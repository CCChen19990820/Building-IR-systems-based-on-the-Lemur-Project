The Net revolution is real, accelerating, and reaching more people
every day.  
What we have are the earliest stages of a brand new,
digital world evolving before our eyes.
Netsurfer Focus is our chronicle of some of the key players on the stage.
Our goal is to make substantive issues about the Net and its continued
development accessible to our users.
<p>
Each issue of Focus addresses a single topic.
It is sent out via e-mail and placed here at
our World Wide Web site. It is often also supplemented by articles and 
additional information at our site. 
This tiered approach gives the big picture for the general reader, 
and detailed resources for the expert.
<p>
Come join us in one of the best adventure of our times.

<font size=+1><b>Future Issues</b></font>
<p>
<blockquote>

Here are a few more possible topics
for issues of Focus in the coming months.
We welcome pointers
to interesting and relevant online resources in these areas. Please
send mail to the editor at <A href=>focus@netsurf.com</A>.
<P>
<B>Diversity</B><br>
<p>
Despite our sometimes parochial US point of view, we know
that the Internet is a truly international community. The diversity
and richness of resources is mirrored in the participants on the
net. We will be exploring the Internet in its manifestations of
race, gender, age, religion, ideology, sexual preference, wealth,
and many of the other differences that make us all unique.
<P>
<B>Health</B><p>
Two of the key strengths of the Internet are the ready dissemination
of information and the sense of community and support that develop
in various newsgroups, chatrooms, and mailing lists. The characteristics
of information and support are also most critical when we face
ill health and when we try to improve or maintain good health.
What resources does the Internet have to offer?

promise. Please let us know what you think by writing to

An advertisement is e-mailed directly to our subscriber list.

permission to do this). The HTML file can have any number of hyperlinks,
including links to graphics. In addition, the ad is placed on our Web
site and a link is provided from Netsurfer Digest issues to the ad.
Guaranteed a minimum of 73,000+ high quality impressions per mailing.

Creation of a special resource publication/page</B> - 
If you are targeting a specific market segment with a well
defined interest profile, we can tailor assemble a publication which
will interest them. We specialize in assembling online resources into 
concise and coherent coverage of a topic. Your company will be the sole
sponsor, the publication will be e-mailed out to our subscribers and
advertised widely on various web indexes (e.g. Yahoo, Lycos), as well as
being permanently placed on our web site. It can also be used in print
advertising.

You can always find out the next publication date by calling us and
asking.
<P>
Advertising copy is due 3 days before publication date.

<P>
Cancellations should be made 1 week prior to publication date.


<P>
<H3><A NAME="SG">Submission Guidelines</A></H3>

<P>
Copy should be plain text or HTML in an e-mail message.

<P>
Graphics should be GIF89a (preferred) or JPEG, e-mailed or sent by FTP.  We
can also grab graphics from your web site. Try to keep graphics at less
then 10K file size. We recommend 60x500 pixels for your banners but you
can use any reasonable geometry you like. File size is more important.

<P>
We can support Java and Javascript applets embedded in your ads, but you
should not assume that our readers will be connected to the Internet
when browsing their issue of the Digest.

<P>
Avoid sending us stuff in word processing formats (e.g. no Microsoft
Word documents) or oddball encoding (e.g. don't use BinHex, or ZIP)
Stick with the universal cross-platform standards and use plain text
or UUENCODE.


<P>
<H3><A NAME="CH">Counting Impressions and Hits</A></H3>

<P>
Placement of advertising within Netsurfer Digest and Marketplace
generates a guaranteed minimum number of impressions based on the
current size of our mailing list. Beyond this minimum there is a large,
though imprecisely measured, number of readers who receive our
publications and mailings through other redistribution web sites,
mailing list exploders, and Bulletin Board Systems throughout the world.

<P>
Note that measuring hits from Netsurfer Digest is <B>NOT</B> like
measuring hits from your average ordinary web site because the Digest is
really a mailing list. However, measurement is quite easy. The hits come
directly from a users browser to your site, without going through our
web server. We can work with your technical representatives to set up
special links from your ads to your web site. These links can be used to
count only the hits made on your web pages from Netsurfer ads. You can
collect your own hit counts using your own favorite tools on your own
schedule with no need to have us get involved.

<P>
Also note that since we don't charge extra for changing your ads, you can
adjust your ad copy/graphics in order to improve the response over the course
of an ad campaign.

<P>
We can also arrange for what are known as "split ads" where some set of
our readers receives one version of the ad, and another set receives
another version. The response rates can then be compared and the ad
campaign adjusted accordingly.

<P>
<H3><A NAME="LG">Legal Fine Print</A></H3>

<P>
No conditions, printed or otherwise, appearing on insertion orders,
contracts, insertion instructions, or any other form of correspondence
that conflict with the policies in this rate card will be binding on 
the publisher.

<P>
By placing advertising with Netsurfer all advertisers agree to
abide by the legal disclaimers and conditions noted in our Fine

The Net revolution is real, accelerating, and reaching more people
every day.  
What we have are the earliest stages of a brand new,
digital world evolving before our eyes.
Netsurfer Focus is our chronicle of some of the key players on the stage.
Our goal is to make substantive issues about the Net and its continued
development accessible to our users.
<p>
Each issue of Focus addresses a single topic.
It is sent out via e-mail and placed here at
our World Wide Web site. It is often also supplemented by articles and 
additional information at our site. 
This tiered approach gives the big picture for the general reader, 
and detailed resources for the expert.
<p>
Come join us in one of the best adventure of our times.

Here are a few more possible topics
for issues of Focus in the coming months.
We welcome pointers
to interesting and relevant online resources in these areas. Please
send mail to the editor at <A href=>focus@netsurf.com</A>.
<P>
<B>Diversity</B><br>
<p>
Despite our sometimes parochial US point of view, we know
that the Internet is a truly international community. The diversity
and richness of resources is mirrored in the participants on the
net. We will be exploring the Internet in its manifestations of
race, gender, age, religion, ideology, sexual preference, wealth,
and many of the other differences that make us all unique.
<P>
<B>Health</B><p>
Two of the key strengths of the Internet are the ready dissemination
of information and the sense of community and support that develop
in various newsgroups, chatrooms, and mailing lists. The characteristics
of information and support are also most critical when we face
ill health and when we try to improve or maintain good health.
What resources does the Internet have to offer?

<B>2. Netsurfer Marketplace Direct Mailing</B> - 
An advertisement is e-mailed directly to our subscriber list.
The advertisement typically consists of an HTML file which is
placed directly into our subscribers mailboxes (they have given us
permission to do this). The HTML file can have any number of hyperlinks,
including links to graphics. In addition, the ad is placed on our Web
site and a link is provided from Netsurfer Digest issues to the ad.
Guaranteed a minimum of 73,000+ high quality impressions per mailing.

<P>
<I>Example 1:</I>
A single company mailing:
<A HREF="http://www.netsurf.com/nsm/v02/nsm.02.01.html">
http://www.netsurf.com/nsm/v02/nsm.02.01.html</A><BR>

(since most of our readers get their issues via e-mail).

<B>4. <A HREF="http://www.netsurf.com/nsf/">Netsurfer Focus</A>: 
Creation of a special resource publication/page</B> - 
If you are targeting a specific market segment with a well
defined interest profile, we can tailor assemble a publication which
will interest them. We specialize in assembling online resources into 
concise and coherent coverage of a topic. Your company will be the sole
sponsor, the publication will be e-mailed out to our subscribers and
advertised widely on various web indexes (e.g. Yahoo, Lycos), as well as
being permanently placed on our web site. It can also be used in print
advertising.

<H3><A NAME="PA">Placing Your Ad</A></H3>

<P>
<B>CALL</B> or <B>E-MAIL</B> us and reserve your space. This is <B>VERY</B> 
important. Communication makes everything else go smoothly:

<P>

<P>
<H3><A NAME="PT">Payment Terms</A></H3>

<P>
Payment in full must be received before an ad is run.


<P>
<H3><A NAME="CD">Closing Dates</A></H3>
 
<P>
The Digest is published roughly every 7 to 10 days (we're constrained by
how long it takes to mail out any given issue).
You can always find out the next publication date by calling us and
asking.
<P>
Advertising copy is due 3 days before publication date.

<P>
Cancellations should be made 1 week prior to publication date.


<P>
<H3><A NAME="SG">Submission Guidelines</A></H3>

<P>
Copy should be plain text or HTML in an e-mail message.

<P>
Graphics should be GIF89a (preferred) or JPEG, e-mailed or sent by FTP.  We
can also grab graphics from your web site. Try to keep graphics at less
then 10K file size. We recommend 60x500 pixels for your banners but you
can use any reasonable geometry you like. File size is more important.

<P>
We can support Java and Javascript applets embedded in your ads, but you
should not assume that our readers will be connected to the Internet
when browsing their issue of the Digest.

<P>
Avoid sending us stuff in word processing formats (e.g. no Microsoft
Word documents) or oddball encoding (e.g. don't use BinHex, or ZIP)
Stick with the universal cross-platform standards and use plain text
or UUENCODE.


<P>
<H3><A NAME="CH">Counting Impressions and Hits</A></H3>

<P>
Placement of advertising within Netsurfer Digest and Marketplace
generates a guaranteed minimum number of impressions based on the
current size of our mailing list. Beyond this minimum there is a large,
though imprecisely measured, number of readers who receive our
publications and mailings through other redistribution web sites,
mailing list exploders, and Bulletin Board Systems throughout the world.

<P>
Note that measuring hits from Netsurfer Digest is <B>NOT</B> like
measuring hits from your average ordinary web site because the Digest is
really a mailing list. However, measurement is quite easy. The hits come
directly from a users browser to your site, without going through our
web server. We can work with your technical representatives to set up
special links from your ads to your web site. These links can be used to
count only the hits made on your web pages from Netsurfer ads. You can
collect your own hit counts using your own favorite tools on your own
schedule with no need to have us get involved.

<P>
Also note that since we don't charge extra for changing your ads, you can
adjust your ad copy/graphics in order to improve the response over the course
of an ad campaign.

<P>
We can also arrange for what are known as "split ads" where some set of
our readers receives one version of the ad, and another set receives
another version. The response rates can then be compared and the ad
campaign adjusted accordingly.

<P>
<H3><A NAME="LG">Legal Fine Print</A></H3>

<P>
No conditions, printed or otherwise, appearing on insertion orders,
contracts, insertion instructions, or any other form of correspondence
that conflict with the policies in this rate card will be binding on 
the publisher.

<P>
By placing advertising with Netsurfer all advertisers agree to
abide by the legal disclaimers and conditions noted in our Fine
Print: <A HREF="http://www.netsurf.com/nsm/legal.html">

<H1>Netsurfer Communications, Inc. Background</H1>
<P>
<A HREF="http://www.netsurf.com">Netsurfer Communications, Inc.</A> 
begun in the spring of 1994 as the
realization of a concept slowly taking shape over the course of several
years. Arthur Bebak, the founder and now president, observed with
interest the slow maturation of the online industry, until in 1994 
the availability of critical user mass, tools, and technology
produced a unique opportunity for the creation of a cyberspace based
business.
<P>
It became clear that the communication revolution had produced
a fertile playing field for the evolution of new business models based
on dispersed work centers and the ease of information distribution. At
the same time the problems and paradigm shifts of that revolution
produced opportunities for the creation of profitable businesses,
positioned at the very beginning of a new industry growth curve.
<P>
Netsurfer Communications was formed to take advantage of that fertile
climate and to help define the future of the connected world. Its
philosophy of <I>"High Signal/Low Noise"</I> reflects the desire to contribute
substance rather then fluff to the online community.
<P>
Since its inception Netsurfer Communication has launched 
<A HREF="http://www.netsurf.com/nsd/index.html">Netsurfer Digest</A>, 
a useful and entertaining E-Zine compendium of news, views, and
reviews of online resources. The success and rapid growth of the Digest
has led to the development of other products and services designed to
make ethical and effective use of cyberspace.
<P>
<H2>Products & Services</H2>
<P>
Netsurfer Communications is engaged in the development of various 
innovative and useful products centered around niche markets and online
spaces.
<P>
<A HREF="http://www.netsurf.com/nsd/index.html">Netsurfer Digest</A>
is the flagship publication of Netsurfer
Communications. Every week the Digest brings its readers an
entertaining and informative slice of the rapidly expanding online
world. Delivered via E-mail and available in a hyperlinked, easy to use
HTML version, the Digest bypasses the inevitable online traffic jams and
connects its readers directly to the vast variety of cyberspace.
<P>
Available for free to the online community, the Digest is supported by
sponsors and advertisers who appreciate the direct connection to its
readers and find it more effective then a purely passive online
presence. At the same time our readers appreciate advertisers who avoid
intrusive and inappropriate pollution of online content with hype, and
who present their informative and entertaining messages in appropriate
venues.
<P>
Other products in development include specialty E-Zines targeted at
<B>books</B>, <B>online travel</B>, and other niche markets. Local San Francisco Bay
Area consumer projects are also under development.
<P>
Netsurfer Communications also provides business services designed to
help companies make effective use of an online presence. We help
businesses go online, provide training in online product support, and
consult on effectively communicating with the online community. In
addition we assist in the development of online products and content.
<P>
<H2>People</H2>
<P>
Based in Sunnyvale, at the very heart of entrepreneurial Silicon Valley,
Netsurfer Communications brings together a team of talented, and above
all experienced, professionals.
<P>
<B>Arthur Bebak</B> founded Netsurfer Communications after a successful career
at Amdahl Inc. as a computer designer, software engineer, manager, and
consultant. His many years of technical and managerial experience,
coupled with his extensive knowledge of online culture and industry
gives him the knowledge and intestinal fortitude both to lead Netsurfer
into the bright future and to deal with its explosive growth.
<P>

Berkeley, California. He's the one who maintains the hosts that bring

Connections, and occasionally for MacWorld and MacWEEK. He sits on the
board of the Apple Network Managers Association, and sits on standards
bodies of the AppleTalk Networking Forum.
<P>
<B>Gary Berlind</B>, formerly with Oracle corporation, brings thirty full years
of experience with computers, software, and marketing to the marketing
team at Netsurf Communications. Currently he is the publisher of the
Morrissey Standard Computer Media Directory, and author of PR/Works -

<P>
<B>Sun Ming Lieu</B> does editing and consults on operational matters for
Netsurfer Communications, Inc. Ms. Lieu has been starting and building
organizations involved in leading edge technologies since 1986. She has

<I>Surfin' San Jose</I> 
<p>
Spring Internet World - the gabfest of Netters: time to leave the 
mellow glow of our monitors and the comforts of cyberspace to 
pound the steamy asphalt of San Jose, Calif., in a record heat wave.
A world with its own logic 
where asphalt met astroturf disguised as asphalt, 
where computer industry leaders and supposed visionaries pranced across
the keynote stage hawking applications programs,
and where 400 or so exhibitors, 
40,000 plus attendees, and miles of wires
overflowed the local Convention Center and oozed into the Civic Auditorium, 
the Tech Museum of Innovation, and a billowing tent/sauna on the sidewalk, 
<p align=center>
<font size=+2><b>OVERLOAD!</b></font>
<p align=left>
Being intrepid net pioneers, however, the Netsurfer gang
ploughed our way through an infinity of booths, demos, literature and
press food
so that you, dear reader, can just sit back and enjoy the highlights.
<! Here is our selection of the key trends. 
You will find more details at our
"A Field Guide to InternetWorld Exhibitors" web page, coming soon.>

<HR>
<I>Sound bites for the cocktail circuit</I> 
<p>
Just have a minute?  
Acquire some choice bon mots to drop at the next party before consigning
this issue to the bit bucket.  These ten are guaranteed a swarm of interest:
<p>
Internet telephony ... web mapping ... 
NC (or network computer if you please) ...
virtual private network ... business objects ... traffic analysis ...
digital IDs ... immersive hypermedia ...
collaborative computing ... SET compliant commerceware
<p>
And then there are the meaningless hypewords that came even thicker 
and faster at the show.  You can pave many a yellow brick road without getting
anywhere with these.  The top ten for your fuzz filter for any show.
<p>
...premier ... complete solution ... innovative ... award-winning ...
next level ... set the standard ... easy to use ... unique
powerful ... revolutionary ...

Microsoft is morphing the browser into the the Windows environment.  
Between them, the digitized world is available on your desktop.
Scuttling around the feet of the clashing titans this year are 
some useful little productivity pearls that makes net exploration
easier.  But check them out now - they could be gobbled up by the giants
by showtime next year.

<HR>
<I>Help for the hardworking spiders</I>
<p>

The stakes keep getting higher in the web content game.
Twelve months ago we were experimenting with text pages
with a few GIFs and imagemaps thrown in.  How many 
used server push?  Now we have
all manner of animation and multimedia flashing, tumbling,
and transforming their way across our screen.
You don't make it if nothing on your page moves.
<font size=-2>(Guess we don't make it, guys... -Ed. ) </font>
What-you-see-is-what-you-get and drag-and-drop insertion
of multimedia elements are de rigueur for authoring
software.  Of course there are tools to create 
VRML, animations, and all, and 'nuff's been said about Java.
Here's some of the latest cool stuff from the show.

<dl>
<dt>The Heavyweights Take On WSYSIWYG Page Creation
<p>
<dd> PageMill from Adobe <p> Besides chewing through
the usual tags and multimedia support, Mac-only PageMill 
converts standard PC file formats, and 
includes a special "geektionary" of techie terms for its
spellchecker.
Cookies and Apple support make tasty desserts.
Step up to SiteMill and your link managements troubles are
taken care of as well.
Windows users will have to wait till late summer for both.
<br>
<a href="http://www.adobe.com/prodindex/pagemill/main.html">
http://www.adobe.com/prodindex/pagemill/main.html</a>
<p>
<dd>Backstage Designer/Studio from Macromedia <p> Point and click forms construction, 
a library of templates and customizable Java and Shockwave aplets and
the xRes SE imaging editor add sizzle to Macromedia's WYSIWYG package.
For the site designer, the Backstage Studio products will provide
site management and built-in objects that provide connectivity 
to desktop databases, forms,
threaded discussion groups, automated email, and other features.

<dt>Multimedia Content Creation
<p>
<dd>CelAnimator <p> So far, bit-mapped graphics have ruled the web.
Yet streaming, vector-based
images and animations can be small and fast to compete.  
CelAnimator from Future Wave
creates graphics scaleable
to any size and color depth without blowing up the file size. 
It can also
incorporate interactive buttons linked to a URL.  A plug-in
viewer is required, though.

<p>
<dd>AnimationNet <p> 
The only 3D animation package that dares claim to run on a 
486 PC with 8 mb of RAM!  Neo Visuals has geared their
products for ease of use.  A kids' version of the animator is
available, presumably for the under-8 set, since by that age most
kids are more computer-savvy than dear old dad.  Their ADL file format is
small enough to send through e-mail, but again, an ADL player is also required.

<dl>
<dt>VRML
<dd>Cosmo <p> Ever feel that you just didn't "get it" about VRML worlds?  
Well it's time to take another look now that version 2 (aka Moving Worlds) is
real real.  Build scalable, dynamic worlds with interactive objects, 3D sound,
embedded audio and video clips for a rich, immersive environment.  SGI's Cosmo
suite can do it all with its VRML browser, authoring tools, 
java development environment, and
media management system.  Cosmo Player, the browser, made the heat
in the show tent bearable, and the good news is that it will even do
Windows.

<dd>Just the Basics <p> If you don't have that Unix workstation
and just want something that is easy to use, Virtual Home Space Builder
from Paragraph or Virtus 3D Website Builder might just do the trick.

check out Dimension X's Liquid Reality toolkit.  It helps
you create and view Java-enhanced VRML worlds that support
sound, motion, and interaction.  And if you want some help
creating Java animations without being a real programmer, their Liquid

<I>Every which way you can</I>
<p>
The Internet has won its place in the telecommunications mainstream.
Web-browsing and e-mail, the sung and unsung Internet killer-apps, have been joined
on the wire (and wireless) by applications from the other communications media.
Internet telephony is getting a lot of attention this year, but radio and television
are following close behind.  After all, once you have the connectivity
and the bandwidth, almost anything is fair game.

<H3><A NAME="s05">MEET CHAT PLAY WORK</A></H3>
<HR>
<I>Leading the way in social computing</I>
<p>
The IRC standard is showing its age and here comes the next 
generation.
3D worlds are the cool new places to meet.  WorldChat led the way
with 3D chat and customizable avatars.
Their latest creation, the spiffy new 
Alphaworld, allows you to homestead the cyberfrontier: chat, build
houses, and even engage in commerce.
OZ bridges work and play with
a VRML browser/server combination that lets you set up your own virtual
world.  Use it for virtual conferencing with text, audio, and video,
voting, file sharing, and other group activities.  Their virtual worlds
are filled with lush graphics and 3D sound and animation.  To
cap it all off, OZ
provides a 3D helper angel that talks to you by text-to-speech conversion.
<p>
America Online sticks to 2D in Virtual Places with avatars
equipped with gestures.  (Goodbye, smileys?)  Keeping it flat has its rewards - a
phone line works well and
you can easily throw a party at your own URL.  But hurry, the 
spring social calendar is filling up fast.
Other participants in the chat game include ichat, and ChatPlus, both
help you set up your own chat servers on the Web.

<HR>
<I>Meet me in the Cyber-Casbah</I>
<p>
Move aside, innovators.
You know the playground of the geeks is changing when big iron
like IBM S/390 mainframes becomes web servers.  From Federal Express
to buying tickets for the Olympics on the web,
Net Biz is now serious Big Biz.
<p>
After a few dalliances and reconciliations, Mastercard and Visa finally got together
and proposed a unified protocol to secure online credit card transactions in
February.  Though Netscape's SSL enabled the early transactions on the net, 
the Secure Electronic Transaction (SET) protocol
put the stamp of respectability on online commerce, and software vendors are
rushing to support it by the end of the summer.
<p>
On another front, 
information, long freely exchanged on the Net, can now be doled out at a price.
Cryptolopes sound like shy ungulates on the digital savannah, but they are
really digital envelopes that bill you when you open them.  
And the tick-ticking you hear is not the return of the Unibomber, it's
simply the meter running inside the new digital content. 
News, books, multimedia, or software, they are all ready
to meter your usage, ane send you a bill.
If you prefer the advertising-funded model used in radio and television 
for collecting your silver,
there are organizations to help you from ad creation, media placement, and
to site visitor traffic analysis and audit.
<p>
Consumers: come on down!

<H3><A NAME="s07">MERRY MUDDLE</A></H3>
<HR>
<I>It's the Intranet, stupid!</I>
<p>
You've seen it on the front cover of major business and computer
magazines.  
A simple, consistent interface to all of an organization's 
data and applications.   
The Intranet is the hottest trend to hit MIS, and may even
bail out a few failed client-server projects. 
The goldrush is on and the shovel- and pick- 
sellers are out in droves.  Enabling software for the corporate
environment blurs in a muddle of buzzwords and
hyperbolic press-release speak.  Now what does package XYZ
do again and how is it different from FGH and PQR?  
Here are a few that actually made it through the haze.

<I>and now, Speeding-Bullet Fast, Bullet-Proof Pipes!</I>
<p>
The connectivity providers were out in force.  There were hardware vendors for
modems wired and wireless, routers and switches, and even uninterruptible power 
supplies.  ISDN seems to have shed its "I Still Don't kNow" rags
to become a choice option for super-surfers ready to ditch 28.8 kbps for the 
satisfaction of 112 kbps from two bonded B channels (sounds racy!).
<p>
And as if fast isn't enough, the roads are also getting safer on the digital 
frontier through new products combining authentication and content encryption. 
Be the center of your own (virtual) private network using the Internet
and any old Internet service provider.  Or double-wrap your inter-office
communications in kevlar and send'em out.

Can't make the Internet World schedule?  Or
is there an advantage to making your announcements 
away from the maddening crowd?
What did Adobe have in mind when they laid out their strategy for
bringing more visual communication to the web (by driving Internet standards
based on Adobe technologies) the week after Internet World?
Armed with an alliance with Javasoft for Adobe's
new 2D image model, Microsoft for Universal Font Format, and AT&T (probably
for AT&T's bandwidth), the plan is to slam and jam all those Adobe
desktop publishing products into Net authoring.  Slow is beautiful.

And speaking of the NC, Lucent Technologies, Ma Bell's newest orphan,
announced in that same post-show week that they will be marketing
Inferno, their network operating system for anything from high-end 
workstations to consumer electronics.  Positioned as the "glue to hold

big players have been gunning for a while.  
And unlike their previous success such as
Unix, C, and C++, this one won't be free.

Well, we can't be absolutely sure there were 400 booths.
In fact, a couple of the sites we've
named here might not even have exhibited in the show.  But they were kind
enough to provide some interesting press kits or briefings for us 
weary show-surfers, and so we
included them anyway.  For the authoritative listing of exhibitors,

<blockquote>
What a difference a year makes, and certainly a year on the Internet.  
It's been said that an Internet-year is like a dog-year, having within it the 
development of seven normal human years.
When we published our first issue on
computer and network security, the Internet was an interesting frontier
and those splashy IPOs of Internet companies had not yet begun.
Now here midway through 1996, it has become a ubiquitous communication
channel.  In the US, for 
example, a URL is as essential for many businesses as a toll-free 800 
phone number.
In the last twelve months,
the first wave of businesses, entrepreneurs, professionals, and consumers has 
adopted the networked desktop computer as an information
appliance.
<p>
Computer and network security used to be problems for large or specialized
organizations and the provenance of technical professionals
steeped in lore and arcana.
Now there are many network users who do not have the advantage of these
resources and must practise safe networking and know how to 
protect themselves.
<!p>
Likewise, our first issue of Netsurfer Focus
on computer and network security largely addressed the
concerns of system administrators.  In this issue, we will continue
to bring you new developments in these areas.  In addition, we
will touch upon problems of concern to small business and home users alike.
For new readers who are interested in the topic, we highly recommend
you also visit the revised edition of our first annual issue on
Computer and Network Security.

<blockquote>
You are connected to a network.  Every click of your mouse can take you to
into the unknown.  Do you know where you are going?  Do you know what
will happen there?
<p>
The original application of the World Wide Web was perfectly
safe.  You download text and graphics, the browser interprets and displays them, and
you can always view the source code the browser interpreted.
There is no hiding behind secret files or obscure binary code that only
a trained programmer or a computer can read.
Although you may not know much about the web site you are visiting and
whether you can trust it or not, the content you get does not do anything
to your computer system.
<p>
But along came the downloadable plug-ins, Java applets, Javascripts scripts,
and ActiveX controls.
Each is a piece of software that runs on your system and has varying
capabilities to modify the local software and hardware.
Clicking on a hotlink to a file of a special mime-type can cause a plug-in to
run, but at least you have to have the plug-in and to click on the link.
Java and Javascript are more insidious because support
comes with popular browsers, and applets and scripts
run immediately when the page has been downloaded.  Although the language
designers have taken pains to make Java and Javascript safe,
problems are still being identified.
ActiveX controls, on the other hand, have much greater access to your
PC system, and being newer to the Net, has had less time for its potential
flaws to be discovered.
<p>
The trick is to not let any unknown code, no matter where it is from,
run on your computer without strong precautions.
If you have not disabled these features in your browser, every time you 
click on the URL of a web page, you are potentially allowing code
that you might not even know is on the page run on your computer.
Unlike a BBS download or even an e-mail attachment, there is no
separate and conscious step to run an executable.  The first click of your
mouse is the crucial one.
<p>
When the Web first started, those who had heard about viruses were
wary, and we were able to reassure them that it was perfectly safe
to point and click.  Now that we have trained the world
to think that it is safe to point and click and surf the Net, we need
to bring the precautions back.

<blockquote>
Judging by the industry response, Java is proving to be a potent brew.
Its strength comes from being a programming language that does most of
the "right" things by modern programming standards; or as Sun Microsystems
itself describes it, Java is fully buzzword-compliant.
The security challenge comes when we rely on it to run, sight unseen, 
applets from the four corners of the earth.
<p>
To keep applets from running amok in the system, a browser that
supports Java constrains them to  a "sandbox".
By definition, this sandbox includes only access to the screen and computing 
power of the client computer, and connection to the host computer from 
which the applet came.  It usually cannot get to your local file system,
and it cannot get to other computers on the network.
<p>
But as we gain experience with Java, we are finding sins of both commission and
omission. A number of design and implementation bugs have 
been reported and quickly fixed.  Among other things, these allowed attacks 
on computers behind firewalls, and also attacks that seem to come from an unwary
and innocuous third party.  
More bugs will doubtlessly be discovered and remedied 
with new releases and continued scrutiny.  
Other problems that come up are part of the nature of the beast.
For example, while applets may stay in the sandbox, they
can raise quite a ruckus and do each other harm in the process.
These "hostile applets" are able to 
lock up your screen, crash the browser, sabotage or kill other applets, try and
steal your password by putting up a login screen and asking you to enter
your password,
or simply siphon off system resources to work on computational problems
and report the results to the originating server.
There are currently no way to control these types of applets except
to restart the browser or the computer.
<p>
The Internet is not always a safe place, but there is no point
in throwing out the Java with the grounds.
Turn off Java support in your browser while visiting
sites you do not trust, and use up-to-date versions of browsers and
Java development kits to get the latest fixes.
With the prevalence of applet-sharing on the Net, the possibility of popular
applets (such as the ticker tape) being turned into Trojan horses
is also very real.  So it is equally important not to use or post any applets 
to your web site unless you know exactly what it does.

Javascript, not to be confused with Java, is a scripting language supported
by the Netscape browsers to improve the interactivity of HTML pages.
While Java applets can get at each other, Javascript code has access to
your computer and what you do within the browser.  Instead of stealing
resources a la applets, the bugs that have been found tend to violate the privacy of
your system.
Malicious Javascript code can track the history of your websurfing,
read your files and file directory listings, and send all the
information back to the server from which it originated.
Most of these problems have been fixed as of this writing but continued
scrutiny may reveal new ones.  So the same precautions that are used for Java
applies to Javascript also.

Programs such as Microsoft Word have a macro language that can modify
program behaviour and enable greater functionality.  If macros are
carried along in the same file as the data, then the program is
susceptible to macro viruses.  Whether you are downloading the file
through FTP or the Web, the data file is not as innocuous at it seems.
And actually, you don't even have to go to the trouble of downloading 
the file containing a
macro gone bad.  E-mail will take care of it for you just fine.  
Safely ensconced
in the protective sheath of a MIME attachment, the lethal payload is 
carried through the firewall and only released
when you open the file.  
Likewise, someone can also send you an infected program as an e-mail
attachment.
The old sneakernet viruses have turned into netsurfing jetsetters, and their
geographic spread has escalated through use of the Internet.
<p>
In each case, the culprit comes through intervening firewalls unscathed.
But of course nothing stands still in the spy-versus-spy world of
computer security.  In the last few months, a number of firewall-based
virus-scanners have been announced.  These will usually check e-mail 
attachments and Web and FTP downloads into your organization for potential
invaders.

<blockquote>
As computers reach across the ether and interconnect to one another,
regardless of whether they are browser clients or servers, 
they take on a certain amount of risk.  In addition to the basic dangers
of being a computer on the Net and being hacked, the World Wide Web
brings them new and wonderful hazards.  
<p>
Java and Javascript abuse at malicious web sites 
and virus-infected content can cause problems.  But they are not the
sole villains in the drama.  As part of the http protocol,
the browser gives out a great deal of information about you to the
server.  The "cookie" mechanism can be used to closely track and
record your activities on any given site - just like going into a store
and having every movement you make recorded filmed for use and analysis.
<p>
But the web server is not always the evil spider inviting the fly to step into
its parlor.  Sometimes the fly comes in armed with a chainsaw, and not always
by the front door.  The web server equally faces all the hazards of connection,
without many of the protections of the underlying operating system.  
For example, you may restrict access to members
only, and use the web server's user ID and password mechanism.  First of all, 
an attacker can make repeated attempts to guess the password - the server does not
shut him down after the third try as do many operating systems.  In addition,
the password is not strongly encrypted as it traverses the Net, but
traverse the Net it does.  To increase the odds of capture and discovery,
user name and password are sent not once but each time any protected
document is accessed.
<p>
CGI scripts, those solid workhorses of interactive web pages, are programs running
on your server computer, and therefore potentially large security holes.  How, you might
ask; well myriad are the ways.  Suffice it be said that the first law is never
to trust user input.  An innocent but unexpectedly large input that overwrites
part of system memory has been the downfall
of many a program.  And given the fact that these scripts frequently work
with system commands (such as 'remove all files'), they are attractive targets
that can cause disproportionate damage. 
<p>
And last but not least, the friendly, helpful robots that scuttle across the Web
indexing all pages in their path do not discriminate against files you did
not plan for the world to see.  Carelessly managed sites have had their password
and system configuration files scooped into massive Web index databases, waving
the red flag of a vulnerable site under the nose of potential hackers.
Exposure of other files is a lesser risk, but do you really want to share all
your organization's secrets with all of cyberspace?

<blockquote>
In addition to the web page traps and viruses that snare unwary netsurfers,
the Net ecosystem is also home to a growing host of robots, agents, 
spiders, worms, ants, and other creatures.  Speaking the language of HTTP
and other network protocols, these are basically small programs that traverse the
Net for a variety of purposes.  The best known are the spiders that
index Net resources for public and private use.
Alta Vista, Infoseek, and Lycos are a few that come to mind.  Others
help webmasters manage their sites, checking for and pruning away 
defunct hotlinks.  Newer programs can help you harvest Net resources,
look for updated
pages, download entire sites while you sleep, or even shop for bargains.
In the brave new world, intelligent agents will not just bring you information,
but become active in
coordinating schedules, executing transactions, and performing other tasks
at your behest.
<p>
These programs or robots can have intended and unintended effects
on the network and web sites they traverse.  Overeager spiders have overwhelmed
web sites by requesting too many documents too rapidly.  
As described elsewhere, they can also ferret out information that a careless
system administrator leaves accessible on his disk.
Efforts are under way to create formal Internet standards of behaviour for 
web robots.  The current version, the Robot Exclusion Standard, allows
site administrators to place a 'robot.txt' file on their web indicating where
robots should not go.  For example, a large archive of bitmap images
would be useless to a robot that is trying to index HTML pages.  
Serving these files to the robot is a needless use of net resources;
however, they need to remain accessible to a human with a browser or FTP.
The standard is a voluntary one for the moment, and an etiquette
is evolving for robot developers as experience is gained with their deployment.

Things are not always what they seem.
The case of cyanide-laced Tylenol tablets, Snow White eating the beautiful
apple from the Evil Queen,
and Archimedes's encounter with gold that had been adulterated with base metals.  
How do you trust what you get? It's no different in cyberspace.
The applet that screams "download me" at your favourite game site.
The robot knocking at the door to your web server.
It's just often harder to verify the reliability of 1's and 0's.
<p>
We have few qualms about installing shrink-wrapped software
packages because we get it from a retailer we know, or because
it carries a brand name we trust.  These days we extend trust to
Net sites that we visit.  The momentum behind using digital signatures 
to show that a message or a piece of software actually came from the
person or organization that we trust is growing.  The Java API including
signed applets will be available in Q3 of 96, and Microsoft is spearheading
a code signing proposal.  So in the not-too-distant future,
we should be able to enforce greater security and functionality by
verifying content, robots, applets, and transactions through the signature
on the digital ID card.  
ID card providers (certificate authorities) are appearing, and
even the US Postal Services is getting into the act.

<I>Virtual Private Networks</I> 
<p>
<! ---------------------------------------------------------------->

<blockquote>
The Internet is one big party line where packets of information bounce hither-thither
from source to destination, free to spend a night or a lifetime with some random computer
somewhere along the way.  But as a public thoroughfare, it has great cost advantages
compared to private networks from stringing your own wire.
So how do you have the best of both worlds of low cost and privacy?
Although some large scale network providers such as MCI can provide a facsimile of
private lines by routing your traffic entirely over network segments that it manages, the
trend has been to more control over your own destiny 
through virtual private networks (VPNs).
<p>

And the party line on privatizing the party line?  IP level encryption.
Sender to recipient, end-to-end encryption of information being 
transmitted across the Internet means that
stray packets are unintelligible to anyone but the intended recipient.
Encryption at the IP level of the Internet protocol stack also allows easy support
of different application protocols such as HTTP, FTP, and Telnet, on a variety
of underlying network technology such as Ethernet, Frame Relay, or ATM.
<p>
Products that secure the communications between designated sites in 
your private network on the Internet are springing up like mushrooms after a rain.
They can be software-only, such as Digital Equipment's Internet Tunnel, or
hardware-based, as NetFortress from Digital Secure Networks Technology.  The
SunScreen solution from Sun Microsystems provides firewall and cryptographic key 
clearinghouse services as well as the basic site-to-site encryption.
These solutions work well for organizations that must secure communications
between different facilities.
The Security Middleware products from Virtual Online Network Environments
use smartcard authentication to verify individual users rather than
host computers.  This product, if deployed by Internet Service Providers, would allow
even small Mom-and-Pop outfits to have affordable private networks.  
And on the large 
enterprise side of the story, an industry coalition is forming to enable
secure wide area networks (S/WAN) through encryption and key management standards.

<I>Where's the beef?</I> 
<p>
<! ---------------------------------------------------------------->

<blockquote>
Glorious sunrise on the range.  The entrance to the E-COM corral, Marlboro
Man look-alikes hoist the corral's new brand over the gates.
Bold, wrought iron letters, SET.  The crowds cheer and applaud.
Suddenly, a lone cowboy in black with a gold belt buckle
rides up with six shooters blazing.  The natives
shoot back and give chase.  Exit, stage left.  The scene continues
undisturbed.
<p>
By late 1995, Netscape's SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) had won the standards race for 
secured transmission of content (read credit card numbers)
across the Net.
Commerce on the Internet received a crucial boost in early 1996 when leading
credit card associations Visa and Mastercard finally set aside their differences
and competing standards (STT and SEPP) in favour of a common specification,
SET (Secure Electronic Transaction).  This specification enables the other aspects
of a credit card transaction, e.g., authorization of the charges,
to occur online, not just the transmission of card number information.
<p>
Then First Virtual Holdings announced the identification of a major flaw
in the use of software-based encryption of credit card numbers: keystroke
capture at the client desktop.  Their point is that
if someone has managed to gain control of
your computer to monitor your keystrokes, he can capture your credit card
number and no amount of encryption for transmission will help protect you.
With the interconnectivity of the net and the ease of downloading
a hostile applet, the vulnerability of the desktop computer cannot be
overemphasized, particularly for those new to computer and network
security issues.
However the hyperbolic press releases on a topic well known to security experts, 
combined with the fact that First Virtual
offers electronic commerce through a mechanism without the use of
encryption has led to a flurry of responses ranging from supportive to
outraged.
<p>
As of this writing, the tempest has subsided to the bottom of the virtual teacup
and electronic commerce marches on.

<blockquote>
Large scale search sites are invaluable to many netizens.
For example, with the growth of the Net in the past year,
publishing Netsurfer Focus would be too painful
to contemplate without access to sites such as Alta Vista*.
The corollary is that with these high powered spiders,
every utterance on the Net, be it on a web page or a newsgroup,
may be a matter of public record that above all else
<b>can be readily found</b>.
<p>
The story of your online life,
whether you are a frequent poster to 'alt.sex.binaries' or
'sci.crypt' (hello, potential employer!), 
or your personal web page showing three beautiful children,
a dog named Jimmy, and a house far beyond your 20K$ a year salary 
(hello, IRS!) can be there for all who cares to see.
And then there are the large online directories.  Coming
hard on the heels of the info-preneurs that have set up directory
sites, the phone companies are rushing online with their
multi-million listing offerings.
Privacy issues become intertwined with physical security because it
has become so easy to identify and physically locate you,
your beliefs and habits, and your computer.

<blockquote>
As computers move into the home, security takes on new dimensions.
Beyond the hard assets of your computer, and the soft assets of your data,
you need to think about protecting your family and especially children.
Bringing access to the cyberworld to your desktop means exactly that, and we
all know there are parts of the world, real or cyber, that you don't want to
take the kids.  
<p>
A number of companies have sprung up to help you avoid the back alleys and 
redlight districts of the Net.  Software such as SurfWatch or NetNanny
block access to known sites where offensive
material are available, or to any site that you deem inappropriate.
The sites that are blocked vary from package to package.  Some include on their
verboten-list not just pornography but web resources about homosexuality, 
or feminism, or anything that does not promote "family values".  Yet other packages 
can log all the surfing activities, enabling Orwellian possibilities right
in your own home.  In sum, they are tools that do not excuse us
from our responsibilities to decide what is appropriate in our households.
<p>
In addition to the reviewer-based systems, another development that will facilitate 
appropriate surfing is some widespread form of labelling or self-labelling.
Just like the "PG", "R", and "X" movie ratings in the US, labelling provides
a more standardized way to assess the content of a web site.
The PICS (Platform for Internet Content Selection) standard is a technical
specification for how to label Net content.  It is developed by the World Wide Web
consortium and can be used to implement any rating system.  
Currently, there is much industry momentum
behind RSACi, the Recreational Software Advisory
Council Internet rating system.  This is an extension of the rating system for computer
games, and has been endorsed by major online
services.  Most of the leading blocking products do or will support RSACi.

<b>Reach out and hack someone</b><p>
A year ago, an enterprising cryptographer named Hal Finney issued a challenge
to his colleagues to crack the encryption on an SSL (Netscape's
Secure Sockets Layer) transmission.  Appropriately for Internet time, 
not one, but two independent successes turned up within a month.
This was the start of a series of black-hat testing of net software
by cryptography and security aficionados across the Internet community. 
Rooted in the belief that strength of security solutions comes from careful 
scrutiny and not obscurity, expert volunteers continue to probe and pummel
away.  Ongoing efforts include a series of challenges issued by 
Internet service provider Community ConneXion.  The reward?  The archetypical
programmer's notch - a t-shirt.

<b>The Tracker Industry</b>
<p>
Hacker Shimomura turned tracker when cracker Mitnick reputedly broke into
Shimomura's computer around Christmas, 1994.
Since then, the event has turned into a mini-industry of its own with not 
one or two, but three books written about the incident.
A web site was also created to promote "Takedown", Shimomura's book.
This time, however, crackers had the last laugh when they hi-jacked the URL
for the Takedown site by forging a change-of-address e-mail message to address
keepers at the Internet Network Information Center.
We can be assured of future pranks and publicity stunts as the movie
rights are sold and the cameras begin to roll.

<p>
In February, the US State Department announced an
amendment to the International Traffic in Arms Regulation (ITAR) allowing
U.S. persons to temporarily export cryptographic products for personal use
without the need for an export license (aka the 'Matt Blaze exemption').  
However, US cryptographers and
their allies continue their campaign for the availability and export of strong
(>40 bit key) cryptography.  
The software industry is clearly concerned about their inability to compete 
in the international markets with the current export controls.
IBM-Lotus struck a compromise with the government by giving it
exclusive access to 24 bits in the 64 bit key used in Lotus Notes Release 4.
RSA went the other way and located a development center
in Japan.  This allows RSA to provide identical encryption technologies outside of the
US without tripping over ITAR.  
On the heels of the successful challenge to the Communications Decency
Act, an industry coalition to lobby Washington
is also forming.

<I>The Big Picture</I> 
<P>
There is a scene in one of the Star Trek movies where the "Genesis
Probe" is launched onto the surface of a barren planet, and
an entire planetary ecosystem develops before the eyes of the
Enterprise crew. 
The World Wide Web has sprung to life with similar speed in the 
last two years.  As part of this, online commerce is evolving and
diversifying before our very eyes.
This issue of Netsurfer Focus takes a took at the emerging ecosystem
of online commerce, the business of the net, and the businesses on
the net, and where they are in their evolution.
<P>
The foundation of the Internet ecosystem is the network itself,
the wires and switches that connect the computers across the world.
Living on the physical network, one step up the foodchain, are
the access providers, the folks that allow networks and end users to 
connect to and communicate
with each other. Then there are the tool providers, the makers
of client browsers and servers, whose software influence much of what
we do.
The user population itself of the Internet is growing and diversifying
exponentially.
Businesses are now being built on top of the network and tools,
and the wheels of commerce greased by evolving electronic payment
systems. It is a landscape bustling with activity, as we dip our
net to scoop up, for your perusal, representative nuggets of netlife.
<p>
<H2><A NAME="sc2">THE FINGERBONES ARE ... CONNECTED TO THE
BACKBONE</A></H2>
<HR>
<P>
<I>Web of Wire: The Data Pipes </I>
<P>
What does the physical network look like?  Just like the highway
system of interstate highways, main thoroughfares, country roads, and
dirt footpaths, the Internet is a network of data pipes of various
capacities.   It usually begins with
a high bandwidth backbone cable with capacity sometimes 
in excess of 100 megabits/sec.  This is in turn connected to a series of networks 
of decreasing capacity until the end user is reached.
<p>
In the United States, the backbones are fiber optic cables provided by 
long distance phone companies such as MCI and Sprint.
There are four main Network Access Points (NAPs), in
San Francisco, Chicago, New York, and the Washington DC area, 
maintained by regional or long distance telephone companies. 
Also connecting at these NAPs
are services to Europe (Ebone and EuropaNET), Asia and the rest
of the world, the US Government via the Federal Internet Exchange
(FIX), and the experimental gigabit per second vBNS (very high speed Backbone
Network Service) .
The government's NSFNet, once the main road of the Internet,
has been shut down since April.
<P>
The companies providing the network backbone form the lowest level
of a food chain of service providers. As network service providers
(NSPs), they provide network capacity to regional network providers
(RNPs) who in turn service the many Internet Service Providers
(ISPs) or Internet Access Providers (IAPs)
who provide connections for end users directly. RNPs may
also directly service end users. 
CIX, the Commercial Internet Exchange, is a consortium of ISPs and
private networks whose equipment also
taps directly into the network access points.
<P>
Although the fiber backbone can service a variety of networks,
the Internet is based on the TCP/IP protocols.  The Internet Society is
the international organization that oversees the cooperation and
coordination of Internet activities.  It is also responsible for future
directions, including development of the next generation IP
protocols - before the growth of the Internet uses up all the
available addresses under the current scheme.
<p>
The foundations for online commerce are being laid down rapidly.
As of  October 1994, about 3.5 million computers are connected 
to the Internet.
A separate survey of the number of Internet
domain names (which approximate the number of organizations on
the Internet) found a total of over 4.8 million domains by February
1995. By all counts, the Internet is growing at a sustained rate
of at least 100% per year. Although this is expected to slow 
down eventually
(since maintaining it would mean that every person on the planet
would be connected to the Internet in 10 years), the boom years
are still ahead of us.

<I>Data plumbers, the next generation</I> 
<P>
The data pipelines of the Internet are simply telephone lines
of various capacity. The backbone providers are long distance
phone companies. We access the Internet through telephone lines.
So who is better to get into the Internet access business than the
local telephone companies themselves? Why go through the middleman
of an Internet service provider? Pacific Bell, for instance, has
started offering Internet services to consumers, and will provide business
service later in the year. More importantly, it also has active 
programs promoting
the use of ISDN - increasing the capacity of our phone wires
from 14.4k bits/second to 56k and better. For those of us who turn off graphics
in our browsers or go for a cup of coffee when downloading a 40
kbyte gif, the bigger data pipes will come none too soon for the
increasing multimedia network traffic.
<P>
But wait. There are often not one but two wires that enter into
a North American home: the telephone, and cable television. What
about using the coaxial television cable to get onto the Internet?
It happens to have quite a bit more capacity than twisted pair
copper phone wires - all you need is a cable-based modem. A new
entrant into the network provider business is the @home network,
a joint venture between cable leader TCI and the Silicon Valley
venture firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield Byers. It plans to offer cable-based
high speed backbone services starting in early 1996. KPCB is probably
better known to Internet users for its investment in Netscape
Communications while TCI has a 20% stake in the Microsoft Network.
<P>
Other cable companies have also started trials of Internet services
on cable. Slightly further afield, a number of telephone companies
are now offering telephone service across cable lines. We have
also seen the VocalTec technology to route telephone calls across
the Internet. It all gets rather mixed up. But think about it,
after all, a wire is only a wire, and just another data pipe.
<P>
And when is a data pipe not a wire? The answer is when it is wireless.
In the equally hot wireless communications industry,
there are a number of competing technologies for Internet access,
including CDPD (Cellular Digital Packet Data - stealing some 
bandwidth from the cellular phone system)
and the much sought-after PCS (Personal Communications 
Services) spectrum.
However if you need modem access speeds now, check out Metricom's
spread spectrum networks operating on the same frequencies
as your garage door opener.

<I>How to get on the Internet</I> 
<P>
Historically, Internet access was for those of us lucky enough
to work at a place that had it set up, or those able to set up
the system and afford the high price of connection. 
There was also dialup access to a number
of stand-alone information or online services and bulletin board
services. With the rising popularity of the World Wide Web and
the Internet in the last few years, there has been a proliferation
of Internet Service Providers targeting individuals or small organizations.
ISPs now offer packages of Internet services (WWW, mail, FTP,
gopher, etc.) accessible from home PC's and Macintoshes over regular
telephone lines and using friendly graphical user interfaces.
They enable individual users to access the full and varied resources
of the Internet. Although some are national in scope, many ISPs
are small local operations that resell network capacity purchased
from the regional network providers.
<P>
General purpose online services, on the other hand, started as
private dial-up networks with local access in many cities. 
Their little brothers, bulletin board services, differ only in size
and scope.
Having no connection to other computers and resources, 
online services support well
developed local content - often through exclusive arrangements
with content developers - as well as discussion groups and forums. The
"Big Three" services in the US today are America Online, CompuServe,
and Prodigy, each claiming several million customers. In the last
six months, all three have begun to provide Internet access to
its members.  Smaller bulletin board operators such as The Well 
are also seeking to provide
Internet access, and so the lines between online service providers,
BBS's, and ISP's are blurring fast.
<P>
With the sudden popularity of the online service business, everyone, end
users and service providers alike, are waiting to see the much-touted 
Microsoft Network (MSN), scheduled to start at the end
of August. The MSN software is packaged as part of Windows 95
and packed with Microsoft's undeniable clout, so most pundits
have already renamed the "Big Three" into the "Big
Four" to include MSN.
Unless, of course, the Department of Justice lands a knockout punch
first.  MSN competitors are crying unfair competition and urging the
unbundling of MSN from Windows 95.
<P>
Meanwhile, service providers large and small are also proliferating
in Europe.  In terms of the majors, the French Minitel system has been
active for many years, and Minitel addresses are as prevalent as
phone numbers on billboards.  CompuServe has always had a European
presence,  and now AOL has teamed up with German publisher 
Bertelsmann.  This won't be called Europe Online, though.  That name
belongs to a different consortium of providers.

Internet access used to be e-mail, telnet, and ftp.  Information access
got better with archie, and gopher, and wais.  The evolution of the 
World Wide Web changed all that.
First came the browser, the ability to navigate the web at the click
of a mouse.  Brower software, based on the NCSA (National Center for Supercomputing
Applications) technology, or written from ground up, proliferated.
Web fever spread, and home pages - Internet storefronts and billboards
- flourished.
The ability to access more and different types of digital information and the availability 
of this information feed upon each other, accelerating the growth and 
development of the web and its applications.  In little more than a year it has gone from
an interesting fad to a major - albeit not always profitable - communication 
and distribution channel.  
<p>
Every day, new businesses from bakers to bankers and realtors to retailers are setting up
shop on the Internet.
This activity provides fertile ground for new technology development.
On the practical side, the web is a huge place - finding 
what you need is like the proverbial needle in the 
haystack, or the few right electrons in all of cyberspace.  
Directory sites and search engine and search agent 
technology are part of the next wave.
On the playful side, increasing interactivity - 
browsers that can deliver multimedia
contents or navigate 3D space and virtual reality are
appearing on the horizon.
Products supporting Internet storefronts and information 
centers - web servers that interface to corporate 
information-bases such as Oracle, WAIS, or
Lotus Notes, or specific applications such as inventory systems - 
are proliferating.
And of course the standards for secure payment systems, another
essential component for business on the net, are quickly 
getting sorted out.
<p>
In the accelerated lifecycle of Internet business, the pioneers are
already going public and getting bought out even as the second wave
of technology and applications develop. 
The third is still a gleam in some prospector's eye.
Sure as there is gold the web, many more will be coming.

<HR>
<P>
<I>And don't forget to count 'em</I> 
<P>
You've staked your claim on the Internet frontier with your
W3 storefront.  So now the question is, how do you get 
people to come to it?  And when what you sell is
information and mindshare, how do you keep track of the
people who do come?
It's not just by word of mouth any more: marketing has come 
to the net, with its questions of demographics, reach, and frequency.
<P>
The popular measure of a web site is the number of "hits"
it receives in a day. A hit is basically the retrieval of a file
from the server. So first of all, depending on how you structure
you web pages, the same information can generate a hit count within
a couple of orders of magnitude. Another source of hit inflation
is readers retrieving a page multiple times during the course
of a visit. Large online services that cache popular W3 pages
locally, on the other hand, deflate the hit count (and may violate
copyright laws as well).
<P>
Another approach, adapted from the pages of the traditional
online services, is to register users (for free) and to require
them to log in to access the information at the site. In the early
days of the web, this was subject to significant criticism. However,
resistance is now declining with prevalence, and this will likely
become part standard operating procedures.
<P>
The need for precise counts of
the number of visitors to your site is often critical.  Just like
circulation audits in the print magazine business or Nielsen ratings
for broadcast television, tools and services for auditing access
to web sites are now beginning to appear. In fact, even Nielsen
is working on an Internet access audit system.
<P>
At the same time, a whole infrastructure supporting the Internet
marketing professional is starting to take shape. These range
from demographic surveys of the Internet to professional
organizations and special
interest groups. More recently, surveys of businesses and profitability
on the net are showing up. Although some reports are free, most
carry a price tag in the $500 and up range - hefty by the
old net standards of free information
And the traditional ad agencies are moving onto
the web, either by developing online capabilities in-house, or by
partnering with the smaller, entrepreneurial presence providers.
The bottom line: the Internet may be a different medium, but the 
marketing basics remain the same.

<H2><A NAME="sc9">WE ARE CIVILIZED</A></H2>
<HR>
<P>
<I>...send in the lawyers</I> 
<P>
Ordinary citizens are settling en masse on the Internet.
The frontier customs, so well suited to the pioneers, are
steadily giving way to the more complex concerns of
civilization.  Concerns such as property rights and torts.
<P>
The beauty of digital information is that it is easy and inexpensive
to duplicate, modify, and transmit. It worked well in the old
days of the Internet, when the dominant culture was one of free
distribution of information. However, with the increase of commercial
interests on the Internet, this is changing fast. The laws governing
intellectual property, particularly copyright, are of crucial
importance to anyone putting material on the Internet. The basic
rule of thumb is don't put any one else's material on your site
without appropriate permission, but links are okay. This isn't
a professional opinion, though, so please consult your lawyer.
<P>
The registration of Internet domain names can also present a challenge.
The story of one company which registered its rival's name - and
offered to return it in exchange for a case of beer - has become
entrenched in Internet legal lore. The simple fact is that domain
names are limited, and you may not be able to use the name of
your corporation or trademark because it is already in use.  There
is no legal relationship between trademarks and domain names entitling
you to one with possession of the other.
<P>
And intellectual property issues are just the tip of the legal
iceberg. Other pithy issues include freedom of speech and of the press,
pornography, and defamation.
<P>
In recent days, the US press and legislature have been abuzz about
the availability of pornography and the "safety" of
cyberspace.   Controversy surrounds the recent Time Magazine
cover on Cyberporn.  Legislation in progress - based on a poor understanding
of the difference between the Internet and broadcast television
(it's all telecommunications, right?) would make browsing an x-rated
newsgroup a crime punishable by up to two years in jail and a
$100,000 fine. Another question: is an Online Service Provider
a "common carrier" not responsible for the contents
created by its subscribers, or is it a publisher and therefore
liable for defamation charges? The Prodigy case - an online
flame war escalated into a multi-million dollar libel suit - is on
appeal yet again after the court ruled for liability, and
is being followed carefully by service providers and the
legal profession alike.
<P>
A different challenge comes about because
while laws are national or local in nature, the Internet
has no geographic boundaries. Should the law where the web server
is located apply, or where the browser is located? The operators
of a BBS in California was convicted of distributing pornographic
materials by Tennessee community standards because the BBS was
accessible in Tennessee.  Toss in the First Amendment rights to
free speech, a too literal interpretation to freedom of the press,
and the much larger cultural differences across the world to make
a tangled web of dilemmas.
<P>
In sum, legal issues affecting property and constitutional rights
are being extended from Realspace into Cyberspace. Cyberspace law is still
in its early days, so be prepared for many more developments and
changes over the next few years. No wonder the telecommunications
reform bill going through US Congress has been referred to as the
"Lawyers' Full Employment Bill".

<I>and no disintermediation in the truly efficient information
market</I> 
<P>
Have you ever noticed that postage for US domestic mail is priced
in one ounce increments while international mail is in half ounce
increments? If you believe there is method in the madness,
you would say the cost of handling domestic mail is higher than
the cost of carrying it physically to its destination; and that
the reverse is true for international mail. Most of us are used
to paying some kind of flat rate for our Internet access, e.g.,
a monthly charge or a cost per hour of connect time, independent
of the amount of network traffic we create. But should you really
have to pay as much for reading USEnet news and sending e-mail
messages periodically as someone having a realtime videoconference
across the net? When there is relatively unlimited network capacity,
you probably don't care. But that will probably change as more
and more bandwidth hungry applications come onto the Internet.
Should there be different prices for priority classes of transmission
services? No one is certain, but Professors Jeff MacKie-Mason and
Hal Varian of the Department
of Economics at the University of Michigan discuss these issues
and suggest some possible pricing systems.

While lawyers ponder the application of intellectual property
laws in cyberspace, Esther Dyson, the PC/digital industry opinion
leader, is arguing for radical changes in our outlook. Her thesis
is that physical and intellectual products are losing their value
in the digital society compared with the "intellectual process".
Put another way, the key is not the content, but the relationship
to the customer. The cost of physical reproduction and distribution
of information is plummeting with the increasing use of the Internet,
and she uses the commoditization of software to illustrate that
most information is not unique and valuable. She suggests that
we "think of content as an advertisement for more personal,
higher-value products, processes, and services".  Well, we don't
think the physical manifestation of information is quite so irrelevant
- it's easy to overlook the value of information packaging
until you've tried to read War and Peace on Sumerian
clay tablets. Nevertheless, the essay presents provocative ideas
about the economics of content in the increasingly digital world.

Okay, so you think disintermediation means losing your connection
in the middle of a furious game of Internet Doom, or that it's
what happens to the baddies when you aim your gargleblaster at
the bloob from YUIOP. But don't think that economist are a dull,
lot of highbrow academics. When in doubt, there is always the

During the personal computer revolution of the 80's, most of the
existing computer manufacturers did not take the microcomputer
very seriously. IBM handed its interest in the problem to Intel
and Microsoft, and the rest is history. When the Internet burst
into prominence in the "Global Information Infrastructure",
however, many organizations didn't make the same mistake twice. Alliances
are forming thick and fast; and outright acquisitions as well.
Browser companies were the first to fall to online service providers.
Search engines were next, as well as a few content producers.
Intuit missed the marriage with Microsoft thanks to the Department
of Justice, but other consumer applications have changed ownership.
And of course, Netscape's strategic partners are legion. Here
is our partial tally of the score to date.
<UL>
<LI>AOL purchases ANS (Internet network infrastructure), Booklink
and Navisoft (web software), Medior (multimedia production), GNN
(content and Internet landmark), WAIS (information indexing and
publishing system), Webcrawler (search engine).
<LI>Bank of America buys Mecca's Managing Your Money (personal
finance).
<LI>CompuServe purchases Spry (browser).
<LI>Home Shopping Network buys Internet Shopping Network, and
CUC buys NetMarket (online shopping).
<LI>IBM takes over Lotus for its Notes product.
<LI>Microsoft gets a stake in Spyglass (browser), and UUNet (Internet
infrastructure) and licenses Lycos (search engine), and partners with NBC
and Dreamworks (content).
<LI>Netscape partners with Adobe (desktop publishing), Macromedia
(multimedia presentation), Mastercard (financial application),
Sun Microsystems (hot java browser technology), Verity (search
engine), Terisa Systems (security) .
<LI>PSI buys Pipeline (local Internet service provider and browser).

In our whirlwind tour of the Internet business world so far,
we have trained our sights on
the lower levels of the food chain - the infrastructure and the
business of the Internet.  
However, we have now run up against the limits of
many e-mail systems and online readability.
As a result, the top level of the electronic ecosphere,
the businesses that actually operate on the Internet, 
will have to be explored in a separate, second section.
Part 2 will be mailed to readers shortly after Part 1, and will
include the following topics.

<li>Beam Me Up, Scotty (Characteristics of Internet businesses)
<li>Old Dog, New Tricks (Traditional businesses take advantage of the Internet)
<li>Electronic Bears and Bulls (The securities business online)
<li>Shop Until you Drop (Online shopping malls)
<li>Digital Delivery's the Name (Internet as a distribution channel)
<li>On the Farther, Wilder Side (More Internet businesses)
<li>Will That be E-Cash, NetChex, or First Virtual? (Payment systems)
<li>Fort-Knox-in-a-Box (Electronic money)

No, this isn't a description about trying to download a 120
kbyte gif file across a 2400 baud line. It's a full page ad campaign
in the Wall Street Journal to persuade the business world that
the network can bring it more money, and it shows a dog labeled
"Network". An (undoubtedly) unintended juxtaposition from
the company that gave us the insightful slogan "The Network
is the Computer" and some great advances in browser technology.

How many women are there on the Net? That seems to be one of the most
popular marketing questions about the Internet. Conventional wisdom (including
our own Netsurfer reader surveys) seem to indicate that the Internet
population is 90% male and 10% female. Matrix, though, claims
this ratio is closer to 2:1, and will sell you a report to prove
it. Take a look at the summary at <A href=gopher://akasha.tic.com:70/00/survey/ids/demo.412>gopher://akasha.tic.com:70/00/survey/ids/demo.412</A>
and see what you think.

<b>Who's Next?</b><br>
Americans are schizophrenic about success: while rags to riches is every entrepreneur's
dream, you become the enemy once you become too rich and too powerful
for the next little guy to have a chance.  Bill Gates must be getting tired of those
Department of Justice trustbusters camped outside his office
- and he has quite a bit less than 70%
of the total computer operating system market.  Netscape claims more than 75%
of all web traffic from its Navigator browser, and it's
locking up the market fast with its alliances and partnerships.  Is it the next up?

<I>100% pure, recycled 1's and 0's</I> 
<P>
So what's this fuss about doing business on the Internet?  
Basically, anything that can be digitized - stored in representations
of 1's and 0's, can be sent quickly down the data pipes.
So the Net is not just a communication channel, but a distribution 
channel of information, words, numbers, sounds, 
pictures, videos, computer programs, etc. as well.  
It can't quite get me a carton of milk from the corner store,
or get me into the office and bypass the rush hour traffic 
as old Scotty can.  But hey, we are still in the 20th Century.
so it's not a bad start.
<p>
The Internet is fast - important for delivering time sensitive 
information.  As a distribution channel, it meets 
our desire for instant gratification.
The 24 hour availability and hyperlinks of the web make 
self service convenient.  Being computerized, it's also easy to search for particular
items in a large collection - a book in a library, or a section of 
the tax code.  And speaking of libraries, who needs to keep copies
around if the whole, most up-to-date Internet library is a few mouseclicks
away?
<p>
The drawbacks are packaging and the early stage of the technology.
Most of us don't yet have the setup to download music or videos
for real-time use, although the next generation data plumbers are already
working on that.  Packaging is tougher:
print is still better for portability and readability on longer tracts 
of information.  However, it doesn't need to be a either-or proposition;
print and online sources can be used to effectively complement
each other.
<p>
Successful businesses on the Internet take advantage of 
its unique characteristics and customers, just like successful 
businesses anywhere else.  The rest just becomes 
cyber-roadkill.  Here is a report from the  early days on the
road.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="sc2">OLD DOG, NEW TRICKS</A></H2>
<HR>
<P>
<I>The Internet is just another channel</I>
<P>
The first step in many business relationships is getting to
know about each other, and the web is an excellent
way to get information to potential customers and
partners - open 24 hours a day,
instant access, leisurely browsing, and downloadable for
future reference but always there and always up-to-date.
These days, a corporate information center on the Internet
is a must for any high tech company - and many
other businesses are moving in as well.
<p>
The de rigueur info center typically has detailed information
about
<ul>
<li>Products and services, including pricing and availability
<li>News and press releases
<li>Contact information

<li>Financial information for shareholders
<li>Locator, e.g., of branches or service counters
<li>Corporate history
<li>Employment opportunities
<li>Reader feedback mechanism
<li>Interesting and relevant information sites
</ul>
It is only a small step to go from the information center to
actually conducting business online.
Many of the daily transactions are routine and easy to automate.
As the ATM (automatic bank teller machine, that is) generation
will attest, it's often easier to deal with a machine than a
surly service rep or a closed office.  Business automation, of course, isn't
new - there are many systems based on touch-tone telephones.  But we 
have all gotten lost in voice-mail hell
simply because most of us navigate the
options better with the information charted out
visually in front of us.  The more complex a transaction, the easier
it is in visual rather than audio form.  Like many another problem on
the net, the bandwidth makes the difference.
<p>
The growing popularity of the web will bring a flood of
simple and complex service transactions.  Already, you can
check airline schedules and fares, buy a ticket, rent a car,
check your bank balance, or find out the location of your
express shipment through the web.  Eventually, anything we
can now do via telephone can be done via the web,
and better.  Just wait and see.

<I>The Internet Ticker Tape</I>
<p>
One activity that operates on timely information
is the stock market. So it is no surprise that stock information
and brokerage services have been quick to set up shop on the net.
Since this is still quite new, however, there is no standardization
of service for the Internet brokerage.
Various approaches and services are offered by the different organizations,
both for fee and for free. All sites typically have the online
ticker tape, a stock-quote server. Quotes tend to be either delayed
(15-20 minutes), or from the end of the previous trading day.
Sites may simply provide quotes or also offer brokerage services
through a secure Web server. Additional financial products, such
as subscriptions to financial newsletters, may also be available.
<P>
<B>PAWWS Financial Network </B>- Security-APL, who runs this service,
has been in the portfolio accounting business since the days of
analog computers. They offer their services in conjunction with
a discount brokerage firm, and provide a 15-minute delayed quote
server for free.<BR>

stock quote server is also provided. All services are free, and
paid for by mutual fund companies who place their information
at the site. However, users must register, and there are also
other disclosure information products for sale.<BR>

Another telephone-based business that works well over the Internet
is online catalog shopping. There are the usual tradeoffs between
using a paper or an online catalog - the paper version is portable
and easier to handle, but has high printing cost and long lead
times for updates. An online catalog has the advantage of
easy keyword based searching through large databases of products,
pictures and detailed spec sheets (if necessary), and low cost,
automated self service. 
<p>
Retail stores were some of the first businesses to arrive on the
Internet.  Many Internet service providers also offered web presence
services that could provide a home page for a small 
fee.  Online catalogs proliferated, particularly in areas
matching the Internet's interest - music, books, wine, chocolates and
desserts.  Florists, used to dealing with FTD (long distance) orders, also arrived
quickly.  Internet shopping malls flourished.
<p>
Mail order shopping is big business in the US, accounting for over $200 billion
of business a year.  Internet-based automation can drastically cut
down the cost of each transaction from dollars to cents.  
Already we can shop until we drop in the comfort of our desks.
So small
wonder that Home Shopping Network has already bought out the
Internet Shopping Network.

Selling - delivering for a fee - digital content on the Internet

of the Internet.  Here are a few of them.
<P>
<B>Auto Dealers</B><BR>
Automobile dealerships may, at first glance, seem a trifle
out of the place on the high tech Internet. But cars are big ticket
items that often require a lot of information and comparison shopping
in the decision process. It is a "considered purchase"
in the vernacular, and the Web is excellent for providing the
levels of detailed information required for the consideration.
For finding just the right used car, online searching and matching
your desired criteria against the inventory available is even
more valuable. DealerNet is a Washington State based group of
dealerships, and if imitation is the sincerest form of flattery,
it definitely has admirers.<BR>

<B>Matching</B><BR>
Matching what we are looking for with what is available is
a process we have all gone through with classified advertising
in traditional newspapers. Buying a used car is an example, and
finding a friend or a date is another. Electric Classifieds, Inc.
is deploying their Internet-based implementation of this traditional
database application in the form of Match.com, a personals and
dating service for the Internet. Doubtlessly other "classified"
sections will follow. While we will all match with more efficiency,
will we lose that unique sociological insight that comes from
browsing the classifieds that leave ink all over our fingers?

television.  Program content is supplemented by more
resources at their web site.  c/net: the Computer Network will

Does it up the ante for all online services, or is it a marriage

Then set up a web server in a country that permits this. And voila,
you have a supply of customers who would otherwise have to physically
leave their home countries for their pleasures. Although the common
theoretical example is an erotica site in a Scandinavian country,
casinos and gambling organizations based in the Caribbean are

<I>Some things in life aren't free</I> 
<P>
You've found the perfect gargleblaster from the W3 store, so just enter
your credit card number in the online form, right? The only problem
is, unlike your home phone, the Internet is one giant party line.
There is a widespread concern that someone is snooping on the
line to steal your credit card number. So, the first problem for
online purchases is to make it safe from the wiretappers.
<P>
Historically - as much as one can call a year or so historical -
the solutions ranged from not worrying about it (and sending
the credit card number out), to calling in the order by phone,
to PGP encryption of credit card information and other proprietary 
solutions.  However, the approaches are rapidly converging.
<p>
The defence mechanism of choice is definitely encryption. 
SHTTP (secure HTTP) and SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) have
now become the de facto standard protocols for securing W3 transactions.
Incorporation of this technology
into web servers and browsers allows secure, encrypted transactions
to take place across the Internet. Currently the Netscape supports
SSL, and a significant proportion of Internet businesses use its secure server.
Terisa Systems has been tasked with merging the two protocols
and making the technology available for licensing.
<P>
In using SHTTP or SSL, the transaction information is encrypted.
This means that you are still paying through a conventional credit
card account, and the recipient must have a merchant account with
the credit card company. Another alternative is an Internet-based
charge account. You set up an account with the provider and it
acts as an Internet front end to any existing credit card or chequing
accounts that you designate. When you make a purchase, you use
proprietary (and usually free) client software that sends the
purchase and account information in encrypted form to the account
provider. The provider in turn sends the information to the appropriate
financial organization for processing. With this kind of arrangement,
it is possible to transfer amounts between accounts without requiring
a credit card merchant account. Currently, CyberCash offers accounts
for use with your credit card (with debit card and demand deposit
accounts to come) while NetChex offers a similar capability for
your chequing accounts.
<P>
Another variation, in use since last October, is the First Virtual
account. The account is set up by phone using a traditional credit
card account. The purchase information, including the First Virtual
account number (and not the credit card number) is sent over the
Internet without encryption. However, each purchase is subject
to an email confirmation. This requires no special software for
either the merchant or the buyer's, and has the advantage of verifying
the purchase. (After all, a stolen credit card number can be used without
detection by a system using encryption alone.)
<P>
The pioneers to date have been small, innovative companies.
What of the existing players?  The credit card business is big business
and the players aren't likely to give it away.
Microsoft and Visa have cooperated on the development of secure
transaction technology based on non-repudiable dignital signatures.
Mastercard has signed up to support this, and no doubt Mastercard
partner Netscape, and Netscape partner Terisa Systems, will follow along.
Will this shut out the adventurous entrepreneurs?  Stay tuned.

<I>Making money takes on new meaning</I> 
<P>
The payment schemes described in the previous section rely upon
a pre-existing relationship between the user and either a conventional
credit card vendor or bank, or an online credit service like Cybercash.
You have an established account, and all transactions are tracked
and accounted for.  Just as cash has its advantages in the offline world,
the concern about privacy, and a need for inexpensive ways to
pay small amounts of money, say $0.10 for an electronic newspaper,
is driving the development is electronic cash. Pioneered by David
Chaum, electronic cash technology uses cryptographic algorithms
to "mint" money that is simply bits of information residing
an electronic wallet on your computer. Like cash, its user cannot
be identified, it can be irretrievably lost if your hard disk
is damaged, and it can be stolen.
<P>
The main effort in e-cash is the CyberBucks experiment being conducted
by Chaum's company, DigiCash. Every participant is given $100
in CyberBucks for free, and there are over 50 participating shops
and about $1,000,000 in circulation. There are also a few other
systems in use by small communities on the Internet, e.g., NexusBucks
and GhostMarks. The obvious question that comes to mind is the
ability to exchange e-cash for conventional currency. This is,
however, not an absolute requirement if enough of the desired
goods and services are available for your particular form of e-cash.
What is inevitable is the tax man. Since 1982, barter systems
are legal forms of trade in the United States. However, barter
"dollars" must be reported for the purposes for income
and sales taxes, and these taxes must be paid in US dollars. With
the international nature of the Internet, of course, this problem
will be a lot more complicated. Right now it's too small to catch
much attention, but doubtlessly the tax man and the regulators
cometh.

<I>The unglamorous EDI oilcan</I> 
<P>
Online commerce involves a lot more than electronic money and
credit card numbers. Long before the Internet captured the headlines,
hundreds of millions of dollars of business was being carried
out internationally through private networks provided by the likes
of AT&T and GE. Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) is the set
of standards for the electronic transmission of information about
trade in goods and services. It is an active industry involving
dozens of national and international standards bodies - including
the United Nations - and hundreds of organizations worldwide.
A quick look into some of the many data interchange standards
reveals the breadth of coverage: predefined datasets range from
"Grocery Product Purchase Order Change" and "Ocean
Vessel Schdule and Itinerary" to "Residential Mortgage
Credit Report Order" and "Student Loan Application".
In comparison, that cgi-script-based form to order the CD's or
a dozen roses is still just a babe in the woods.
<P>
The EDI industry is now moving onto the Internet to take advantage
of its speed and increasing reach. In addition to porting the
data interchange software to run securely on TCP/IP networks,
the dialup Value Added Networks (VANs) are setting up shop on
the web. Membership-based World Wide Web sites dedicated to industrial
buyers are appearing beneath the buzz of online consumer shopping.
- Truly an industrial strength undertaking.

of information and the sense of community and support that develop
in various newsgroups, chatrooms, and mailing lists. The characteristics
of information and support are also most critical when we face
ill health and when we try to improve or maintain good health.
What resources does the Internet have to offer?
<P>
<B>Diversity</B><BR>
Despite our sometimes parochial US point of view, we know
that the Internet is a truly international community. The diversity
and richness of resources is mirrored in the participants on the
net. We will be exploring the Internet in its manifestations of
race, gender, age, religion, ideology, sexual preference, wealth,
and many of the other differences that make us all unique.

<I>The Big Picture</I> 
<P>
There is a scene in one of the Star Trek movies where the "Genesis
Probe" is launched onto the surface of a barren planet, and
an entire planetary ecosystem develops before the eyes of the
Enterprise crew. 
The World Wide Web has sprung to life with similar speed in the 
last two years.  As part of this, online commerce is evolving and
diversifying before our very eyes.
This issue of Netsurfer Focus takes a took at the emerging ecosystem
of online commerce, the business of the net, and the businesses on
the net, and where they are in their evolution.
<P>
The foundation of the Internet ecosystem is the network itself,
the wires and switches that connect the computers across the world.
Living on the physical network, one step up the foodchain, are
the access providers, the folks that allow networks and end users to 
connect to and communicate
with each other. Then there are the tool providers, the makers
of client browsers and servers, whose software influence much of what
we do.
The user population itself of the Internet is growing and diversifying
exponentially.
Businesses are now being built on top of the network and tools,
and the wheels of commerce greased by evolving electronic payment
systems. It is a landscape bustling with activity, as we dip our
net to scoop up, for your perusal, representative nuggets of netlife.
<p>
<H2><A NAME="sc2">THE FINGERBONES ARE ... CONNECTED TO THE
BACKBONE</A></H2>
<HR>
<P>
<I>Web of Wire: The Data Pipes </I>
<P>
What does the physical network look like?  Just like the highway
system of interstate highways, main thoroughfares, country roads, and
dirt footpaths, the Internet is a network of data pipes of various
capacities.   It usually begins with
a high bandwidth backbone cable with capacity sometimes 
in excess of 100 megabits/sec.  This is in turn connected to a series of networks 
of decreasing capacity until the end user is reached.
<p>
In the United States, the backbones are fiber optic cables provided by 
long distance phone companies such as MCI and Sprint.
There are four main Network Access Points (NAPs), in
San Francisco, Chicago, New York, and the Washington DC area, 
maintained by regional or long distance telephone companies. 
Also connecting at these NAPs
are services to Europe (Ebone and EuropaNET), Asia and the rest
of the world, the US Government via the Federal Internet Exchange
(FIX), and the experimental gigabit per second vBNS (very high speed Backbone
Network Service) .
The government's NSFNet, once the main road of the Internet,
has been shut down since April.
<P>
The companies providing the network backbone form the lowest level
of a food chain of service providers. As network service providers
(NSPs), they provide network capacity to regional network providers
(RNPs) who in turn service the many Internet Service Providers
(ISPs) or Internet Access Providers (IAPs)
who provide connections for end users directly. RNPs may
also directly service end users. 
CIX, the Commercial Internet Exchange, is a consortium of ISPs and
private networks whose equipment also
taps directly into the network access points.
<P>
Although the fiber backbone can service a variety of networks,
the Internet is based on the TCP/IP protocols.  The Internet Society is
the international organization that oversees the cooperation and
coordination of Internet activities.  It is also responsible for future
directions, including development of the next generation IP
protocols - before the growth of the Internet uses up all the
available addresses under the current scheme.
<p>
The foundations for online commerce are being laid down rapidly.
As of  October 1994, about 3.5 million computers are connected 
to the Internet.
A separate survey of the number of Internet
domain names (which approximate the number of organizations on
the Internet) found a total of over 4.8 million domains by February
1995. By all counts, the Internet is growing at a sustained rate
of at least 100% per year. Although this is expected to slow 
down eventually
(since maintaining it would mean that every person on the planet
would be connected to the Internet in 10 years), the boom years
are still ahead of us.

<I>Data plumbers, the next generation</I> 
<P>
The data pipelines of the Internet are simply telephone lines
of various capacity. The backbone providers are long distance
phone companies. We access the Internet through telephone lines.
So who is better to get into the Internet access business than the
local telephone companies themselves? Why go through the middleman
of an Internet service provider? Pacific Bell, for instance, has
started offering Internet services to consumers, and will provide business
service later in the year. More importantly, it also has active 
programs promoting
the use of ISDN - increasing the capacity of our phone wires
from 14.4k bits/second to 56k and better. For those of us who turn off graphics
in our browsers or go for a cup of coffee when downloading a 40
kbyte gif, the bigger data pipes will come none too soon for the
increasing multimedia network traffic.
<P>
But wait. There are often not one but two wires that enter into
a North American home: the telephone, and cable television. What
about using the coaxial television cable to get onto the Internet?
It happens to have quite a bit more capacity than twisted pair
copper phone wires - all you need is a cable-based modem. A new
entrant into the network provider business is the @home network,
a joint venture between cable leader TCI and the Silicon Valley
venture firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield Byers. It plans to offer cable-based
high speed backbone services starting in early 1996. KPCB is probably
better known to Internet users for its investment in Netscape
Communications while TCI has a 20% stake in the Microsoft Network.
<P>
Other cable companies have also started trials of Internet services
on cable. Slightly further afield, a number of telephone companies
are now offering telephone service across cable lines. We have
also seen the VocalTec technology to route telephone calls across
the Internet. It all gets rather mixed up. But think about it,
after all, a wire is only a wire, and just another data pipe.
<P>
And when is a data pipe not a wire? The answer is when it is wireless.
In the equally hot wireless communications industry,
there are a number of competing technologies for Internet access,
including CDPD (Cellular Digital Packet Data - stealing some 
bandwidth from the cellular phone system)
and the much sought-after PCS (Personal Communications 
Services) spectrum.
However if you need modem access speeds now, check out Metricom's
spread spectrum networks operating on the same frequencies
as your garage door opener.

<I>How to get on the Internet</I> 
<P>
Historically, Internet access was for those of us lucky enough
to work at a place that had it set up, or those able to set up
the system and afford the high price of connection. 
There was also dialup access to a number
of stand-alone information or online services and bulletin board
services. With the rising popularity of the World Wide Web and
the Internet in the last few years, there has been a proliferation
of Internet Service Providers targeting individuals or small organizations.
ISPs now offer packages of Internet services (WWW, mail, FTP,
gopher, etc.) accessible from home PC's and Macintoshes over regular
telephone lines and using friendly graphical user interfaces.
They enable individual users to access the full and varied resources
of the Internet. Although some are national in scope, many ISPs
are small local operations that resell network capacity purchased
from the regional network providers.
<P>
General purpose online services, on the other hand, started as
private dial-up networks with local access in many cities. 
Their little brothers, bulletin board services, differ only in size
and scope.
Having no connection to other computers and resources, 
online services support well
developed local content - often through exclusive arrangements
with content developers - as well as discussion groups and forums. The
"Big Three" services in the US today are America Online, CompuServe,
and Prodigy, each claiming several million customers. In the last
six months, all three have begun to provide Internet access to
its members.  Smaller bulletin board operators such as The Well 
are also seeking to provide
Internet access, and so the lines between online service providers,
BBS's, and ISP's are blurring fast.
<P>
With the sudden popularity of the online service business, everyone, end
users and service providers alike, are waiting to see the much-touted 
Microsoft Network (MSN), scheduled to start at the end
of August. The MSN software is packaged as part of Windows 95
and packed with Microsoft's undeniable clout, so most pundits
have already renamed the "Big Three" into the "Big
Four" to include MSN.
Unless, of course, the Department of Justice lands a knockout punch
first.  MSN competitors are crying unfair competition and urging the
unbundling of MSN from Windows 95.
<P>
Meanwhile, service providers large and small are also proliferating
in Europe.  In terms of the majors, the French Minitel system has been
active for many years, and Minitel addresses are as prevalent as
phone numbers on billboards.  CompuServe has always had a European
presence,  and now AOL has teamed up with German publisher 
Bertelsmann.  This won't be called Europe Online, though.  That name
belongs to a different consortium of providers.

Internet access used to be e-mail, telnet, and ftp.  Information access
got better with archie, and gopher, and wais.  The evolution of the 
World Wide Web changed all that.
First came the browser, the ability to navigate the web at the click
of a mouse.  Brower software, based on the NCSA (National Center for Supercomputing
Applications) technology, or written from ground up, proliferated.
Web fever spread, and home pages - Internet storefronts and billboards
- flourished.
The ability to access more and different types of digital information and the availability 
of this information feed upon each other, accelerating the growth and 
development of the web and its applications.  In little more than a year it has gone from
an interesting fad to a major - albeit not always profitable - communication 
and distribution channel.  
<p>
Every day, new businesses from bakers to bankers and realtors to retailers are setting up
shop on the Internet.
This activity provides fertile ground for new technology development.
On the practical side, the web is a huge place - finding 
what you need is like the proverbial needle in the 
haystack, or the few right electrons in all of cyberspace.  
Directory sites and search engine and search agent 
technology are part of the next wave.
On the playful side, increasing interactivity - 
browsers that can deliver multimedia
contents or navigate 3D space and virtual reality are
appearing on the horizon.
Products supporting Internet storefronts and information 
centers - web servers that interface to corporate 
information-bases such as Oracle, WAIS, or
Lotus Notes, or specific applications such as inventory systems - 
are proliferating.
And of course the standards for secure payment systems, another
essential component for business on the net, are quickly 
getting sorted out.
<p>
In the accelerated lifecycle of Internet business, the pioneers are
already going public and getting bought out even as the second wave
of technology and applications develop. 
The third is still a gleam in some prospector's eye.
Sure as there is gold the web, many more will be coming.

<HR>

<I>And don't forget to count 'em</I> 
<P>
You've staked your claim on the Internet frontier with your
W3 storefront.  So now the question is, how do you get 
people to come to it?  And when what you sell is
information and mindshare, how do you keep track of the
people who do come?
It's not just by word of mouth any more: marketing has come 
to the net, with its questions of demographics, reach, and frequency.
<P>
The popular measure of a web site is the number of "hits"
it receives in a day. A hit is basically the retrieval of a file
from the server. So first of all, depending on how you structure
you web pages, the same information can generate a hit count within
a couple of orders of magnitude. Another source of hit inflation
is readers retrieving a page multiple times during the course
of a visit. Large online services that cache popular W3 pages
locally, on the other hand, deflate the hit count (and may violate
copyright laws as well).
<P>
Another approach, adapted from the pages of the traditional
online services, is to register users (for free) and to require
them to log in to access the information at the site. In the early
days of the web, this was subject to significant criticism. However,
resistance is now declining with prevalence, and this will likely
become part standard operating procedures.
<P>
The need for precise counts of
the number of visitors to your site is often critical.  Just like
circulation audits in the print magazine business or Nielsen ratings
for broadcast television, tools and services for auditing access
to web sites are now beginning to appear. In fact, even Nielsen
is working on an Internet access audit system.
<P>
At the same time, a whole infrastructure supporting the Internet
marketing professional is starting to take shape. These range
from demographic surveys of the Internet to professional
organizations and special
interest groups. More recently, surveys of businesses and profitability
on the net are showing up. Although some reports are free, most
carry a price tag in the $500 and up range - hefty by the
old net standards of free information
And the traditional ad agencies are moving onto
the web, either by developing online capabilities in-house, or by
partnering with the smaller, entrepreneurial presence providers.
The bottom line: the Internet may be a different medium, but the 
marketing basics remain the same.

<H2><A NAME="sc9">WE ARE CIVILIZED</A></H2>
<HR>
<P>
<I>...send in the lawyers</I> 
<P>
Ordinary citizens are settling en masse on the Internet.
The frontier customs, so well suited to the pioneers, are
steadily giving way to the more complex concerns of
civilization.  Concerns such as property rights and torts.
<P>
The beauty of digital information is that it is easy and inexpensive
to duplicate, modify, and transmit. It worked well in the old
days of the Internet, when the dominant culture was one of free
distribution of information. However, with the increase of commercial
interests on the Internet, this is changing fast. The laws governing
intellectual property, particularly copyright, are of crucial
importance to anyone putting material on the Internet. The basic
rule of thumb is don't put any one else's material on your site
without appropriate permission, but links are okay. This isn't
a professional opinion, though, so please consult your lawyer.
<P>
The registration of Internet domain names can also present a challenge.
The story of one company which registered its rival's name - and
offered to return it in exchange for a case of beer - has become
entrenched in Internet legal lore. The simple fact is that domain
names are limited, and you may not be able to use the name of
your corporation or trademark because it is already in use.  There
is no legal relationship between trademarks and domain names entitling
you to one with possession of the other.
<P>
And intellectual property issues are just the tip of the legal
iceberg. Other pithy issues include freedom of speech and of the press,
pornography, and defamation.
<P>
In recent days, the US press and legislature have been abuzz about
the availability of pornography and the "safety" of
cyberspace.   Controversy surrounds the recent Time Magazine
cover on Cyberporn.  Legislation in progress - based on a poor understanding
of the difference between the Internet and broadcast television
(it's all telecommunications, right?) would make browsing an x-rated
newsgroup a crime punishable by up to two years in jail and a
$100,000 fine. Another question: is an Online Service Provider
a "common carrier" not responsible for the contents
created by its subscribers, or is it a publisher and therefore
liable for defamation charges? The Prodigy case - an online
flame war escalated into a multi-million dollar libel suit - is on
appeal yet again after the court ruled for liability, and
is being followed carefully by service providers and the
legal profession alike.
<P>
A different challenge comes about because
while laws are national or local in nature, the Internet
has no geographic boundaries. Should the law where the web server
is located apply, or where the browser is located? The operators
of a BBS in California was convicted of distributing pornographic
materials by Tennessee community standards because the BBS was
accessible in Tennessee.  Toss in the First Amendment rights to
free speech, a too literal interpretation to freedom of the press,
and the much larger cultural differences across the world to make
a tangled web of dilemmas.
<P>
In sum, legal issues affecting property and constitutional rights
are being extended from Realspace into Cyberspace. Cyberspace law is still
in its early days, so be prepared for many more developments and
changes over the next few years. No wonder the telecommunications
reform bill going through US Congress has been referred to as the
"Lawyers' Full Employment Bill".

<I>and no disintermediation in the truly efficient information
market</I> 
<P>
Have you ever noticed that postage for US domestic mail is priced
in one ounce increments while international mail is in half ounce
increments? If you believe there is method in the madness,
you would say the cost of handling domestic mail is higher than
the cost of carrying it physically to its destination; and that
the reverse is true for international mail. Most of us are used
to paying some kind of flat rate for our Internet access, e.g.,
a monthly charge or a cost per hour of connect time, independent
of the amount of network traffic we create. But should you really
have to pay as much for reading USEnet news and sending e-mail
messages periodically as someone having a realtime videoconference
across the net? When there is relatively unlimited network capacity,
you probably don't care. But that will probably change as more
and more bandwidth hungry applications come onto the Internet.
Should there be different prices for priority classes of transmission
services? No one is certain, but Professors Jeff MacKie-Mason and
Hal Varian of the Department
of Economics at the University of Michigan discuss these issues
and suggest some possible pricing systems.

While lawyers ponder the application of intellectual property
laws in cyberspace, Esther Dyson, the PC/digital industry opinion
leader, is arguing for radical changes in our outlook. Her thesis
is that physical and intellectual products are losing their value
in the digital society compared with the "intellectual process".
Put another way, the key is not the content, but the relationship
to the customer. The cost of physical reproduction and distribution
of information is plummeting with the increasing use of the Internet,
and she uses the commoditization of software to illustrate that
most information is not unique and valuable. She suggests that
we "think of content as an advertisement for more personal,
higher-value products, processes, and services".  Well, we don't
think the physical manifestation of information is quite so irrelevant
- it's easy to overlook the value of information packaging
until you've tried to read War and Peace on Sumerian
clay tablets. Nevertheless, the essay presents provocative ideas
about the economics of content in the increasingly digital world.

During the personal computer revolution of the 80's, most of the
existing computer manufacturers did not take the microcomputer
very seriously. IBM handed its interest in the problem to Intel
and Microsoft, and the rest is history. When the Internet burst
into prominence in the "Global Information Infrastructure",
however, many organizations didn't make the same mistake twice. Alliances
are forming thick and fast; and outright acquisitions as well.
Browser companies were the first to fall to online service providers.
Search engines were next, as well as a few content producers.
Intuit missed the marriage with Microsoft thanks to the Department
of Justice, but other consumer applications have changed ownership.
And of course, Netscape's strategic partners are legion. Here
is our partial tally of the score to date.
<UL>
<LI>AOL purchases ANS (Internet network infrastructure), Booklink
and Navisoft (web software), Medior (multimedia production), GNN
(content and Internet landmark), WAIS (information indexing and
publishing system), Webcrawler (search engine).
<LI>Bank of America buys Mecca's Managing Your Money (personal
finance).
<LI>CompuServe purchases Spry (browser).
<LI>Home Shopping Network buys Internet Shopping Network, and
CUC buys NetMarket (online shopping).
<LI>IBM takes over Lotus for its Notes product.
<LI>Microsoft gets a stake in Spyglass (browser), and UUNet (Internet
infrastructure) and licenses Lycos (search engine), and partners with NBC
and Dreamworks (content).
<LI>Netscape partners with Adobe (desktop publishing), Macromedia
(multimedia presentation), Mastercard (financial application),
Sun Microsystems (hot java browser technology), Verity (search
engine), Terisa Systems (security) .
<LI>PSI buys Pipeline (local Internet service provider and browser).

In our whirlwind tour of the Internet business world so far,
we have trained our sights on
the lower levels of the food chain - the infrastructure and the

However, we have now run up against the limits of

As a result, the top level of the electronic ecosphere,
the businesses that actually operate on the Internet, 
will have to be explored in a separate, second section.
Part 2 will be mailed to readers shortly after Part 1, and will
include the following topics.

<li>Old Dog, New Tricks (Traditional businesses take advantage of the Internet)
<li>Electronic Bears and Bulls (The securities business online)
<li>Shop Until you Drop (Online shopping malls)
<li>Digital Delivery's the Name (Internet as a distribution channel)
<li>On the Farther, Wilder Side (More Internet businesses)
<li>Will That be E-Cash, NetChex, or First Virtual? (Payment systems)
<li>Fort-Knox-in-a-Box (Electronic money)

No, this isn't a description about trying to download a 120

in the Wall Street Journal to persuade the business world that
the network can bring it more money, and it shows a dog labeled
"Network". An (undoubtedly) unintended juxtaposition from
the company that gave us the insightful slogan "The Network
is the Computer" and some great advances in browser technology.

How many women are there on the Net? That seems to be one of the most
popular marketing questions about the Internet. Conventional wisdom (including
our own Netsurfer reader surveys) seem to indicate that the Internet
population is 90% male and 10% female. Matrix, though, claims
this ratio is closer to 2:1, and will sell you a report to prove
it. Take a look at the summary at <A href=gopher://akasha.tic.com:70/00/survey/ids/demo.412>gopher://akasha.tic.com:70/00/survey/ids/demo.412</A>

<b>Who's Next?</b><br>
Americans are schizophrenic about success: while rags to riches is every entrepreneur's
dream, you become the enemy once you become too rich and too powerful
for the next little guy to have a chance.  Bill Gates must be getting tired of those
Department of Justice trustbusters camped outside his office
- and he has quite a bit less than 70%
of the total computer operating system market.  Netscape claims more than 75%
of all web traffic from its Navigator browser, and it's
locking up the market fast with its alliances and partnerships.  Is it the next up?

<P>
<I>100% pure, recycled 1's and 0's</I> 
<P>
So what's this fuss about doing business on the Internet?  
Basically, anything that can be digitized - stored in representations
of 1's and 0's, can be sent quickly down the data pipes.
So the Net is not just a communication channel, but a distribution 
channel of information, words, numbers, sounds, 
pictures, videos, computer programs, etc. as well.  
It can't quite get me a carton of milk from the corner store,
or get me into the office and bypass the rush hour traffic 
as old Scotty can.  But hey, we are still in the 20th Century.
so it's not a bad start.
<p>
The Internet is fast - important for delivering time sensitive 
information.  As a distribution channel, it meets 
our desire for instant gratification.
The 24 hour availability and hyperlinks of the web make 
self service convenient.  Being computerized, it's also easy to search for particular
items in a large collection - a book in a library, or a section of 
the tax code.  And speaking of libraries, who needs to keep copies
around if the whole, most up-to-date Internet library is a few mouseclicks
away?
<p>
The drawbacks are packaging and the early stage of the technology.
Most of us don't yet have the setup to download music or videos
for real-time use, although the next generation data plumbers are already
working on that.  Packaging is tougher:
print is still better for portability and readability on longer tracts 
of information.  However, it doesn't need to be a either-or proposition;
print and online sources can be used to effectively complement
each other.
<p>
Successful businesses on the Internet take advantage of 
its unique characteristics and customers, just like successful 
businesses anywhere else.  The rest just becomes 
cyber-roadkill.  Here is a report from the  early days on the
road.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="sc2">OLD DOG, NEW TRICKS</A></H2>
<HR>
<P>
<I>The Internet is just another channel</I>
<P>
The first step in many business relationships is getting to
know about each other, and the web is an excellent
way to get information to potential customers and
partners - open 24 hours a day,
instant access, leisurely browsing, and downloadable for
future reference but always there and always up-to-date.
These days, a corporate information center on the Internet
is a must for any high tech company - and many
other businesses are moving in as well.
<p>
The de rigueur info center typically has detailed information
about
<ul>
<li>Products and services, including pricing and availability
<li>News and press releases
<li>Contact information
<li>A search mechanism if the site is extensive
</ul>
In addition, many carry one or more of the following:
<ul>
<li>Showcase of upcoming products and technologies
<li>Financial information for shareholders
<li>Locator, e.g., of branches or service counters
<li>Corporate history
<li>Employment opportunities
<li>Reader feedback mechanism
<li>Interesting and relevant information sites
</ul>
It is only a small step to go from the information center to
actually conducting business online.
Many of the daily transactions are routine and easy to automate.
As the ATM (automatic bank teller machine, that is) generation
will attest, it's often easier to deal with a machine than a
surly service rep or a closed office.  Business automation, of course, isn't
new - there are many systems based on touch-tone telephones.  But we 
have all gotten lost in voice-mail hell
simply because most of us navigate the
options better with the information charted out
visually in front of us.  The more complex a transaction, the easier
it is in visual rather than audio form.  Like many another problem on
the net, the bandwidth makes the difference.
<p>
The growing popularity of the web will bring a flood of
simple and complex service transactions.  Already, you can
check airline schedules and fares, buy a ticket, rent a car,
check your bank balance, or find out the location of your
express shipment through the web.  Eventually, anything we
can now do via telephone can be done via the web,
and better.  Just wait and see.

<I>The Internet Ticker Tape</I>
<p>
One activity that operates on timely information
is the stock market. So it is no surprise that stock information
and brokerage services have been quick to set up shop on the net.
Since this is still quite new, however, there is no standardization
of service for the Internet brokerage.
Various approaches and services are offered by the different organizations,
both for fee and for free. All sites typically have the online
ticker tape, a stock-quote server. Quotes tend to be either delayed
(15-20 minutes), or from the end of the previous trading day.
Sites may simply provide quotes or also offer brokerage services
through a secure Web server. Additional financial products, such
as subscriptions to financial newsletters, may also be available.
<P>
<B>PAWWS Financial Network </B>- Security-APL, who runs this service,
has been in the portfolio accounting business since the days of
analog computers. They offer their services in conjunction with
a discount brokerage firm, and provide a 15-minute delayed quote
server for free.<BR>
<A href=http://pawws.secapl.com/top.html>"http://pawws.secapl.com/top.html"</A>
<P>
<B>Galt Technologies </B>- The Net Worth site focuses on mutual
fund information supplied by Morningstar. A 15-minute delayed
stock quote server is also provided. All services are free, and
paid for by mutual fund companies who place their information
at the site. However, users must register, and there are also
other disclosure information products for sale.<BR>
<A href=http://networth.galt.com/>"http://networth.galt.com/"</A>
<P>
<B>E-Trade Securities</B> - This is an online deep discount broker.
The W3 interface interfaces to telnet to their online trading
system. There is the usual time-delayed quote server, and also
an online stock game where you can test your skills without risking
your dollars. <BR>

<B>InterQuote</B> - Paragon Software provides software to analyze
and report stock information. It is packaged with various levels
of stock information services. Quotes may continuously via telnet
and W3 or at the end of the day via email. Registered users can
get five free end-of-day quotes on their W3 server.<BR>

<I>without leaving your desk</I> 
<P>
Another telephone-based business that works well over the Internet
is online catalog shopping. There are the usual tradeoffs between
using a paper or an online catalog - the paper version is portable
and easier to handle, but has high printing cost and long lead
times for updates. An online catalog has the advantage of
easy keyword based searching through large databases of products,
pictures and detailed spec sheets (if necessary), and low cost,
automated self service. 
<p>
Retail stores were some of the first businesses to arrive on the
Internet.  Many Internet service providers also offered web presence
services that could provide a home page for a small 
fee.  Online catalogs proliferated, particularly in areas
matching the Internet's interest - music, books, wine, chocolates and
desserts.  Florists, used to dealing with FTD (long distance) orders, also arrived
quickly.  Internet shopping malls flourished.
<p>
Mail order shopping is big business in the US, accounting for over $200 billion
of business a year.  Internet-based automation can drastically cut
down the cost of each transaction from dollars to cents.  
Already we can shop until we drop in the comfort of our desks.
So small
wonder that Home Shopping Network has already bought out the
Internet Shopping Network.

<P>
<I>Instant gratification's the game</I> 
<P>
For products that can be digitized, the Internet gives
the added benefit of instant delivery of either samples or
the real thing. Although some of the first Internet stores
are no more than online catalogs, new ventures have moved quickly to
capitalize on the digital advantage.  If it can be shipped right
down the wire, why wait for the slow boat from China?  Now if only
someone could get that transporter room set up...
<P>
<B>Infohaus</B><BR>
First Virtual's Infohaus is one of Internet's first digital
content marketplace. For a small fee, anyone can place text, image,
sound, video, and even software online for purchase by downloading.
Although the 70 plus "merchants" mostly offer text based
materials, images and sound clips are also available for a few
dollars. The low cost of entry encourages some level of vanity
publishing. <BR>

<B>software.net</B><BR>
Close to 8000 software packages for PC's, Macs, and different
flavours of Unix can be found at the software.net location. Cross
indexing makes searching for what you want a simple task when
compared with the typical PC/Mac catalogs, and linkage to CMP's
extensive product review library assists in the decision process.
Demo programs and sometimes the entire product can be downloaded
and installed with a few keystrokes. <BR>

<B>IUMA (International Underground Music Archive</B><BR>
The Internet Underground Music Archive started as a labour
of love by three UC Santa Cruz students to provide online exposure
for unsigned, independent bands and musicians. It now showcases
between 500 and 600 artists with information, pictures, downloadable
music samples, discography and sells their music on traditional
media.<BR>

Walt Disney's Buena Vista Pictures has a virtual cinema on

the Internet is clearly calling. <BR>

Selling - delivering for a fee - digital content on the Internet
is, after all, the obvious application on a digital network. However,
part of the power of the Internet is all the creative minds relentlessly
thinking about different angles and clever new ways to take advantage
of the Internet.  Here are a few of them.
<P>
<B>Auto Dealers</B><BR>
Automobile dealerships may, at first glance, seem a trifle
out of the place on the high tech Internet. But cars are big ticket
items that often require a lot of information and comparison shopping
in the decision process. It is a "considered purchase"
in the vernacular, and the Web is excellent for providing the
levels of detailed information required for the consideration.
For finding just the right used car, online searching and matching
your desired criteria against the inventory available is even
more valuable. DealerNet is a Washington State based group of
dealerships, and if imitation is the sincerest form of flattery,
it definitely has admirers.<BR>
<A href=http://www.dealer.net>"http://www.dealer.net"</A>
<P>
<B>Matching</B><BR>
Matching what we are looking for with what is available is
a process we have all gone through with classified advertising
in traditional newspapers. Buying a used car is an example, and
finding a friend or a date is another. Electric Classifieds, Inc.
is deploying their Internet-based implementation of this traditional
database application in the form of Match.com, a personals and
dating service for the Internet. Doubtlessly other "classified"
sections will follow. While we will all match with more efficiency,
will we lose that unique sociological insight that comes from
browsing the classifieds that leave ink all over our fingers?
<BR>
<A href=http://www.match.com/?netsurf>"http://www.match.com/?netsurf"</A>
<p>
<b>Media Combo</b><br>
A number of television shows have their own web pages, but
c/net plans to be both an Internet based online service and a television
network for those interested in computers.  Currently its
programming airs for about 6 times a week on network
television.  Program content is supplemented by more
resources at their web site.  c/net: the Computer Network will
go to 24-hour satellite-delivered programming next year.
Does it up the ante for all online services, or is it a marriage
of two media that don't mix?  Only time will tell.

<B>Gambling</B><BR>
Since geographic distance has little meaning on the Internet,
but our laws are based on geographic boundaries, a discontinuity
is created for entrepreneurial exploitation. Take an activity
that is illegal in many countries, e.g., erotica or gambling.
Then set up a web server in a country that permits this. And voila,
you have a supply of customers who would otherwise have to physically
leave their home countries for their pleasures. Although the common
theoretical example is an erotica site in a Scandinavian country,
casinos and gambling organizations based in the Caribbean are
already leading by a nose.<BR>

<I>Some things in life aren't free</I> 
<P>
You've found the perfect gargleblaster from the W3 store, so just enter
your credit card number in the online form, right? The only problem
is, unlike your home phone, the Internet is one giant party line.
There is a widespread concern that someone is snooping on the
line to steal your credit card number. So, the first problem for
online purchases is to make it safe from the wiretappers.
<P>
Historically - as much as one can call a year or so historical -
the solutions ranged from not worrying about it (and sending
the credit card number out), to calling in the order by phone,
to PGP encryption of credit card information and other proprietary 
solutions.  However, the approaches are rapidly converging.
<p>
The defence mechanism of choice is definitely encryption. 
SHTTP (secure HTTP) and SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) have
now become the de facto standard protocols for securing W3 transactions.
Incorporation of this technology
into web servers and browsers allows secure, encrypted transactions
to take place across the Internet. Currently the Netscape supports
SSL, and a significant proportion of Internet businesses use its secure server.
Terisa Systems has been tasked with merging the two protocols
and making the technology available for licensing.
<P>
In using SHTTP or SSL, the transaction information is encrypted.
This means that you are still paying through a conventional credit
card account, and the recipient must have a merchant account with
the credit card company. Another alternative is an Internet-based
charge account. You set up an account with the provider and it
acts as an Internet front end to any existing credit card or chequing
accounts that you designate. When you make a purchase, you use
proprietary (and usually free) client software that sends the
purchase and account information in encrypted form to the account
provider. The provider in turn sends the information to the appropriate
financial organization for processing. With this kind of arrangement,
it is possible to transfer amounts between accounts without requiring
a credit card merchant account. Currently, CyberCash offers accounts
for use with your credit card (with debit card and demand deposit
accounts to come) while NetChex offers a similar capability for
your chequing accounts.
<P>
Another variation, in use since last October, is the First Virtual
account. The account is set up by phone using a traditional credit
card account. The purchase information, including the First Virtual
account number (and not the credit card number) is sent over the
Internet without encryption. However, each purchase is subject
to an email confirmation. This requires no special software for
either the merchant or the buyer's, and has the advantage of verifying
the purchase. (After all, a stolen credit card number can be used without
detection by a system using encryption alone.)
<P>
The pioneers to date have been small, innovative companies.
What of the existing players?  The credit card business is big business
and the players aren't likely to give it away.
Microsoft and Visa have cooperated on the development of secure
transaction technology based on non-repudiable dignital signatures.
Mastercard has signed up to support this, and no doubt Mastercard
partner Netscape, and Netscape partner Terisa Systems, will follow along.
Will this shut out the adventurous entrepreneurs?  Stay tuned.

<I>Making money takes on new meaning</I> 
<P>
The payment schemes described in the previous section rely upon
a pre-existing relationship between the user and either a conventional
credit card vendor or bank, or an online credit service like Cybercash.
You have an established account, and all transactions are tracked
and accounted for.  Just as cash has its advantages in the offline world,
the concern about privacy, and a need for inexpensive ways to
pay small amounts of money, say $0.10 for an electronic newspaper,
is driving the development is electronic cash. Pioneered by David
Chaum, electronic cash technology uses cryptographic algorithms
to "mint" money that is simply bits of information residing
an electronic wallet on your computer. Like cash, its user cannot
be identified, it can be irretrievably lost if your hard disk
is damaged, and it can be stolen.
<P>
The main effort in e-cash is the CyberBucks experiment being conducted
by Chaum's company, DigiCash. Every participant is given $100
in CyberBucks for free, and there are over 50 participating shops
and about $1,000,000 in circulation. There are also a few other
systems in use by small communities on the Internet, e.g., NexusBucks
and GhostMarks. The obvious question that comes to mind is the
ability to exchange e-cash for conventional currency. This is,
however, not an absolute requirement if enough of the desired
goods and services are available for your particular form of e-cash.
What is inevitable is the tax man. Since 1982, barter systems
are legal forms of trade in the United States. However, barter
"dollars" must be reported for the purposes for income
and sales taxes, and these taxes must be paid in US dollars. With
the international nature of the Internet, of course, this problem
will be a lot more complicated. Right now it's too small to catch
much attention, but doubtlessly the tax man and the regulators
cometh.

<I>The unglamorous EDI oilcan</I> 
<P>
Online commerce involves a lot more than electronic money and
credit card numbers. Long before the Internet captured the headlines,
hundreds of millions of dollars of business was being carried
out internationally through private networks provided by the likes
of AT&T and GE. Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) is the set
of standards for the electronic transmission of information about
trade in goods and services. It is an active industry involving
dozens of national and international standards bodies - including
the United Nations - and hundreds of organizations worldwide.
A quick look into some of the many data interchange standards
reveals the breadth of coverage: predefined datasets range from
"Grocery Product Purchase Order Change" and "Ocean
Vessel Schdule and Itinerary" to "Residential Mortgage
Credit Report Order" and "Student Loan Application".
In comparison, that cgi-script-based form to order the CD's or

The EDI industry is now moving onto the Internet to take advantage
of its speed and increasing reach. In addition to porting the
data interchange software to run securely on TCP/IP networks,
the dialup Value Added Networks (VANs) are setting up shop on
the web. Membership-based World Wide Web sites dedicated to industrial
buyers are appearing beneath the buzz of online consumer shopping.
- Truly an industrial strength undertaking.

<B>Sign of the Times:</B><BR>
The June 29th edition of the Wall Street Journal
featured an 8-page advertising supplement entitled 
"The Internet Directory".
Jammed with about 100 advertisers, front page listings include 
JP Morgan, Northern Telecom, 
Intel, and the inevitable Netscape.<br>

<B>Sign of the Times in Silicon Valley:</B><BR>
Highway 101 runs down the coast of California through the
heart of Silicon Valley.  Just south of the University Avenue
exit, gateway to downtown Palo Alto, the first city on the
Internet, and Stanford University, spawning grounds for many
of the Valley's bright lights, this billboard has stood beside the
northbound lanes for over a year promoting jobs for the wired:<br>

"SAVE $0.40 on any Ragu(R) Pasta Sauce" ...
and ... "Now you can visit us on the Internet at 
<A href=http://www.eat.com>http://www.eat.com</A>."
Found printed on a manufacturer's coupon inserted into local newspapers.
And if you go to their site, you can fill in a form and get a
coupon book (by mail). On the other hand, if you prefer cruising
down the blacktop to cooking in the kitchen, you can always decorate
your bike with a licence plate holder that says <A href=http://www.harley.com>"http://www.harley.com"</A>.

Meanwhile, on the information highway, the first road
kill has been sighted.  Even as some companies reach 
for gold and glory, others are ground into dust.

<I>Curl up with a good book</I>

Business on the Internet is new and growing.  It is in, it is hype, 
it is the new media darling.  
But who is making money on the net?
Although some businesses claim to be turning a profit, the clear
winners are the authors of Internet books.
Here is our selection of some entertaining titles 
- and no promises on the contents.

As in all ecologies, that of the Internet is complex and interconnected.
In talking about the business of and on the net, we touch on a
broad range of issues from the telecommunications giants to First
Amendment rights and network security. Yet there are equally important
and fascinating topics that we have neglected. Some of these will
be featured in future issues of Netsurfer Focus. We welcome pointers
to interesting and relevant online resources in these areas. Please
send mail to the editor at <A href=>mailto:focus@netsurf.com</A>.
<P>
<B>Cryptography and Privacy</B><BR>
Cryptography is a critical technology for secure online commerce,
electronic signatures, and anonymous electronic cash. Cryptography
ensures privacy of communications. Yet many forms of cryptography
are considered "arms", and the US government would like
to make sure that it can break the code in the name of national
security. Technologies, applications, and social/legal issues
abound.
<P>
<B>Health</B><BR>
Two of the key strengths of the Internet are the ready dissemination
of information and the sense of community and support that develop
in various newsgroups, chatrooms, and mailing lists. The characteristics
of information and support are also most critical when we face
ill health and when we try to improve or maintain good health.
What resources does the Internet have to offer?
<P>
<B>Diversity</B><BR>
Despite our sometimes parochial US point of view, we know
that the Internet is a truly international community. The diversity
and richness of resources is mirrored in the participants on the
net. We will be exploring the Internet in its manifestations of
race, gender, age, religion, ideology, sexual preference, wealth,
and many of the other differences that make us all unique.

CyberMalls(tm) Corporation announced that a recent decision to
favor its ethical values over its own business success has led
to the possibility of becoming an information superhighway casualty.
CyberMalls(tm) is an Internet Presence Provider (IPP), a company
who manages a World Wide Web site used by companies desiring to
promote themselves via electronic marketing. According to majority
owner Jeffrey C. Frost, CyberMalls(tm), currently supporting over
70 businesses, is in danger of creating a resounding Cybersplat.
On Friday May 12, the doors will close and all employees will
be laid off.
<P>
According to Frost, CyberMalls(tm) is seeking a significant infusion
of capital. Frost stated that the conflict between ethics and
business objectives is an accurate if simplistic means to describe
an anguished decision making process which the owners of CyberMalls(tm)
faced. "Ultimately we decided to not accept further customer
monies unless we could obtain the investment capital needed to
lift our Internet sites to a whole new plateau of capability.
The truth is that our 18 months in the trenches has taught us
just how difficult it will be for companies to benefit from utilizing
the Internet for electronic marketing. We created solid first
generation malls better than all but a few alternative sites (Time
Magazine, Success Magazine, Gelormine's The Internet Marketing
Black Book and others have chosen us as an example of what is
being done right). In spite of our pride of accomplishment we
now know that our very robust, very specific model of what it
will take to generate future success for our client companies
requires a much increased level of investment from both ourselves
and our customers. We could not encourage our client companies
to invest further sums under the status quo. We decided CyberMalls(tm)
would be as good as or better than any site in the world or we
would be prepared to close. Without the needed influx of investment
capital, we will have put ourselves out of business by this choice."
<P>
"Cybersplat is never pretty" continued Frost, &quot;but
you will be seeing a lot of it. We hope not to become a notable
smudge on the proverbial information superhighway, but effective
immediately we are suspending all activities and have laid off
all employees until our status is resolved. Our sites at URL:
http://www.cybermalls.com remain open as of today."
<P>
Frost, who notes that his mismanagement contributed to the crisis,
is exploring a book contract (working title: CyberSuccess/CyberDistress
- Internet Based Electronic Commerce) detailing the lessons learned
participating in the electronic marketing efforts of the 70 plus
client firms. Says Frost, "if we can not continue to propel
the efforts of these companies directly, perhaps we can spread
our knowledge by sharing the details of our extensive electronic
marketing models. From our experience, not many people have seen
the light yet,"; he added.<HR>

<P>
For further information contact Jeffrey C. Frost at 802-655-7611
or jfrost@cybermalls.com. Alternate contact points will be 802-
860-7583 and HSVG34A@prodigy.com.

<p>
<i>Top Practitioners to Meet in NYC to Set Technology
Agenda for Doing Business on the Internet
</I>
<p>
Berkeley, CA (June 12, 1995)--Everybody wants to do business on the Internet,
yet relatively few companies actually are.  Why not?
<p>
The USENIX Association will gather leading technologists, business folks, and
practitioners of electronic commerce to debate and discuss the issues at this
by-invitation-only workshop to be held at the Sheraton New York Hotel and Towers
on July 11-12, 1995
<p>
What new technology is coming down the road?  What are the legal issues?  How do
you receive payment?  How do you secure your network?  Who are the buyers?  How
will the World Wide Web be improved and extended?  During refereed paper
presentations, panels and working groups, workshop attendees hope to answer
these important questions and help set the technical direction for the future.
<p>
Daniel Schutzer of Citibank will give the keynote address "Electronic Banking
and Electronic Commerce on the SuperInformation Highway."  Jay M. Tenenbaum,
Founder and CEO of EIT, and Chairman of CommerceNet's Board of Directors, will
also speak.
<p>
Following on July 13-14, 1995, will be the USENIX Association's Electronic
Commerce Tutorial Program, also at the Sheraton New York Hotel and Towers.  The
Tutorial Program will allow dissemination of  information to the security
specialists and managers; technical staff and managers; and system and network
administrators expected to implement electronic commerce systems for their
companies.  
<p>
Since 1975 the USENIX Association has has served as a focal point for the
community of engineers, scientists, and technicians working on the cutting edge
of the computing world.  USENIX technical conferences have become the essential
meeting grounds for the presentation and discussion of the most advanced
information on the development.

<blockquote>
What a difference a year makes, and certainly a year on the Internet.  
It's been said that an Internet-year is like a dog-year, having within it the 
development of seven normal human years.
When we published our first issue on
computer and network security, the Internet was an interesting frontier
and those splashy IPOs of Internet companies had not yet begun.
Now here midway through 1996, it has become a ubiquitous communication
channel.  In the US, for 
example, a URL is as essential for many businesses as a toll-free 800 
phone number.
In the last twelve months,
the first wave of businesses, entrepreneurs, professionals, and consumers has 
adopted the networked desktop computer as an information
appliance.
<p>
Computer and network security used to be problems for large or specialized
organizations and the provenance of technical professionals
steeped in lore and arcana.
Now there are many network users who do not have the advantage of these
resources and must practise safe networking and know how to 
protect themselves.
<!p>
Likewise, our first issue of Netsurfer Focus
on computer and network security largely addressed the
concerns of system administrators.  In this issue, we will continue
to bring you new developments in these areas.  In addition, we
will touch upon problems of concern to small business and home users alike.
For new readers who are interested in the topic, we highly recommend
you also visit the revised edition of our first annual issue on
Computer and Network Security.

<blockquote>
You are connected to a network.  Every click of your mouse can take you to
into the unknown.  Do you know where you are going?  Do you know what
will happen there?
<p>
The original application of the World Wide Web was perfectly
safe.  You download text and graphics, the browser interprets and displays them, and
you can always view the source code the browser interpreted.
There is no hiding behind secret files or obscure binary code that only
a trained programmer or a computer can read.
Although you may not know much about the web site you are visiting and
whether you can trust it or not, the content you get does not do anything
to your computer system.
<p>
But along came the downloadable plug-ins, Java applets, Javascripts scripts,
and ActiveX controls.
Each is a piece of software that runs on your system and has varying
capabilities to modify the local software and hardware.
Clicking on a hotlink to a file of a special mime-type can cause a plug-in to
run, but at least you have to have the plug-in and to click on the link.
Java and Javascript are more insidious because support
comes with popular browsers, and applets and scripts
run immediately when the page has been downloaded.  Although the language
designers have taken pains to make Java and Javascript safe,
problems are still being identified.
ActiveX controls, on the other hand, have much greater access to your
PC system, and being newer to the Net, has had less time for its potential
flaws to be discovered.
<p>
The trick is to not let any unknown code, no matter where it is from,
run on your computer without strong precautions.
If you have not disabled these features in your browser, every time you 
click on the URL of a web page, you are potentially allowing code
that you might not even know is on the page run on your computer.
Unlike a BBS download or even an e-mail attachment, there is no
separate and conscious step to run an executable.  The first click of your
mouse is the crucial one.
<p>
When the Web first started, those who had heard about viruses were
wary, and we were able to reassure them that it was perfectly safe
to point and click.  Now that we have trained the world
to think that it is safe to point and click and surf the Net, we need
to bring the precautions back.

<blockquote>
Judging by the industry response, Java is proving to be a potent brew.
Its strength comes from being a programming language that does most of
the "right" things by modern programming standards; or as Sun Microsystems
itself describes it, Java is fully buzzword-compliant.
The security challenge comes when we rely on it to run, sight unseen, 
applets from the four corners of the earth.
<p>
To keep applets from running amok in the system, a browser that
supports Java constrains them to  a "sandbox".
By definition, this sandbox includes only access to the screen and computing 
power of the client computer, and connection to the host computer from 
which the applet came.  It usually cannot get to your local file system,
and it cannot get to other computers on the network.
<p>
But as we gain experience with Java, we are finding sins of both commission and
omission. A number of design and implementation bugs have 
been reported and quickly fixed.  Among other things, these allowed attacks 
on computers behind firewalls, and also attacks that seem to come from an unwary
and innocuous third party.  
More bugs will doubtlessly be discovered and remedied 
with new releases and continued scrutiny.  
Other problems that come up are part of the nature of the beast.
For example, while applets may stay in the sandbox, they
can raise quite a ruckus and do each other harm in the process.
These "hostile applets" are able to 
lock up your screen, crash the browser, sabotage or kill other applets, try and
steal your password by putting up a login screen and asking you to enter
your password,
or simply siphon off system resources to work on computational problems
and report the results to the originating server.
There are currently no way to control these types of applets except
to restart the browser or the computer.
<p>
The Internet is not always a safe place, but there is no point
in throwing out the Java with the grounds.
Turn off Java support in your browser while visiting
sites you do not trust, and use up-to-date versions of browsers and
Java development kits to get the latest fixes.
With the prevalence of applet-sharing on the Net, the possibility of popular
applets (such as the ticker tape) being turned into Trojan horses
is also very real.  So it is equally important not to use or post any applets 
to your web site unless you know exactly what it does.

Javascript, not to be confused with Java, is a scripting language supported
by the Netscape browsers to improve the interactivity of HTML pages.
While Java applets can get at each other, Javascript code has access to
your computer and what you do within the browser.  Instead of stealing
resources a la applets, the bugs that have been found tend to violate the privacy of
your system.
Malicious Javascript code can track the history of your websurfing,
read your files and file directory listings, and send all the
information back to the server from which it originated.
Most of these problems have been fixed as of this writing but continued
scrutiny may reveal new ones.  So the same precautions that are used for Java
applies to Javascript also.

Programs such as Microsoft Word have a macro language that can modify
program behaviour and enable greater functionality.  If macros are
carried along in the same file as the data, then the program is
susceptible to macro viruses.  Whether you are downloading the file
through FTP or the Web, the data file is not as innocuous at it seems.
And actually, you don't even have to go to the trouble of downloading 
the file containing a
macro gone bad.  E-mail will take care of it for you just fine.  
Safely ensconced
in the protective sheath of a MIME attachment, the lethal payload is 
carried through the firewall and only released
when you open the file.  
Likewise, someone can also send you an infected program as an e-mail
attachment.
The old sneakernet viruses have turned into netsurfing jetsetters, and their
geographic spread has escalated through use of the Internet.
<p>
In each case, the culprit comes through intervening firewalls unscathed.
But of course nothing stands still in the spy-versus-spy world of
computer security.  In the last few months, a number of firewall-based
virus-scanners have been announced.  These will usually check e-mail 
attachments and Web and FTP downloads into your organization for potential

<I>The fly in the parlor ... with the chainsaw</I> 
<p>

<blockquote>
As computers reach across the ether and interconnect to one another,
regardless of whether they are browser clients or servers, 
they take on a certain amount of risk.  In addition to the basic dangers
of being a computer on the Net and being hacked, the World Wide Web
brings them new and wonderful hazards.  
<p>
Java and Javascript abuse at malicious web sites 
and virus-infected content can cause problems.  But they are not the
sole villains in the drama.  As part of the http protocol,
the browser gives out a great deal of information about you to the
server.  The "cookie" mechanism can be used to closely track and
record your activities on any given site - just like going into a store
and having every movement you make recorded filmed for use and analysis.
<p>
But the web server is not always the evil spider inviting the fly to step into
its parlor.  Sometimes the fly comes in armed with a chainsaw, and not always
by the front door.  The web server equally faces all the hazards of connection,
without many of the protections of the underlying operating system.  
For example, you may restrict access to members
only, and use the web server's user ID and password mechanism.  First of all, 
an attacker can make repeated attempts to guess the password - the server does not
shut him down after the third try as do many operating systems.  In addition,
the password is not strongly encrypted as it traverses the Net, but
traverse the Net it does.  To increase the odds of capture and discovery,
user name and password are sent not once but each time any protected
document is accessed.
<p>
CGI scripts, those solid workhorses of interactive web pages, are programs running
on your server computer, and therefore potentially large security holes.  How, you might
ask; well myriad are the ways.  Suffice it be said that the first law is never
to trust user input.  An innocent but unexpectedly large input that overwrites
part of system memory has been the downfall
of many a program.  And given the fact that these scripts frequently work
with system commands (such as 'remove all files'), they are attractive targets
that can cause disproportionate damage. 
<p>
And last but not least, the friendly, helpful robots that scuttle across the Web
indexing all pages in their path do not discriminate against files you did
not plan for the world to see.  Carelessly managed sites have had their password
and system configuration files scooped into massive Web index databases, waving
the red flag of a vulnerable site under the nose of potential hackers.
Exposure of other files is a lesser risk, but do you really want to share all
your organization's secrets with all of cyberspace?

In addition to the web page traps and viruses that snare unwary netsurfers,
the Net ecosystem is also home to a growing host of robots, agents, 
spiders, worms, ants, and other creatures.  Speaking the language of HTTP
and other network protocols, these are basically small programs that traverse the
Net for a variety of purposes.  The best known are the spiders that
index Net resources for public and private use.
Alta Vista, Infoseek, and Lycos are a few that come to mind.  Others
help webmasters manage their sites, checking for and pruning away 
defunct hotlinks.  Newer programs can help you harvest Net resources,
look for updated
pages, download entire sites while you sleep, or even shop for bargains.
In the brave new world, intelligent agents will not just bring you information,
but become active in
coordinating schedules, executing transactions, and performing other tasks
at your behest.
<p>
These programs or robots can have intended and unintended effects
on the network and web sites they traverse.  Overeager spiders have overwhelmed
web sites by requesting too many documents too rapidly.  
As described elsewhere, they can also ferret out information that a careless
system administrator leaves accessible on his disk.
Efforts are under way to create formal Internet standards of behaviour for 
web robots.  The current version, the Robot Exclusion Standard, allows
site administrators to place a 'robot.txt' file on their web indicating where
robots should not go.  For example, a large archive of bitmap images
would be useless to a robot that is trying to index HTML pages.  
Serving these files to the robot is a needless use of net resources;
however, they need to remain accessible to a human with a browser or FTP.
The standard is a voluntary one for the moment, and an etiquette
is evolving for robot developers as experience is gained with their deployment.

We have few qualms about installing shrink-wrapped software

it carries a brand name we trust.  These days we extend trust to
Net sites that we visit.  The momentum behind using digital signatures 
to show that a message or a piece of software actually came from the
person or organization that we trust is growing.  The Java API including
signed applets will be available in Q3 of 96, and Microsoft is spearheading
a code signing proposal.  So in the not-too-distant future,
we should be able to enforce greater security and functionality by
verifying content, robots, applets, and transactions through the signature
on the digital ID card.  
ID card providers (certificate authorities) are appearing, and

<blockquote>
The Internet is one big party line where packets of information bounce hither-thither
from source to destination, free to spend a night or a lifetime with some random computer
somewhere along the way.  But as a public thoroughfare, it has great cost advantages
compared to private networks from stringing your own wire.
So how do you have the best of both worlds of low cost and privacy?
Although some large scale network providers such as MCI can provide a facsimile of
private lines by routing your traffic entirely over network segments that it manages, the
trend has been to more control over your own destiny 
through virtual private networks (VPNs).
<p>

And the party line on privatizing the party line?  IP level encryption.
Sender to recipient, end-to-end encryption of information being 
transmitted across the Internet means that
stray packets are unintelligible to anyone but the intended recipient.
Encryption at the IP level of the Internet protocol stack also allows easy support
of different application protocols such as HTTP, FTP, and Telnet, on a variety
of underlying network technology such as Ethernet, Frame Relay, or ATM.
<p>
Products that secure the communications between designated sites in 
your private network on the Internet are springing up like mushrooms after a rain.
They can be software-only, such as Digital Equipment's Internet Tunnel, or
hardware-based, as NetFortress from Digital Secure Networks Technology.  The
SunScreen solution from Sun Microsystems provides firewall and cryptographic key 
clearinghouse services as well as the basic site-to-site encryption.
These solutions work well for organizations that must secure communications
between different facilities.
The Security Middleware products from Virtual Online Network Environments
use smartcard authentication to verify individual users rather than
host computers.  This product, if deployed by Internet Service Providers, would allow
even small Mom-and-Pop outfits to have affordable private networks.  
And on the large 
enterprise side of the story, an industry coalition is forming to enable
secure wide area networks (S/WAN) through encryption and key management standards.

Glorious sunrise on the range.  The entrance to the E-COM corral, Marlboro
Man look-alikes hoist the corral's new brand over the gates.
Bold, wrought iron letters, SET.  The crowds cheer and applaud.
Suddenly, a lone cowboy in black with a gold belt buckle
rides up with six shooters blazing.  The natives
shoot back and give chase.  Exit, stage left.  The scene continues
undisturbed.
<p>
By late 1995, Netscape's SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) had won the standards race for 
secured transmission of content (read credit card numbers)
across the Net.
Commerce on the Internet received a crucial boost in early 1996 when leading
credit card associations Visa and Mastercard finally set aside their differences
and competing standards (STT and SEPP) in favour of a common specification,
SET (Secure Electronic Transaction).  This specification enables the other aspects
of a credit card transaction, e.g., authorization of the charges,
to occur online, not just the transmission of card number information.
<p>
Then First Virtual Holdings announced the identification of a major flaw
in the use of software-based encryption of credit card numbers: keystroke
capture at the client desktop.  Their point is that
if someone has managed to gain control of
your computer to monitor your keystrokes, he can capture your credit card
number and no amount of encryption for transmission will help protect you.
With the interconnectivity of the net and the ease of downloading
a hostile applet, the vulnerability of the desktop computer cannot be
overemphasized, particularly for those new to computer and network
security issues.
However the hyperbolic press releases on a topic well known to security experts, 
combined with the fact that First Virtual
offers electronic commerce through a mechanism without the use of
encryption has led to a flurry of responses ranging from supportive to
outraged.
<p>
As of this writing, the tempest has subsided to the bottom of the virtual teacup
and electronic commerce marches on.

<blockquote>
Large scale search sites are invaluable to many netizens.
For example, with the growth of the Net in the past year,
publishing Netsurfer Focus would be too painful
to contemplate without access to sites such as Alta Vista*.
The corollary is that with these high powered spiders,
every utterance on the Net, be it on a web page or a newsgroup,
may be a matter of public record that above all else
<b>can be readily found</b>.
<p>
The story of your online life,
whether you are a frequent poster to 'alt.sex.binaries' or
'sci.crypt' (hello, potential employer!), 
or your personal web page showing three beautiful children,
a dog named Jimmy, and a house far beyond your 20K$ a year salary 
(hello, IRS!) can be there for all who cares to see.
And then there are the large online directories.  Coming
hard on the heels of the info-preneurs that have set up directory
sites, the phone companies are rushing online with their
multi-million listing offerings.
Privacy issues become intertwined with physical security because it
has become so easy to identify and physically locate you,
your beliefs and habits, and your computer.

<blockquote>
As computers move into the home, security takes on new dimensions.
Beyond the hard assets of your computer, and the soft assets of your data,
you need to think about protecting your family and especially children.
Bringing access to the cyberworld to your desktop means exactly that, and we
all know there are parts of the world, real or cyber, that you don't want to
take the kids.  
<p>
A number of companies have sprung up to help you avoid the back alleys and 
redlight districts of the Net.  Software such as SurfWatch or NetNanny
block access to known sites where offensive
material are available, or to any site that you deem inappropriate.
The sites that are blocked vary from package to package.  Some include on their
verboten-list not just pornography but web resources about homosexuality, 
or feminism, or anything that does not promote "family values".  Yet other packages 
can log all the surfing activities, enabling Orwellian possibilities right
in your own home.  In sum, they are tools that do not excuse us
from our responsibilities to decide what is appropriate in our households.
<p>
In addition to the reviewer-based systems, another development that will facilitate 
appropriate surfing is some widespread form of labelling or self-labelling.
Just like the "PG", "R", and "X" movie ratings in the US, labelling provides
a more standardized way to assess the content of a web site.
The PICS (Platform for Internet Content Selection) standard is a technical
specification for how to label Net content.  It is developed by the World Wide Web
consortium and can be used to implement any rating system.  
Currently, there is much industry momentum
behind RSACi, the Recreational Software Advisory
Council Internet rating system.  This is an extension of the rating system for computer
games, and has been endorsed by major online
services.  Most of the leading blocking products do or will support RSACi.

<b>Reach out and hack someone</b><p>
A year ago, an enterprising cryptographer named Hal Finney issued a challenge
to his colleagues to crack the encryption on an SSL (Netscape's
Secure Sockets Layer) transmission.  Appropriately for Internet time, 
not one, but two independent successes turned up within a month.
This was the start of a series of black-hat testing of net software
by cryptography and security aficionados across the Internet community. 
Rooted in the belief that strength of security solutions comes from careful 
scrutiny and not obscurity, expert volunteers continue to probe and pummel
away.  Ongoing efforts include a series of challenges issued by 
Internet service provider Community ConneXion.  The reward?  The archetypical
programmer's notch - a t-shirt.

<b>The Tracker Industry</b>
<p>
Hacker Shimomura turned tracker when cracker Mitnick reputedly broke into
Shimomura's computer around Christmas, 1994.
Since then, the event has turned into a mini-industry of its own with not 
one or two, but three books written about the incident.
A web site was also created to promote "Takedown", Shimomura's book.
This time, however, crackers had the last laugh when they hi-jacked the URL
for the Takedown site by forging a change-of-address e-mail message to address
keepers at the Internet Network Information Center.
We can be assured of future pranks and publicity stunts as the movie
rights are sold and the cameras begin to roll.

<p>
In February, the US State Department announced an
amendment to the International Traffic in Arms Regulation (ITAR) allowing
U.S. persons to temporarily export cryptographic products for personal use
without the need for an export license (aka the 'Matt Blaze exemption').  
However, US cryptographers and
their allies continue their campaign for the availability and export of strong
(>40 bit key) cryptography.  
The software industry is clearly concerned about their inability to compete 
in the international markets with the current export controls.
IBM-Lotus struck a compromise with the government by giving it
exclusive access to 24 bits in the 64 bit key used in Lotus Notes Release 4.
RSA went the other way and located a development center
in Japan.  This allows RSA to provide identical encryption technologies outside of the
US without tripping over ITAR.  
On the heels of the successful challenge to the Communications Decency
Act, an industry coalition to lobby Washington
is also forming.

<I>Editor's Introduction</I> 
<! ---------------------------------------------------------------->

<P>
Welcome to Netsurfer Focus! In putting together Netsurfer Digest
we have discovered that sometimes a topic deserves more attention
and depth than can be provided in the Digest. Netsurfer Focus
is designed to address these topics. Each issue focuses on a single
topic, and issues are published on a periodic basis. Like the Digest,
issues are sent out via e-mail and placed at our World Wide Web
site. In addition, the issues are supplemented by a comprehensive database
of resources at our web site. This two-tiered approach allows
us to give the big picture for general readers and provide detailed
resources for the experts.
<P>
Netsurfer Focus departs from the Digest format that you love and
support. But we hope that it delivers the same useful and
entertaining values of our More Signal, Less Noise
promise. Please let us know what you think by writing to 
<a href="mailto:focus@netsurf.com">focus@netsurf.com</a>.
Your input will help us shape future issues of the Focus.<p>

<I>The three tradeoffs</I> 
<! ---------------------------------------------------------------->
 
<p>
Life is full of tradeoffs and computer security is no different.
<OL>
<LI>The only safe computer is a dead computer. Or at least a disconnected
one. If no one can get to it, no one can harm it. The only problem
is, it's not exactly useful in that state. So the extent of computer
safety or security is always a tradeoff between putting the computer
to use and restricting its misuse and abuse.
<LI>The time and money you spend on securing
your computer has to be weighed against the likely loss if it is broken into or
damaged; e.g., you're not likely to keep your garbage under lock
and key.
<LI> The cracker likewise has a cost-benefit tradeoff.  It's unlikely that
someone will break into Fort Knox for a box of wheaties. So a modicum of good housekeeping
can serve as an effective deterrent against the doorknob rattlers and window breakers.
</OL>

<P>
As you design or modify your computer and network
security, think about how you want to use your systems and what
you stand to lose if security is compromised. This will help guide your
choice of solutions and their relative complexity and costs.
<p>

<A NAME="sc3"></A><font=+1><b>GOOD HOUSEKEEPING</b></font>
<hr>
<I>Or, more things come in threes</I> 
<! ---------------------------------------------------------------->
 
<P>
All systems consist of three components, the software and hardware parts, the people,
and the procedures. The same is true of computer and network systems.
Securing your computer system means security of the software and
hardware, trustworthiness of the people who use and manage it, and reliability of the procedures for using and managing the system.
In this issue, we will mainly focus on secure
software and system management practices. But when you are evaluating
the security of your system, don't forget to consider the other
components.
<P>
And while we are talking about threesomes, remember that there
are three kinds of threats to your system: malice, ignorance,
and acts of god or nature. A malfunctioning sprinkler system in
the computer room, a magnitude 6.0 earthquake, a disgruntled employee,
or a misguided big cheese can do equal amounts of damage. Think
through each of the components, the what-if scenarios, the technical
and non-technical solutions, and the cost-benefit tradeoffs. Also, don't
count on your computer to come out of the box with its security mechanisms
set up correctly for you. They aren't always that way.
<P>
The bottom line: It really is housekeeping, and it really is up
to you what kind of a computer house you keep.

<P>
The whole idea of security is tied to who can have access to what.
You prove who you are by providing a secret password. The cave
doors magically open and you get to the jewels: you can read and
write file, run programs, allow other users access to your files
and computers, and so on. Multiuser computer systems, like Unix, usually
have a hierarchy of personages, each with different access privileges.
If you prove you are the Grand Vizier (a.k.a. root), you can basically
do whatever you want - wipe out entire disks of files, change
how the system is set up, and maybe even launch a frog battalion
against Upper Timbuktu. However, even the lowliest courtier can let
intruders in, setting off a chain of intrigue and skullduggery
of who does what to whom.
<P>
So the first line of defense is secure passwords. The second is
to make sure that only selected people have access to the powerful
files and tools.

<I>Twisty passages all connected to each other</I> 
<! ---------------------------------------------------------------->
 
<P>
Now, connect your single computer to other computers, through
phone lines, a local network, or the Internet. The plot
thickens. An intruder doesn't even have to be physically near
your computer. Through the magic of telecommunications, they are
only a handshake or two away. At this point, to make things worse,
not only can people try to pretend they are you, computers can
also pretend they are your computers (known in the vernacular
as spoofing). And oh, by the way, about the telecommunications
- it's a party line. On the way from your computer to some other
computer, anyone can use a sniffer program to tap
in and listen to what you are saying.
<P>
Before you hide your computer under the bed, remember our friends,
the tradeoffs. Think through the system components and the risks
methodically and logically. You've done the basic good housekeeping
on each computer. Minimize your risk by making only one of them
publically available and hiding the rest behind a secure barrier
or firewall. Then focus on the exposed gateway computer and make
it as secure as you can from potential intruders. Monitor it for
intruders. And make sure you don't transmit secret information
- like your password - over the Internet without protection.

You want to make sure of the basics: that the passwords on your system are
secure and hard to break, that only the right people have write access
to system files and programs, and that no one has modified the
files without your knowledge.  A log of who has been active on your system
is also helpful for monitoring usage and documenting malfeasance.
Here are some useful readings and a list of
(free) tools that will help you get started on protecting
your system.

<P>
Every computer is a potential host of vulnerabilities. The more
accessible it is, the more it is susceptible to attack. Connecting
to a network such as the Internet makes it potentially accessible
to everyone on the network. We want the advantages of Internet
access, but we also need to limit our exposure to intruders. The
solution is often the installation of a firewall, so that only
selected "gateways"  have access to the outside world.
<p>
The "gateway", either a computer or a router,
stands guard over your network, rejecting all incoming traffic
not directed to itself, and selectively forwarding communications such as
mail between the inside and outside networks.
A proxy server is a program that mediates application-specific traffic, e.g., ftp,
through the firewall, making secure access less cumbersome.  
It usually has additional logging, user authentication, and protocol-specific
security capabilities.
<P>
The computer firewall industry has become a hotbed of growth with
the increasing popularity of the Internet. You can build your own from free
software toolkits, purchase hardware and/or software solutions from a vendor,
or engage consultants who will implement a custom solution. Hardware
solutions include both Intel x86 boxes running Unix and network routers that
support intelligent packet filtering.
Another option is to use an Internet
Service Provider who provides the firewall and gateway service
between your network and the Internet. Whatever approach you choose,
protecting the exposed gateway is of primary importance, and a later
section on Satan suggests some tools that can be used.

<I>The three-headed hound from hell</I> 
<! ---------------------------------------------------------------->
 
<P>
You've protected your systems from external threats with a firewall,
but what happens when you cannot trust everyone in your own organization?
You may have confidential data to send, e.g., personnel records,
or you may just need to login to another host in your network.
This is particularly true in the academic environment. MIT considered
this problem back in the 80's and came up with the Kerberos package.
This is an authentication system that uses cryptography to protect
passwords and other sensitive information in network traffic.
<P>
Kerberos relies on the security of a central authentication server, i.e., a single
point of failure.  Every network program, such as remote login, that wants to 
use its authentication 
and encryption capabilities must be modified to include Kerberos code directly.
A third significant limitation is that Kerberos uses Data Encryption
Standard (DES) to encrypt its information. Codebreaking played a key
role in the success of the Allied Forces during World War II.  As a result, certain
forms of cryptography are still classified as Munitions
by the US Government, subjecting them to International Traffic in Arms
Regulations (ITAR).
What this means is that special export licensing from the US State
Department may be required to take Kerberos software out of the
country, even if it is only an ftp download.

<hr>
<I>Where's the beef?</I> 
<! ---------------------------------------------------------------->

<P>
April 5th has come and passed. Satan was released to the Internet
on schedule and the networked world as we know it has not collapsed
in an apocalypse of security incidents.
<P>
Satan, short for Security Administrator Tool for Analyzing Networks,
is a set of tools that probes remote computers on the Internet
for known vulnerabilities. It is not the first of its kind; tools
that check host computers for well-known vulnerabilities in ftp,
tftp, and sendmail have been available for several years. These
include public and commercial versions of the Internet Security
Scanner (ISS), PINGWARE (commercial only), and the Security Profile
Inspector (SPI) which is currently available only to the Departments
of Energy and Defense. What is different about Satan is that it is widely
available and has an HTML-based interface. This allows users to
probe networks with point-and-click ease through a World Wide
Web browser. In addition, Satan also provides extensive documentation
on the vulnerabilities being identified and how to repair them.
<P>
Satan can be used by the system administrator to test local security,
or it can be used by crackers to look for weaknesses in a potential
victim. The risk to a system decreases with good security practices.
Use Satan first to uncover and repair any additional vulnerabilities
before a cracker can discover them. To help system administrators
detect when their systems may be under scrutiny from a rogue copy
of Satan, CIAC has developed Courtney, a program to
monitor and report on any network activity that resembles a Satan
probe.
<P>
As security experts and system administrators use Satan on different
systems, its strengths and weaknesses are being characterized.
A security hole was quickly discovered for host machines running Satan. 
Version 1.1 introduced a new and different hole, and now Version 1.2 
is expected shortly.  Although the initial noise about Satan's release
may look like hype or hysteria in retrospect, there's no reason
to let down your guard. Crackers may simply be lurking until the
scrutiny dies down; they now have one more powerful tool in their
black bag.

<P>
It was the best of times with the dreams of online commerce roaring
across the Global Information Superhighway. It was the worst of
times when it was pointed out that the Internet is one giant party
line. Confidential information such as credit card numbers can
easily be captured between sender and receiver. The techies rushed
in with a variety of secure implementations of electronic commerce,
and when the dust settled, two contenders for standardization were left.
<P>
On one side was Netscape Communications, with their
Secure Sockets Layer (SSL).  SSL is an additional layer
between the application and TCP/IP connection layers
in the network protocol stack.
On the other side, CommerceNet, a
non-profit consortium of companies and organizations established to create
an electronic marketplace on the Internet, weighed in with Secure-HTTP (S-HTTP).
S-HTTP is an application level "meta-protocol" that allows web applications
to negotiate the protocols of encryption and authentication to
be used with the documents being exchanged. Both sides lined up
major commercial supporters, submitted proposals to various standard
bodies such as the World Wide Web Consortium, created reference
implementations, and took gentle potshots at the other side.
<P>
Was this shaping up to be another VHS versus Beta battle in the
search for a common security standard for online commerce? Fortunately,
saner heads prevailed. Rather than sow mass confusion and delay
market development, Netscape joined forces with heavyweights IBM,
America Online, and H&amp;R Block (owner of CompuServe), and
purchased a controlling interest in Terisa Systems, Inc., tasking
it with the responsibility of combining the two rival standards.
The Open Security Platform toolkit is expected in
June of 1995. Terisa Systems, of course, is a joint venture between
cryptography vendor RSA Data Security, and
Enterprise Integration Technology, Internet consultants and
the project manager for CommerceNet.

<P>
A hacker is a person who is intensely interested in how complex
systems, in particular computer systems, work. A cracker extends
this interest to unauthorized entry and modification of these
systems. The term hacker has also been used synonymously with
cracker, much to the dismay of hackers who are sometimes called
on to detect, repair, and prevent future damage by crackers. Phrack
is an electronic magazine in publication since 1985 and dedicated
to providing information on operating systems, networking technologies,
telephony, and news of the international computer underground.
Varied topics such as lock picking and construction of acetyline
bombs have also been covered in their philes. The
uebercracker is a cracker of superior skill, and is very hard
to keep out of your systems. Phone phreaks have a fascination
with telephone systems. There is no special meaning to the word
spy in computer security, but you can be an international arms
courier...

<P>
Spring is here! (At least for those of us in the Northern Hemisphere.)
There are times when even the most dedicated Netsurfer wants to
get away from our computer screens and sit out in the garden with
a good book. Here is our selection on the topic of Computer Security
for your consideration.
<P>
<B>General:</B> 
<UL>
<LI>Cyberpunk: Outlaws and Hackers on the Computer Frontier,
Katie Hafner and John Markoff, Simon &amp; Schuster, 1991.
<LI>The Cuckoo's Egg. Clifford Stoll, Doubleday, 1989.
<LI>The Hacker Crackdown, Bruce Sterling, Bantam,
1992.
</UL>

<P>
<B>Technical:</B> 
<UL>
<LI>Practical Unix Security, Simson Garfinkel and
Gene Spafford, O'Reilly &amp; Associates, 1991.
<LI>Unix Systems Security: A Guide to Users and System Administrators,
David A. Curry, Addision-Wesley, 1992.
</UL>
<P>
But remember, just as with computer security, it's up to you to
take care of yourself. So wear a hat and suncreen.

In talking about computer security, we have barely scratched the surface of cryptography and have not yet touched the thorny issues of privacy and the law.  
At the same time, while the Open Security Platform is still
months away, commercial and financial transactions are already taking place over the Internet. Electronic cheque- and cash-equivalents are also being developed.
Here's a selection of links to whet your appetite for the upcoming Netsurfer Focus issues on cryptography and online commerce.

<!I God is in the details /I> 

<p>

Since the publication of the original issue of 
Netsurfer Focus on Computer and Network Security over a year ago, we have
received a lot of support and encouragement from our readers.  
In addition to a steady stream of visitors to the web page,
over 300 other sites have also provided links and redistribution.
<p>
At the same time, there has been tremendous development in both
network security and in the Web itself.  Existing technologies
have evolved, e.g., SSL looks like a
winner in the protocol battle.  New technologies and products
have appeared, e.g., the enormous interest in Java despite
its associated security challenges.  And web sites and pages appear, 
disappear, and rearrange themselves.
<p>
In recognition of your interest and support we are updating our 
materials as follows.

<ul>
<li>The original issue (v.1 no.1) has been replaced with a revised
edition.  This new edition is located at the same URL, 
<a href="http://www.netsurf.com/nsf/v01/01/nsf.01.01.html">
http://www.netsurf.com/nsf/v01/01/nsf.01.01.html</a>, so that
existing links now point to the most up-to-date information.
The revisions include:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Wherever possible, URLs that have disappeared or moved 
have been replaced.
<br>
URLs that cannot be replaced are left in the body of the text without 
a hotlink.
<p>
<li>Hot links to new developments in a story, e.g., the January 96 decision 
not to prosecute
PGP creator Phil Zimmermann, are provided.  Sometimes there is enough
to justify an update section. 
Links to these sections are also marked
with an
<img src="update.gif" alt="Updated">
tag.
</ul>
<p>

<li>A new issue of Netsurfer Focus on Computer and Network Security
(v2. no.2) has been published.
This issue covers new topics that have developed in the last year.
It is located at
<a href="http://www.netsurf.com/nsf/v02/02/nsf.02.02.html">
http://www.netsurf.com/nsf/v02/02/nsf.02.02.html</a>.

<A NAME="AB"><B>Arthur Bebak</B></A> - President and Publisher
<P>
Longer ago than he cares to remember Arthur was educated at the
University of Illinois where he picked up a degree in Computer
Engineering on a fencing scholarship (go figure). Fleeing the Illinois
weather for sunnier climes, he wound up in California designing
mainframes and doing heavy duty project management for Amdahl
Corporation.  He studied business administration at Golden Gate
University and kept a keen eye on the evolution of cyberspace until it
had matured to the point where it could support a business.  Today he
helms Netsurfer Communications and uses his considerable and hard won
experience to consult on matters of cyberspace. Arthur is also the
accidental co-author of <A HREF="http://www.netsurf.com/cwpfd/">
Creating Web Pages For Dummies</A>.

<P>
<A NAME="SM"><B>Sun Ming Lieu</B></A> - Vice President and Publisher
<P>
Sun Ming Lieu does editing and consults on operational matters for
Netsurfer Communications, Inc.  Ms. Lieu has been starting and building
organizations involved in leading edge technologies since 1986.  She has
held a number of management positions in top-of-the-field companies
including Hewlett-Packard and Wind River Systems.  Prior to joining
Netsurfer Communications, Ms. Lieu was Vice President of Engineering at
Cygnus Support where she helped pioneer a new business model based on
Free Software and built a distributed organization that worked in close
cooperation with the cream of the Internet software development
community.  Ms. Lieu has a Ph.D. in Biology from McGill University in
Canada and is working towards an M.B.A. at Santa Clara University.

<P>
<A  NAME="BW"><B> Bill Woodcock</B></A> - Production Manager and Netmaster    
<p>
Bill Woodcock is a TCP/IP and AppleTalk <a
href="http://www.zocalo.com/zocalo-engineering/about.html"><b>networking</b></a>
consultant in Berkeley, California.  He's the one who maintains the
hosts that bring Netsurfer publications to you.  Being an engineer by
trade and an artist by education, Bill likes to think of himself as a
dabbler in each, by turns.  He's the author of McGraw-Hill's
<i>Networking the Macintosh</i>, and writes regularly for <i>Network
World</i> and <i>Connections</i>, and occasionally for <i>MacWorld</i>
and <i>MacWEEK</i>.  He sits on the board of the <a href="
ftp://ftp.zocalo.com/pub/docs/anma/text"><b>Apple Network Managers
Association</b></a>, and sits on standards bodies of the AppleTalk
Networking Forum.

<P>
<A NAME="LNS"><B>Lisa Nichols</B></A> - Marketing Consultant  
<P>
Lisa Nichols has been in marketing and sales since 1983 and a consultant
with her own business, Nichols & Sense, since 1991.  Ms. Nichols assists
Netsurfer Communications in developing marketing and sales strategies
and writing promotional materials.

<P>
<A NAME="LN"><B>Lawrence Nyveen</B></A> - Editor, Netsurfer Digest
<P>
Lawrence (usually known as Laurie), was a writer and copy editor with
Netsurfer Digest until tapped for everlasting fame and of all free time as
editor.  He grew up in Montreal, attended Rice University in Houston (B.A.
in biology and anthropology), and soon found himself studying ornithiscian
dinosaurs at Yale.
<P>
One thing led to another, and soon Laurie was walking across the stage,
receiving his grad diploma in journalism from Concordia University in
Montreal.  After a short stint at a real job with Reader's Digest (Canada),
he eventually hooked up with Arthur, who was looking for something he had
to offer.  It was probably the glamour of Reader's Digest.  Either that or
his tie.
<P>
Besides editing NSD, Laurie takes care of his __-month old (b. July 1994)
girl, Elisabeth; serves as DNRC Minister of Adding "ue" to Words That End
in "log; is a sysop in CompuServe's dinosaur forum; writes a column for The
Web magazine in the UK; and does some other freelancy stuff.  He's
responsible for hiring Barnes (q.v.), proof that the judicious purchase of
beer for others can at times be a career-opening opportunity.
<P>
Look for Laurie's home page to appear here soon.  He can be quite the ranter.

design firm, <a href="http://scribble.com/">the scribble company</a>;
and entertains himself with
<a href="http://kzsu.stanford.edu/uwi.html">UnderWorld Industries</a>.
However, he considers himself primarily a <i>mathematician</i>, trapped
in a world of technology.  Jon has naively been called an artist, writer,
poet, thinker, and madman; but, he knows better.  He can often be found
roaming the streets of Portland (Oregon), Ann Arbor, Toronto, or L.A.
There isn't <a href="http://kzsu.stanford.edu/jon.html">much else</a> to
know.

<I>Last Minute Holiday Shopping Ideas From the Netsurfers at Netsurfer Digest</I>
<P>
<H2>Ahh, The Holidays.....</H2>
<P>
You've already got the silver cachepot for Great-Aunt Hilary, the
Wedgewood ashtray for Uncle Reginald, a monogrammed cashmere blanket for
Fifi, and that frilly see-through thing for the upstairs maid.
There's the Miro print for Zazu and Fred, two gallons of 4 alarm hot
sauce for Steve, and three copies of Doom II for Doug, Scott and Bart.

<P>
But what about Grandma Harris? And kindly old Mr. Carruthers down the
street? Your cousin Mary has a new pair of twins this year (again!), and
you really can't go another year without sending Mom and Dad something.
There's also Gregor and Anna and Camille and Pubert and Steve and the other
Steve and, and....And what about your mother-in-law?

<HR>
<H2>Because Last Minute Shopping is Hell</H2>
<P>
That's why we here at

<P>

a great gift and which has information available online you can

Proprietor Steve Kramer says: "I have spent the last 6 years selling foreign,
independent, cult and more to video stores around the country. Now it's
time to bring the weird, the daring and the truly offbeat directly to
those who want it.  We are starting small for a good reason: You'll find
no list of 20,000 or 30,000 films to scroll through here. Instead,
you'll find updates almost every week; plus items of cross-cultural
interest and introductions to new or little known films and genres. We
will reach out to independent filmmakers throughout the country and the
world. Welcome to the Picture Palace."

<p>
The following table shows the results of the Netsurfer Digest Reader 
Survey for the periods June 1994 - May 1995 and November 1995 - June 1996.
We didn't do any fancy statistical analysis, so here are a couple of
trends by the old eyeball method:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Our readership is getting more diverse in terms of age, gender, and 
occupation.
<li>There is a large increase in home use, with concurrent jumps in the
use of Windows, 28k modems, and SLIP/PPP.
Macintoshes, however, took it on the chin with a drop of almost 10 percentage
points.
<li>Online services and BBS's both saw declining use.  CompuServe's fall
behind AOL is reflected in the big drop in CompuServe users among our readers.
<li>Archie and gopher are dying off as web access reaches near-saturation
levels.
<li>Interest in USENET news is giving way to using the Net for investment 
and money management information.
</ul>

<TITLE>Interview with Arthur Bebak</TITLE>
</HEAD> 
<BODY bgcolor=ffffff>
<H1>NETSURFER COMMUNICATIONS AND THE INTERNET</H1> 
<HR>
<I>An Interview with Arthur Bebak - June 1994</I>
<P>
The following is an interview conducted with <B>Arthur Bebak</B>, founder and
president of Netsurfer Communications.
<P>
<I>Q. How did you come up with the idea for Netsurfer Communications?</I>
<P>
<B>AB.</B> I wanted to create a vehicle for exploring this incredible online
space out there called the Internet. I wanted to explore the new
paradigms for conducting business through online interactions. The ways
people communicate and accomplish tasks online were simply not possible
a few years ago. So, my goal was to really get involved in that
environment with Netsurfer Communications. I thought it would be fun and
a good thing to do with my life. (grins) Some profit motive also entered
into it.
<P>
<I>Q. How did you come up with the idea for the Digest?</I>
<P>
<B>AB.</B> One of the things I found to be a problem while hanging out online
was the overwhelming amount of information available. And it's not just
information. It's communication, files, people, bunches of stuff coming
straight at your face in amazing volume.  And I thought - how can one
cut through all that? I created Netsurfer Digest to lessen the amount of
noise people have to deal with. So much of what you have to sift through
is irrelevant. If you read something in a newsgroup, the bulk of it will
generally be of no interest- it's just a bunch of people saying - "me
too", "me too". I wanted to screen that out so that just the stuff that
was substantial remained. I wanted people to know Netsurfer Digest as a
source of substantial and entertaining information as opposed to fluff.
<P>
<I>Q. How do you determine which items make it into the Digest?</I>
<P>
<B>AB.</B> Well, clearly one of our functions here is to be an editor and try
to gauge the tastes of our audience - to be an arbiter of what is
interesting on their behalf. It's a heavy responsibility and we have to
earn their trust, their confidence that we won't waste their time. There
are some things I think most people would agree are not interesting
unless the reader is in some narrow area of specialization - some narrow
scientific, educational, or government field perhaps.  Generally, we try
to go after things that are entertaining and that our audience would
like. Frankly, in the end, it comes down to what I and our writers,
editors, and netsurfers think is interesting. I think we are a fairly
representative sampling of our audiences, and for this reason our
readers trust us to do right by them.
<P>
<I>Q. How do you know that you're hitting the mark?</I>
<P>
<B>AB.</B> Feedback from our readers. We are constantly polling and keeping a
finger on the pulse of our audience. We are getting letters constantly
saying that we seem to be one of the best places to look at as far as
new and interesting sites in cyberspace. So, clearly we are doing
something right. And that's reflected in our growth curve. When we started
our beta test with absolutely no publicity whatsoever we went from 0
to over 2000 E-mail subscribers in a very short period of time - which
is amazing. It's all been through word of mouth.
<P>
<I>Q. How else has the company grown since its inception?</I>
<P>
<B>AB.</B> First of all, the staff has grown quite a bit. We started with four
writers and now have eight. Our marketing staff has grown quite a bit
too. The people who join us are interested and excited by this concept,
by this environment. In terms of services, we are starting to offer
consulting. We're also developing other products in the online
publishing and multimedia venues. So we have certainly grown, but our
focus remains on the Digest for now.
<P>
<I>Q. How would you profile your typical reader?</I>
<P>
<B>AB.</B> I think our typical reader has the same profile as the population of
the Internet in general.  We aren't differentiated enough to appeal to
one specific group - although that will probably happen with some of our
future products. Right now our typical user is overwhelmingly male,
generally college educated, is a technical or business professional, and
has a fairly decent income. We also appeal to newcomers online. I think
the profile will soon change to favor the large online population coming
through commercial online services such as Compuserve and America
Online. It's a question of sheer numbers. Overall one of the things we
have in our favor is that our reader base has very desirable
demographics from the point of view of potential advertisers.
<P>
<I>Q. But do your readers want to be targets of advertising?</I>
<P>
<B>AB.</B> Our readers are not naive, they are sophisticated consumers and
understand that neat things like Netsurfer Digest don't come free. We
have to feed our writers and pay the bills, and it takes money to
develop other neat products. The readers know - and we are very up front
about telling them - that sponsorships and advertising are part of the
deal. As it happens we have what I think is a relatively non-intrusive
model for handling that aspect of the business. If you like our ads,
great, there they are at your fingertips, If not, it's easy to ignore
them. And ultimately, advertising is content and communication which can
be informative and entertaining. It's our job to teach the sponsors that
our readers appreciate creativity and have a low tolerance for hype. If
we succeed everybody wins. The readers get high signal content and
product information, the advertisers get customers, and we get the
capital to develop more cool products.
<P>
<I>Q. You mentioned the new ways of doing business over the Internet. Can you
discuss that further?</I>
<P>
<B>AB.</B> There are several ways the Internet is altering the way business is
done. First of all, it facilitates the dispersal of business functions
and information. You can now have businesses that are widely separated
geographically but can engage in intimate and effective communication
with each other - true virtual corporations, of which Netsurfer
Communications is a perfect example. Secondly, it creates new
opportunities for new types of businesses. There are many products and
services that can exist because of the online environment, and some that
can exist only in the online environment. Some of the impact this new
connectivity has on such traditional fields as publishing are quite
enormous. The delivery mechanism here is essentially free. The economics
of business on the Internet are drastically different than traditional
arenas and I don't think traditional businesses are quite ready to
acknowledge and exploit that yet. Those are some of the issues
Netsurfer Communications would like to address.
<P>
<I>Q. Where do you see your company in 5 years?</I>
<P>
<B>AB.</B> (grins) I'd like us to have one of our products in every mailbox in
the world - that would be my ideal. I see us as a major content provider
and an inevitable filter for the glut of information and junk that is
out there. We're gaining a reputation as a critical and discriminating
voice and a source of reputable content. And I think that is the
ultimate goal of this company.
<P>
<I>Q. Are you having fun?</I>
<P>
<B>AB.</B> Oh, good lord, yes - I'm having fun. There's nothing quite like it.
Partly it's the excitement of starting a new business - it's a
wonderful, frustrating, uplifting, great up/down kind of feeling. The
other part is this industry. It's so full of potential and promise, not
to mention the high weirdness factor. You never get bored.

  <H3><A NAME="FAQ1">1.0 WHERE CAN THIS FAQ BE FOUND? </A> </H3>
<P>
   This information is available via FTP and WWW at: 
<P>
   FTP: <A HREF="ftp://ftp.netsurf.com/pub/nsd/ndfaq.txt">ftp://ftp.netsurf.com/pub/nsd/ndfaq.txt</A> <BR>
   WWW: http://www.netsurf.com/nsd/ndfaq.html<BR>
<P>
  <H3><A NAME="FAQ2">2.0 WHAT IS NETSURFER DIGEST?</A></H3>
  <P>
   Netsurfer Digest is your guide to interesting news, places, and
   resources online. Each week it brings you short, crisp newsbytes,
   notices, and reviews designed to provide an informative and
   entertaining snapshot of the vast wired world. Periodically you can
   also expect to see special longer features, a letters to the editor
   section, and possibly special bulletins about significant breaking
   stories (e.g. imminent death of the Internet).
   <P>
  <H3><A NAME="FAQ3">3.0 HOW MUCH DOES NETSURFER DIGEST COST?</A></H3>
   <P>
   Netsurfer Digest is free. However, we presume our readers are mature
   enough to understand that in the real world of bills and taxes a
   business such as this can't survive without sponsors. Thus you can
   expect to see a trade supplement show up in your mailbox, never more then
   once per week, and no larger then the average issue of the Digest.
   <P>
   The goal is to deliver this material in a non-intrusive and clearly
   marked manner on the assumption that you are interested in who is
   offering what online. Read it at your leisure or delete it, it's part
   of the package and both we and the sponsors will be interested in your
   reaction to it.
   <P>
  <H3><A NAME="FAQ4">4.0 HOW IS NETSURFER DIGEST DELIVERED?</A></H3>
   <P>
   Netsurfer Digest is delivered via E-mail directly to your mailbox. The
   Digest can reach you at any E-mail address which is capable of
   receiving mail from the Internet.
   <P>
   <H3><A NAME="FAQ5">5.0 IN WHAT FORMATS IS NETSURFER DIGEST DELIVERED?</A></H3>
   <P>
   Netsurfer Digest comes in one of two formats, plain ASCII text, or
   HTML formatted text suitable for viewing with any World Wide Web
   browser. The HTML version has live links to all the sites named in the
   text so that with a simple click of a mouse you can connect to the
   site you have just been reading about.
   <P>
   <B>NOTE:</B> You do not have to be connected directly to the Internet in
   order to enjoy the benefits of the HTML version. Any HTML browser,
   such as Mosaic or Lynx, can be used to read Netsurfer Digest in a
   nicely formatted style, much superior to boring old ASCII text.
<P>
   <B>We strongly encourage you to subscribe to the HTML version.</B>
   That way you can take advantage of various neat features we
   are working on for future versions of the digest.
   <P>
 <H3> <A NAME="FAQ6">6.0 HOW DO I READ THE HTML VERSION OF NETSURFER DIGEST?</A></H3>
<P>
   Reading the HTML version of Netsurfer Digest is pretty simple.        
   It may be even simpler if your e-mail reader has the capability
   to handle MIME extensions (see below).
<P>
   All you have to do is to save your e-mail copy into a file with        
   a .html extension (or .htm for DOS and Windows systems). Then        
   simply go into any World Wide Web browser (like Netscape, Mosaic,        
   MacWeb or whatever is your favorite) and load the file. If you        
   are connected directly to the Internet via a SLIP or PPP link        
   you can then read the Digest and follow all the enclosed links        
   with the click of a mouse.        
<P>       
   You may want to remove the e-mail header from the top of your        
   HTML files to make the results look good in your browser. The        
   header is everything above the first HTML line and any text 
   editor will do to snip it off.
<P>       
   Some e-mail readers have capabilities to take advantage of the        
   MIME header entry which we send out in every HTML version of        
   Netsurfer Digest. This is the header field which reads:        
   "Content-Type: text/html". If your e-mail reader can handle
   MIME extensions then you may be able to configure it to
   automatically open your Web browser whenever you want to read
   an HTML e-mail such as Netsurfer Digest. Since there are so many
   e-mail readers out there your best bet is to check the
   documentation, contact customer support, or as a last resort
   ask for advice on USENET.
<P>
 <H3> <A NAME="FAQ7">7.0 HOW DO I SUBSCRIBE TO NETSURFER DIGEST?</A></H3>
<P>
   If you have access to the World Wide Web you can use our online
   subscription form at <A HREF="http://www.netsurf.com/nsd/subscribe.html">
   http://www.netsurf.com/nsd/subscribe.html</A>
   <P>
   You can also subscribe via e-mail.
   Send all e-mail subscription requests to: <B>nsdigest-request@netsurf.com</B>
   <P>
   To subscribe to the HTML version send the following command in the
   <B>BODY</B> of the message:
<PRE>
     subscribe nsdigest-html
</PRE>   To subscribe to the TEXT version send the following command in the
   <B>BODY</B> of the message:
<PRE>
     subscribe nsdigest-text
</PRE>
   To unsubscribe send one of the following commands in the <B>BODY</B> of the
   message:
<PRE>
     unsubscribe nsdigest-text
     unsubscribe nsdigest-html   
</PRE>  

<H3><A NAME="FAQ8">8.0 HOW CAN I CHANGE MY SUBSCRIPTION FROM TEXT TO HTML FORMAT?</A></H3>
<P>
   Easy. Simply send the following to <B>nsdigest-request@netsurf.com</B> in 
   the <B>BODY</B> of the message:
 <PRE>
    unsubscribe nsdigest-text 
    subscribe nsdigest-html
</PRE>   
If you want to switch from HTML to TEXT just reverse the order like so:
<PRE>
    unsubscribe nsdigest-html
    subscribe nsdigest-text
</PRE>
  <H3><A NAME="FAQ9">9.0 HOW CAN I CHANGE MY DELIVERY ADDRESS?</A></H3>
<P>
   It's easy. Simply send an unsubscribe command from your old address
   and then send a subscribe command from your new address.
<P>
   Note that our subscription software automatically reads the address
   from the "From:" field of your E-mail message, so the subscribe
   and unsubscribe commands must come from the appropriate addresses.
<P>
 <H3> <A NAME="FAQ10">10.0 WHY DO YOU BOTHER MAILING THE HTML VERSION?</A></H3>
   <P>
   Why not just put up the Web server? Well, there are really two reasons
   for this.
   <P>
   First, the Web clients such as Mosaic and others make very nifty
   universal readers for all of our customers, even those without direct
   access to the Internet. Since we like our product to look good this
   seems the obvious solution to go with.
   <P>
   The second reason is that we do not want our WWW server to be a choke
   point for our readers. Why have thousands of readers trying to hook up
   to our machine and potentially wind up in a giant traffic jam, just to
   link to an unrelated site they read about in the Digest? From the
   standpoint of reliability and bandwidth usage it makes sense to mail
   out HTML source.
   <P>
<H3>  <A NAME="FAQ11">11.0 HOW COME I DID NOT GET MY LAST ISSUE OF NETSURFER DIGEST?</A></H3>
<P>
    We've been doing this long enough to know that there are a number of
    problems which crop up over and over again either due to factors
    beyond our control or due to our dizzy growth rate. 
<P>
    On any given mass mailing we get between 5%-10% bounced E-mail.
    This means our software tried to deliver to your address but could
    not. Some of the reasons we've seen why this happens:
<P>
<UL>
     <LI>Your machine or mailing software was down when we tried mailing.
      <LI> Your file system was full.
      <LI> Your address has changed.
      <LI> The link to your site was down somewhere along the delivery chain.
      <LI> Our mailing software starts acting up for utterly unknown reasons
        (well, usually it's because we've been mucking with our machines).
      <LI>A conspiracy involving aliens, Elvis, and the Trilateral Commission.
 </UL>
<P>
   If all else fails you can always stop at our FTP or WWW sites to
    get the latest issue of Netsurfer Digest:
  <PRE>  
      http://www.netsurf.com/nsd/index.html
      ftp://ftp.netsurf.com/pub/nsd/
</PRE>
  <H3><A NAME="FAQ12">12.0 HOW CAN I UNSUBSCRIBE TO NETSURFER DIGEST?</A> </H3>
<P>
    It hurts us to have to tell you how to do that. It really does. If it
    comes to this it means we have failed you, our gentle readers. If you
    unsubscribe there will be wailing and gnashing of teeth, and someone
    will throw themselves on the point of their mouse pad. So don't. Just
    tell us how to get better.
<P> 
    Mail <B>nsdigest-request@netsurf.com</B> with one of the following in the 
    <B>BODY</B> of the message:
    <PRE>
        unsubscribe nsdigest-html 
        unsubscribe nsdigest-text
</PRE>
  <H3><A NAME="FAQ13">13.0 WHO PUBLISHES NETSURFER DIGEST?</A></H3>

<PRE>

THE FINE PRINT

1) Publisher reserves the right to accept or refuse any advertisements
and to edit or alter or omit advertisements for any reason at any time.

2) The Publisher reserves the right to place the word "Advertisement"
with copy that in the publisher's opinion resembles editorial matter.

3) All advertising copy is subject to Publisher's approval. All
advertisements are accepted and published upon the representation that
advertisers and agencies are authorized to publish the entire contents
and subject matter thereof. In consideration of the Publisher's
acceptance of such advertisements for publication, both advertisers and
their agencies will indemnify and hold the publisher harmless from and
against any loss or expense arising out of publication of such
advertising, including, but without limitation to, those resulting from
attorney's fees, claims for suits for libel, violation of rights of
privacy, plagiarism, copyright infringement, trademark, trade name or
patent infringement, and unlawful appropriation of the name or likeness.

4) Advertisers are encouraged to indicate position preference on
insertion orders and contracts. Publisher will attempt to accommodate
all reasonable positioning requests. Premium position requests, when
accompanied by the appropriate premium position payment and accepted,
will be considered binding upon the publisher and treated as such. In
certain instances the Publisher still reserves the right to alter a
premium position for any reason at any time. If this occurs the
Publisher will make every effort to offer a mutually satisfying
alternative premium position. When unaccompanied by a premium payment,
all positioning instructions will be treated as requests to be complied
with at the discretion of the Publisher. The client and its agency agree
to pay for the advertisement in full whether or not Publisher complies
with the positioning request.

5) Publisher is not liable for delays in distribution and/or nondelivery
in the event of an act of God, action by any government entity, fire,
flood, insurrection, riot, war, explosion, embargo, strike(whether legal
or illegal), labor or material shortage, transportation interruption of
any kind, work slowdown, technical difficulties, or any condition beyond
the control of the Publisher affecting production or delivery in any
manner.

6) Publisher makes no promise regarding the exact publication date that
shall in any way affect the terms of this contract.

7) Publisher is not responsible for errors in formatting, links,
indexes, or any other content construction or service done by Publisher.

8) Publisher liability for any errors will not exceed the cost of the
space occupied by that error.

9) In the event of nonpayment, Publisher reserves the right to hold the
advertiser or advertising agency jointly and severally liable for such
monies as are due and payable to Publisher. Advertiser or advertising
agency agrees to pay attorney's fee and court costs if any action is
instituted for collection or breach of any terms of this agreement.

10) Publisher shall have the right to terminate this agreement at any
time, with or without notice to advertiser, for nonpayment of invoices
at due date. In the event of such termination by Publisher for said
reasons, advertiser or advertising agency will pay Publisher for all
space used under this agreement of the published rate.

11) No conditions, printed or otherwise, appearing in insertion orders,
contracts, insertion instructions, or any other form of correspondence
that conflict with these policies will be binding on the Publisher.

<H3><A NAME="HWW">How It All Works</A></H3>
<P>
Basically <A HREF="http://www.netsurf.com/">Netsurfer Communications, Inc.</A> 
works by distributing content for free and paying the bills by
delivering commercial messages, advertising, special mailings, etc. 
Our policy is based on making a fair arrangement between our four
customers - content producers, readers, advertisers, and redistributors.
It is very simple, and applies to 
<A HREF="http://140.174.161.1/sprintbiz/maintest.html">
both electronic and non-electronic media</A> and any form of delivery.
So read it even if you 
<A HREF="http://www.mcs.net/~sculptor/home.html">
chisel each copy in stone</A> and send it out by 
<A HREF="http://www.neosoft.com/citylink/sacramento/sacsee.html">
pony express.</A>
<P>
<H3><A NAME="WLP">WWW Linking</A></H3>
<P>
<STRONG>You may use hypertext links to material on our WWW server without
restriction.</STRONG> In fact we encourage everyone to do this. This policy
works well since we get to count the number of accesses and pass
that information on to our sponsors.

<P>
We would, however, appreciate 
<A HREF="mailto:distribution@netsurf.com">a note</A> saying that you have created a link
to our content. This helps us plan our server capacity to give all our
visitors good response time and an enjoyable experience at our site. If
you tell us about your site, we may also be able to 
inform you of any new or
interesting material which you may wish to add to your pages.

<P>
<H3><A NAME="WIR">What is Redistribution?</A></H3>
<P>
You are redistributing our material if you place full or partial copies of our
publications at your online sites, or if you use them in print. 
The rules for redistribution are as follows: 
<P> 

<H3><A NAME="NCR">Non-Commercial Redistribution</A></H3>

<LI>Send us an e-mail message at <A HREF="mailto:distribution@netsurf.com">distribution@netsurf.com</A>

public mirror site or whether you just want to distribute our
publications internally to your group.

<P>
<LI>Always carry entire, unaltered copies of both the editorial and
the commercial content. For example, if you carry
<A HREF="http://www.netsurf.com/nsd/latest.digest.html">

<A HREF="http://www.netsurf.com/nsm/latest.mktplace.html">

<P> 

<LI>Leave all copyright notices intact.  
<P>

<P> 
If you are redistributing content for commercial purposes, either online

<A HREF="mailto:distribution@netsurf.com">distribution@netsurf.com.</A> We make commercial
arrangements on a case-by-case basis. We can provide special 
editions such as editorial-content-only versions, or issues 
based on special areas of interest.
Please note that print syndication arrangements are also available.

<H3><A NAME="RMP">Review Material </A></H3>

<IMG ALT="Netsurfer Marketplace Ad Guidelines" SRC="mktplc2.gif">
<P>
<H2>NETSURFER MARKETPLACE ADVERTISING GUIDELINES</H2>
<P>
This brief document gives some tips on how best to use Netsurfer 
Marketplace to advertise and promote your business. 

<P>
<H3>WHY NETSURFER MARKETPLACE?</H3>
<P>
Keep in mind that Netsurfer Marketplace is a unique delivery
mechanism for advertising. It is not as passive as simply putting up
online sites and hoping you get visited. This is pro-active promotion of
a very effective and high signal nature.
<P>
On the other hand Netsurfer Marketplace is not distastefully
in-your-face like direct E-mail or Spamming. The subscribers are
sophisticated enough to understand that it underwrites worthy
publications like Netsurfer Digest and have signed up to receive it.
They will read it as long as it is informative and entertaining.
<P>
Think about these guidelines when composing your ad and both your
business and our readers will profit from the experience.
<P>
<H3>THE GUIDELINES</H3>
<P>
<B><IMG SRC="mktbul7.gif">1.0 Respect the readers.</B>
<P>
Keep in mind that your audience is a pretty sophisticated and intelligent
bunch. Respect their intelligence and their integrity as consumers. They
live in a barrage of media and have developed sophisticated bullshit
filters. If you as a business do right by them, they will do right by you.

<P>
<B><IMG SRC="mktbul7.gif">2.0 Use Netsurfer Marketplace as a gateway to your business.</B>
<P>
Think of ads in Netsurfer Marketplace as a gateways to your
business. Your ads can take our readers to your online content with the
click of a mouse. We will place them in thousands of mailboxes belonging
to people who actually want to receive such doorways. The challenge is
to give the readers some reason to visit your cyberspace. If you
provide them with a cool site, they won't need much prompting.

<P>
<B><IMG SRC="mktbul7.gif">3.0 Provide or sponsor some informative or entertaining content.</B>
<P>
There is a lot of stuff out there in cyberspace, all of it easily
accessible. Unfortunately much of it is pretty worthless. Rather than
contributing to online noise, give our readers and your customers some
reason to respect your voice. Use your ad space to sponsor something
useful or something entertaining. Remember, people spend money and a
couple of hours in a dark theater to watch the world's best commercials.

<P>
<B><IMG SRC="mktbul7.gif">4.0 Vary your message.</B> 
<P>
You are buying space, not frozen copy. Don't run the exact same copy
week after week, you'll just bore your readers. Give them a reason to
read every one of your ads. It's relatively trivial to vary most online
advertising, so take advantage of that capability.

<P>
<B><IMG SRC="mktbul7.gif">5.0 Avoid hype.</B>
<P>
The audience you are communicating with has grown up in the Media Age. 
Where advertising is concerned, they've seen it all and don't believe
most of what they hear (face it, do you?). They know the difference
between hype and substance. Tone down the exclamation marks, don't SHOUT,
and don't make bogus claims in vapid language. If you hype, you'll just
loose credibility.
<P>
<B><IMG SRC="mktbul7.gif">6.0 Use Netsurfer Marketplace for promotion.</B>
<P>
OK, so you've put up a spiffy new WWW site with tons of great
information about your products. Now, how do you get people to come and
visit? You need to let them know that you are out there and open for
business. Take advantage of the wide availability and circulation of
Netsurfer Marketplace to let people know about new material at
your sites or about new developments in your product line.
<P>
<B><IMG SRC="mktbul7.gif">7.0 Use Netsurfer Marketplace for time sensitive information.</B>
<P>
Netsurfer Marketplace is a perfect vehicle for promotion or
advertising which is of a time sensitive nature. It is published
frequently and has lead times which are much shorter then comparable
print or monthly E-zines. Take advantage of that. Netsurfer 
Marketplace is perfect for promoting sales, seasonal items, new
products, deadlined promotions, or timely announcements.
<P>
<B><IMG SRC="mktbul7.gif">8.0 Interact with your customers.</B>
<P>
Online technology makes it easy to interact with your customers. Take
advantage of this capability by providing ways to gather your customer's
opinion. Use the standard forms provided by Netsurfer 
Marketplace, and invest in developing your own methods. After all, your
customers are the best sources of information about your market.
<P>
<B><IMG SRC="mktbul7.gif">9.0 Offer links to samples in your ads.</B>
<P>
If your product is information, software, multimedia, entertainment, or
any other item which can be presented online, then you'll have much to
gain by offering samples in your ads. Remember, you can link from your ad
directly to any content you place on the Internet. Give your customers a
taste through Netsurfer Marketplace.
<P>
<B><IMG SRC="mktbul7.gif">10.0 Don't take it too seriously.</B>
<P>
Life is short. Don't twist your panties in a knot over this stuff.
Have fun with it. Be creative. Our readers will appreciate you for it.

<A NAME="AB"><B>Arthur Bebak</B></A> - Publisher &amp; Executive Editor
<P>
Longer ago than he cares to remember Arthur was educated at the
University of Illinois where he picked up a degree in Computer
Engineering on a fencing scholarship (go figure). Fleeing Illinois
topography for more vertically challanging terrain, he wound up in
California designing mainframes and doing heavy duty project management
for Amdahl Corporation. He studied business administration at Golden
Gate University and kept a keen eye on the evolution of cyberspace until
it had matured to the point where it could support a business.  Today he
helms Netsurfer Communications and uses his considerable and hard won
experience to consult on matters of cyberspace. Arthur is the co-author
of <A HREF="http://www.netsurf.con/cwpfd/">Creating Web Pages for Dummies</A>,
part of a popular series of technical guide books for beginners.
In his voluminous spare time Arthur hallucinates in Perl.

<P>
<A NAME="LN"><B>Lawrence Nyveen</B></A> - Editor, Netsurfer Digest
<P>
Lawrence (usually known as Laurie), was a writer and copy editor with
Netsurfer Digest until tapped for everlasting fame and of all free time as
editor.  He grew up in Montreal, attended Rice University in Houston (B.A.
in biology and anthropology), and soon found himself studying ornithiscian
dinosaurs at Yale.
<P>
One thing led to another, and soon Laurie was walking across the stage,
receiving his grad diploma in journalism from Concordia University in
Montreal.  After a short stint at a real job with Reader's Digest (Canada),
he eventually hooked up with Arthur, who was looking for something he had
to offer.  It was probably the glamour of Reader's Digest.  Either that or
his tie.
<P>
Besides editing NSD, Laurie takes care of his __-month old (b. July 1994)

<P>
<H2>How Netsurfer Marketplace Works</H2>

<P>
Netsurfer publishes a 
<A HREF="http://www.netsurf.com/nsm/zines.html">number of E-Zines</A>, 
or electronic magazines. Our E-Zines are unique in a number of ways.
They are freely available to all subscribers and Web readers, thus
generating large international audiences. They are delivered directly to
readers electronic mailboxes making them as easy and painless to access
as electronic mail. They are also formatted as standard World Wide Web
hyperlinked HTML documents. This makes the sites we write about accessible
with a simple mouse click. Finally, they are written with an eye
towards delivering high signal content amidst the noise of the online
world. As a result our E-Zines have developed a reputation for
delivering high quality online information and entertainment.

<P>
Our readers are a 
<A HREF="http://www.netsurf.com/surveys.html">sophisticated group</A> 
and understand the economics of sponsor driven publications. In return
for free access to our E-Zines they have agreed to receive commercial
content in their electronic mailboxes in the form of <I>Netsurfer
Marketplace</I>. Marketplace is an E-Zine much like the others in format
and delivery, but carrying purely commercial content. It is delivered
to the same large mailing list as 
<A HREF="http://www.netsurf.com/nsd/">Netsurfer Digest</A> and 
<A HREF="http://www.netsurf.com/nsf/">Netsurfer Focus</A>.
In addition to e-mail delivery its availability on our Web sites
provides additional exposure to our extensive Web based readership. Our
readers appreciate <I>Netsurfer Marketplace</I> for bringing them a wide
variety of neat commercial sites to netsurf.

<P>
All this adds up to is an excellent opportunity for advertisers to
deliver their content and to place links to their online sites into many
thousands of mailboxes all over the world. This proactive method
makes <I>Netsurfer Marketplace</I> much more effective then the traditional passive online
approach (<I>"If we put up a web site they will come...
Won't they?</I>").  In fact the ability to place a gateway to your site
into a potential consumer mailbox makes possible some unique
distribution and promotion methods. Read our 
<A HREF="http://www.netsurf.com/nsm/adguide.html">Netsurfer Marketplace
Advertising Guidelines</A> for a brief set of suggestions on how to use
this uniquely flexible medium to best effect.

<P>
Sponsors wishing to reach our readers can purchase ad space
in <I>Netsurfer Marketplace</I>.  See the latest
<A HREF="http://www.netsurf.com/nsm/ndratecard.html">Rate Card</A>
for prices. More information about placing advertising or contacting

Netsurfer T-Shirt Design Contest Submission Rules
</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY>
<H1>Netsurfer T-Shirt Design Contest</H1>
<IMG SRC="artist.gif" ALT="">  
<H3>Submission Rules, Or the Fourfold Path to Graphic Glory</H3>
<P>
This page assumes you already know about the Netsurfer T-Shirt Design
Contest and want to enter. If not, you can read the 
<A HREF="http://www.netsurf.com/tshirt/tannounce.html"> 
announcement of the contest</A> to find out what we are up to.
<P>
This page will tell you how you can submit entries for the
Netsurfer T-Shirt contest. It's a simple four part process.
<P>
Remember 50% of people can't follow simple directions. We figure
you're not one of them. Please don't prove us wrong, OK?
<P>
<H1>EXTENDED Entry Deadline: August 18, 1995</H1>
<P>
<H3>[1] Design a T-Shirt Graphic</H3>
<P>
This is an important first step. You can't enter unless you design a
T-Shirt graphic. Really. You can't. 
<P>
It can be anything you want. Take a look at some T-Shirts for
inspiration. Look at clouds. Study the wisdom of the ancients, like
Elvis, or Richard Nixon. Brood. Paint nude studies of Margaret Thatcher.
Get yourself some angst. You know, do that whole art thing and produce
something worthy of the Netsurfer mythos.
<P>
Yes, you can submit more then one design. As many as you like.
<P>
<H3>[2] Save Your Work in the Right Format: GIF or JPEG</H3>
<P>
<B>PLEASE DON'T</B> send us TIFF, Photoshop, CorelDraw, EPS, PCX, BMP,
or BPHBPPF (Bob's Proprietary Home Brew Paint Program Format).
Just produce a simple GIF or JPEG image please. We're busy folks and would
rather Netsurf on your behalf then spend time finding converters for
someone's pet program. OK, one exception. We'll take entries in Color
McCheese format.
<P>
If you like to work in hardcopy, keep in mind that most copy
stores have a scanner these days. Head on to your local Kinko's, or
CopyMat, or Annie's Copy Emporium &amp; Fish Market and scan
it in.
<P>
<H3>[3] Send in Your Work Using FTP</H3> 
<P>
Upload your file to <B>ftp://ftp.netsurf.com/pub/incoming/</B>.
This means you <B>DO NOT</B> need to Uuencode it, BinHex it, ZIP it, tar
it, saute it, bake it, filet it, or do anything weird with it. Just
upload the bare GIF or JPEG file.
If you can't do that, have a plugged in friend do it for you. If
that won't work let us know at
<A HREF="mailto:tshirt-contest@netsurf.com">
tshirt-contest@netsurf.com</A>, and we'll work something out.
<P>
<H3>[4] Notify Us: tshirt-contest@netsurf.com</H3>
<P>
Once you have uploaded your file, send us email to
<A HREF="mailto:tshirt-contest@netsurf.com">
tshirt-contest@netsurf.com</A> and include the following information:
<P><B>
Your Name<BR>
File Name(s)<BR>
Your E-mail address<BR>
Your Phone<BR>
Your Snail Mail Address<BR>
Your Favorite URL (besides ours)<BR>
</B>
<P>
The second item, File Name(s), should be the file name or names of the
artwork you uploaded to our FTP site.  The last item, Your Favorite URL,
is to share with the rest of our readers.  We'll put them all on a page
for everyone's enjoyment.

<P>
<H3>The Legal Stuff</H3>
<P>
Selection of winners is at the sole discretion of Netsurfer
Communications, Inc. All decisions are final. Winning entries become
the property of Netsurfer Communications, Inc., and may be used in
various promotional activities (with attribution).
<P>
<H3>Questions?</H3>
<P>
Send'em to <A HREF="mailto:tshirt-contest@netsurf.com">
tshirt-contest@netsurf.com</A>. 
We'll cheerfully answer the ones we can comprehend.
<P>
<H3>That's It!</H3>
<P>
Simple wasn't it? Pat yourself on the back (or wherever) and go sit in a
corner and bite your nails until we announce the results on August 31.
<P>
We think you are a truly wonderful person just for entering. We thank
you profoundly and most sincerely for your help and promise to always
improve our publications to be worthy of fine people like you.
<P>

<HR>
<H2>Random Design Notes</H2>
<P>
OK, here are some notes about the design. Take them with a grain of
salt, they are mostly guidelines to keep in mind.
<P>
<H4>Colors</H4>
<P>
The price of T-Shirt manufacturing goes up with the number of colors.
Try to stay with no more then four, but don't be paranoid about it.
<P>
<H4>Tag Lines</H4>
<P>
Feel free to use some of our tag lines in the design. Each of 
<A HREF="http://www.netsurf.com/nsm/zines.html">our E-zines</A> 
has it's own tagline so you can incorporate that into
your design. If you have a better catch phrase, go for it!
<P>
<H4>Themes</H4>
<P>
Don't get hung up on the surfing theme. Be creative. Be weird.
Be bold. Be sting. Be bop. 
<P>

It's easier then you think. All you need to do is send us
e-mail to 
<A HREF="mailto:pressroom@netsurf.com">pressroom@netsurf.com</A>.
<P>
As usual, do remember that brevity is the soul of wit. So keep it
short, we get hundreds of submissions every week and the longer
they are the less likely it is that we'll look at them. Standard
press release length (a page or two) is fine, but don't go beyond that.

<B><A NAME="BS1">US SUPREME COURT AGREES TO RULE ON CDA</A></B>
<P>
The US Supreme Court has agreed to hear the appeal of a ruling that the
Communications Decency Act (CDA) is unconstitutional. Earlier this year, a
three-judge panel in Philadelphia ruled that the CDA violated rights
protected by the First Amendment to the US Constitution. A decision is
expected by July. The CNN article comes with a pic of Santa Claus looking
at naked Jenny McCarthy holding a Dalmatian. How timely, for both the
Christmas season and Disney's "101 Dalmatians" are being foisted at us from
every corner. And Jenny? Well, she's timeless.

<B><A NAME="BS2">HAPPY CHANUKAH</A></B>
<P>
The eight-day Jewish festival of lights and grease began Thursday at
sundown, and we've taken pains to seek out a few points of Chanukah
brightness and clarity from the deep dark Web. Jewish Communication Network
(JCN), offers lots of guidance for those who want to celebrate a
traditional holiday. You'll learn how to light the candles, what to recite,
and meditations for every night. Other links at the site include the
history of Chanukah, the JCN's "Top 12 Reasons We Like Hanukkah," the
Chanukah Carol Competition, and a recipe exchange (including latkes, of
course!). Much of the same is found at the Jewish Post site. JCN:

<B><A NAME="BS3">PEARL HARBOR</A></B>
<P>
Personal stories make important events seem so - well, personal. Seeing as
how we've just passed the 55th anniversary of the Japanese attack on Pearl
Harbor, we decided to look online for eyewitness accounts. William Innanen,
a soldier, describes the scene at the naval base in the wake of the attack.
Ginger, a 17-year-old high school student living in Pearl Harbor at the
time of the attack, gives another point of view. Her concern for friends
and family killed or missing is vivid and touching. Innanen:

<B><A NAME="SS1">AIDS AND A FAMILY</A></B>
<P>
Picture an ordinary family in Minnesota, a mother, a father, two boys, and
an infant girl. Now picture them thrust into a nightmare, with the parents
and the baby girl infected with HIV. This photodocumentary takes a
sensitive and emotional look at one family's struggle with AIDS,
particularly how the infected parents of the three-year-old dealt with her
illness and the reactions of their town and church. A photographer and two
writers tracked the family's six-year odyssey and have put together a site
with as many positive insights as are possible. The pages are as elegant as
they are heart-wrenching, and the somber gray-scale frames tell the story
as it should be told.

<B><A NAME="SS2">THE FUTURE IS HERE...</A></B>
<P>
Phillip's Vision of the Future Magazine is a dive into a whole new world of
the possible. The site tries to determine what the future would look like
in terms of personal communications and entertainment tools. What they came
up with is nothing short of fascinating. Make sure you check out the
Personal Touch issue and the background information on the project.

<B><A NAME="SS3">...AND ROBON CORPORATION HYPES IT</A></B>
<P>
According to mythical metamegacorporation Robon Corp., life is upgradeable.
That's all you need know before you enter this wry, wise, and slick site
dedicated to the belief that all cyber-hype is indeed true. Whether Robon
is Bill Gate's wettest dream or your worst nightmare, it's good for more
than a few laughs, and shivers. <A HREF="http://www.robon.com/">"http://www.robon.com/"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="SS4">JUST ZOO IT</A></B>
<P>
Things are really hopping in Washington, D.C. Especially at the National
Zoo, where promiscuous Komodo dragons and computer-literate orangutans
abound. If you're in the mood to stroll among the animals, stop by. Be sure
to check out the naked mole rats and newly born rhinoceros via
freeze-framed, live-action photos. <A HREF="http://www.si.edu/organiza/museums/zoo/">"http://www.si.edu/organiza/museums/zoo/"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="SS5">ATTACK OF THE BOTS</A></B>
<P>
Bots are entities that have been around almost as long as the Net. These
pseudo-beings, originally created as a means of bridging the gap between
computers and ordinary linguistic communication, have evolved into a
powerful means of translating simple questions into powerful Internet
database queries. The big low-down on bots, their origins, and their
current capabilities now resides at the Bot Info site, full of data on
current bot trends. There's even a link to Eliza, the "original" bot,
created in the late 1960s. This site holds a great deal of information,
including several FAQ's and reviews of bots deemed important enough to
communicate to the Internet community as a whole. <A HREF="http://www.botspot.com/">"http://www.botspot.com/"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="SS6">IF YOU WANT TO DOWNLOAD IT, THEY'VE USUALLY GOT IT</A></B>
<P>
The C|Net downloading engine makes it easy to find, read about, and
download just about any online software that you might be looking for. It's
convenient to search or browse by categories at the well designed site.
Links are easy and navigation is quick. Some of the groups of software that
they classify for downloading are: business; development tools;
educational; games; home and personal; Internet; kids; multimedia and
design; and utilities. Test drive it. <A HREF="http://www.download.com/">"http://www.download.com/"</A>

<B><A NAME="SS7">TESSERACT, ANYONE?</A></B>
<P>
Anyone who's ever tried looking for the images hidden in those inane
stereoscopic pictures (Ooh, look! I'm dizzy!) might get a kick out of the
3-D hypercube page. A Java applet runs a three-dimensional simulation of a
hypercube, and those who have held on to those 3-D movie glasses will be
able to take full advantage of the effect. Plenty of other optical
illusions abound, and some of the programming that went into creating the
displays might also confuse you. <A HREF="http://www.sover.net/~manx/hyprcube.html">"http://www.sover.net/~manx/hyprcube.html"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="SS8">ANCIENT HISTORY SEARCH ENGINE</A></B>
<P>
Argos is a search engine whose focus is limited to matters of ancient
history, myth, and fable. The Argos site draws from a variety of sources to
be a handy tool for researchers and academics interested in the legends
that populate humankind's collective unconscious. Some of the sources drawn
from include the Labyrinth's medieval site and the Duke Papyrus Archive,
the Internet's most exhaustive study of ancient Egyptian papyri.

<B><A NAME="SS9">A THROWBACK TO THE GOOD OLD DAYS OF WEB PUBLISHING</A></B>
<P>
The days of quirky, remote URLs loaded with personal neuroses, boasting,
and occasional banality seem to be vanishing before the onslaught of slick,
commercial Web sites. Sentimentalists longing for the good old days should
check into the Catacombs Cyber Cafe where proprietor Scott Klender is
selling nothing but himself: what books he reads, what movies he likes,
what bands he listens to. There's more: admittedly bad poetry; the "random
psychosis generator"; his own Another Brilliant Site award - so much more
that it feels like you've taken a can opener to his skull. It's worth the
peek inside. <A HREF="http://www.rust.net/~sklender/catacombs_home.html">"http://www.rust.net/~sklender/catacombs_home.html"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="SS10">IT'S A MYSTERY</A></B>
<P>
If you love mysteries and don't mind eyestrain, you'll like "The Light
Files". This series of online murder mysteries, which begins with "Death in
Broad Daylight", opens with a very dark, dismal, and hard-to-scan home
page. Get past that obstacle, and you can try to solve the mystery. As an
enticement, the sponsoring company (SouthPeak Interactive) is offering a
$5,000 reward. <A HREF="http://www.lightfiles.com/">"http://www.lightfiles.com/"</A>

<P>
Talk about walking a mile in somebody's shoes.... Robert Swan and
colleagues are going to walk 1,300 kilometres across Antarctica. If you
want to join them, along with 35 young explorers from around the world,
slip on your mukluks and head for One Step Beyond. The site covers both
Swan's stroll across the Antarctic wastes and the activities of a select
group of 16 to 24-year-olds who will undertake their own month-long
expedition to the Antarctic environs, meeting up with Swan and company in
January 1997. The site promises daily notes from the field and expedition
updates. For those with the juice to support it, the site features a 3-D
virtual reality walk across Antarctic terrain. Those without it can stare
at a white screen and pretend it's a blizzard.

By the time we entirely explored this virtual guide to Belize, we could

different tours around the small Central American country, including visits
to the Mayan Ruins, the national parks, and other localities. It's the next
best thing to being there. <A HREF="http://www.belizenet.com/guide.html">"http://www.belizenet.com/guide.html"</A>

<B><A NAME="OT3">WHAT DO ERROL FLYNN AND A TASMANIAN DEVIL HAVE IN COMMON?</A></B>
<P>
Both come from Tasmania, as do these vicarious adventures you can
experience with your Web browser. Tour Australia's smallest state and one
of its most popular tourist attractions from the comfort of your chair.
This tour is designed as a brief guide to "Tassie", as it's called in the
local vernacular. It provides a nice, well designed sampling of the diverse
and spectacular scenery and attractions of Tasmania. An interesting and
informative tour, it's also a good way to plan a trip there.

While we'd love to write this ultra-commercial site off as just another
pretty travel page, the World Travel Guide, sponsored by AT&T and the
Columbus Group, is actually a glorious collection of information for
would-be travelers. Based on the best-selling World Travel Guide books,
this site provides tourist and business travel information; essential
details about climate, visas, currency and customs; listings of public
holidays; and, of course, so much more. Use its spiffy Hotel Finder to
search a database of over 6,000 hotels worldwide. <A HREF="http://www.wtgonline.com/">"http://www.wtgonline.com/"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="OT5">WHEN'S THE FLIGHT ARRIVING?</A></B>
<P>
What the online World Travel Guide doesn't have, TheTrip.com does. This
travel resource aims squarely at the business air traveler. The coolest
feature is the real-time flight tracking page. The page will retrieve
flight info - from ETA to speed and altitude of the airplane -
lickety-split for airline and general aviation aircraft. The technology
uses Federal flow control data, piped and formatted for the Web interface.
It works only for flights wholly within the US, but you don't need a flight
number. The airport guides would be more useful if they mapped gates. On
the horizon, TheTrip.com promises a customized bargain airfare e-mail list.

<P>
Yes, it's the season when the desperation in parents' faces contrasts
nicely with the rictus of avarice on the faces of their kids. What could it
be but the annual holiday of commerce, Christmas. We thought we'd give you
a break and have some fun with holiday netsurfing by putting together this
little site. It's an update of a concept we first attempted in 1995,
featuring some diverting and eclectic links which we think you'll enjoy.
Have fun, and happy holidays. <A HREF="http://www.netsurf.com/12sites/12sites96.html">"http://www.netsurf.com/12sites/12sites96.html"</A>

<P>
Netcraft has released the latest in their ongoing round of automated Web
server surveys. After accessing 603,367 servers, they report that Apache
runs at 41% of all sites, dwarfing the shares of commercial servers and a
hair up from the last survey. Second-place Netscape servers declined
slightly from 13.75% to 12.96%, apparently at least partly due to gains in
fourth place Microsoft's share, which went up to from 9.37% to 9.52%. NCSA
server continues to lose ground, though it's still in third place with
12.63%. Details can be found at the Netcraft site.

<P>
Just in time for the holiday season, Newsweek launched this site featuring
just about everything you could possibly want to know about children's
software. Aside from regular reviews of new educational and entertainment
software, the site features a database of over 600 programs and a forum
area where you can chat about your tykes' favorite programs. There's also a
frame-rich page with an assortment of columns with the now familiar
big-media generic titles like "The Net: Childs Play?" and "Your Kid's
School and How You Can Help". It's a fairly straightforward site dedicated
to one topic which it does cover quite thoroughly. If you're in the market
for kids' software, a stop here could be rewarding.

Many of you know EPIC as the electronic privacy organization which was
formed to center attention on issues of electronic privacy and civil
liberties in cyberspace. In that role, it has just opened a bookstore
section which features an excellent assortment of privacy and related books
at their Web site. It's a comprehensive assortment of books, ranging from
the epic "Applied Cryptography" to fiction such as "Snow Crash", various
technical journals, and obscure but tantalizing titles like "The Naked
Consumer: How Our Private Lives Became Public Commodities", and "Computer
Crime Techniques Prevention and Detecting Crime in Financial Institutions".
Lots of good browsing for laypeople and technical pros.

<B><A NAME="BS5">GENERAL REASONING PROGRAM PROVES THEOREM</A></B>
<P>
This is kind of an esoteric item, but it marks a significant step in the
development of artificial intelligence software. Some years back, the very
first computer proof was done, when a computer exhaustively proved the
famous four-color map conjecture after being programmed to do so. Recently,
another computer discovered another proof, but this time the beast was
programmed to do generic reasoning, not any specified problem. For the
first time, we have a tool which can, to some extent, exhibit the same
mathematical reasoning power that top human mathematicians use to crack
difficult abstract math problems. With this proof, the quality of our
artificial intelligence knowledge has taken a quantum leap. For the
mathematically masochistic, the technical details of the Robbins Conjecture
proof are at this site. Read the Press Release link from there for the
non-technical info. <A HREF="http://www.mcs.anl.gov/home/mccune/ar/robbins/">"http://www.mcs.anl.gov/home/mccune/ar/robbins/"</A>

<B><A NAME="BS6">SENDMAIL CERT ADVISORY AND WEB SPOOFING SECURITY ALERT</A></B>
<P>
CERT has issued an advisory for the sendmail program. It seems that it is
possible for a user to gain group permissions of another user. The advisory
has details and suggests that you upgrade to Sendmail 8.8.4. In a separate
development, there seems to be yet another security flaw in the generic Web
infrastructure. It goes by the euphonious name of "Web spoofing" and
basically means that an evil hacker can listen in and modify the traffic
between your browser and any Web server you are trying to access. Read all
about it on the Safe Internet Programming page, an interesting and useful
resource in its own right.

<P>
Glenn Sanford presents the manic history of Apple Computer in broad strokes
with six short, sharp synopses of the Woz and Steve's brainchild. Read
along as Apple forges ahead or falls behind under the guiding hand of the
company's notoriously woozy management. While there's certainly more to be
said and read (a good "further reading" list for the interested is
included), Sanford has pulled together an excellent thumbnail history of
the people behind Apple, and has managed to compile decent, detailed
histories for every machine Apple has introduced to the market. An opinion
section adds depth to the history by offering comment and criticism from
some of the folks who helped make that history. If you're an Apple a day
kind of nethead, it's tasty eating. <A HREF="http://www.apple-history.pair.com/">"http://www.apple-history.pair.com/"</A>

<P>
Tony Heinz, webmaster of Jumbo!, decided to investigate how much time users
from US government domains (.gov) spent from August to October at the
online shareware emporium. He found that the feds spent over 5,000 hours at
the site, equivalent to ten employees doing nothing but searching and
downloading. NASA's Ames Research Center employs the biggest federal
bandwidth suckers, who accessed over 25,000 pages over 950 hours, way ahead
of numbers two (National Institutes of Health; 180 hours) and three (US
Postal Service; 112 hours). The Executive Office of the President logged
4.8 hours, but with the campaign and all.... Downloads included Quake,
Homer Simpson belching sound files, and business-related software and
utilities. <A HREF="http://www.jumbo.com/">"http://www.jumbo.com/"</A>

<B><A NAME="OC3">CENSORSHIP MOST IMPORTANT ISSUE FOR INTERNET USERS</A></B>
<P>
This according to the latest indispensible GVU's WWW User Survey. Fully 35%
of the 15,000-plus respondents said that censorship was the most important
issue facing the Internet today, with privacy coming in second place at
26.2%. In addition, more than 2/3 of respondents (67.6%) reported that they
were not willing to pay additional fees for accessing Web materials. The
survey ran throught October and November of this year. As usual, there are
many, many more interesting results then we can report here, so we urge you
to take a look at the site for a fascinating snapshot of our online
culture. <A HREF="http://www.cc.gatech.edu/gvu/user_surveys/survey-10-1996/">"http://www.cc.gatech.edu/gvu/user_surveys/survey-10-1996/"</A>

<P>
A new survey of about 10,000 households by PC-Meter leads that company to
estimate that about 11 million households use the Web in the US. Not
surprisingly, 33.1% of households with annual incomes over $100,000 use the
Web, as opposed to only 5.5% of those with incomes of $25,000 or less.
Similarly, advanced degree holders hit the Web more (28.0%) than do those
with only high school degrees (5.3%). Another survey reveals that 25% of
Web users now visit shopping sites, with the number one shopping
destination being Shareware.com. Other top shopping sites include Columbia
House, ZD-Net, CUS, and Amazon.com. These fun facts and more can be found
in the latest PC-Meter press releases, and details can be had if you

founded last March, is just gathering steam, notably with PGP e-mail
products and the much-needed PGPcookie.cutter application. The cookie
blocking program enables you to control the cookies (essentially hidden
footnotes) Web sites leave around on your machine. If you want anonymity

contributions from "true believers", most material appears to come from

Tim Dick, president and COO of the WorldPages directory we featured last
issue, is a tad miffed that we called his baby a "one-stop stalker's shop."
He wrote us to say WorldPages carefully ensures that only information which
is publicly volunteered appears on the site. He adds: "We must request that
you position us differently ASAP as we'd rather not get into legal and
libel issues. I suggest 'The First One-Stop Directory - find people,
business, URLs, e-mails all in one place'." So there you go.

<B><A NAME="BS1">TO BE, OR NOT TO BE: THAT'S THE MACOS QUESTION</A></B>
<P>
Be, Inc. is raising quite a buzz in Silicon Valley. Their BeBox (not named
after our esteemed publisher), a nifty machine with the multimedia
capabilities of the Mac and the flexibility of Unix, is generating serious
feelings of hardware lust among the Valley hacker crowd. Be made headlines
by dancing the acquisition minuet with Apple, which is seeking a boost for
the aging MacOS. More recently, Be struck a deal with Apple clone maker
Power Computing to ship the BeOS operating system on PowerMac clones. Now
comes word that they are working on porting Linux to their hot BeBox. The
Be site has many screen shots and a listing of where their roadshow will be
doing demonstrations. Could Be be the Apple computer of tomorrow? You may
want to put some money on that. Take a look and judge for yourself.

If you've ever wanted to own your own radio station but held back because
of that pesky government license requirement, this software will be of
interest to you. Media Server and Media Player will in combination deliver
audio over the Net. Perhaps the most interesting aspect of this
announcement is that about 40 companies have signed up to support the new
broadcast standard, which Netscape and Progressive Networks (RealAudio)
jointly developed. Beta copies are available for download, as is a fairly
succinct FAQ document. Announcement:

<B><A NAME="BS4">WORLDCHAT SHOWCASES ACTIVEX CAPABILITIES</A></B>
<P>
WorldChat is a new network of chat servers built specifically on
Microsoft's Conference Server and ActiveX technology. This barely
international network of chat servers provides audio-based conferencing,
whiteboard utilities, and a member search service. They are currently
running 10 servers, nine in the US and one in Denmark. Chatters can hook up
using either standard IRC software or proprietary clients like Microsoft's
MIChat. The site is heavily Microsoft centric; you won't even see their
home page without a browser that supports ActiveX, Microsoft's competition
for Java. If you want to know how Microsoft stacks up in the server wars,
give them a look. <A HREF="http://www.worldchat.org/">"http://www.worldchat.org/"</A>

<B><A NAME="BS5">NETADDRESS OFFERS FREE E-MAIL</A></B>
<P>
There may be no free lunch, but these days there's free e-mail. In this
case, you get your freebie if you can endure some advertising. You read
your free e-mail anywhere via the Web, or have it forwarded to the POP
mailbox of your choice. Filtering rules can be applied to store, forward,
or delete your mail. They even have a feature which will collect your
e-mail from several ISPs and forward it to you. Sounds pretty useful, and
as the site says, "Hey, what do you have to lose? After all, it's free!"

<B><A NAME="BS6">HP UNVEILS NEW CRYPTO CONTROL FRAMEWORK</A></B>
<P>
Hewlett-Packard announced a new framework technology designed to let
governments enable and disable strong cryptography products. The framework
is independent of the method used in a given product. The heart of the
system is a small, tamper-resistant module with the cryptographic
algorithms that remain dormant until activated. A policy activation token
(basically some key bits) can be used to choose between the various crypto
algorithms stored on the module. The HP press release makes this sound like
the greatest thing since public key encryption, but in reality it appears
to be just another attempt to insert government control into private data
exchanges. Look for legislative attempts to make this technology mandatory
on all encryption products. Technology details are at the site.

<B><A NAME="OC1">SPAM ROUTES AROUND CENSORSHIP</A></B>
<P>
Sanford Wallace of CyberPromotions is nothing if not tenacious. Threatened
by court orders and large provider shutouts with losing access to millions
of potential spamees, Sanford has turned to that tried and true Internet
censorship remedy, the distributed spam network. Shortly before he lost his
Sprint Net access, he reportedly hired 10 sites which will allow him to
hook up a PC to their networks in return for about $1000 per month. This
will allow him to spam from multiple IP addresses, making it harder for
targets to filter out the offending sites. Will it work? Probably, for a
time. It's a classic evolutionary race (see the Red Queen hypothesis)
between the spammers and the blockers, and bears watching as proof (or
disproof) of the famous aphorism that the Net routes around censorship.

This exceptionally organized site devoted to the life and work of David
Seymour (1911-1956), political photojournalist, is the product of the
International Center of Photography/Midtown. The lives of David Seymour and
his friend Robert Capa were woven together by war, intellect, and the
everpresent camera. Many wonderful photographs run side by side with the

This elaborate and compelling exhibit presented by the Houston (Texas, USA)
Museum of Fine Art has over 60 exhibits from ancient Egypt. Though the
images are great, you must work around the poor graphic design of the pages
in several places - red text on black, for instance. The page provides
special information for teachers and students, and has RealAudio and
QuickTime VR files of interest.

Culturekiosque, resembling an online newsstand, dishes out culture with
European flair. The e-zine-like pages cover the opera scene, classical
music, archeological art, and cooking, in English, German, and French.
That's not all you get. When visitors first show up, they are presented
with an article on intelligent cyberagents. A tech section is in the works,
too. Journalists and critics writing for major dailies and specialist
magazines provide the content, which masterfully uses frames to keep the
organization simple and appealing. Did you know the composer Gioacchino
Rossini (Barber of Seville, William Tell) was as famous for his gastronomy
in his day as he was for his music?

If it's on your wall, it's trash. On somebody else's, it's art. That
appears to be the aesthetic at Digital Jungle's Graffiti from London. It's
a combination gallery, newswire, and e-zine on the London graffiti scene,
with scads of photographs of legally and illegally paint-bombed trains and
walls. In addition to the visual, the site features information on the
various London crews, short histories of favorite graffiti sights, and
latest news from the local graff community. An interview with local bomber
Ser sets the rhythm and rhyme of an artful subculture where the objets
d'art are often erased within days of their creation.

Now this is odd. You'd figure from the title, Entropy Gradient Reversals
(EGR), that this little e-zine would bring order to the universe. You'd be
wrong. The word we'll use to describe it is "dichotomous". It's about the
Internet, society, and Internet society, yet it's still hilarious. It's
light, but serious. It quotes Alexis de Tocqueville and Samuel Johnson, yet
literally shouts "holy shit!" at you - repeatedly, if you hit your back
button. EGR's produced by Christopher Locke, a.k.a. RageBoy, who ranks
somewhere between your uncle and Jerry Yang on the Net.fame.scale. To

appealing blend of scholarship and journalism. The first issue offers
multipage, conservatively and beautifully illustrated stories, such as one
about an archaeologist who works underwater in Hawaii to clarify "one of
the most bizarre and fascinating stories in American history." Other
features include an in-depth look at the American wine industry, poetry and
the workplace, a profile of solo theater artist Brenda Wong Aoki, a
multipart audio interview with ex-Los Angeles Laker star James Worthy, and
a background piece on a luncheonette pivotal in the American civil rights
movement. Let's hope the Smithsonian continues to fund this site. What a
premiere! <A HREF="http://www.si.edu/i+d/">"http://www.si.edu/i+d/"</A>

<B><A NAME="BEZ4">AMERICAN HISTORY, ABRIDGED</A></B>
<P>
For democracy to work, you need a sense of connectedness, and it helps to
know a little history. William M. Brinton has compressed 6,000 years of
American and pre-American history (most of it the past 200 years) into a
rich synopsis on the Web. To visit "An Abridged History of the United
States" is to return to history and civics classes in high school, with a
legal bent, without the pressure of quizzes. The target audience here
consists of teachers and other educators, but this should be required
reading for many students, too. Brinton's prose is leisurely,
authoritative, and expansive. You can read it online - with or without
frames - or download the entire textbook as a zipped or StuffIt archive.

RiotGrrl has a colossal reputation for pushing the boundaries of
traditional female roles and this page is no exception. Read about how it
feels to be a nude model, the fashion of actors as celebrities rather than
professionals, and Schneider and Fein's "The Rules: Time Tested Secrets for
Capturing the Heart of Mr. Right" book ("Shake your buns. Be quiet and
mysterious. Be feminine."). Brash, lively, and relevant.

Waaaay back, in NSD 1.20, we introduced two sites devoted to the
know-it-all, tell-it-all Cecil Adams and his "The Straight Dope" column. An
issue later, one disappeared. This week, none other than Cecil's own
editor, Ed Zotti, wrote to say that "The Straight Dope" hadn't given up the
ghost on the Web, it just moved. It's now a snazzy,
authorized-but-not-official site that's easy on the eyes and the download
clock, with a year's worth of legend-busting letters and answers. If you're
looking for "The Straight Dope" TV show, we suspect it has been euthanized,

Feast here, Web developers and lovers of Netscape: NetscapeWorld e-zine has
a wonderful collection of background articles and pointers on color,
intelligent agents, Java and JavaScript, audio, plug-ins, HTML 3.2, and
other nuts and bolts, along with the latest on trends in browsers and the
Web. Need more? There are news items and columns, book reviews, FAQs, and
technical information, too. A lot of the material pertains to Internet
Explorer and other browsers as well as to the browser king. The time to
frequent this site is now, while Netscape still rates at the top of most
Web surveys. You can bet a lot of Microsoft employees check this out.

Two Irish developers use their wry senses of humor to select Web pages and
snippets of e-mail and Usenet postings for this eclectic cybersampler. You
might get a Monty Python script, an extraterrestrial view from a NASA
probe, a look at the "Disturbing product of the month" (gourmet pet water,
for example), a "wacky, wrongful or weird ad", sound bites from
blockbusters and TV shows, audiovisual birthday cards, or e-mail humor. A
funny e-mail section called "Words Not Yet in the Dictionary" should be
highlighted and expanded rather than buried near the bottom of a page.

Mars won't stay out of the news it seems. Months after a NASA research team
announced evidence for past life on Mars, a British team has come forward
with supporting evidence and the claim that they actually had the story
seven years earlier. Meantime, the Russian Space Agency recently flung the
Mars 96 spacecraft toward the Red Planet, but fell a bit short - into the
Pacific, to be exact. Exciting stuff, maybe, but both pale before the
delightfully demented mind of Tim Burton and his retro-sci-fi flick "Mars
Attacks." Skip the snaps of itty-bitty Martian microbes and check out the
brain cases on these guys (beware the 7 MB QuickTime clip). Mars life, UK

Thanks to National Academy Press (NAP), you can access more than 1,000

mostly for researchers and others with professional interests, but
consumers are welcome and will quickly find much of topical interest,
including Auditorium Chat. NAP has collected digitized books in more than
26 categories in the Reading Room. Much of the dry prose comes from
government agencies, but tax dollars have at least made it plentiful,
far-reaching, and authoritative. Fresh Paint is a "What's New" with a
calendar, reviews, and discussions of hot topics in science. If you want

It's easy to think of Comdex, the monster computer trade show currently in
progress in Las Vegas, as a city within a city. The cynical (who, us?)
could call it a city of vapor within a land of fantasy, but the sheer size
and aspiration of the event calls for a certain awe. Think of it as the
equivalent of the Grateful Dead parking lot for chipheads. As befits a
thriving community, Comdex even has an e-zine. The Show Daily features
everything from summaries of the keynotes to product announcements to
columns by various industry luminaries. It's all refreshingly compact, and
provides a concise snapshot of the unwieldy event. Also check out the live
webcast site for spy cams, chats, and video clips. Daily:

<P>
Netscape CEO Jim Barksdale unveiled Constellation during his keynote speech
at Comdex, and immediately upped the ante for Microsoft in the browser
game. Constellation can best be thought of as an information workspace that
goes beyond the browser as an information presentation, organization, and
creation tool. It appears to be a souped-up desktop environment which will
also allow you to receive netcasts in various media and have access to your
information and applications while away from your home or office. Netscape
has committed to running Constellation on all platforms which now support
their browser. This site has a short but informative presentation. Expect
the press to go nuts.

<P>
After last issue's review of the Reader's Digest LookSmart site, we got a
couple of letters which castigated us for not giving the site its due.
Well, we're opinionated, but not (yet) infallible. In particular, we'll cop
to being quite wrong about the amount of content at the site, which is
indeed extensive. Put it down to a misreading of the user interface.
Apparently, LookSmart also got some angry letters from the gun crowd
complaining about a ban on firearm content. It's more a ban on gun
advertising than firearm content, as spelled out in their "About Us"
section. See our Letters to the Editor for more info. As it is, the second
look allows us to again urge you to take a look at the Java version of the
site, a great example of what you can do with the technology. For the
record, we actually rather like what they're doing.

<P>
Codie Smith was reasonably normal before he worked for Walt Disney, but
some time back this junior at Southwest Texas State University landed a
five-month gig as a "seasonal cast member on the custodial staff" at Walt
Disney World. In a word, he had to haul the Magic Kingdom's trash. The
result was not only a cleaner Walt Disney World, but a slightly weirder Web
and Codie. He presents "The Trash Cans of Disney," a repository for every
imaginable bit of information you could wish on Disney trash cans (which,
aside from the ones that might talk, look basically like everybody else's).
The site is a labor of love and looks it. If it's trash on Mickey you want,
here's the spot. <A HREF="http://www.swt.edu/~CS22517/">"http://www.swt.edu/~CS22517/"</A>

<B><A NAME="SS2">ROMAN CATACOMBS</A></B>
<P>
If you're feeling dead tired after a hard night's surfing, you might find
some heavenly rest at the Roman Catacombs. No, this is not an after-hours
club, but the real cyber-thing: a tour of the subterranean Christian burial
grounds of Rome. In the more than 80 that lie beneath the outskirts of
Rome, the common and the saintly rest together. Sounds creepy, but the site
is anything but. It delivers a scholarly review of the catacombs' history
and illuminates the symbolism in early Christian funerary art. Brief tours
of selected catacombs delve into the history of the sites and some of their
more famous residents (the catacombs of St. Callixtus boast 16 popes).
Spend enough time underground with the dead and you'll see it's a spiritual
tour you're on, not historical. <A HREF="http://www.catacombe.roma.it/welcome.html">"http://www.catacombe.roma.it/welcome.html"</A>

<B><A NAME="SS4">REMEMBERING THE GREAT CHICAGO FIRE</A></B>
<P>
It's not exactly a pleasant historical memory, but the Great Fire of 1871
certainly left an indelible mark on the people, property, and personality
of Chicago. Some would even venture to say that the post-fire rebuilding of
the city was the creative spark for Chicago's can-do attitude, innovative
architecture, and towering skyscrapers. All thanks to Mrs. O'Leary's
lantern-kicking cow - or so the story goes. For the 125th anniversary of
the big event, this site puts some cool perspective on a topic that's
particularly hot this year. <A HREF="http://www.chicagohs.org/fire/">"http://www.chicagohs.org/fire/"</A>

one memorable evening Peter the Great forced salad and vinegar into the
nose of a banquet guest until he vomited blood, then got the other guests
pissed on wine and in the middle of the night made them chop down a forest
to make a new walkway. Did you know William the Conquerer was so fat when
he died that his body burst during burial and stunk up the funeral? Exams
should be as insightful. <A HREF="http://www.owlnet.rice.edu/~four/histfacts.html">"http://www.owlnet.rice.edu/~four/histfacts.html"</A>

This refreshing home page is full of insights into Scott Christensen's
life. Devoid of cool site links or ego-boosting graphics, it's honest,
confrontational, and startlingly funny. His bike (Old Yella), his attempts
at juggling (start with hankerchiefs, then introduce some knives), his
night thoughts (the lifetime repercussions of reading poems out loud in
English class), and his one skill (perfecting an old Jewish man's accent,
with audio sample) are all detailed in candid banter. Setting a precedent
for quality. <A HREF="http://www.webcom.com/~sc/welcome.html">"http://www.webcom.com/~sc/welcome.html"</A>

come up with Web tools or pages to help teach their peers in several
categories. Prizes include college scholorship money for participants and
cash awards for both coaches and schools. The deadline for submission of
proposals is Jan. 31, 1997. Check out the finalists for 1996 which include
Java applets that render fractals in your browser window, a virtual
introduction to artists throughout the ages, and investment strategies for
kids with online audio business news updates. These kids are taking to
cyberspace like ducks to water and the world will never be the same again.

<B><A NAME="SS9">FINGERING EL CAPITAN</A></B>
<P>
It's rare for a site to be so well written you simply cannot stop reading.
Such is the site devoted to the story of the first blind person to climb El
Capitan (a great whopping rock wall) in Yosemite. Photos accompany the
tale, which comes with plenty of background on the climbers, and is just
plain compelling. You can even find out how they "do their business" at
3000 feet, should you be so inclined.

<B><A NAME="SS10">STRAIGHT FROM Q'S LAB</A></B>
<P>
Q, of course, is the mechanical mastermind behind James Bond's gadgets.
This site is a fake CIA museum, filled with a number of incendiary and
spying devices. The creations are supposedly based on real schematics and
technical drawings from the Agency. Even if they aren't real, they're
pretty interesting. Our faves include the dental bridge transceiver and the
infrared watch. Yes, they've found a way to make a Rolex even MORE
expensive! <A HREF="http://www.inch.com/~dna/">"http://www.inch.com/~dna/"</A>

<B><A NAME="SS11">PSYCHOTHERAPY VOYEURISM OR SIMPLY A SERIAL FOR PARTICIPATION?</A></B>
<P>
The Company Therapist, hypertext entertainment and creativity, lets readers
enter the world of Dr. Charles Balis, a psychiatrist who primarily sees
employees of a large computer company in San Francisco. Visitors can
explore the most personal records and examine the therapy session
transcripts. Readers are also invited to become writers and to create their
own patients and therapy sessions. You might call it Soap-on-a-Web.

<B><A NAME="SS12">FATTY ARBUCKLE AND THE FIRST HOLLYWOOD MURDER MYSTERY</A></B>
<P>
Roscoe Arbuckle didn't particularly care for his famous nickname. He cared
even less for being accused of murder. To discover the story behind the
headlines, drop in on Arbucklemania, a site devoted to the silent film
comic. There's a full filmography, as well as some interesting factoids.
The real story however, is the death of Virginia Parre and how it destroyed
Arbuckle's career. Though hardly an exact analogy to the OJ Simpson drama
(a.k.a. the Neverending Story), a comparison shows just how little the lot
of suspected celebrity murderers has changed in 70 years.

<P>
Ever wonder what it would take to achieve "Most Wanted" criminal status in
your city, state, or country? Hopefully not. But if you're the least bit
curious, it does involve a lot more than simply jay-walking or
double-parking. Now you can see the "baddest of the bad" for yourself by
viewing an overwhelmingly thorough line-up of mug shots and case histories
of today's most wanted robbers, murderers, and all-around thugs. Contact
information is provided so you can provide the authorities with possible

A team of journalists, photographers, and video artists from Utopia, a
global Internet development and consulting firm, began transmitting stories
about life in China in mid-October. They will continue to send digital
dispatches through the month of November. The group will visit five cities
in five weeks and there are special provisions for classroom participation.

<P>
Two nerds, who at one point used a flashlight to see their map in broad
daylight, decided to check out the only American highway Depeche Mode ever
sang about. Mark Evangelista and Glen Golightly have investigated Route 66
from tip to tail and discovered the best roadside attractions. See for
yourself with the back-seat-driver cam. Their best advice, should you
decide to follow in their tire tracks, is to break the law by bypassing the
barricades at the end of the road near Santa Monica ("Tell 'em Bob said it
was okay") and do the trip properly.

If you're planning to see the USA by automobile any time soon, you might

itinerary from city to city, from road to road. Going from Boston to
Bakersfield? Easy. Heading from Pierre to Peoria? Not a problem. You can
even work in particular points of interest, including hotels and
restaurants. Approximate travel times and mileage are included. Go ahead...

Ever felt woozy because of too much junk food and flat soft drinks on the
road? Check out the best truck stops, drive-ins, home cooking, and Mexican
spreads in the US and Canada and you'll never tempt malnutrition on the
road again. Read the travel stories (How the "Lock Babes" saved one family
from highway death), nominate your favorite spots, and find out the answers
to your most asked travel questions, like "Why are cops outside that
place?", "Where have all the Burma Shave signs gone?", and "What is Chili
Size?" Jack Kerouac never had it so good. <A HREF="http://www.eathere.com/">"http://www.eathere.com/"</A>

great deals on travel, eating, hotels, etc., and you'll want to pack your

holiday. Surprisingly enough, you can get just about anywhere in France by
boat. There's a bit of info on restaurants, hotels, and things to do. The

It's a good idea, a one-stop shopping site where you can compare, select,

Shopper NetBuyer seems a bit rusty before its time. Server errors pop up,
pages take days to load, and the product selection seems oddly truncated.
Growing pains undoubtedly, so it seems best to place the bookmark and check
back in a couple of months. <A HREF="http://www.netbuyer.com/">"http://www.netbuyer.com/"</A>

<B><A NAME="SS1">THE 1893 CHICAGO WORLD'S FAIR</A></B>
</P>
<P>
The World's Columbian Exposition, held in a newly rebuilt, post-Great Fire
Chicago, celebrated the discoveries and influences of explorer Christopher
Columbus. This magnificent tribute to endeavor and achievement not only
left its social, cultural, and architectural mark on the city of Chicago,
it influenced future fairs, museums, and expositions all over the world.
This site focuses on what the Fair looked like, who was there, what was on
display, and the aftermath of the event. Be sure to take the virtual tour
of the fairgrounds and see what it was like to be entertained at the turn
of the century. <A HREF="http://xroads.virginia.edu/~MA96/WCE/title.html">&lt;http://xroads.virginia.edu/~MA96/WCE/title.html&gt;</A><BR>

<B><A NAME="SS2">THE WEB'S DYNAMIC TOP 100</A></B>
</P>
<P>
"Top-site" Web sites abound, but the Web 100 wants to be tiptop. Rankings
of top sites are based on users' ratings and change automatically on the
fly. On the home page, you'll see a note on the site of the hour such as:
"MOVING UP! Voyager jumped from #58 to #54 in the rankings from 6:00 a.m.
to 7:00 a.m. PDT.") The rankings are nice, but you're more likely to return
for the convenience of organization - sites are organized by general topics
without prizes, but it'll help you find many sites that are as meaty as
they are popular. Hey, wouldn't it be cool if Netsurfer Digest got on
there? Like 100,000 times? <A HREF="http://www.web100.com/">&lt;http://www.web100.com/&gt;</A><BR>

<B><A NAME="SS3">HOW DO I LEARN 2?</A></B>
</P>
<P>
In what is perhaps one of the most useful acts of Web creation ever, the
founders of the Learn2.com site have put together a grab bag of the little
details you need to know to take a stumble-free walk across the tapestry of
life. The Learn2.com site has tutorials intended to assist in getting
through events such as changing tires, leasing cars, or the ever-important
"Understanding Baseball". The "2torials" offered by this site represent
some of the best advice (on some very arcane topics) that the Internet has
to offer. Trouble tying that tie? Don't call Mom, click Learn2.Com.

<P>
<B><A NAME="SS4">ASK A STUPID QUESTION...</A></B>
</P>
<P>
Designed as a repository for the stupidest questions that plague society,
the StupidQuest Web site does its utmost to obfuscate anything that might
even slightly resemble actual fact. Site caretaker Captain Stupid answers
the really big questions, such as "What animal does naugahide (sic) come
from?" and "What do they wrap around styrofoam when they ship it?"
(Answers: the nauga beast; nothing.)  <A HREF="http://www.stupidquest.com/">&lt;http://www.stupidquest.com/&gt;</A><BR>

<P>
<B><A NAME="SS5">E-MAIL VIRTUAL FOOD</A></B>
</P>
<P>
E-mail postcards have gone from novelty to staple of the Internet. To keep
some of the spice, the creators of the Mail a Meal site have cooked up a
storm to try and recapture some of that novelty. Instead of sending a
friend, acquaintance, or loved one a simple postcard, use Mail a Meal to
deliver an entire virtual repast via e-mail to the target glutton. Apart
from simply being a great idea, the Mail a Meal site also features some of
the most mouth-watering and tantalizing images of food we've seen.

<B><A NAME="SS6">DOG BREED SITE WITH TEETH</A></B>
</P>
<P>
"Best of Breed Online" is a handy resource for the dog owner and dog lover.
You can look up canines by breed name, breed type (sporting, herding, etc.)
or picture. Breeds are organized alphabetically, with in-depth descriptions
and photos to give you an overview of a great range of dogs from
Affenpinscher to Yorkshire Terrier. If you're not a pure-breed type, that's
OK. This site is great for figuring out what your mutts are made of.

<B><A NAME="SS7">AN EXHAUSTIVE CYBERSPACE TOUR THROUGH SOCIOLOGY</A></B>
</P>
<P>
This rich and heavy site can quickly send the unwary cybertraveler into
information overload. The sociological tour-de-force ranges from
commentaries and essays to data and links covering time, aging, death and
dying, family, mass media, and more. If you find the torrent of content
intimidating or boring, check out the Op-Ed articles at the end of the long
first page. Well worth a visit if you simply ignore the horrid backgrounds
and occasional blinking text. <A HREF="http://www.trinity.edu/~mkearl/index.html">&lt;http://www.trinity.edu/~mkearl/index.html&gt;</A><BR>

No longer need lost souls lurk on the Internet. They can find all the
directions they need in Zip2. This set of online yellow pages offers
several features. You can search near addresses, get door-to-door
directions, search via map, and more. Zip2 includes more than 16 million
businesses in the USA. One caveat: the site's graphics do slow down the
process, and while 'twould be nice to have a text-only option, none exists.

"Silence of the Lambs", the mug shot collection, and the images from Nazi
Germany. If you've ever had a hankering to read essays like "Butchering the
Human Carcass for Human Consumption" or "My Life of Molesting Children",
then this is the place to start. Pursue perversion on an intellectual

There's no such thing as overachievement at the Academy of Achievement, a
site designed to inspire young people to great heights through education
and emulation of 20th-century giants. In each "Gallery of Achievers" (halls
of arts, business, public service, sports, etc.), men and women are honored
and exhibited with a biography and interview. The Academy is selective. The
Hall of Sports honors Dr. Tenley Albright, Susan Butcher, Julius Irving,
Willie Mays, Herschel Walker, and John Wooden. "Steps to Success" groups
achievers by qualities - passion, vision, preparation, courage,
perseverance, and integrity - and includes audio clips. Other resources
abound. What's holding you back? Go forth and achieve.

Mapping Your Future (MYF) takes an ambitious stab at the guidance counselor
biz. Guided tours explain how to choose a career, select a school, and pay
for an education. The Planning a Career section, for example, includes
information on career goals and planning, occupations, job hunting tips,
interview techniques, and resume writing. A search engine helps you find
specific topics. Not a fly-by-night or marketing site, MYF is sponsored by
state agencies that administer the US Federal Family Education Loan
Program, which provides low-interest loans to students and parents to help
pay for education beyond high school. It's a must-see if there's a high
school kid in the house. <A HREF="http://mapping-your-future.org/">&lt;http://mapping-your-future.org/&gt;</A><BR>

One of your favorite generals, little Napoleon, is now being honored
online. That's right, it's the virtual Napoleon! Learn more about his
military campaigns, his life, and - alas - his eventual downfall. The
Napoleon Foundation, which sponsors this site, also presents information on
Napoleonic collections. You might want to don sunglasses before viewing

Spiral. Shoestring. Waffle-cut. Home-style. Greasy. Salty. And definitely

sizes and standard colors than you probably ever seriously considered. To
see what we mean, simply stop by this enthusiastic fry-filled site.
Highlights include an official color standard chart and an experiment on
poutine, the cheese curd, gravy (not wavy), and french fry dish so popular
in Quebec that even MacDonald's serves it, though not well.

The intersection between the sets of computer weenies and the Dungeons and

official Web site would have arrived years ago, as did officially
unappreciated unofficial sites. It might have, if not for the arguably
technophobic chiefs at TSR, the company that publishes the game. Bending to
equally arguable progress, the TSR site has arrived online with grace and
generosity. The beautiful pages are not quite fully woven, but any and all
information about TSR and its games a person could want is here. TSR has
even promised to upload about two dozen adventures for free download. You
can also get game products previously available only on AOL and a limited
FTP site. It took time, but it was worth it. <A HREF="http://www.tsrinc.com/">&lt;http://www.tsrinc.com/&gt;</A><BR>

Two teenaged boys were killed in Arkansas in August 1987. These deaths are
surrounded in controversy, mystery, and allegations of a government
coverup. It's got everything a good mystery needs: death; drugs;
conspiracy; and blackmail. The only thing missing is the sex. The mother of
one of the boys killed in the "train deaths" presents her case, but some
might consider this conspiracy hooey. <A HREF="http://www.idmedia.com/ttd.htm">&lt;http://www.idmedia.com/ttd.htm&gt;</A><BR>

The CNN Travel Guide is on its way to becoming a comprehensive site for
those about to hit the road. "Destinations" lets you select information by
locale (Alsace, say) or topic (art exhibits, for instance, or "Fall

reflect headlines on the evening news; others provide background (e.g.
"Egypt bans animals [and their mess] at Pyramids" and "Frustrated French
tourists take 'hostages'") you might not find elsewhere. Despite the
quality, one recent Sunday morning we found some pages slow to load across
a residential ISDN line, and some links produced a "Document contains no

including links to graphics. In addition, the ad is placed on our Web
site and a link is provided from Netsurfer Digest issues to the ad.

Creation of a special resource publication/page</B> - 
If you are targeting a specific market segment with a well
defined interest profile, we can tailor assemble a publication which
will interest them. We specialize in assembling online resources into 
concise and coherent coverage of a topic. Your company will be the sole
sponsor, the publication will be e-mailed out to our subscribers and
advertised widely on various web indexes (e.g. Yahoo, Lycos), as well as
being permanently placed on our web site. It can also be used in print
advertising.

Payment in full must be received before an ad is run.


<P>
<H3><A NAME="CD">Closing Dates</A></H3>
 
<P>
The Digest is published roughly every 7 to 10 days (we're constrained by
how long it takes to mail out any given issue).
You can always find out the next publication date by calling us and
asking.
<P>
Advertising copy is due 3 days before publication date.

<P>
Cancellations should be made 1 week prior to publication date.


<P>
<H3><A NAME="SG">Submission Guidelines</A></H3>

<P>
Copy should be plain text or HTML in an e-mail message.

<P>
Graphics should be GIF89a (preferred) or JPEG, e-mailed or sent by FTP.  We
can also grab graphics from your web site. Try to keep graphics at less
then 10K file size. We recommend 60x500 pixels for your banners but you
can use any reasonable geometry you like. File size is more important.

<P>
We can support Java and Javascript applets embedded in your ads, but you
should not assume that our readers will be connected to the Internet
when browsing their issue of the Digest.

<P>
Avoid sending us stuff in word processing formats (e.g. no Microsoft
Word documents) or oddball encoding (e.g. don't use BinHex, or ZIP)
Stick with the universal cross-platform standards and use plain text
or UUENCODE.


<P>
<H3><A NAME="CH">Counting Impressions and Hits</A></H3>

<P>
Placement of advertising within Netsurfer Digest and Marketplace
generates a guaranteed minimum number of impressions based on the
current size of our mailing list. Beyond this minimum there is a large,
though imprecisely measured, number of readers who receive our
publications and mailings through other redistribution web sites,
mailing list exploders, and Bulletin Board Systems throughout the world.

<P>
Note that measuring hits from Netsurfer Digest is <B>NOT</B> like
measuring hits from your average ordinary web site because the Digest is
really a mailing list. However, measurement is quite easy. The hits come
directly from a users browser to your site, without going through our
web server. We can work with your technical representatives to set up
special links from your ads to your web site. These links can be used to
count only the hits made on your web pages from Netsurfer ads. You can
collect your own hit counts using your own favorite tools on your own
schedule with no need to have us get involved.

<P>
Also note that since we don't charge extra for changing your ads, you can
adjust your ad copy/graphics in order to improve the response over the course
of an ad campaign.

<P>
We can also arrange for what are known as "split ads" where some set of
our readers receives one version of the ad, and another set receives
another version. The response rates can then be compared and the ad
campaign adjusted accordingly.

<P>
<H3><A NAME="LG">Legal Fine Print</A></H3>

<P>
No conditions, printed or otherwise, appearing on insertion orders,
contracts, insertion instructions, or any other form of correspondence
that conflict with the policies in this rate card will be binding on 
the publisher.

<P>
By placing advertising with Netsurfer all advertisers agree to
abide by the legal disclaimers and conditions noted in our Fine

<H2>ASK WOODY about SPOOFING ATTACKS</H2>

<H4>Bill Woodcock, Zocalo Engineering (woody@zocalo.com)</H4>
<HR>

<P>
<B>Q:</B>  I have a consulting client that wants to get connected
to the Internet, but I've been reading in the popular press about
the many security concerns that entails.  What are the potential
risks and vulnerabilities my client would face?  What is a firewall,
and how could one protect my client?  What's an Ethernet data encryptor,
and would that be any help?
<P>
<I>          Michael Lipson, Macintosh Consultant, TeamNet Technologies,
San Francisco, California. </I>
<P>
<B>Q:</B>  Alright; I give up; I've read much about the spoofing
incident that occurred recently, but none of the reporters had
any idea what they were talking about; can you explain what spoofing
really is, and what happened that got the press all excited?
<P>
<B>Q:  </B>How could a router get confused, and think that an
external address is actually an internal address?  I know I'm
gonna read shortly in Wired's Jargon-Watch column that someone
in the office spoofed the job of his superior or that some marketeer
spoofed his competitors presentation; I'd like to understand what
it really means before it's too late.
<P>
          <I>Stuart Fischbach, Networking Consultant, S'Ware,
Danbury, Connecticut.</I>
<P>
<B>Q:</B>  A recent CERT advisory describes an IP spoofing attack
that relies on the predictability of TCP sequence numbers generated
by Berkeley kernels.  Does the fact that A/UX is System V based
exempt it from this kind of attack?
<P>
<I>          Fred Condo, System Administrator, Lightside Corporation,
Covina, California.</I>
<P>
<B>A:</B>  The press' recent reports on the spoofing attack on
a diskless workstation at the San Diego Supercomputer Center last
December 25 have spurred a great many people to reexamine security
at their Internet-connected sites, and a general lack of understanding
of the issues involved has lead the non-technically inclined press
to propagate misinformation about the specific attack and about
security on the Internet in general.
<P>
An unfortunate result is that during the past few weeks a great
many network administrators have suddenly been told to do something
about this spoofing thing by people who know only what they've
gleaned from alarmist reports in the press. 
<P>
The first and most important thing to understand in connection
with the explosion of paranoia is that Macintoshes running the
Macintosh operating system, even if theyre running MacTCP and
operating as servers on the Internet, are not vulnerable to this
threat in any way.
<P>
The specific attack which prompted the flurry of press coverage
relied upon three factors:
<P>
1.  The network on which the target machine resided was connected
to the Internet by means of a router which allowed packets with
local IP source addresses to enter from its Internet side.  Despite
widespread knowledge that this is a security hole, this has been
standard behavior heretofore, although in the wake of the press
attention paid this attack, many network administrators are emplacing
filters to discard such packets in the future.   
<P>
2.  The target machine used a predictable method of generating
TCP sequence numbers.  A sequence number is the numerical tag
common to a stream of packets between any two devices that serves
to identify those packets as belonging to a transaction unique
from any others. In other words, they tell a machine which of
the many conversations it's conducting an incoming packet is associated
with.  Sequence numbers were intended to be random, but under
Berkeley Software Distribution-based Unix systems, they're actually
very predictable, since the Unix host simply increments the number
by a fixed amount each second, and for each new transaction. 
This is an unfortunate feature common to many Unix implementations
<P>
3.  The target machine was part of a web of trusted hosts, which
had special permissions with respect to each other.  The collection
of software which implements the trusted-host relationships is
sometimes referred to as the r-utilities, since most of the individual
pieces begin with the letter r, short for remote.  Specifically,
utilities like rsh, which opens a shell on a remote host, and
rlogin, which opens a terminal session on a remote host, are points
of vulnerability.  These utilities are commonly used on Unix machines
everywhere.
<P>
Each of these three criteria must be met for this particular sort
of attack to succeed.
<P>
This combination of factors, while common enough on Unix hosts
at large sites, does not occur at all on MacOS-using Macintoshes,
since they don't meet the third criterion: none of the Unix utilities
which are exploited after the first two conditions are met can
run under the Macintosh operating system.  Even ported versions,
if they were to become available, would not make the Macintosh
vulnerable, since the vulnerability is really not in the utilities
themselves, but in the nature of a multiuser permissions-based
operating system.
<P>
Apple's A/UX based Workgroup Servers and workstations are potentially
at risk, if both the other conditions are met, and utilities like
rlogin, rsh, and the like are running.  Since these utilities
aren't necessary to the operation of a purely AppleTalk-serving
Workgroup Server, they can be safely turned off if that's all youre
using your server for, by disabling the appropriate ports in /etc/servers
or /etc/services.
<P>
Since those utilities are often essential to the way Unix-users
work, and removing them doesn't guard against other methods of
intrusion anyway, most sites may more profitably address the first
criterion on the list, IP packets with local trusted source addresses
(i.e. spoofed packets) entering the network from outside.
<H4>Spoofing/TCP Sequence Prediction Attack Explained</H4>

<P>
The attack on the SDSC workstation rigorously followed the steps
outlined in Robert Morris' (Sr., the security expert, not Jr.,
author of the Internet Worm) 1985 paper "A Weakness in the 4.2BSD
Unix TCP/IP Software".  That paper described a security hole in
the r-utilities, which use IP address as a means of authenticating
trusted hosts.  Users or machine administrators can define a list
of hosts which can execute commands or open shells remotely with
special privileges, as though by a user operating from within
a local account.  This is a great convenience in a low-security
atmosphere with a high degree of trust, where users maintain accounts
on multiple hosts, and must work back and forth between them frequently.
Unfortunately, it also creates a potential problem, spoofing,
wherein an unauthorized host sends packets purporting to be from
a trusted host, and takes advantage of the special permissions
allotted the trusted host.
<P>
Two mechanisms exist to prevent this in even an otherwise unprotected
network.
<P>
First and most simply, when a packet seeking to initiate a TCP
circuit (TCP SYN) is sent to the target host using the forged
address of a trusted host, the target host will acknowledge the
request with a response (TCP SYN_RCVD) directed to the trusted
host, not the machine which actually forged and sent the packet.
 The trusted host, seeing an acknowledgment of a packet it has
no record of having sent, will send a packet (TCP RST) back to
the target, telling it to tear down the circuit.
<P>
Second, and slightly more complicated, IP hosts use a 32-bit number
to uniquely identify TCP circuits, such that it can determine
which of many open circuits any newly-received TCP packet belongs
to.  If a host uses forgery to open a TCP connection putatively
between the target and a trusted host, it will never see any packets
sent by the target host, including the one which assigns the sequence
number, necessary to correctly tag packets so that the target
will recognize them as belonging to the forged circuit.
<P>
In addition, there's the more general difficulty of maintaining
a useful connection to a remote host when you can't see any replies
from that host.
<P>
Both of the two technical problems are unfortunately surmountable,
as documented in Morris' paper.
<P>
To nullify the problem of the trusted host tearing down any circuit
a forger requests, and generally prevent it from responding to
packets sent to it through a forged circuit, a port on that host
is chosen which is only intended to listen for incoming connections.
 Such ports have limited capacity to deal with unanticipated problems
like unrequested circuits being acknowledged.  Specifically, they
have a queue of limited length for dealing with incoming connection
requests; since a host which requests a circuit of the trusted
host has, by definition, IP connectivity with the trusted host,
the trusted host assumes that a small queue will be all that's
necessary for stacking up such packets, since they'll be quickly
dealt with.  If, however, it receives connection requests from
hosts which are unreachable, not normally a possibility, this
queue can be overrun, and the trusted host will no longer be able
to deal with new connection requests on that port.  Thus the forger
must send a flurry of also-forged connection requests to the port
it wishes to emulate on the trusted host, using bogus and unreachable
sender addresses.  This busies out that port on the trusted host,
leaving it unable to send a TCP RST packet to the target.
<P>
Unfortunately it turns out that the second problem, determining
the sequence number of a circuit you cannot see, is easier than
it should be.  Whereas sequence numbers should be pseudorandom,
most types of Unix actually generate them by simply adding some
number to the sequence number assigned to the most recently created
circuit.  Thus by attempting several sequential new connections
to the target host using its own real address, the forging machine
can determine the pattern by which sequence numbers are being
generated, and predict the next one to be assigned with reasonable
accuracy.
<P>
To put these parts together into a whole attack, the forger first
uses utilities like finger, showmount, and rpcinfo to determine
what relationships of trust may exist between the target host
and other hosts.  Next, the forger chooses a machine which has
a trusted host relationship to the target machine, and busies
out one of its listener ports.  Port 513, the login port, was
chosen in the actual attack.  To busy out the port, it sends a
series of TCP SYNs with bogus, but unreachable, sender addresses.
 These quickly fill the queue which the trusted host uses to deal
with incoming login requests, since it's busily failing to reach
the purported senders with its SYN_RCVD responses.  Any additional
incoming packets overflow this queue and are ignored.
<P>
Next, the forger sends a series of perfectly valid TCP SYNs to
the target, which the target responds to with a series of SYN_RCVDs,
each including a sequence number.  The sequence numbers are analyzed,
and the next one is predicted.
<P>
Next, the forger sends a TCP SYN to the target, this time using
the sender address of the trusted host, rather than the forger's
own address.  The target acknowledges the TCP SYN with a SYN_RCVD,
including the sequence number for the circuit, but it sends this
packet to the trusted host, rather than to the forger.  The trusted
host ignores the packet, because the packet is replying to port
513, its busied-out login port.  The forger, however, operating
on the assumption that the SYN_RCVD packet was sent, acknowledges
it with an ESTABLISHED packet, using the sequence number it predicted.
 If the sequence number was predicted correctly, there will now
be a valid circuit open into the target host, albeit one from
which the forger will never see a reply packet.
<P>
To finish the attack, the forger must take advantage of the privileges
accorded the trusted host, and secure some means of logging back
into the target host with a full bi-directional connection.  In
the actual attack, this was accomplished by adding a line to the
.rhosts file in the target machines root directory according trusted
host status to all comers.
<P>
Lastly, the forger cleans up by forging ESTABLISHED packets in
acknowledgment of all the SYN_RCVDs presumably sent by the trusted
host, and then tears down those connections with RSTs; and does
the same for the circuits used to determine the sequence number
generation method on the target host.
<P>
As you can see, this process, while conceptually simple, would
be immensely difficult to actually carry out, given the necessity
of operating completely in the dark, as it were, without ever
receiving acknowledgment from the target host.  Nonetheless, as
with the sendmail security holes of the past, once its been demonstrated
feasible once, no matter how difficult, it will undoubtedly be
repeated by other crackers.  This is sufficient reason to assure
yourself that your site won't be vulnerable to such an attack.
 As I said before, this attack relied upon the forgers ability
to insert forged packets into the target hosts local network,
the predictability of TCP sequence numbers generated by the target
host, and the unfortunate dependency of the r- utilities upon
IP addresses for authentication.
<P>
Macintoshes running the MacOS aren't vulnerable as they don't run
the r-utilities, but nearly all of you run multi-platform networks,
or have A/UX hosts, and would be loath to give up all the utilities
which employ IP-based authentication, so that's not sufficient
security.
<P>
Predictability of TCP sequence numbers is something we can't do
anything about as network administrators, save demand that vendors
use a more sensible scheme.  Worse, regardless of the scheme vendors
employ, pseudorandom numbers will always be vulnerable, given
that the forger has an unlimited amount of time to determine the
mechanism.
<P>
This leaves firewalling the network, such that packets which are
forged with the address of a local host cannot enter the network
in the first place.  Although firewalls are normally a very bad
alternative to real system security, since they generally present
a greater inconvenience to the valid users than to skilled crackers,
this is one case in which a filter presents no inconvenience at
all to authorized users while acting as an effective barrier to
attackers.
<P>
Quite a few routers are capable of acting as firewalls; those
in most common use seem to be made by Cisco and Livingston, so
for the sake of convenience, I'll present the steps necessary to
add trusted-address-spoofing protection to routers made by those
two vendors.  If you follow the examples, you should be able to
apply the same methods to any other router which supports the
same functionality, albeit through a slightly different configuration
interface.
<H4>Configuring Cisco Access Lists to Confound Spoofing</H4>

<P>
Cisco packet filters are defined in one group of commands, and
then applied within the applicable interface.  To create a firewall
to protect against spoofing, use the commands
<PRE>
    access-list  X  deny    Net-Address  Inverted-Mask
    access-list  X  permit  0.0.0.0      255.255.255.255
</PRE>

<P>
where X is the number of the access list (which for IP filters
must be chosen from the range 1-100), Net-Address is your IP network
number, and Inverted-Mask is the inverse of the mask which would
ordinarily define the type of network youre using.
<P>
For instance, at my site, one class B network (157.22.0.0) and
two class C nets (198.182.167.0 and 198.207.242.0) are protected
behind our firewall.  Inverting the net-masks which would ordinarily
be used to define class B and class C nets gives us 0.0.255.255
and 0.0.0.255, respectively, so we have the following access-list
definition:
<PRE>
    access-list  1  deny    157.22.0.0     0.0.255.255
    access-list  1  deny    198.182.167.0  0.0.0.255
    access-list  1  deny    198.207.242.0  0.0.0.255
    access-list  1  permit  0.0.0.0        255.255.255.255
</PRE>

<P>
The last line is an explicit permission to pass any packets which
are not discarded by the preceding rules.  This is necessary,
since Cisco's default action is to discard any packets which aren't
explicitly permitted.
<P>
Next we have to apply the access-list to our upstream interface,
the one which connects our net to the Internet.  Since in my case
this is a T1 on serial interface 0, I use the following lines
to assign the access-list to the interface:
<PRE>
    interface Serial0
    ip access-group 1 in
</PRE>

<P>
Note three things here: first, that Cisco uses the terminology
access-group when referring to assignment within an interface,
as opposed to access-list when defining the component rules of
the list, since youre assigning the interface to a group of interfaces
which share the characteristics of the access list in common.
 Second, the last word is in, meaning that this filter is to be
applied to packets as they enter the router through the serial
0 interface, rather than as they exit the router. This is crucial,
since if you specified out, youd have just filtered all your own
traffic, and disconnected yourself from the Internet!  Third,
it's important that you apply the filter to inbound packets on
the upstream interface, rather than outbound packets on the local
LAN interface, because your routers LAN interface uses a local
address; if you applied the filter to the LAN interface, you'd
no longer be able to receive packets from your own router.
<P>
One last change you may wish to make in order to prevent crackers
from taking advantage of a related IP routing security hole is
to disable IP source-routing, which could potentially allow the
rerouting of internal packets through external, unsecured, networks.
<P>
In general configuration mode, enter the command:
<PRE>
    no    ip    source-route
</PRE>

<P>
When you've finished applying your access-list, don't forget to
write your changes back out to the permanent configuration, and
back them up to any other copies of your configuration file you
may keep outside the router.
<H4>Configuring Livingston Packet Filters to Prevent Spoofing
</H4>

<P>
Livingston's method for creating and applying packet filters is
much like Cisco's, if a little more terse.  As before, the first
task is to create and name a filter, and then add the exclusion
criteria to it:
<PRE>
    add    filter    Name
    set    filter    Name    Rule-Number    deny    Net-Address/Mask-Bits
    0.0.0.0/0
</PRE>

<P>
Here, a filter is Named, rather than numbered, and a Rule-Number
is used to uniquely identify each component of the filter, a feature
dictated mostly by the nature of Livingston's command-line configuration
editor.
<P>
For instance, to create a filter which would work here, I'd use
the following commands:
<PRE>
    add  filter  internet.in
    set  filter  internet.in  1  deny  157.22.0.0/16     0.0.0.0/0
    set  filter  internet.in  2  deny  198.182.167.0/24  0.0.0.0/0
    set  filter  internet.in  3  deny  198.207.242.0/24  0.0.0.0/0
</PRE>

<P>
Note that the format of the masking is different, and a bit more
standard, in Livingston's configuration method than in Cisco's rather
than specifying the inverse of a dotted-quad mask, you simply
specify the number of one-bits from the left side of the mask.
 Thus a class B mask, 255.255.0.0, which is 1111 1111 1111 1111
0000 0000 0000 0000 in binary, becomes /16, while a class C mask,
255.255.255.0, which is 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 0000 0000
in binary, becomes /24.
<P>
To apply the filter to a specific interface, in this case serial
port 0, use the set command as follows:
<PRE>
    set  s0  ifilter  internet.in
</PRE>

<P>
Here, ifilter is used to indicate that the filter is to be applied
to packets entering the interface, whereas ofilter would indicate
an output filter.
<P>
IP source-routing need not be explicitly disabled on the Livingston.  It's
such a bad idea that they dont let you do it in the first place.
<P>
Again, remember to save your changes, and recall that on the Livingston,
changes are saved to the permanent configuration, rather than
the currently-running one, so youll probably want to reset the
interface immediately to put them into effect:
<PRE>
    save  all
    reset s0
</PRE>

<H4>Three-Quarters of the Way Through the Column,  I Finally Get
Around to Answering the Questions</H4>

<P>
<B>What are the potential risks an Internet-connected company
faces?</B>
<P>
I'd say that most of them are human-factors sort of problems,
better dealt with through policy and management than via technical
means.  For example, one of the most common problems I see is
employees of Internet connected companies failing to appreciate
the difference between replying to the sender of a piece of electronic
mail, and replying to all addressees of the mail.  This can lead
to terrible embarrassment, particularly when an employee is perceived
to be speaking on behalf of the company, in official capacity.
 I've seen companies give up external electronic mail connections
entirely after an employee stupidly broadcasts some badmouthing
of a person or product to a huge mailing list, containing press,
competitors, customers, and what-have-you.  A variation of this
is hot-headed employees who spout off in public fora, while using
their company electronic mail accounts, again appearing to speak
for the company, despite the fact that they may have no authorization
to do so at all.  Many companies require that all postings from
company machines contain a disclaimer, unless theyre sent by a
specifically authorized representative of the company, like a
public relations officer.
<P>
Another example is mismanagement of valid servers.  Your company
may have servers publicly accessible via the net.  There's no technical
means of preventing server administrators or even users from accidentally
putting confidential information on public servers.  Only an effective
corporate security policy can teach people to be careful.
<P>
Last, and perhaps most trivial, any company that connects to the
net will see some initial period of lower productivity, while
technically-unskilled employees come up to speed on using it,
and the technically-skilled go net-surfing.  Soon enough the former
will get things figured out, and the latter will get bored and
go back to work.
<P>
<B>What are reasonable firewall options?</B>
<P>
As I said, firewalls are generally a bad idea.  Most firewalls
I've seen are terrible overkill, making a company's expensive network
connection worthless for most of the purposes it's best suited
for, and annoying users and customers alike.  The best network
security is system security, making sure that all the passwords
on all your hosts are unguessable, and that known security holes
in system and networking software are plugged.  The network is
meant to transport packets, not hinder them.  That said, there
may be a very few specific instances in which the most efficient
and effective means of achieving a security objective is to simply
filter some sort of packet out at the point at which it enters
your network.  If you're sure you've identified such a situation,
and you can't think of any better way to achieve the same goal
on your hosts, then a filter is called for.
<P>
<B>What are Ethernet data encryptors?</B>
<P>
They're devices which are either implemented in software inserted
below your IP protocol stack, or in hardware between a network
interface and the network wire itself.  They take all outgoing
Ethernet packets and encrypt them, and decrypt all incoming packets.
 Obviously, this sort of solution is only good against outside
intrusion, since it's transparent to any hosts already on your
network.  As a result, its generally used on point-to-point links,
like the serial lines connecting portions of a wide-area-network.
 Those links are relatively secure anyway (In the U.S. thats no
longer the case, since the NSA recently pushed a bill through
Congress requiring all telecommunications and encryption equipment
vendors to put vulnerable back doors into all their equipment,
to facilitate tapping), so it's largely wasted effort.  And since
any communications across the Internet are likely to be with random
hosts belonging to other companies, no encryption is possible,
at least until public-key technology is integrated much more fully
into our network infrastructure than it is today.
<P>
<B>How could a router get confused, and think an external address
is really an internal address?</B>
<P>
It's not quite so simple as that.  First of all, a router has
no way of determining the ultimate origin of a packet; all it
has to look at is the source IP address, which is written by the
sender, and therefore not necessarily trustworthy.  The problem
isn't external addresses being mistaken for internal addresses,
it's packets with internal addresses appearing within the router,
and being routed normally.  Routers don't ordinarily check to see
what port a packet arrives on, they just worry about delivering
it out the correct port to get it to its destination.  Routers
sometimes have to deal with many thousands of packets each second,
and it's speed optimizations like these that allow them to perform
at that level.  In cases like we're discussing here, though, an
input filter is practical, since it allows the router to discard
the forged packet before it would normally determine what port
to deliver it to, and thus doesn't take particularly longer to
deal with than a normal packet would.  Besides, such packets are
likely to be coming in over slower wide-area-network interfaces,
where blazing performance isn't an issue.
<P>

TCP Sequence Number cracks should examine the two papers which

<P>
Java is an object-oriented programming language developed by Sun and
optimized for the creation of distributed, executable applications.
Netscape, in its drive to become the Microsoft of the online world has
just licensed this technology from Sun.  Java is currently in the alpha
technology demonstration stage and currently it only runs on Suns, 
In-house ports to Windows and Mac are in the works.

<B><A NAME="WN1">NETSCAPE VS. HTML 3.0: GOOD WEB DESIGN GUIDELINES</A></B>
<P>
Andy King has put together a great guide on the differences between HTML 3.0
and Netscape extensions. There are clear guidelines how to use HTML 3.0
tags to achieve the same effects as the Netscape extensions while staying
compatible with the largest number of browsers. Since Netscape is committed
to supporting HTML 3.0 clearly it makes sense to use the facilities of that
spec rather then Netscapes own tags. A must page for all sophisticated web
authors. <A HREF="http://corpnet.com/ic/andy_king/html3andns.htm">"http://corpnet.com/ic/andy_king/html3andns.htm"</A>

<B><A NAME="WN2">PHANTOM, ANOTHER LANGUAGE FOR DISTRIBUTED PROGRAMMING</A></B>
<P>
Phantom is a new interpreted language designed to address some of the
problems presented by large-scale, interactive, distributed applications
such as distributed conferencing systems, multi-player games, and
collaborative work tools. Its goals are similar to Java (see above),
but it has been developed independently. Since it's written in ANSI C
it's highly portable. The open and freely distributed nature of this
language would seem to make it a viable alternative to the commercial
Java, but, alas Sun has 25 people working on Java, Phantom has only one.
But then, maybe that's an unbeatable advantage....

<B><A NAME="WN3">NIFTY WEB BASED SOFTWARE PROJECT MANAGEMENT TOOL FROM NASA</A></B>
<P>
WISE is a WWW-based tool that provides a framework for managing software
development projects across the Web.  Programmers and managers can log
issue reports, track the status of issues, and view project metrics
using standard WWW browsers. Looks like a pretty nice tool to manage and
keep track of large projects with a number of programmers. They are
looking for Alpha test sites, but you'll have to run Solaris and
have access to Oracle in order to be one. Write to <A HREF="mailto:research@ivv.nasa.gov">research@ivv.nasa.gov</A>
for more info.  A short web tutorial is included at the site.

<B><A NAME="WN4">FEATURE PACKED PYTHIA BROWSER AIMS AT RADICALLY DEMANDING USERS</A></B>
<P>
Pythia created for use by some heavy duty commercial users and therefore
has some radical extensions to HTML to support sophisticated commercial
and institutional use. This means better security, greater visual
impact, kiosk mode, electronic signatures, inline video and audio
capabilities, and interfaces to standard RDBMS and GIS databases.  Note
that Pythia is not directly comparable with any current WWW browser
products since it has different goals. Take a look and give some
constructive feedback to the creators.

<B><A NAME="WN5">SO HOW BIG IS THE WEB?</A></B>
<P>
The folks at Lycos went off and did what may be one of the first studies
with some hard data behind it. For many reasons this estimate is
somewhat flawed, or perhaps a better word would be limited, by the
methodology, but it provides some hard numbers to start with. They
report roughly 4.051 million URLs as of April 4th 1995 for what they
call the "core web" with a rough storage capability of 29.9 gigabytes (based
on an average file size of 7,920 characters).

<P>
Harvest is a caching and sever accelerator program which purports to
speed up your site by up to 200 percent. The software has been ported to
all the major Unix platforms and can boost performance of sites running
both the NCSA and CERN servers. The documentation at the site is a bit
sparse about the theory behind all this so it's hard to judge just how
such large numbers are achieved, particularly in the case of the sever
accelerator function. However the software is there for your
experimentation pleasure. Anybody care to do some speed tests?

This Mac HTML Markup converter works a bit differently from most such tools.
When you drag a file or files onto the HTML Markup icon, a "job ticket"
is brought up. With this ticket, you can check off which filters you
want to apply (e.g. use the first line as an H1 header or as a title, break
each line with BR). The software is still in beta and you can be a beta
tester if you wish. More info and the latest binaries on the home page.
Scott J. Kleper, the author, also wrote HTML Markdown, a program which
converts HTML back to text.

<P>
Judging from the volume of wailing and gnashing of teeth on various
developer newsgroups many of you want to know what is the secret of
creating Server Push documents with Perl? Well, unless you unbuffer your
I/O (setting $|=1) your script will get you nowhere fast. A server will
not send your output out until you close STDOUT otherwise. Once that
minor matter is taken care of you too can be creating bandwidth wasting
animations just to say you did it. Take a look at some examples

can freely use on your pages. Another alternative, Texture Land, is from
the ever inescapable Netscape Hall of Shame site and has a few more
selections (about 60) for your graphic pleasure. Finally there is one
more extensive texture site at baylor.edu also with about 60 textures.
Be aware that there are many graphic swatches here, so the download time
for these pages can be long.

<B><A NAME="ST4">CLIENT SIDE IMAGE MAPS DRAFT SPEC</A></B>
<P>
The Internet Engineering Task Force has a draft document outlining a
strategy for dealing with client side image maps. Client side image maps
would deal with some of the limitations of current image mapping
technology, most notably the need for a separate server program to
handle the image clicks. With this capability it would be possible to
distribute self contained web documents complete with clickable images,
no doubt a boon to graphically oriented CD-ROM publishers. The sad
thing is that this spec is well over a year old but implementations
seem to be non-existent.

<blockquote>
What a difference a year makes, and certainly a year on the Internet.  
It's been said that an Internet-year is like a dog-year, having within it the 
development of seven normal human years.
When we published our first issue on
computer and network security, the Internet was an interesting frontier
and those splashy IPOs of Internet companies had not yet begun.
Now here midway through 1996, it has become a ubiquitous communication
channel.  In the US, for 
example, a URL is as essential for many businesses as a toll-free 800 
phone number.
In the last twelve months,
the first wave of businesses, entrepreneurs, professionals, and consumers has 
adopted the networked desktop computer as an information
appliance.
<p>
Computer and network security used to be problems for large or specialized
organizations and the provenance of technical professionals
steeped in lore and arcana.
Now there are many network users who do not have the advantage of these
resources and must practise safe networking and know how to 
protect themselves.
<!p>
Likewise, our first issue of Netsurfer Focus
on computer and network security largely addressed the
concerns of system administrators.  In this issue, we will continue
to bring you new developments in these areas.  In addition, we
will touch upon problems of concern to small business and home users alike.
For new readers who are interested in the topic, we highly recommend
you also visit the revised edition of our first annual issue on
Computer and Network Security.

<blockquote>
You are connected to a network.  Every click of your mouse can take you to
into the unknown.  Do you know where you are going?  Do you know what
will happen there?
<p>
The original application of the World Wide Web was perfectly
safe.  You download text and graphics, the browser interprets and displays them, and
you can always view the source code the browser interpreted.
There is no hiding behind secret files or obscure binary code that only
a trained programmer or a computer can read.
Although you may not know much about the web site you are visiting and
whether you can trust it or not, the content you get does not do anything
to your computer system.
<p>
But along came the downloadable plug-ins, Java applets, Javascripts scripts,
and ActiveX controls.
Each is a piece of software that runs on your system and has varying
capabilities to modify the local software and hardware.
Clicking on a hotlink to a file of a special mime-type can cause a plug-in to
run, but at least you have to have the plug-in and to click on the link.
Java and Javascript are more insidious because support
comes with popular browsers, and applets and scripts
run immediately when the page has been downloaded.  Although the language
designers have taken pains to make Java and Javascript safe,
problems are still being identified.
ActiveX controls, on the other hand, have much greater access to your
PC system, and being newer to the Net, has had less time for its potential
flaws to be discovered.
<p>
The trick is to not let any unknown code, no matter where it is from,
run on your computer without strong precautions.
If you have not disabled these features in your browser, every time you 
click on the URL of a web page, you are potentially allowing code
that you might not even know is on the page run on your computer.
Unlike a BBS download or even an e-mail attachment, there is no
separate and conscious step to run an executable.  The first click of your
mouse is the crucial one.
<p>
When the Web first started, those who had heard about viruses were
wary, and we were able to reassure them that it was perfectly safe
to point and click.  Now that we have trained the world
to think that it is safe to point and click and surf the Net, we need
to bring the precautions back.

<blockquote>
Judging by the industry response, Java is proving to be a potent brew.
Its strength comes from being a programming language that does most of
the "right" things by modern programming standards; or as Sun Microsystems
itself describes it, Java is fully buzzword-compliant.
The security challenge comes when we rely on it to run, sight unseen, 
applets from the four corners of the earth.
<p>
To keep applets from running amok in the system, a browser that
supports Java constrains them to  a "sandbox".
By definition, this sandbox includes only access to the screen and computing 
power of the client computer, and connection to the host computer from 
which the applet came.  It usually cannot get to your local file system,
and it cannot get to other computers on the network.
<p>
But as we gain experience with Java, we are finding sins of both commission and
omission. A number of design and implementation bugs have 
been reported and quickly fixed.  Among other things, these allowed attacks 
on computers behind firewalls, and also attacks that seem to come from an unwary
and innocuous third party.  
More bugs will doubtlessly be discovered and remedied 
with new releases and continued scrutiny.  
Other problems that come up are part of the nature of the beast.
For example, while applets may stay in the sandbox, they
can raise quite a ruckus and do each other harm in the process.
These "hostile applets" are able to 
lock up your screen, crash the browser, sabotage or kill other applets, try and
steal your password by putting up a login screen and asking you to enter
your password,
or simply siphon off system resources to work on computational problems
and report the results to the originating server.
There are currently no way to control these types of applets except
to restart the browser or the computer.
<p>
The Internet is not always a safe place, but there is no point
in throwing out the Java with the grounds.
Turn off Java support in your browser while visiting
sites you do not trust, and use up-to-date versions of browsers and
Java development kits to get the latest fixes.
With the prevalence of applet-sharing on the Net, the possibility of popular
applets (such as the ticker tape) being turned into Trojan horses
is also very real.  So it is equally important not to use or post any applets 
to your web site unless you know exactly what it does.

Javascript, not to be confused with Java, is a scripting language supported
by the Netscape browsers to improve the interactivity of HTML pages.
While Java applets can get at each other, Javascript code has access to
your computer and what you do within the browser.  Instead of stealing
resources a la applets, the bugs that have been found tend to violate the privacy of
your system.
Malicious Javascript code can track the history of your websurfing,
read your files and file directory listings, and send all the
information back to the server from which it originated.
Most of these problems have been fixed as of this writing but continued
scrutiny may reveal new ones.  So the same precautions that are used for Java
applies to Javascript also.

Programs such as Microsoft Word have a macro language that can modify
program behaviour and enable greater functionality.  If macros are
carried along in the same file as the data, then the program is
susceptible to macro viruses.  Whether you are downloading the file
through FTP or the Web, the data file is not as innocuous at it seems.
And actually, you don't even have to go to the trouble of downloading 
the file containing a
macro gone bad.  E-mail will take care of it for you just fine.  
Safely ensconced
in the protective sheath of a MIME attachment, the lethal payload is 
carried through the firewall and only released
when you open the file.  
Likewise, someone can also send you an infected program as an e-mail
attachment.
The old sneakernet viruses have turned into netsurfing jetsetters, and their
geographic spread has escalated through use of the Internet.
<p>
In each case, the culprit comes through intervening firewalls unscathed.
But of course nothing stands still in the spy-versus-spy world of
computer security.  In the last few months, a number of firewall-based
virus-scanners have been announced.  These will usually check e-mail 
attachments and Web and FTP downloads into your organization for potential
invaders.

<I>The fly in the parlor ... with the chainsaw</I>

<blockquote>
As computers reach across the ether and interconnect to one another,
regardless of whether they are browser clients or servers, 
they take on a certain amount of risk.  In addition to the basic dangers
of being a computer on the Net and being hacked, the World Wide Web
brings them new and wonderful hazards.  
<p>
Java and Javascript abuse at malicious web sites 
and virus-infected content can cause problems.  But they are not the
sole villains in the drama.  As part of the http protocol,
the browser gives out a great deal of information about you to the
server.  The "cookie" mechanism can be used to closely track and
record your activities on any given site - just like going into a store
and having every movement you make recorded filmed for use and analysis.
<p>
But the web server is not always the evil spider inviting the fly to step into
its parlor.  Sometimes the fly comes in armed with a chainsaw, and not always
by the front door.  The web server equally faces all the hazards of connection,
without many of the protections of the underlying operating system.  
For example, you may restrict access to members
only, and use the web server's user ID and password mechanism.  First of all, 
an attacker can make repeated attempts to guess the password - the server does not
shut him down after the third try as do many operating systems.  In addition,
the password is not strongly encrypted as it traverses the Net, but
traverse the Net it does.  To increase the odds of capture and discovery,
user name and password are sent not once but each time any protected
document is accessed.
<p>
CGI scripts, those solid workhorses of interactive web pages, are programs running
on your server computer, and therefore potentially large security holes.  How, you might
ask; well myriad are the ways.  Suffice it be said that the first law is never
to trust user input.  An innocent but unexpectedly large input that overwrites
part of system memory has been the downfall
of many a program.  And given the fact that these scripts frequently work
with system commands (such as 'remove all files'), they are attractive targets
that can cause disproportionate damage. 
<p>
And last but not least, the friendly, helpful robots that scuttle across the Web
indexing all pages in their path do not discriminate against files you did
not plan for the world to see.  Carelessly managed sites have had their password
and system configuration files scooped into massive Web index databases, waving
the red flag of a vulnerable site under the nose of potential hackers.
Exposure of other files is a lesser risk, but do you really want to share all
your organization's secrets with all of cyberspace?

<blockquote>
In addition to the web page traps and viruses that snare unwary netsurfers,
the Net ecosystem is also home to a growing host of robots, agents, 
spiders, worms, ants, and other creatures.  Speaking the language of HTTP
and other network protocols, these are basically small programs that traverse the
Net for a variety of purposes.  The best known are the spiders that
index Net resources for public and private use.
Alta Vista, Infoseek, and Lycos are a few that come to mind.  Others
help webmasters manage their sites, checking for and pruning away 
defunct hotlinks.  Newer programs can help you harvest Net resources,
look for updated
pages, download entire sites while you sleep, or even shop for bargains.
In the brave new world, intelligent agents will not just bring you information,
but become active in
coordinating schedules, executing transactions, and performing other tasks
at your behest.
<p>
These programs or robots can have intended and unintended effects
on the network and web sites they traverse.  Overeager spiders have overwhelmed
web sites by requesting too many documents too rapidly.  
As described elsewhere, they can also ferret out information that a careless
system administrator leaves accessible on his disk.
Efforts are under way to create formal Internet standards of behaviour for 
web robots.  The current version, the Robot Exclusion Standard, allows
site administrators to place a 'robot.txt' file on their web indicating where
robots should not go.  For example, a large archive of bitmap images
would be useless to a robot that is trying to index HTML pages.  
Serving these files to the robot is a needless use of net resources;
however, they need to remain accessible to a human with a browser or FTP.
The standard is a voluntary one for the moment, and an etiquette
is evolving for robot developers as experience is gained with their deployment.

Things are not always what they seem.
The case of cyanide-laced Tylenol tablets, Snow White eating the beautiful
apple from the Evil Queen,
and Archimedes's encounter with gold that had been adulterated with base metals.  
How do you trust what you get? It's no different in cyberspace.
The applet that screams "download me" at your favourite game site.
The robot knocking at the door to your web server.
It's just often harder to verify the reliability of 1's and 0's.
<p>
We have few qualms about installing shrink-wrapped software
packages because we get it from a retailer we know, or because
it carries a brand name we trust.  These days we extend trust to
Net sites that we visit.  The momentum behind using digital signatures 
to show that a message or a piece of software actually came from the
person or organization that we trust is growing.  The Java API including
signed applets will be available in Q3 of 96, and Microsoft is spearheading
a code signing proposal.  So in the not-too-distant future,
we should be able to enforce greater security and functionality by
verifying content, robots, applets, and transactions through the signature
on the digital ID card.  
ID card providers (certificate authorities) are appearing, and
even the US Postal Services is getting into the act.

<I>Virtual Private Networks</I> 
<p>
<! ---------------------------------------------------------------->

<blockquote>
The Internet is one big party line where packets of information bounce hither-thither
from source to destination, free to spend a night or a lifetime with some random computer
somewhere along the way.  But as a public thoroughfare, it has great cost advantages
compared to private networks from stringing your own wire.
So how do you have the best of both worlds of low cost and privacy?
Although some large scale network providers such as MCI can provide a facsimile of
private lines by routing your traffic entirely over network segments that it manages, the
trend has been to more control over your own destiny 
through virtual private networks (VPNs).
<p>

And the party line on privatizing the party line?  IP level encryption.
Sender to recipient, end-to-end encryption of information being 
transmitted across the Internet means that
stray packets are unintelligible to anyone but the intended recipient.
Encryption at the IP level of the Internet protocol stack also allows easy support
of different application protocols such as HTTP, FTP, and Telnet, on a variety
of underlying network technology such as Ethernet, Frame Relay, or ATM.
<p>
Products that secure the communications between designated sites in 
your private network on the Internet are springing up like mushrooms after a rain.
They can be software-only, such as Digital Equipment's Internet Tunnel, or
hardware-based, as NetFortress from Digital Secure Networks Technology.  The
SunScreen solution from Sun Microsystems provides firewall and cryptographic key 
clearinghouse services as well as the basic site-to-site encryption.
These solutions work well for organizations that must secure communications
between different facilities.
The Security Middleware products from Virtual Online Network Environments
use smartcard authentication to verify individual users rather than
host computers.  This product, if deployed by Internet Service Providers, would allow
even small Mom-and-Pop outfits to have affordable private networks.  
And on the large 
enterprise side of the story, an industry coalition is forming to enable
secure wide area networks (S/WAN) through encryption and key management standards.

<p>
<! ---------------------------------------------------------------->

<blockquote>
Glorious sunrise on the range.  The entrance to the E-COM corral, Marlboro
Man look-alikes hoist the corral's new brand over the gates.
Bold, wrought iron letters, SET.  The crowds cheer and applaud.
Suddenly, a lone cowboy in black with a gold belt buckle
rides up with six shooters blazing.  The natives
shoot back and give chase.  Exit, stage left.  The scene continues
undisturbed.
<p>
By late 1995, Netscape's SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) had won the standards race for 
secured transmission of content (read credit card numbers)
across the Net.
Commerce on the Internet received a crucial boost in early 1996 when leading
credit card associations Visa and Mastercard finally set aside their differences
and competing standards (STT and SEPP) in favour of a common specification,
SET (Secure Electronic Transaction).  This specification enables the other aspects
of a credit card transaction, e.g., authorization of the charges,
to occur online, not just the transmission of card number information.
<p>
Then First Virtual Holdings announced the identification of a major flaw
in the use of software-based encryption of credit card numbers: keystroke
capture at the client desktop.  Their point is that
if someone has managed to gain control of
your computer to monitor your keystrokes, he can capture your credit card
number and no amount of encryption for transmission will help protect you.
With the interconnectivity of the net and the ease of downloading
a hostile applet, the vulnerability of the desktop computer cannot be
overemphasized, particularly for those new to computer and network
security issues.
However the hyperbolic press releases on a topic well known to security experts, 
combined with the fact that First Virtual
offers electronic commerce through a mechanism without the use of
encryption has led to a flurry of responses ranging from supportive to
outraged.
<p>
As of this writing, the tempest has subsided to the bottom of the virtual teacup
and electronic commerce marches on.

<blockquote>
Large scale search sites are invaluable to many netizens.
For example, with the growth of the Net in the past year,
publishing Netsurfer Focus would be too painful
to contemplate without access to sites such as Alta Vista*.
The corollary is that with these high powered spiders,
every utterance on the Net, be it on a web page or a newsgroup,
may be a matter of public record that above all else
<b>can be readily found</b>.
<p>
The story of your online life,
whether you are a frequent poster to 'alt.sex.binaries' or
'sci.crypt' (hello, potential employer!), 
or your personal web page showing three beautiful children,
a dog named Jimmy, and a house far beyond your 20K$ a year salary 
(hello, IRS!) can be there for all who cares to see.
And then there are the large online directories.  Coming
hard on the heels of the info-preneurs that have set up directory
sites, the phone companies are rushing online with their
multi-million listing offerings.
Privacy issues become intertwined with physical security because it
has become so easy to identify and physically locate you,
your beliefs and habits, and your computer.

<blockquote>
As computers move into the home, security takes on new dimensions.
Beyond the hard assets of your computer, and the soft assets of your data,
you need to think about protecting your family and especially children.
Bringing access to the cyberworld to your desktop means exactly that, and we
all know there are parts of the world, real or cyber, that you don't want to
take the kids.  
<p>
A number of companies have sprung up to help you avoid the back alleys and 
redlight districts of the Net.  Software such as SurfWatch or NetNanny
block access to known sites where offensive
material are available, or to any site that you deem inappropriate.
The sites that are blocked vary from package to package.  Some include on their
verboten-list not just pornography but web resources about homosexuality, 
or feminism, or anything that does not promote "family values".  Yet other packages 
can log all the surfing activities, enabling Orwellian possibilities right
in your own home.  In sum, they are tools that do not excuse us
from our responsibilities to decide what is appropriate in our households.
<p>
In addition to the reviewer-based systems, another development that will facilitate 
appropriate surfing is some widespread form of labelling or self-labelling.
Just like the "PG", "R", and "X" movie ratings in the US, labelling provides
a more standardized way to assess the content of a web site.
The PICS (Platform for Internet Content Selection) standard is a technical
specification for how to label Net content.  It is developed by the World Wide Web
consortium and can be used to implement any rating system.  
Currently, there is much industry momentum
behind RSACi, the Recreational Software Advisory
Council Internet rating system.  This is an extension of the rating system for computer
games, and has been endorsed by major online
services.  Most of the leading blocking products do or will support RSACi.

A year ago, an enterprising cryptographer named Hal Finney issued a challenge
to his colleagues to crack the encryption on an SSL (Netscape's

not one, but two independent successes turned up within a month.
This was the start of a series of black-hat testing of net software
by cryptography and security aficionados across the Internet community. 
Rooted in the belief that strength of security solutions comes from careful 
scrutiny and not obscurity, expert volunteers continue to probe and pummel

Hacker Shimomura turned tracker when cracker Mitnick reputedly broke into
Shimomura's computer around Christmas, 1994.
Since then, the event has turned into a mini-industry of its own with not 
one or two, but three books written about the incident.
A web site was also created to promote "Takedown", Shimomura's book.
This time, however, crackers had the last laugh when they hi-jacked the URL
for the Takedown site by forging a change-of-address e-mail message to address
keepers at the Internet Network Information Center.
We can be assured of future pranks and publicity stunts as the movie

<p>
In February, the US State Department announced an
amendment to the International Traffic in Arms Regulation (ITAR) allowing
U.S. persons to temporarily export cryptographic products for personal use
without the need for an export license (aka the 'Matt Blaze exemption').  
However, US cryptographers and
their allies continue their campaign for the availability and export of strong
(>40 bit key) cryptography.  
The software industry is clearly concerned about their inability to compete 
in the international markets with the current export controls.
IBM-Lotus struck a compromise with the government by giving it
exclusive access to 24 bits in the 64 bit key used in Lotus Notes Release 4.
RSA went the other way and located a development center
in Japan.  This allows RSA to provide identical encryption technologies outside of the
US without tripping over ITAR.  
On the heels of the successful challenge to the Communications Decency
Act, an industry coalition to lobby Washington
is also forming.

Netsurfer T-Shirt Design Contest
</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY>
<H1>The Great Netsurfer<BR>
T-Shirt Design Contest</H1>
<IMG SRC="artist.gif" ALT="">
<P>
Every business, unless it plows under in the first six months, gets to
the point where it needs a corporate propaganda T-Shirt. Netsurfer
Communications, has reached that point. In case you don't know us,
we're the ones who publish the oddly compelling
<A HREF="http://www.netsurf.com/nsd/">Netsurfer Digest</A> 
as well as <A HREF="http://www.netsurf.com/nsm/zines.html">
other E-Zines</A>.
<P>
So, we'd like to ask the Net Arts community for some help in designing
a way cool Netsurfer T-Shirt. Something that average netsurfers all over
the world would feel proud spilling their coffee on, wiping the screen with,
and taking off for their significant others. 
<P>
<H3>What's in it for you?</H3> 
<P>
Big, huge, gigantic amounts of money, for one.
Well, OK, maybe only $100 for the winning design. 
<P>
<H3>But wait, there's more!</H3> 
<P>
Aside from the glory of having our 50,000 or so world-wide readers
sweating in your work, we'll also fawn all over you on our web pages and
publications. Front page, links to your web site, below the banner kind of
coverage. You can't beat that kind of cyberoverexposure, particularly if
you're looking for a cool job, and let's face it, who isn't? The top five
runners up will also get similar treatment.
<P>
<H3>So what are we looking for?</H3>
<P>
Since we'd like to make our T-Shirts much sought after cult items we
need a killer design to start off what eventually will become a
legendary line of T-Shirt art. Either that, or a really scarce, one of a
kind collectors item if we go under. So strive for something
significant, yet daring, without necessarily being stuck to the
inevitable surfing theme.
<P>
<H1>EXTENDED Deadline for submissions is August 18</H1> 
<P>
We won't burden this message with operational details. Look at 
<A HREF="http://www.netsurf.com/tshirt/trules.html>
the contest entry rules</A> for how you can submit a design, or, to get
instructions by e-mail, send a message to our automated infobot at
<A HREF="mailto:info@netsurf.com">info@netsurf.com</A> with the keywords
"send tshirt-contest" in the BODY of the message (Subject: is ignored).
<P>
<H3>Questions?</H3>

<B><A NAME="TN1">NETSCAPE OFFERS MORE IPO SHARES AS STOCK CLIMBS</A></B>
<P>
Netscape's IPO shares are in tremendous demand, to the point that the
company has upgraded from an original offer of 3.5 million shares at $11
to 5 million shares at $28. Don't hold your breath if you want to get in
on the action, since that price is available only to the IPO insiders
and investment bankers. The shares went on the market at $71 and
immediately started heading up before settling down in the mid $50's.
Note that the company has yet to earn a profit. Here is the PR and a
graph of Netscape stock.

<P>
Compuserve's new Internet division (formerly Spry) just announced their
version of a web server, to be available in 3Q95. Internet Office Web
Server will be a secure Web server with support for both
Secure-Hypertext Transfer Protocol (S-HTTP) and Secure Sockets Layer
(SSL). Also included as part of the package will be HTML authoring tools
such as HoTMetal Pro from Softquad, an SQL database, and data search
engines from Architext.  Cost will be $599. You can get a free
beta copy at their site, where you will also find the press release.

SlipKnot is the innovative graphical browser for Windows users with Unix
shell accounts. The just-released version 1.11 now offers OS/2
compatibility and speed improvements. Three previous upgrades since
November have added support for fill-in forms (through lynx), gopher,
telnet, modemless direct serial connections, longer job queues, a large
list of popular bookmarks, and site license customizations.

<P>
VRweb is a VRML browser for 3D scenes and worlds usable with Hyper-G and
WWW browsers. Binaries for various Unix platforms and Windows are
available, along with source code. This project, jointly initiated by
IICM, NCSA, and the Gopher team at the University of Minnesota, is
intended to complement forthcoming commercial VRML browsers and
providing a platform for research and experiment.

<B><A NAME="WN2">POWWOW LETS YOU GANG-SURF </A></B>
<P>
PowWow is a Windows program that allows up to five (version 1.5) or
seven (v1.6 Beta) people to chat, send and receive files. It also allows
them to cruise the World Wide Web together as a group. You start by
registering with a directory of PowWow users (WhitePages), which hooks
your name up to a server. You can then use PowWow to communicate with
other users just by knowing their e-mail address. The best part is that
you can gang-surf the web by assuming control of a cruise, which will
launch Netscape on up to seven other machines and let you control where
you go. At the moment only the Netscape browser is supported for the
cruise feature.  Version 1.6 Beta has support for voice chats.

<B><A NAME="WN3">AUTOWINNET AUTOMATES NET ACCESS TASKS UNDER WINDOWS</A></B>
<P>
OK, so the home page is full of silly hype and looks like it was
constructed under the influence of too much caffeine. But still, the
program looks genuinely useful. AutoWinNet claims to automate and make
unattended everything from FTP downloads, updated web page scanning,
Usenet posting/reading, e-mail access, even IRC chat. It slices, it
dices, and for all we know it probably even automatically shaves your
cat in the background. It's a Windows Winsock program and works on any
SLIP/PPP account. Shareware version is available and the pro version
costs $69.  <A HREF="http://www.computek.net/autownet">"http://www.computek.net/autownet"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="WN4">ANCHORPAGE PROVIDES MULTIPLE VIEWS OF HTML DOCS UNDER WINDOWS</A></B>
<P>
AnchorPage is web site software that automatically hyperlinks and
indexes web documents as well as offering the site administrator many
more content display options.  It automatically create various views of
your documents: Phrase View, Concept View, Table of Contents View, and
Abstract View. They have some interesting examples of this at work,
where you can take a look at things like The Congressional Record, or
The Origin of Species indexed in various ways. Good software for library
or archive sites, may also be of interest to scholars for document
analysis.  Unfortunately it's Windows only, which rules out its use in
heavy duty Unix archive sites.  Price: $895 <A HREF="http://www.iconovex.com/">"http://www.iconovex.com/"</A>

<B><A NAME="WT1">WINDOWS COLOR BROWSER HELPS PICK WEB PAGE COLORS</A></B>
<P>
Color Browser is a new Windows freeware utility which helps you to
quickly pick a color when designing web pages. It can also round off the
color to the nearest 8, 16, or 32 bits so that you get good results on a
256-color system. The site also has a couple of other useful developer
tools. FTP Editor creates description files for directories served by
the Windows NT FTP server, while MsgFilter is a VBX custom control for
filtering messages sent to any window.

<B><A NAME="WT2">SERVER SIDE INCLUDE CAPABILITY FOR CERN WEBSERVER, OTHER WEB UTILITIES</A></B>
<P>
Server side includes are HTML commands interpreted by the server, as
opposed to the browser, before the page is sent out. They are used to
make possible various dynamic continually updating page elements like
counters or dates. The NCSA server has them, and the CERN one does not.
This Perl script, fakessi, emulates server side includes for the CERN
Web server. The fakessi web page has a very good description of what it
does and how. This site also has a number of other useful utilities.

<B><A NAME="WT3">USENET-WEB 1.0 ASSISTS IN USENET NEWSGROUP ARCHIVING</A></B>
<P>
This free Perl based software is designed for the low maintenance
permanent archiving and presentation on the World Wide Web of one or
multiple Usenet newsgroups. The archives are readily searchable by date,
from and subject line contents. This is not a newsreader, so no posting
facilities are built in.  Naturally, you need to be able to run Perl and
CGI scripts to use this software.

<B><A NAME="WT4">LWGATE: MAILING LIST WWW GATEWAY</A></B>
<P>
LWGate is a Perl script and CGI gateway wich presents information about
mailing lists to WWW users, assist users in executing mailing list
commands though a user friendly, forms based interface, and automatically
generate a hypertext interface on the fly to list archives available on
the local server.  LWGate supports mailing lists provided by
Listserv, ListProcessor 6, and Majordomo servers.

<P>
<B><A NAME="WT5">MAILSERV: ANOTHER LINKABLE MAILING LIST WWW GATEWAY</A></B>
<P>
This one is nice since you can just set up links to its home site on the
web, and don't need to install it on your machine if you don't want to.
It's a Perl program using sendmail to send commands to a variety of
mailing list servers. Currently it supports List Processor, Listserv,
Majordomo, SmartList and manually administered mailing lists. A good
tool to present a nice forms interface to your mail server. It appears
to have somewhat better documentation then LWGate and supports more
servers.  <A HREF="http://iquest.com/~fitz/www/mailserv/">"http://iquest.com/~fitz/www/mailserv/"</A>

<B><A NAME="WT6">HYPERNEWS ALLOWS WEB BASED USENET-LIKE COMMUNICATION</A></B>
<P>
This free software package, available in Unix source code, enables you
to add create USENET-like information and discussion hierarchies
available through the Web. You create a file with some information
you want to make available for discussion using the friendly forms
interface of HyperNews, and then let people add comments to your
document. the comments will appear at the bottom of your document
page. The HyperNews site itself is a good example of this mechanism.
There are security capabilities (i.e. passwords for posting), e-mail
notification, and various formats, including HTML, for posting.

<P>
Commercial sites looking for robust text search software should check
out this company and their tools.  Specifically consider PLWeb, which
has the ability to support distributed searching, includes login and
password control, compatibility with secure communications, per-document
pricing options, billing/tracking logs, and a ton of sophisticated
search functions. You can download PLWeb for a free 45 day demo. Some of
their customers include Time Inc's Pathfinder Service, Electronic
NewsStand USA Today. PLWeb 2.0 is $4,995.00.  <A HREF="http://www.pls.com/">"http://www.pls.com/"</A>

<B><A NAME="WT8">TOOLS FOR WRITING MAC CGI PROGRAMS IN C</A></B>
<P>
Grant's CGI Framework enables developers to write 68K and PowerMac CGI
scripts using the C language. This is beta code, so it may not be very
robust, but it's a start. You'll need to know something about Mac
programming and C to use it. Instructions and more info on this page.
These tools appear to be freeware for non-commercial use, with modest
license fees for commercial applications.

<B><A NAME="WT9">CHWEB HELPS SECURE LOCAL WEB DOCS UNDER UNIX</A></B>
<P>
CHWEB is a setuid root Unix command that makes a file or directory
accessible to its owner, a server, and root but no one else. The basic
idea is that anyone who logs into your server can probably see all your
web documents, which by default are world readable. This command secures
the document so that other people who have accounts on your server
machine will not be able to read the file.  Presumably you also secure
the file on the web using .htaccess, CGI, or other mechanisms.

<P>
The tool creates a friendly web page which contains the titles of the
most popular pages and the dates they were last updated.  Because this
is a client-server application, it can gather statistics from several
servers and produce one list containing information from all the
servers. More info and pointers to documentation on the authors,

Beta binaries are freely available for SunOS and Linux, set to expire on
Sept 15. Incidentally, all their pages consist of horrible cgi-bin

<P>
BEACH RaT is an HTML site designed to help HTML authors calculate
Netscape backgrounds from RGB numbers in programs such as Adobe
Photoshop.  Simply enter the three decimal values for the RGB triplet
and out pops the hex value and some text in your chosen color.  Nifty.
While there don't forget to sneak a peek at the Novalink top secret
internal memo regarding the BEACH RaT project.

<B><A NAME="WT13">REFERRER AND AGENT LOG ANALYSIS FOR NCSA HTTPD 1.4.X</A></B>
<P>
Here are a couple of scripts which will generate reports on the new logs
available with the NCSA 1.4.x server. The logs give information on the
URL referring a link, and on the browsers which accessed your pages.
Both are by Benjamin Franz, also the author of Usenet Web we noted
elsewhere in this issue. You'll have to dink around with some of the
paths hardcoded in the scripts, but they are pretty straightforward.
You'll find both BrowserCounter and RefStats on his Utilities page:

<B><A NAME="WT14">PATCHES TO SERVERS CREATE MORE EFFICIENT HIT COUNTER</A></B>
<P>
There are a number of problems with most implementation of live page hit
counters, either using cgi-bin scripts or inefficient and insecure
server side includes. William Herrin has created a patch to NCSA and
Apache servers which will create a server-side include "counter"
function. Now you can turn includes on but executables off and still
have a counter. Because its part of the server, it doesn't have to fork
a process and is thus a lot more efficient.

For another implementation of a web based discussion package

Macintosh and Windows environments which facilitates high speed
transmission of images over regular phone lines. Compression is
supposedly up to three times better then JPEG and GIF. Apparently this

<H2><A NAME="AD7">CAPITALIST PIG - Business Game Tests Your Entrepreneurial Savvy</A></H2>  

<B>Capitalist Pig</B>, the business simulation game for Windows and Macintosh, lets you
succeed in business without risking it all.  In the sound-and-animation
filled game, you choose a product, line up capital, hire employees, and
you're on your way to big bucks or bankruptcy.  
<P>
The fun is backed by economic statistics from the twentieth century, and
financial statements are always on hand, so you can learn economics and
business as well.  You're constantly making decisions: hire or fire?
advertise?  what about taxes?  Your advisors (lawyer, accountant,
economist, PR agent) give you sound advice, but will you follow it?
Meanwhile, employees embezzle funds, fire breaks out, and a terrorist
runs rampant.  
<P>
Used in business classes and for management training,
it's one game you've got to try.

<H2>The Vortex Experience - Vortex Snowboards</H2>
<P>
Another snowboard company? 
<P>
You bet. More hype, more gravy train, more
cashing in on the way of life that IS snowboarding? 
<P>
No way. 
<P>
You see, we at Vortex make our own boards with our own people, hands on.
Then we test ride them ourselves to make em' right.  What we came up
with is a 1995/96 lineup of eleven models for some serious snowboarding.
There are boards for the rider who loves the pipe, the park, the trees,
the backcountry, the sport.

<H2>Incredible South Pacific Travel Bargains</H2>
<P>
<p>Its amazing - its Amazia! A new Web site full of South Pacific
travel information and bargains. To introduce you to our new services,
we've put together the best value travel packages to Australia and/or New
Zealand that you'll ever see! Complete one week packages including
airfare, good quality accommodation, and some touring or a car too - all
available for less than the the lowest published airfare by itself.
Imagine spending 
<A Href=http://www.anzac.com/endvr/fiji.htm> a week in
Fiji for only <b>$799</b></a>, 
<A Href=http://www.anzac.com/endvr/ts60.htm> a week in NZ for only
<b>$948</b></a>, 
<A Href=http://www.anzac.com/endvr/ts59.htm> a week in
Australia for only <b>$967</b></a> <b>(all inclusive and $81 less than
the lowest airfare by itself!!!)</b>.</p>

<p>Amazia is also where 
<A Href=http://www.anzac.com/qantas/qantas.htm>Qantas Airways</a> makes
its home.  Maybe that's part of the reason we can offer these incredible
values, available <b>exclusively to netizens like yourself!</b>  These
unbeatable (and sadly probably unrepeatable) specials are good for
travel starting no later than 31 May, so 
<A Href=http://www.anzac.com/endvr/endvr.htm>click</a> to our pages
now.</p>

<p>
Amazing!  Amazia!  Australia!  It doesn't get any better than this, folks! 
Check out our package pages and then reach for your suitcase and 
passport!</p>

<H2>Gourmet Easter Gift Basket from Kaua'i Exotix</H2>
<P>
Here's a tropical twist on the old fashioned Easter Basket -- a gourmet
gift basket from 
<A HREF="http://www.service.digital.com/ke/index.html">KAUA'I EXOTIX</A>
filled with rare goodies like lilikoi mustard and jelly (made from
Kauai's own passion fruit), papaya salsa, and mango chutney.  Or for
coffee lovers another basket features Kaua'i and Kona coffee, chocolate
covered coffee beans (Hawaiian of course), Kona coffee cookies and an
attractive bird of paradise coffee mug.  
<P>
Beautifully presented and shipped directly from Hawaii's garden isle,
these baskets are from the same people who ship fresh tropical flowers.
There are no pictures of our beautiful baskets as of yet on our home
page but please call our 800# 1-800-718-1018 or e-mail us to ask us
about them.
<P>
These tropical exotics are a wonderful gift not only for Easter but for
all occasions and there are two great advantages to ordering direct from
the grower -- you save money and because the flowers come straight from
the farm,they are much fresher and last longer than those you buy at
even the finest florist.
<P>
For tropical flower lovers we are offering the ultimate handbook,
<I>"Exotic Tropicals of Hawaii."</I> Ask us about this great book.

<B><A NAME="SS1">THE 1893 CHICAGO WORLD'S FAIR</A></B>
</P>
<P>
The World's Columbian Exposition, held in a newly rebuilt, post-Great Fire
Chicago, celebrated the discoveries and influences of explorer Christopher
Columbus. This magnificent tribute to endeavor and achievement not only
left its social, cultural, and architectural mark on the city of Chicago,
it influenced future fairs, museums, and expositions all over the world.
This site focuses on what the Fair looked like, who was there, what was on
display, and the aftermath of the event. Be sure to take the virtual tour
of the fairgrounds and see what it was like to be entertained at the turn
of the century. <A HREF="http://xroads.virginia.edu/~MA96/WCE/title.html">&lt;http://xroads.virginia.edu/~MA96/WCE/title.html&gt;</A><BR>

<B><A NAME="SS2">THE WEB'S DYNAMIC TOP 100</A></B>
</P>
<P>
"Top-site" Web sites abound, but the Web 100 wants to be tiptop. Rankings
of top sites are based on users' ratings and change automatically on the
fly. On the home page, you'll see a note on the site of the hour such as:
"MOVING UP! Voyager jumped from #58 to #54 in the rankings from 6:00 a.m.
to 7:00 a.m. PDT.") The rankings are nice, but you're more likely to return
for the convenience of organization - sites are organized by general topics
without prizes, but it'll help you find many sites that are as meaty as
they are popular. Hey, wouldn't it be cool if Netsurfer Digest got on
there? Like 100,000 times? <A HREF="http://www.web100.com/">&lt;http://www.web100.com/&gt;</A><BR>

<B><A NAME="SS3">HOW DO I LEARN 2?</A></B>
</P>
<P>
In what is perhaps one of the most useful acts of Web creation ever, the
founders of the Learn2.com site have put together a grab bag of the little
details you need to know to take a stumble-free walk across the tapestry of
life. The Learn2.com site has tutorials intended to assist in getting
through events such as changing tires, leasing cars, or the ever-important
"Understanding Baseball". The "2torials" offered by this site represent
some of the best advice (on some very arcane topics) that the Internet has
to offer. Trouble tying that tie? Don't call Mom, click Learn2.Com.

Designed as a repository for the stupidest questions that plague society,
the StupidQuest Web site does its utmost to obfuscate anything that might
even slightly resemble actual fact. Site caretaker Captain Stupid answers
the really big questions, such as "What animal does naugahide (sic) come
from?" and "What do they wrap around styrofoam when they ship it?"
(Answers: the nauga beast; nothing.)  <A HREF="http://www.stupidquest.com/">&lt;http://www.stupidquest.com/&gt;</A><BR>

</P>
<P>
E-mail postcards have gone from novelty to staple of the Internet. To keep
some of the spice, the creators of the Mail a Meal site have cooked up a
storm to try and recapture some of that novelty. Instead of sending a
friend, acquaintance, or loved one a simple postcard, use Mail a Meal to
deliver an entire virtual repast via e-mail to the target glutton. Apart
from simply being a great idea, the Mail a Meal site also features some of
the most mouth-watering and tantalizing images of food we've seen.

"Best of Breed Online" is a handy resource for the dog owner and dog lover.
You can look up canines by breed name, breed type (sporting, herding, etc.)
or picture. Breeds are organized alphabetically, with in-depth descriptions
and photos to give you an overview of a great range of dogs from
Affenpinscher to Yorkshire Terrier. If you're not a pure-breed type, that's
OK. This site is great for figuring out what your mutts are made of.

This rich and heavy site can quickly send the unwary cybertraveler into
information overload. The sociological tour-de-force ranges from
commentaries and essays to data and links covering time, aging, death and
dying, family, mass media, and more. If you find the torrent of content
intimidating or boring, check out the Op-Ed articles at the end of the long
first page. Well worth a visit if you simply ignore the horrid backgrounds
and occasional blinking text. <A HREF="http://www.trinity.edu/~mkearl/index.html">&lt;http://www.trinity.edu/~mkearl/index.html&gt;</A><BR>

No longer need lost souls lurk on the Internet. They can find all the
directions they need in Zip2. This set of online yellow pages offers
several features. You can search near addresses, get door-to-door
directions, search via map, and more. Zip2 includes more than 16 million
businesses in the USA. One caveat: the site's graphics do slow down the
process, and while 'twould be nice to have a text-only option, none exists.

view the graves of the Geins whose antics inspired movies like "Psycho" and
"Silence of the Lambs", the mug shot collection, and the images from Nazi
Germany. If you've ever had a hankering to read essays like "Butchering the
Human Carcass for Human Consumption" or "My Life of Molesting Children",
then this is the place to start. Pursue perversion on an intellectual
level. <A HREF="http://www.ieway.com/~csukbr/">&lt;http://www.ieway.com/~csukbr/&gt;</A><BR>

</P>
<P>
There's no such thing as overachievement at the Academy of Achievement, a
site designed to inspire young people to great heights through education
and emulation of 20th-century giants. In each "Gallery of Achievers" (halls
of arts, business, public service, sports, etc.), men and women are honored
and exhibited with a biography and interview. The Academy is selective. The
Hall of Sports honors Dr. Tenley Albright, Susan Butcher, Julius Irving,
Willie Mays, Herschel Walker, and John Wooden. "Steps to Success" groups
achievers by qualities - passion, vision, preparation, courage,
perseverance, and integrity - and includes audio clips. Other resources
abound. What's holding you back? Go forth and achieve.

Mapping Your Future (MYF) takes an ambitious stab at the guidance counselor
biz. Guided tours explain how to choose a career, select a school, and pay
for an education. The Planning a Career section, for example, includes
information on career goals and planning, occupations, job hunting tips,
interview techniques, and resume writing. A search engine helps you find
specific topics. Not a fly-by-night or marketing site, MYF is sponsored by
state agencies that administer the US Federal Family Education Loan
Program, which provides low-interest loans to students and parents to help
pay for education beyond high school. It's a must-see if there's a high
school kid in the house. <A HREF="http://mapping-your-future.org/">&lt;http://mapping-your-future.org/&gt;</A><BR>

sizes and standard colors than you probably ever seriously considered. To
see what we mean, simply stop by this enthusiastic fry-filled site.
Highlights include an official color standard chart and an experiment on

in Quebec that even MacDonald's serves it, though not well.

The intersection between the sets of computer weenies and the Dungeons and
Dragons players in the Venn diagram of geeks is so large, you'd think an
official Web site would have arrived years ago, as did officially
unappreciated unofficial sites. It might have, if not for the arguably
technophobic chiefs at TSR, the company that publishes the game. Bending to
equally arguable progress, the TSR site has arrived online with grace and
generosity. The beautiful pages are not quite fully woven, but any and all
information about TSR and its games a person could want is here. TSR has
even promised to upload about two dozen adventures for free download. You
can also get game products previously available only on AOL and a limited
FTP site. It took time, but it was worth it. <A HREF="http://www.tsrinc.com/">&lt;http://www.tsrinc.com/&gt;</A><BR>

Two teenaged boys were killed in Arkansas in August 1987. These deaths are
surrounded in controversy, mystery, and allegations of a government
coverup. It's got everything a good mystery needs: death; drugs;
conspiracy; and blackmail. The only thing missing is the sex. The mother of
one of the boys killed in the "train deaths" presents her case, but some
might consider this conspiracy hooey. <A HREF="http://www.idmedia.com/ttd.htm">&lt;http://www.idmedia.com/ttd.htm&gt;</A><BR>

locale (Alsace, say) or topic (art exhibits, for instance, or "Fall

reflect headlines on the evening news; others provide background (e.g.
"Egypt bans animals [and their mess] at Pyramids" and "Frustrated French
tourists take 'hostages'") you might not find elsewhere. Despite the
quality, one recent Sunday morning we found some pages slow to load across
a residential ISDN line, and some links produced a "Document contains no

<H2>Award Winning ACMA Computers Announces Power Series</H2>
<P>

<P>

<A HREF="http://www.acma.com">ACMA Computers</A>, winner of 7 PC World
Best Buy Awards, sells PC systems and peripherals primarily to the
corporate marketplace. Our new Power Series allows you to select a PC
system based on the level of features you desire.

<P>
Want it fully loaded? Go for <B>z-Power</B> ("<I>A good hardware bundle
and good performance set these systems apart</I>" - PC Magazine,
12/5/95). From the brilliant 17 inch .28 pitch monitor to the 16
megabytes of EDO RAM to the 6 speed CD-ROM drive, z-Power delivers
quality and performance.

<P>
Want to design your own system configuration? x-Power is our custom
(customer) designed series. Pick what you want. Base it on what you need
it for or what you desire. Our trained sales consultants will make sure
you don't run into compatability issues.

<B>s-Power</B> is aimed at audiences who want performance but can still
live without brand name components.  And our <B>m-Power</B> is for the
value hunter (486 systems).

<H2>InContext Systems - Web Authoring Tools</H2>
<P>
<H3>Welcome to InContext Systems!</H3>
<P>
For the past several years, InContext Systems has been a world leader in
<A HREF="http://incontext.ca/articles/sgml/ic2info1.html"> desktop SGML</A>. 
And now, with the recent explosive growth of the Internet World Wide
Web, we've made it our mission to provide the easiest-to-use HTML
software so you can create the best-looking pages on the Web in a matter
of minutes.  </P>

<P>
We recently launched our series of InContext WebWare&#153; products
with InContext Spider&#153;, the world's first truly interactive Web 
<I>processor</I> that lets you create Web pages just as easily as you
browse through the Web. </P>

InContext Spider

</H3>
<P>

Unlike other HTML editors, you don't have to know anything about HTML to
create exciting Web pages that follow HTML's rules <I> all the time</I>.
InContext Spider does it all behind the scenes so that aspiring
Webmasters can build their Web site with the program's easy-to-use,
interactive interface. </P>

<P>
InContext Spider speaks directly to the browser so that you can cruise
the Web, find the sites you like, and then insert links to them in your
Web page by selecting a simple, one-step command or clicking on the
button bar. You can even download a Web page right into InContext
Spider, add your own text and graphics, and use it as the foundation
for your own page. Other features include: </P>

<A HREF="http://incontext.ca/articles/webware/control7.html">
<I> ...and many many more!  </I> </A>

But enough talk. If you really want to get down to business and see what
InContext Spider can do one-on-one, you can just download an 
<A HREF="http://www.incontext.ca/demo/icspeval.html"> evaluation version</A>

<H2>Inetix - Connecting NetWare IPX/SPX to the Internet</H2>
<P>
The I<I>netix</I> connectivity software from Micro Computer Systems,
Inc. (<a href="http://www.mcsdallas.com/"> MCS</a>) enables Windows-based
NetWare IPX/SPX client computers to access the Internet and World Wide
Web without changing protocols.  Inetix Client and Inetix Gateway work
together to offer NetWare IPX/SPX users transparent access to the
Internet.  The Inetix Client portion allows a NetWare IPX/SPX client
computer to run the most popular Internet access software, ie: NetScape,
Mosaic, Cello, etc., without changing the client protocol to TCP/IP.
The Inetix client portion includes Windows-based FTP software.

<P>
The Inetix Gateway works by translating the IPX/SPX information,
received from the Inetix client, into TCP/IP for the Internet.  The
Gateway includes: node and IP address filtering , connection status
utilities, logging, Firewall and administration utilities.  The Inetix
Gateway is available for <a href="http://www.mcsdallas.com/press.htm">
UNIX</a>, <a href="http://www.mcsdallas.com/press2.htm">Windows NT</a>,
and <a href="http://www.mcsdallas.com/press3.htm">NetWare NLM</a>
versions.  Pricing for the complete software system begins at $995 for a
concurrent user system.

<P>

<P>
<B><A NAME="SS1">HEATHER HAS TWO MOMMIES</A></B>
<P>
If the word "wymyn" causes you to go ballistic - er, into aggression
enhancement mode, then you can break a wind of politically incorrect relief
as you read about Heather's trip to the zoo. One of her two mommies
explains the zoo in politically correct terms, while Heather cuts through
the bovine waste products and gets to the heart of the matter. You'll find
plenty of superb animal photos and a few chuckles, as well as additional
sarcastic links.
<A HREF="http://www-swiss.ai.mit.edu/zoo/heather-has-two-mommies.html">"http://www-swiss.ai.mit.edu/zoo/heather-has-two-mommies.html"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="SS2">NETCAST FUNERAL SERVICES</A></B>
<P>
It had to happen sooner or later. We've become so accustomed to a lack of
face-to-face intimacy that now you can even pay your final respects over
the Net. At Simplex Knowledge Co.'s Cybermourn site, you can see via
closed-circuit camera a new image of the deceased and company every 30
seconds. Cybermourners will be able to send flowers, shiva baskets, and
sympathy cards, and can even arrange to have prayers said. A live chat
between cybermourners and anyone at the funeral who feels up to facing a
keyboard can be conducted in another frame. OK, the idea has some merit to
it, but check out the wildly inappropriate cheerful avatars for your chat
session. <A HREF="http://www.skc.com/cybermourn/index.html">"http://www.skc.com/cybermourn/index.html"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="SS3">THE CONSUMMATE AV HOME PAGE</A></B>
<P>
"Jeffrey Zeldman Presents" is an ambitious title for a home page, but a
visit here will not disappoint. The site hosts an incredible array of audio
and video pleasures presented with sophisticated and elegant design. For
starters, there are plenty of QuickTime movies and GIF animations that are
not merely irritating tricks but endeavor to be actual art. Web designers
can feast on design tips, Q&A ("Ask Doctor Web"), pointers to resources and
tools, a discussion of the creation of the "Batman Forever" Web site, and a
free collection of backgrounds, textures, and icons. You also get paintings
by Zeldman's talented girlfriend, an unusual (be forewarned) adult section,
and original music clips. Come be amazed and entertained.
<A HREF="http://www.zeldman.com/">"http://www.zeldman.com/"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="SS4">THE DARK SIDE OF BATMAN</A></B>
<P>
"Batman, the Animated Series" (a.k.a. "Batman TAS") gives you yet another
version of the batty bemasked marvel... as if Adam West, Michael Keaton,
Val Kilmer, George Clooney, and all the other cartoon and comic book
figures aren't enough. At any rate, this nicely organized Batman TAS
encyclopedia site pays homage to those dark, mysterious Bat-characters from
this television series, with in-depth bios of heros and villains alike,
including Harley Quinn, Commissioner Gordon, Poison Ivy, Joker, and
Two-Face. You'll also find video captures from the show. It's a spooky but
safe enough place for brave kids to visit. <A HREF="http://www.cmgnet.com/~ames/">"http://www.cmgnet.com/~ames/"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="SS5">THE CURE'S WEB HOUSE</A></B>
<P>
Speaking of things dark and gothic, the Cure's house on the Web has all the
modern conveniences, and if you're lucky, you might bump into a friendly
Cure member ready to chat in the conservatory. Go to the kitchen and find
out how to make Robert Smith's favorite prawn curry. Hear official bootlegs
(huh?) and watch videos in the lounge, or grafitti the bathroom (we did!).
Of course you can buy stuff, and be patient while they move in properly,
but this is good real estate. Wonder what the neighbors think.
<A HREF="http://www.thecure.com/">"http://www.thecure.com/"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="SS6">WEIRD FLYING CONTRAPTIONS</A></B>
<P>
Weird things that fly, or almost fly, are featured here. You can find out
where to get a book on building your own hovercraft or simply enjoy
browsing the images and info on rocket belts, jet packs, flying platforms,
one-man helicopters, and more. You can see pictures of a real flying
saucer, the Avrocar experimental craft. Other amazing images include flying
cars and functional flying platforms supporting people.
<A HREF="http://www.prysm.com/~jnuts/">"http://www.prysm.com/~jnuts/"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="SS7">SILVER SCREEN SIRENS</A></B>
<P>
Veronica, Rita, Ingrid, and Greta - they're all here in glorious posed
stills, with home pages and personal tidbits. The well documented site
takes a generally respectful tone, except when referring to Frances Farmer
as a "babe". All the stars are here, as well as cheesecake shots of the
inimitable Mamie Van Doren and Jane Russell. Dazzling.
<A HREF="http://users.deltanet.com/users/dstickne/">"http://users.deltanet.com/users/dstickne/"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="SS8">THE TEA MAN TALKS</A></B>
<P>
The topic is tea. Chinese tea. Indian tea. Tea that's healthy. You name it,
if it's even remotely related to tea, the Tea Man can tell you about it.
This easy-to-swallow newsletter may be just what you need to relax after a
long, hard day. Ah, the variety. The rituals. The amazing tea facts. Do
stop by. <A HREF="http://www.teatalk.com/explorer/index.html">"http://www.teatalk.com/explorer/index.html"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="SS9">CALIFORNIA CUISINE</A></B>
<P>
Hawthorne Lane is a toney restaurant in central SoMa, San Francisco, that
comes from the same stock as Chez Panisse. So it's no surprise its Web site
has an elegant logo and articles about growing heirloom tomatoes. In fact,
each item on the menu gets it own full text paragraph. The nice thing here
is the opportunity to click a recipe and make the mouth-watering dish for
yourself. Well worth bookmarking for those times when you need to impress
the guests. <A HREF="http://www.hawthornelane.com/hawthornelane/">"http://www.hawthornelane.com/hawthornelane/"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="SS10">RAMEN IN THOUGHT</A></B>
<P>
Are you a noodle nerd? Are styrofoam cups of petrified noodles your idea of
a major food group? Here's the Web site of your food dreams, or nightmares.
You can read about the inventor of Top Ramen instant noodles, learn how to
prevent "noodle breakage", and view the famous (oh, really?) Cup Noodles
billboard in Times Square. If you're truly a gourmet, don't miss the
unbelievable recipes for delicacies made with Top Ramen. How about Top
Ramen Chicken Noodle Strudel, for example, made with pineapple, cornstarch,
red pepper, broccoli, and chicken flavor Top Ramen? Yummm.
<A HREF="http://www.nissinfoods.com/">"http://www.nissinfoods.com/"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="SS11">HYPNOTIZE YOURSELF ON THE INTERNET</A></B>
<P>
No, not the standard way, in which you stare at your monitor long enough to
fall asleep, dropping your nose on your keyboard and filling your screen
with "hhhhhhhh...." This site is easy to navigate and provides simple
directions for anyone who wants to use self-hypnosis to improve their life.
There is a special section for teachers and students for overcoming test
anxiety but all can learn to make personal and practical use of
self-hypnosis. You can even take a mini-vacation by using the information
provided. The site author, has included a professional history and a short
history of hypnotism. <A HREF="http://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/hypnotism/">"http://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/hypnotism/"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="SS12">RIDING THE RAILS</A></B>
<P>
The romance of the hobo takes a bit of a beating - as did, apparently, a
good number of hobos - in David Barnes's audio interviews of 83-year-old
Bob Zimmerman of Peru, Indiana. Zimmerman, who rode the rails during the
Great Depression, here relates tales of the simple acts of kindness that
kept him and his buddies alive and the anything-but-kind acts of the
freight yard "bulls" hired by the railways to keep the hobos at bay.
Zimmerman's a decent raconteur, but the combination of low-quality
recordings (you'll need TrueSpeech to play the selections) and Barnes's
interjections make listening something of a challenge.

<B><A NAME="OT1">VIRTUAL DAYDREAMS OF THE GREAT OUTDOORS</A></B>
<P>
Created with netsurfers in mind, Nature Break is a site with virtual
outdoor adventure for those of us who are too desk-bound to get out there
for real. All of this relaxation is brought to you by the wonders of QTVR.
Look around Diablo Canyon, for example, imagine yourself there, and feel
restored. Of course, the rest you can get while waiting for each movie to
download over a dial-up line is probably pretty beneficial too.
<A HREF="http://naturebreak.com/">"http://naturebreak.com/"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="OT2">LUNATIC TO TRY TO BIKE AROUND WORLD IN A MONTH</A></B>
<P>
Nick Sanders is Mr. Determined. Despite a dislocated ankle, extreme
exhaustion, and really crappy weather, he managed to ride his motorcycle
almost the length of the Americas in 35 days, only to have snow bungle the
final steps of a complete journey. At one point, he was so tired he fell of
his bike and couldn't pick it up again. You can follow Sanders's agony
online, and prepare to do it again as he's off in October on the Mobil
Around the World Challenge. It will all be documented, it will raise money
for charity, but it will not, apparently, demystify the answer to the
question, "Why?" <A HREF="http://www.mobilchallenge.ihost.com/index.html">"http://www.mobilchallenge.ihost.com/index.html"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="OT3">GLOBAL ONLINE ADVENTURES</A></B>
<P>
If you've always wanted to sail solo around the world or dreamed of a
similar extended trip, point your browser to Global Online Adventure
Learning (GOALS). Here you'll find accounts of sailors who've tackled or
are tackling the ultimate in daring, endurance, and skill. Besides
background on the sailors and their vessels, this site keeps you posted on
their recent or current progress with explodable maps, journal entries,
pictures, and statistics. There's also a virtual yacht club, in case you
want to learn to tie knots or communicate with other surfers, and a nice
photo gallery. Click here, matey. <A HREF="http://goals.com/">"http://goals.com/"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="OT4">YAHOO LOVES LA</A></B>
<P>
Trendy, useful, and pure Web: that's "Yahoo! Los Angeles", sister of
"Yahoo! San Francisco" and "Yahoo! New York". Web sites with local focus
are coming on strong, and this is one of the biggest and best. What Yahoo
did to organize the Web it's doing for LA with its famously easy-to-grasp
categorization by subject. Business, classifieds, news, maps, show biz,
sports, recreation, and more and more make you wonder why anyone on the Web
will ever buy a travel guide again. Every major city should have something
like this and eventually probably will. <A HREF="http://la.yahoo.com/">"http://la.yahoo.com/"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="OT5">FIJI FACTS</A></B>
<P>
Who needs a travel service when your tour guide lives at your destination
and offers to arrange your itinerary by e-mail? Rob Kay promotes his own
services as well as the fabled beauty of Fiji with his Fiji Islands Guide,
a site as low key as the land it describes with concision and graphic
economy. His FAQs page takes the tone of a travel brochure but his tidbits
are on the money. You'd expect that of a former journalist. This guide does
not have Fodor's glitz, but then, paradise never needed glitz. The Endless
Surfing page refers to the real thing. Sigh. <A HREF="http://www.fijiguide.com/">"http://www.fijiguide.com/"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="OT6">THE LAND OF CASTRO AND CUGAT</A></B>
<P>
Don't go looking for a welcome from Fidel at CubaNet. The look of the site
is slick, the content rich, and the politics expatriate. Though a
self-proclaimed "non-partisan Internet project", CubaNet does focus on the
"underground democracy movement" in Cuba, and aims to skirt government
censorship with a bit of help from the Web. That said, CubaNet is, if not
non-partisan, at least non-polemical. The site includes an encyclopedia of
Cuban music and music-makers (text only, though), selected art by Cuban
artists, a photo album, and daily news updates from Cuba in English and
Spanish. The art of dissident artists and cigar labels are also
highlighted. The site hosts an enormous list of like-minded sites in both
English and Spanish. <A HREF="http://www.netpoint.net/~cubanet/">"http://www.netpoint.net/~cubanet/"</A>

Lots of radio stations broadcast on the Net now. Of course, you have to
spin your virtual dial to find something to your liking. Now with "The DJ"
free software for Win95 (and a 28.8 kbps modem) you have access to
continuous music delivered via RealAudio. With over 40 channels such as

Are you enamored of Web Search Engines? Wouldn't it be great if you could
search your own documents the same way? You can, with Digital's "AltaVista
Search My Computer Private eXtension" free beta software for Win95. Using
the same technology as Digital's excellent public engine, you can index and
search your hard disk. The software also recognizes both Microsoft Exchange
and Eudora mailboxes, which can be handy if you are using Eudora Light with
its lame one-at-a-time search capabilities. Results are displayed in a
table that lets take  a quick peek or launch an application. The same
desktop interface allows you to search the Web without launching your
browser. The downside to this is the huge index files, which appear to be
about half the size of the indexed data. If you've got the spare space,
though, it's worth it - this baby is fast. Alta Vista:

The staff at the Clicked shareware emporium staff is a little peeved at our

before Microsoft adopted a similar look. And a Mac version is in the works.

<B><A NAME="BS1">THE NET V. JANET RENO: INDECENCY LAW PARTIALLY ON HOLD</A></B>
<P>
The backlash against the US "Communication Decency Act of 1996" is
underway. Aside from symbolic protests of black backgrounds and blue
ribbons, several major free speech advocates have launched a suit
against Janet Reno (who, we suppose, doesn't agree with the legislation
anyway) in her capacity as Attorney General of the US. Confusing
everyone, a federal judge has upheld parts of the law and blocked
others, calling the term "indecent" too vague while legally approving of
"patently offensive". The more networthy plaintiffs - the Electronic
Frontier Foundation (EFF), the Electronic Privacy Information Center
(EPIC), and ClariNet - are joined by less e-focused groups like the
American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU). Check out any of the following:

editors from some of the biggest and best print magazines. It's all here

<B><A NAME="BS3">INVEST REAL MONEY IN POLITICAL FUTURES MARKET</A></B>
<P>
The Iowa Electronic Markets are real-money futures markets for contracts
based on economic and political events such as elections. While this is
an academic project, you can make - or lose - real money. You purchase
futures contracts for a chosen outcome of a political race, and if
you're right you make a profit. If not, you lose the bundle. The action
isn't confined to the US. You may also invest in a number of races from
Austria and British Columbia. There are spiffy graphs of the action, the
latest quotes, and many links to related sites. In fact, aside from the
futures market itself, this is a great index of political websurfing,
ranging from candidate's sites to media analysis to polling data.
Definitely bookmark material. <A HREF="http://www.biz.uiowa.edu/iem/">"http://www.biz.uiowa.edu/iem/"</A>

<B><A NAME="BS4">CHINA TURNS THE SCREWS ON LOCAL INTERNET USERS</A></B>
<P>
In a predictably totalitarian move, China has decided that all Internet
users in that country must register with the state security department
and that international Internet access must be routed through
state-controlled gateways. Concern over "non-Asian" values, pornography,
and potential damage to state security provide the justifying loincloth
wrapped around these restrictions. In a related move, businesses in
China will no longer be allowed to import financial data electronically,
but will have to get if from government sources. Predictably, a black
market of Internet addresses has reportedly sprung up. CNN's short story
provides a few more details.

<B><A NAME="BS6">WHITE HOUSE ACCIDENTALLY BLOCKED BY SURFWATCH</A></B>
<P>
In case you haven't heard, SurfWatch makes software that prevents access
to objectionable sites, used primarily by parents to shield their kids
from reality, leading the offspring to enter politics when they grow up.
In any event, one of the pages on Socks the cat's virtual tour of the
White House contains the word "couples" (as in Bill and Hillary, Al and
Tipper). This subversive phrase was deemed too shocking for underage
eyes, leading to the blocking of the entire White House site. Saner
heads eventually prevailed, once the White House webmaster complained.
Is this comedy or tragedy? Despite the absurdity, kudos to SurfWatch,
which is, in the greater scheme of things, part of the solution rather
than the problem. <A HREF="http://www.surfwatch.com/">"http://www.surfwatch.com/"</A>

He's been a cult phenomenon for years, redefining the very notion of
action hero. Watching one of his movies is as much fun as seeing a
tornado rip through a trailer park full of Hollywood executives. What's
more, aside from being possibly the best screen athlete ever, he
actually can act. Though Jackie's been making great movies for decades,
he's been relatively unknown here in the States. This is about to change
with the release of his new feature "Rumble in the Bronx". A major
publicity blitz brings with it this action-packed Web site. Aside from
the usual plot synopsis, clips, and interviews, you'll find a guide to
Jackie's personal appearances, merchandise info, CuSee-Me clips, e-mail,
and even a Shockwave analysis of his stunts. If nothing else, check out
the video clips. Awesome! <A HREF="http://www.rumble.com/">"http://www.rumble.com/"</A>

Everyone with a Web site or, for that matter, with a Web browser can

spent any time netsurfing, you've noticed the plethora of virtual awards
displayed on Web pages. The Anarchy Award offers every Net junkie the
chance to review his own site and award himself the ultimate crowning
glory, Anarchy's "The Best of the Web". Anarchy reserves venom for other
Web awards like Point Communications. If, as Lycos and Alta Vista claim,
there are 16.5 million valid Web pages, Web cruising for 24 hours a day
while spending 10 minutes at each page would let a Point surfer visit
its famed top five percent in only 15 years. Keep those acceptance
speeches under 20 minutes, please.

A site that includes its own calibration tests for adjusting your

analogue to digital media, using images with content value and not just

of Havana; documentation of Guatemalan coffee harvesters; street
children in Mexico City; even abstract erotica. Well worth a visit.

More than just another online art museum, the Carnegie Museum of Art's

ways: in short blurbs on the page; through links to the Britannica
Online; and in RealAudio files. Unfortunately, the gray images lack
oomph next to the color panels, but connections to other paintings by an
artist somewhat make up for that. The site disappears at the end of

The Lost World, Michael Crichton's sequel to Jurassic Park, is the
subject of a Web page set up by his publisher, Random House. The
stylishly designed site offers users an automatic guided tour of the
eerie world of bio-engineering gone wrong, as well as excerpts - audio
and text - from the novel. Notable sights at the site include scads of
dinosaur, genetics, and paleontology sites, a Web contest related to the
book's release, video clips from the Jurassic Park movie (with the first
T. rex scene!), and short synopses of some of Crichton's other works. As
soon as production on the Lost World movie begins (unless it already
has), this site will find its monthly hits increasing exponentially.

Piety. Wholesomeness. Family values. If you're looking for any of those,
just be sure to give Fat City News a wide berth. This satirical,
sarcastic e-zine pulls laughs out of its e-hat with articles like "Why
Nixon Rising from the Depths of Hell Is the Only Hope for America",
which holds up the late ex-president as the only savior from the
mediocrity that the American elections are unleashing on an unsuspecting
populace. This is hard-hitting, below the belt, hilarious stuff, but is
certainly not for the easily offended or delicate of constitution.

wounds or treat syphilis with urethral injections of mercury." Ouch!
Great pains were taken in this Web restoration. Its dry conservatism may
not spark a treasure hunt, but it aims at currency with references to

And they're all displayed against a hideously vivid rainbow background
with mucho animation. Some of the images are quite nice though and the
globe icon collection is potentially useful. The historic maps are
particularly fascinating. But visit wearing your darkest sunglasses.

The Philadelphia Inquirer's Health and Science magazine has its own
Internet site. If you're the kind of individual who is entranced by
reports on fruit flies and craves to know whether neutrinos have mass,
you'll love this Web page. The health-related topics are not as
prevalent as the science stuff - despite the nagging note about the need
for adults to get booster shots - but reading about Jurassic frogs and
the virtues of bats lowers our blood pressure, at least.

<P>
A James Randi in the making has devoted a page to the Bermuda Triangle.
Why do strange things seem to happen in the triangular space between
Bermuda, Miami, and San Juan, PR? Wrong question. Ask why people believe
they happen. Here's a great place to start exploring the possibilities
and weeding out the myths. It's not the most professional looking site
out there, but we commend the effort.

<B><A NAME="SS1">WINDOWS 95 MADNESS</A></B>
<P>
You've been hyped enough, so we won't slap you around with any more snappy
lines, witty asides, or caustic remarks. Here are the crucial sites. The
Microsoft Win95 Site has free software, compatability info, and the usual
support materials. "Report From an OS/2 Devotee" is a PC World cover story
with an IBMish perspective.  Try the "Unofficial Windows 95 Software
Archive" for free and shareware goodies. Finally, are there Subliminal
Messages in Windows 95? Bob Loblaw takes you on a twisted tour of the best
ones. Now you can sleep at night, knowing you have the links that matter.

<B><A NAME="SS2">IF IT'S OUTDOORS, IT'S IN GORP</A></B>
<P>
Some of us use the Great Outdoor Recreation Pages (GORP) a remarkable
amount. From links to every U.S. National Park/Forest/Monument/etc. home
page to the rec.boats.paddle FAQ, you can access a wealth of
outdoor-related information by activity type, geographic location, and
attraction name. You can find links to environmental resources for the
eco-politically active; health info for travelers who go off the beaten
path; gear; books and maps to order; current magazine and newspaper
articles; organizations to join or volunteer for; and of course, commercial
trips to go on. It's all up to date and clearly arranged: a real
masterpiece of Web service. <A HREF="http://www.gorp.com/">"http://www.gorp.com/"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="SS3">THE BURNING MAN FESTIVAL 1995</A></B>
<P>
Build it and they'll come. Build it, burn it, and they'll come again and again.
Burning Man is a unique annual celebration held in the high desert
wilderness of Northern Nevada - so remote, the organizers provide survival
instructions. Three days of art, music, dance, and performance - often by
costumed celebrants - climax in the ritual destruction by fire of a
four-story human effigy known as the Burning Man. In its tenth year, the
festival will take place Aug. 31 to Sept. 4, 1995. The official Web site
below gives a taste of the event and some images, but we suspect you gotta
be there to truly soak it all in. <A HREF="http://www.well.com/user/burnman/">"http://www.well.com/user/burnman/"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="SS4">WHO SHOT MONTY BURNS?</A></B>
<P>
If you're one of the millions of fans of "The Simpsons", then you've
probably had half an urge to put a bullet in the nasty old curmudgeon
yourself, as did one character in last spring's season-ending cliffhanger.
Now there's a site devoted to unmasking the murderer. Clues lie scattered
about the site and a bulletin board hosts an ongoing discussion of the
mystery, or you can study the suspect file, provided by the
ever-incompetent Police Chief Wiggums. Richly illustrated with characters
from the show, this site also provides background on the program, and an
upcoming episode guide. The only problem with the site is... no donuts.
Doh! <A HREF="http://www.springfield.com/main.html">"http://www.springfield.com/main.html"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="SS5">THE RIGHT TO DIE</A></B>
<P>
DeathNET, a collaboration of the Right to Die Society of Canada and Derek
Humphry, best-selling author of "Final Exit", contains a vast array of
resources covering right-to-die materials. This large, impressively laid
out, and intelligently designed site offers over 550 files and 100 links
covering legal, political, social, and medical information on human
mortality, euthanasia, and bereavement. A frequent target of the press,
DeathNET also features a popular page on media criticism.
<A HREF="http://www.islandnet.com/~deathnet/">"http://www.islandnet.com/~deathnet/"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="SS6">MARKETING OF THE MORBID</A></B>
<P>
Just call this the "death issue" of Netsurfer Digest. There's at least a
couple of sites out there cashing in on celebrity demises. Looking for a
Halloween gift? Try Celebrity Rubbings from the Grave. You can buy a
gravestone rubbing from the resting place of Jimi Hendrix, Marilyn Monroe,
or many others. Want a very rare David Koresh business card? How about the
medical examiner's report on Kurt Cobain's death? Digital Deviations Gift
Catalog caters to the tastes of the, um, more unusual collector, with
copies of the death certificates of more than 20 celebrities from Karen
Carpenter to Humphrey Bogart.

<P>
<B><A NAME="SS7">ONE-STOP HUMOR SPOT</A></B>
<P>
Time for some levity. Oracle's Humor Archives (not to be confused with the
Usenet Oracle) is a compendium of Usenet comic relief. Containing
everything from top-ten lists to dreaded blonde jokes, it's a virtual
warehouse of humor. The site also contains a collection of Net-available
comic strips and even includes the entire screenplay for "Monty Python's
Quest for the Holy Grail". If you've always wanted to know the air-speed
velocity of an unladen swallow (African or European?) drop on in.
<A HREF="http://www.synapse.net/~oracle/Contents/HumorArch.html">"http://www.synapse.net/~oracle/Contents/HumorArch.html"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="SS8">JUST ABOUT EVERYTHING'S IN THE ART BIN</A></B>
<P>
At first glance, this eclectic collection of pages might be mistaken for a
magazine. The grand theme is culture, and the content is varied. H.G. Wells
proves himself a visionary in "World Brain: The Idea of a Permanent World
Encyclopedia". "The whole human memory can be, and probably in a short time
will be, made accessible to every individual," he wrote. Consider us a
neuron. The Kisamor Documents deal with Kisamor, a female natural healer in
Sweden (1788-1842). There's even a sound file of James Joyce reading a
fragment of "Finnegan's Wake". This site is not for everyone, but what a
find for those with refined and/or oddball tastes.

<B><A NAME="SS9">SANTA CRUZ MOUNTAIN GEEKS</A></B>
<P>
A UC-Santa Cruz tradition known as the "geek house" continues to live on in
the "Resort", a mixed-sex group of self-confirmed geeks who can teach you
all you need to know about nitrous oxide, Santa Cruz's Mystery Spot, and
the local Renaissance Faire. Households comprised solely of computer geeks
are scattered throughout the Santa Cruz Mountains of central California,
and there are links to most of them through this page. The residents of the
Resort have a couple of rooms available to the right person. Before you
pack your bags, make sure you like banana slugs. <A HREF="http://resort.com/">"http://resort.com/"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="SS10">PHILOSOPHY, THEOLOGY, AND FAMILY COOKING</A></B>
<P>
Orrin Onken's Very Serious Guide to Spiritual Stuff offers the soon to be
classic text, "The Big Dummy's Guide to Philosophy, Theology, and Ethics".
After introducing naive "technoids" to the jargon of "deep thought", this
work delves into questions like "Does God exist?", "Do we have free will?",
and "Who is really going to Hell?" Despite virtual tongue in virtual cheek,
basics of the real arguments do get covered. When you're done with that,
take a gander at the other document here, Onken Family Cooking, which holds
as its philosophy "fresh ingredients, cast iron pans, and a cupboard full
of garlic" to "hold at bay the tide of pretentious gourmetism that
threatens to engulf America." <A HREF="http://www.industrial.com/~simon/">"http://www.industrial.com/~simon/"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="SS11">NOT FANTASY BASEBALL, BUT BASEBALL FANTASY</A></B>
<P>
Based on the belief that baseball "is really a metaphor for the life of the
mind", the Cosmic Baseball Association has sorted cultural icons into teams
competing in cyberleagues. For example, the 1995 Vestal Virgins roster
lists Marilyn Monroe, P; Yoko Ono, IF/OF; Pocahontas, P; and Sappho, C/OF;
among others. Fans can follow links to thumbnail biographies of each. This
is probably the only place on Earth you'll find a bio on rocket pioneer
Robert Goddard a few clicks from the hypothetical (and shabby) batting
average of Alan Ginsberg. <A HREF="http://www.clark.net/pub/cosmic/cba1.html">"http://www.clark.net/pub/cosmic/cba1.html"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="SS12">WOULDN'T YOU LIKE TO BE A PEPPER, TOO?</A></B>
<P>
The Unofficial Dr. Pepper Homepage is a shrine to the beverage the creator
of this homage cannot do without. Rather than an overwhelming and unabashed
marketing ploy, the Dr. Pepper page comes off as a sincere tribute to the
drink as though it were a trusted friend, a companion through long nights
and bleary days. In any event, this site offers more than just adulation
and fun nutrition facts. It also has some pretty spiffy VRML pages that
allow Web surfers to navigate what might be Dr. Pepper-induced
hallucinations. Be a Pepper. <A HREF="http://www.astro.wisc.edu/~howk/pepper.html">"http://www.astro.wisc.edu/~howk/pepper.html"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="SS13">MY GOD, IT'S FULL OF STAR TREK</A></B>
<P>
Star Trek:The Billion Billion Dollar Best Marketing Scheme Ever will always
have special status on the Internet. This Web site guarantees it. This
unofficial WWW Star Trek page indexes, rates, and links to every Star Trek
site on the Net. It's massive - as in your CPU will perceptibly gain weight
when loading it - but it's cool. Live long and prosper.

<B><A NAME="SS14">SPEAKING OF STAR TREK...</A></B>
<P>
"Darmok and Jalad at Tanagra." If your immediate reaction is "Huh?", the
Darmok Dictionary is ready to introduce you to one of the best episodes of
Star Trek:The Next Generation. The third-season episode, "Darmok", features
aliens with whom the Enterprise crew is incapable of communicating, since
they speak only in the metaphors of their alien culture. The Darmok
Dictionary decodes the cryptic statements made by the alien race, known as
the Tamarians, and provides an exhaustive dissection of the episode. The
site might only be of worth to hard-core trekkers, but should be commended
simply for the amount of effort that has gone into detailing the 46-minute
episode. Mirab, his sails unfurled.
<A HREF="http://www.wavefront.com/~raphael/darmok/darmok.html">"http://www.wavefront.com/~raphael/darmok/darmok.html"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="SS15">THE PRONOIA PAGE</A></B>
<P>
This site is devoted to the 1994 Pronoia ("the suspicion others are
conspiring behind your back to HELP you") tour born of the huge publicity
jolt following a cover story on the Zippies in Wired magazine. The Zippies,
(Zen Inspired Pronoia Professionals, or "hippies with zip"), loosely
affiliated with the rave scene and the Rainbow family, are ideological
opposites of the do-nothing, don't-care, slacker Gen-X stereotype. The site
has a superior collection of links to music, politics, virtual communities,
and spirituality and consciousness sites. Promises of audio/video
experiments and links to interactive communities suggest that you keep an
eye on this page. <A HREF="http://myhouse.com/pronoia/">"http://myhouse.com/pronoia/"</A>

<P>
Feeling misty about the Misty Isles? This is your site. The Virtual Irish
Pub contains a wealth of information about Ireland and things Irish. The
pub is divided into tables, each hosting a topic of its own. The literature
table includes information on famous Irish writers, current Irish
bestseller lists, and some excellent essays and poetry gleaned from the
Net. The Explore Ireland table is a tourism resource, and the music table
provides a number of links to pages devoted to Irish musicians. There's
even a chat table. Belly up to the bar, pour yourself a pint of Guinness,
and enjoy. <A HREF="http://www.misty.com/ulysses/vip/welcome.html">"http://www.misty.com/ulysses/vip/welcome.html"</A>

<B><A NAME="OT2">AROUND THE WORLD... WITHOUT LEAVING THE GROUND</A></B>
<P>
If you enjoyed Luke's Hippy Dippy global travels, and even if you didn't,
chances are you'll really like Jeff Greenwald's Big World. Jeff, a
professional travel writer, made his trip around the world using only
surface transportation. We're impressed. He tells about it in a thoughtful,
engaging manner. Fascinating stories and a spiffy interactive map - what
more does one need?

<P>
<B><A NAME="OT3">ALCATRAZ ISLAND</A></B>
<P>
Volunteers with the National Park Service bring one of San Francisco's most
popular tourist attractions, the infamous ex-prison on Alcatraz Island, to
the Web. With an emphasis on straight text, there's everything you'd want
to know about "The Rock". You'll find a history of the prison, including
the 1969-71 Native American occupation, the island's natural history, and
visitor information. Go to the bookstore area to hear audio clips from
former inmates and island residents. All subsections conclude with a Q&A
that answers questions like "Are there any rats on Alcatraz?"

<B><A NAME="OT4">FRANCE AT A GLANCE</A></B>
<P>
If you're a North American planning a trip to France, FranceScape is the
site for you, literally. The French Government Tourist Office and France
OnLine (both located in the U.S.) have teamed up to bring you a touring
guide to - guess where - France! You'll find regional information; tips for
traveling by car, train, and bus; suggestions for planning your trip; a
list of tour operators; and more. Although the chic graphics are great to
look at, it seems they're a bit slow to load. Zut alore!

<B><A NAME="OT5">ADVENTURE UNDER NEW ZEALAND</A></B>
<P>
According to this Web site, the name Waitomo comes from the Maori "wai"
(water) and "tomo" (hole or shaft). As you might guess, Waitomo is a region
in New Zealand reknowned for its caverns and underground watercourses.
Centrally located on the North Island, the limestone caves are home to many
glowworms. Activities and adventure center around a small village called
Waitomo Caves (or simply Waitomo). The pages have historical, spelunking,
and general tourist info, nicely illustrated with photos and MPEGs.

Want to talk about your day in the sun? Try Toucan Travel, where you can
show and tell all about your latest travel adventures. Here, ordinary folks
describe their trips with prose and GIFs. So far, most stories highlight
good times in the tropics. You're invited to submit your own recollections

of these mini-essays could use more detail. On the other hand, a taste of

<B><A NAME="BS1">CMU BANS ALT.SEX, SPARKS NET FUROR</A></B>
<P>
Carnegie Mellon University sparked a nationwide furor by removing several
alt.sex newsgroups from its Usenet feed. Officials were worried about
liability for knowingly distributing sexually explicit or obscene material,
especially to minors. Criticism has come from both the student body and the
faculty, which passed a resolution to reinstate the alt groups. National
organizations like the American Civil Liberties Union have also weighed in
with criticism. The ever-practical students have responded with a "How to
Receive Banned Newsgroups" FAQ and a well orchestrated series of protest
actions. Check out the comprehensive and informative Web page for daily
updates on the situation. Discussion threads can also be found on
alt.censorship and alt.comp.acad-freedom.talk.

<B><A NAME="BS2">COURT RULING LIMITS SCOPE OF ELECTRONIC PRIVACY ACT</A></B>
<P>
In reviewing the outcome of the notorious Steve Jackson v. the Secret
Service case (the Secret Service went nuts and confiscated the BBS of a
harmless Cyberpunk game publisher), the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals has
ruled that the seizure of a bulletin board (BBS) which contains private
electronic mail is not an unlawful interception prohibited by the
Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986. They upheld a lower court
ruling that the seizure was not an intercept because it was not
contemporaneous with the transmission of the communications, thus not
protected under the ECPA.

The Internet Hunt is on hiatus until January. According to Rick Gates,
master of the hunt, "We're trying to evolve the Hunt. If we are to avoid
stagnancy, and continue to reflect the energy and dynamism of the Nets,
it's time for a change." The monthly contest features a series of questions
with answers to be found on the Net. Contestants vie to answer the most
questions in the least amount of time by surfing the Net. We'll let you
know when it's back.

The latest Domain Survey recorded a 21 percent host growth rate in the
third quarter of 1994, the greatest rate of growth in the past four years.
If projections hold, we should see 100 million hosts by the first quarter
of 1999. Not surprisingly, the .com domain is now the largest with over one
million hosts. In another telling statistic, the .net domain, used by many
public data internet service providers for their customers, grew by 66
percent during the quarter. You can find all the statistics at:

<P>
In what may be the most stunning election result of our time, a true bird
brain has been swept into high office. On November 8, 2,648 voters,
spanning three countries and 31 institutions of lower learning, voted to
elect a new mayor of Toon Town. The illustrious roster of candidates
included Mickey Mouse, Bugs Bunny, Donald Duck, and Batman. The real kicker
is the results: Tweety Bird (!!), with 709 votes, is the new mayor of Toon
Town. It gets better. The commercial powerhouse Mickey Mouse (385) placed a
distant 5th behind runner-up Minnie Mouse (581), Donald Duck (512) and
Mayor-elect Tweety Bird's archnemesis, Sylvester (388). Batman was not in
the running, with only one vote, the same pathetic number as the Tick. You
won't get news like this on CNN, folks.

can customize any of her knit blankets, wraps, bags, and so on, with a

easily checked out. We suggest you turn off your inline image downloading

<P>
We found a couple of great quotes in a recent Wall Street Journal from rival
publishers of Internet oriented magazines. NetGuide says they are "the
first consumer magazine devoted entirely to helping people navigate through
cyberspace." No way, says Internet World: "We were the first consumer
magazine to help people navigate through cyberspace." Well, we here at
Netsurfer say they're both wrong. As far as we know, Boardwatch magazine
was there long before either of them. Back before the Net was the happening
thing they covered the cyberspace of the BBSes with more style, substance,
and panache then either of the above can possibly hope to match. So here's

<P>
The newsgroup is alt.anarchy. The topic is freedom. This is the place to
hang out if governments give you the dry heaves and if liberty is your
passion. The discussion can turn to conventional politics - for example,
the rightist outcome of recent U.S. Congressional elections - but you can
also find more philosophical threads: how should an anarchistic society
deal with psychopaths? ("Anarchy and Psychopaths"); is it possible to sell
your freedom? ("Freedom for Sale"). For the practical anarchist who must
deal with everyday problems of managing a revolution, this is the place to
ask about how-to manuals like "The Anarchist Cookbook". A useful resource
if you need to go and overthrow something.

The approaching online appearance of The Stark Fist of Removal, the

Info Bog (aka Kibosphere, The Information Catheter) for the uninitiated,
but cheap enlightenment does not come cheap. Read about the Church's
charismatic
yet fecund anti-leader J. R. "Bob" Dobbs, connections between the Mormon
"Guide to Self-Control" and masturbating with boxing gloves on, Bob Dobbs
screen savers for Linux (that most slackful of Unixes), and a proposal for
countering the religious right's insistence on a moment of silence in
schools with a moment of chaos. If you can't wait to see the online Stark

where you can listen to some synthesized outtakes from Tieleman, immersing
yourself in the Rhonde, the Pavane, and La Bataille. Finally, head over to
an art exhibition of rather

John Ockerbloom has created a new Web page making books which have been the
objects of censorship, particularly by legal authorities or by schools,
available online. The selections range from "Ulysses" to "Little Red Riding

killjoys thought kids couldn't handle that monumentally trivial detail. In

<P>
Presumably, the profligate links on Websters's Page will be among the 500
to be listed in the soon-to-be-released book "Internet: A Parents' Guide",
for which this site serves as an advance teaser. The page, ostensibly for
use by kids and their parents, contains links both useful and irrelevant to
the target audience. Among the worthwhile science, art, and reference sites
are a few like EDGAR, an outlet for the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission, which might be okay for a term paper, but otherwise would seem
to have limited appeal. <A HREF="http://www.halcyon.com/ResPress/kids.html">"http://www.halcyon.com/ResPress/kids.html"</A>

<B><A NAME="BEZ3">STRANGE LINKS FORM MAGICAL BLEND</A></B>
<P>
"Magical Blend Magazine" seems to have nestled itself in the simply strange
and mystical, improved over, or perhaps retreating from, its original "too
weird for words" style. Unfortunately, they also removed some interesting
links, though plenty of strange ones remain. It has some far-out articles
and art on display.  Authors like Tim Leary and Ursula Le Guin cavort
around articles like "The Call of the Goddess", "Q'ero Shamanism and the
West", and "The World of Ambient Music". If the offbeat is your bag, check

<B><A NAME="BEZ4">CYBERKIND KINDLY WELCOMES NEW SUBSCRIBERS</A></B>
<P>
Rated by PC Week as a must-visit E-Zine, Cyberkind plays tribute to the
electronic world and its scientific underpinnings. This electronic journal
is specifically designed for prosaics and poetics who wax poetic about the
world of wired communication. For this reason, a majority of the pieces
mentioned in the table of contents contain a reference to Internet,
electronic, or scientific offerings. Choosing to link to the description of
the contributors offers insight into why Cyberkind's creators have joined
forces. Most of the writers sound hip and with-it, and a number provide
links to individual home pages. Linking to a poem called MiceLives was a
very out-there experience and
worth exploring for the poetically inclined or just electronically curious.

distributed by first class snail mail. It is designed to help those in
development, marketing, planning, etc. to keep up with news from the
business and technical press concerning the converging information
technologies. The editors will follow, they say, "hundreds" of publications
and will focus on "those articles that
provide insightful analysis". Yearly subscriptions: US$24, CDN$36,

The editor of Campus Voice needs your help. Campus Voice is a college
magazine put out as a four-foot square poster installed in wall-mounted
frames and kiosks. It reaches about 3.8 million college students. The
January poster will be all about pizza - from a college perspective. If
anyone out there has any interesting facts (e.g. college students eat 45
lbs. of pizza per semester, etc.), strange recipes, stories, or knows where
such things can be found, please let him know. He'll even cite you as a

<P>
MidLink Magazine, an E-zine for kids in middle grades, is looking for
submissions to their "Home for the Holidays" page, to be featured in the
December/January issue. Kids should draw something about their favorite
holiday celebrated anytime from now through January. While at MidLink's WWW
page, check out the last two monthly features, Virtual Haunted House and
"Consider Yourself At Home", with drawings of homes and schools by kids
worldwide. The "Global Skylines" project is also conceptually interesting,
allowing you to gaze, for example, at the skyline of Des Moines, Iowa, as
drawn by a pre-teen. Kids or teachers can contact Caroline McCullen at
"<B>mccullen@aquarius.cc.ucf.edu</B>"
for more info or send her the URL of the drawing once you get it online.

<I>The best places to netsurf this week</I>
<P>
<B><A NAME="SS1">IF: THE INTERACTIVE FANTASY NETWORK</A></B>
<P>
The Interactive Fantasy Network is a place to let your imagination run
wild. Become a registered guest by selecting a fantasy name and
answering a few questions. Then explore the place and meet the regulars
at various real-time chat "tables". Enter contests. Play games. Search
for new friends, adventure - hey, you might even find your soulmate
(sorry, no guarantees). If this is starting to sound like IRC (Internet
Relay Chat) or commercial service chat rooms, you're right. It is
essentially that, but chat is only forwarded to you when you choose to
reload the table page. Some of the nifty graphics are a bit slow to
load. But it's definitely worth stopping by. <A HREF="http://www.ifnet.com/">"http://www.ifnet.com/"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="SS2">ALTA VISTA THE LATEST, GREATEST SEARCH ENGINE</A></B>
<P>
It's easy. It's fast. It's great. Really! Thanks to sponsor Digital
Equipment Corporation (DEC), the Alta Vista search site is instant
competition for Yahoo, Inktomi, and the ilk. It's easy to believe DEC's
claim that it has indexed more than 16 million Web pages, along with
postings from 13,000 Usenet groups "updated in real-time". Click on
"Surprise" for random fun. Addictive? You bet! This is the latest word
in free industrial-strength Web searching. Brief descriptions accompany
hits. If you only add one search engine to your hotlist, add this one.
It's a light year ahead of the others. <A HREF="http://altavista.digital.com/">"http://altavista.digital.com/"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="SS3">MENTOS, THE FRESHMAKER</A></B>
<P>
This is one of the most devoted tongue in cheek sites we've seen.
Obsessively detailed and maddeningly descriptive, the Mentos site
examines everything from the jingle to the international packaging to
the opinions of consumers (includes their web addreses) to the horror of
Mint Chews, the fake Mentos that are "not sufficently fresh nor full of
life". Special care is taken to deconstruct the commercials, possibly
the worst of all time. Mentos Lingo, called "Fresh Speak", details such
terms as "Momentos", which are Mentos from overseas bought as
souveniers. Very refreshing, and concludes for all time what the plural
is. <A HREF="http://www.mentos.com/">"http://www.mentos.com/"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="SS4">INTERNET CRIME ARCHIVE</A></B>
<P>
The Internet Crime Archive is a reference page for surfers interested in
the history and psychology of mass murderers, serial killers, and other
assorted sociopaths. The site nicely uses Netscape 2.0's frames to keep
the index of depravity visible at all times. The complete News Flash and
Crime Archives sections offer links to more detailed descriptions of the
murderers, their victims, and their crime sprees. The only real
complaint we have is the cavalier attitude with which the murderous
rampages of the selected killers are depicted. The descriptions of the
criminals and their crimes are graphic, and those with easily offended
sensibilities may want to steer clear. <A HREF="http://www.mayhem.net/Crime/">"http://www.mayhem.net/Crime/"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="SS5">THE JAVAED INFINITE UNKNOWN </A></B>
<P>
You're greeted with a beautiful blue image that brings to mind an
oceanic vortex. The image is framed with a border of hieroglyphic-like
characters. How to proceed? There's no text or help to guide you and the
peculiar electronic animal soundtrack that prompted a co-worker to ask
"Are there pelicans in here?" offers no help. With any luck you're using
a Java-enabled browser (or an older version of Netscape with a fast net
connection) to play this curious game. Click a glyph: the characters
rotate and flash; what does it mean? Solving the puzzle may mean access
to another mystery or may link you to a science fiction site. Warning:
If you play the Java version and get the bomb screen, it will crash
Netscape 2.0b4. How's that for high drama? <A HREF="http://www.zorg.com/">"http://www.zorg.com/"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="SS6">MIKE ROSOFF DOORS 96</A></B>
<P>
The Mike Rosoff Network is a reasonably good-humored poke at the
Microsoft Network. The site is nothing but satire, dripping with special
irony when addressing any aspect of Microsoft's monopoly-creation
tactics, such as refusing access to a document because the user's hard
drive has been examined and a determination has been made that the user
didn't really need to see that document anyway. The "Kitty Porn" and
"Sports and Drugs" sections are completely odd. All in all, this site is
a good break from the seriousness and sheer bloody-minded marketing that
is taking hold on the internet. All hail Mike Rosoff!
<A HREF="http://www.c3f.com/mikrosof.html">"http://www.c3f.com/mikrosof.html"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="SS7">OVI'S BELIEVE IT OR NOT!</A></B>
<P>
Anyone who has seen the Ripley's Believe It or Not television show, or
read any Ripley's books will be interested in a new Web entry: Ovi's
World of the Bizarre. This site contains a virtual library of tales that
deal with the more surreal aspects of everyday life, taken from news
services and publications throughout the world. Expect to find high
levels of oddness as you read the tales of the "Roach that would not
die" or the more gruesome "Man kills wife over argument about pasta",
which ends as the angry husband impales his wife's lungs and heart on a
stake in the garden. Gruesome, but at times entertaining.
<A HREF="http://netmar.com/users/ovigher/ovi.htm">"http://netmar.com/users/ovigher/ovi.htm"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="SS8">ROOT OF ADVENTURE</A></B>
<P>
Root is a Web site depicting the tale of the self-proclaimed "oldest,
snottiest artificial life form." This multimedia tour allows the viewer
to follow the exploits of Root, a robotic entity that has existed for
four millennia, as he finds his way to Seattle for the purpose of
finding the "Specialist", an engineer who will finally release him from
his robotic form and give him access to the next level of artificial
consciousness. The art found at this site is above par, with various
QuickTime movies and sound clips interspersed with the narrative of
Root's journey. Netsurfers should prepare themselves for a taste of the
surreal before clicking on this link.

<P>
<B><A NAME="SS9">HERE RESIDES THE TRUTH (DON'T BELIEVE IT)</A></B>
<P>
You might not have to love, but you ought to at least be intrigued by
someone with the moniker Dead Addict. Dead has authored Underground
Propaganda, a.k.a. the truth told in the guise of deception. "Oh, one of
those sites," you might think, and yes, you'd be right, except Mr./Ms.
Addict has filled the Underground with a good deal of entertaining
essays, thoughts, compelling nonsense, and "first drafts of deep
thoughts." The Computer Underground section is definitely worth the
visit for a spirited defense of software piracy, intriguing tales of
incompetent busts, and hacking humor and fashion. Underground Propaganda
is slick but carries an edge you could cut a diamond with. Dead's got a
lively page. <A HREF="http://www.l5.com/daddict/">"http://www.l5.com/daddict/"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="SS10">LET THE WEB FANTASY GAMES BEGIN</A></B>
<P>
Now you can manage world-class athletes in basketball, baseball,
football, hockey, and golf on the Web. It's fantasy, of course, but
cerebral: no arcade action here. Budding MBAs should check it out. Small
World Software has created an elaborate system of credit and exchange.
You can compare athletes with customizable graphs, much as brokers
compare stocks and mutual funds, then trade to advantage. These
market-based games of strategy take time to understand and master,
although they appear to be well designed. If you want to hone your
trading skills with play money, you might find a stock-market game more
likely to pay off in the long run, but if you want to trade for a hot
left-winger, this is a better bet.

<P>
<B><A NAME="SS11">THOSE INCREDIBLE REPLACEABLE SEA MONKEYS</A></B>
<P>
In this day of bizarre rites and rituals, it's rather soothing to
contemplate a sect who worship so simple an object as a sea monkey. The
Sea Monkey Worship Page invites the uninitiated to "begin a NEW amazing
hobby" by raising the "portable, active, disposable" sea monkey (the kit
includes a replacement guarantee for the post-disposal phase). Don't
miss the Sea Monkey Birth Announcements Page, Bad Poetry Page, and the
FAQ. Sample Question: "How should I feed my Sea Monkeys?" Answer: "The
official guide suggests that you only feed them once per week! They
aren't very big and you could kill them with all that food!" God forbid.

<P>
<B><A NAME="SS12">GOT A SECRET?</A></B>
<P>
If you're secretive when it comes to your personal secrets, skip this
site. The sponsors of the Secrets home page want to research such topics
as family and personal secrets and "illicit activities". Claiming that
your data will be handled "safely" and "will add to our overall
understanding of human behavior", they invite you to complete an online
form (anonymity is an option). Results will be reported in a book and
articles, with "certain responses" to be borrowed for dialogue in a
movie. Survey questions range from your present occupation to whether
you believe in God to the number of children that you've had born out of
wedlock. <A HREF="http://www.northcoast.com/~secrets/">"http://www.northcoast.com/~secrets/"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="SS13">FULL OF FELIX</A></B>
<P>
He's a wonderful, wonderful cat, and he has his own site. A history
(biography?) of Felix the Cat, as well as extensive filmographies of
both the 1950s television version of Felix and the current version are
included. There are also literary critiques of Felix related works,
posters from the early years, and links to other Felix fans. There's
more info here than Felix has lives.... Curious?

<B><A NAME="OT1">CELTS IN CYBERSPACE (CABERSPACE?)</A></B>
<P>
Knowing no boundaries, cyberspace can be home to the dispossessed, the
diaspora of the world. That's the ruling principle at the Great Irish
Story, where a virtual community of Irish culture is slowly developing.
Dagda, the good god, acts as interlocutor as you wander through his
tales of Ireland. Though there's a great deal of sweet reading in
Dagda's tales, the most entrancing pages belong to the voices of locals
from Roslea, county Fermanagh. The rhythm of the language and the
stories told will have you wishing for a Guinness, a peat fire, and a
mist in the air in no time. (Be sure not to miss Mick Cassidy, Bill
Clinton's closest Irish relative and Roslea resident, on his relation's
ascent to the presidency.) This is one of those rare spots that promises
to grow better and better with time as the Emerald Isle's people and her
lost children share their stories. <A HREF="http://www.nua.ie:80/dagda/">"http://www.nua.ie:80/dagda/"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="OT2">ON THE ROAD AGAIN</A></B>
<P>
A traveler takes to the American road along with his Powerbook. This Web
page spotlights Matt Krasner's circuitous journey, as he spends three
months relocating from Maryland to be with his girlfriend in Seattle. An
employee of PSINet, a nationwide Internet service provider, he stops at
their local offices along the way to post his notebook pages, pictures,
and voice and video clips in an attempt to give us "vicarious reality".
There is something nice about following the progress of a cross-country
trip, not unlike the pleasure of watching the soaps, but the
self-important overlay of this drive being a quest for the ultimate
meaning of truth makes the site just another Generation X rambling.
<A HREF="http://roadsigns.inter.net/roadsigns/">"http://roadsigns.inter.net/roadsigns/"</A>

<B><A NAME="OT3">FAST WIRE TO HONG KONG</A></B>
<P>
Seems that the day of traveling around the world in 80 clicks is
approaching ever faster. One of the latest stops for virtual
globetrotters is the Hong Kong Wonder Net, a site established by the
Hong Kong Tourist Association. It boasts all the now-standard features
of virtual touring spots: walking tours, decent maps, hotel and
restaurant guides, entertainment calendars and the like. It does manage
to distance itself from the rest of the pack with its Interactive Tour
Guide. Fill out a form with the amount of time you'll be in Hong Kong,
the month, and some general interests, and the guide bounces back with a
list of recommended activities. Now, if you could only _really_ get to
Hong Kong.... <A HREF="http://www.hkta.org/">"http://www.hkta.org/"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="OT4">BUMMED ABOUT BAD WEATHER? TRY THE ISRAELI MEDITERRANEAN</A></B>
<P>
When the weather outside is frightful, it's delightful to contemplate a
tour of the Mediterranean. The Mediterranean Travel & Tourism home page
features links to information about hotels, events, travel magazines,
shopping, and travel agents. Featured at the Israeli site is Jerusalem
3000, celebrating "Jerusalem's primacy among cities of the world for the
past 3,000 years." If shopping and vacation are synonymous for you,
check out the Jerusalem Mall, which includes 200 stores. There's also a
link to Holyland Magazine, billed as "Israel's international tourism
magazine," with topics ranging from archaeology and history to modern
Israeli life. <A HREF="http://www.jer1.co.il/tourism/travel/">"http://www.jer1.co.il/tourism/travel/"</A>

<B><A NAME="OT5">KEEP WARM WHILE VISITING ANTARCTICA</A></B>
<P>
You won't need your arctic gear to visit, but you may get a chill just
looking at the ice, in case there's not already enough where you are.
Over 40 pages about Antarctica with images, audio and video clips, and
lots of descriptive text. There are photos and facts about the
environment, wildlife, and the exploration of Antarctica along with
details about how you can have the actual adventure yourself. Great
browsing and very educational. <A HREF="http://www.terraquest.com/">"http://www.terraquest.com/"</A>

<B><A NAME="OT6">THERE'S MORE THAN JUST LANDMASS DOWN UNDER</A></B>
<P>
We hope it's easier to navigate Australia than Global Passage's Netstop
Web site. Mucho cool graphics, but what do they mean? Even with a key to
the icons (which was hard to find), it's still guess and click, then
wait for the new page to download. Suddenly you're at a full-page ad
with testimonials for used car sales (buying your own is de rigeur for
travelling the outback). Next you're at Surfworld, where everyone's a
surfer deep inside. Here's tips on avoiding robbery while travelling.
There's the homepage of the local radio station. Even the text-based
list is hard to figure. But persevere! There's tons of good stuff here
for both the prospective visitor and the merely curious. The travel
articles are witty and well written. The photos are lovely too.

around Melbourne and Victoria in Australia. Six or eight simply

<B><A NAME="BS1">TO BE, OR NOT TO BE: THAT'S THE MACOS QUESTION</A></B>
<P>
Be, Inc. is raising quite a buzz in Silicon Valley. Their BeBox (not named
after our esteemed publisher), a nifty machine with the multimedia
capabilities of the Mac and the flexibility of Unix, is generating serious
feelings of hardware lust among the Valley hacker crowd. Be made headlines
by dancing the acquisition minuet with Apple, which is seeking a boost for
the aging MacOS. More recently, Be struck a deal with Apple clone maker
Power Computing to ship the BeOS operating system on PowerMac clones. Now
comes word that they are working on porting Linux to their hot BeBox. The
Be site has many screen shots and a listing of where their roadshow will be
doing demonstrations. Could Be be the Apple computer of tomorrow? You may
want to put some money on that. Take a look and judge for yourself.

audio over the Net. Perhaps the most interesting aspect of this

broadcast standard, which Netscape and Progressive Networks (RealAudio)
jointly developed. Beta copies are available for download, as is a fairly
succinct FAQ document. Announcement:

WorldChat is a new network of chat servers built specifically on
Microsoft's Conference Server and ActiveX technology. This barely
international network of chat servers provides audio-based conferencing,
whiteboard utilities, and a member search service. They are currently
running 10 servers, nine in the US and one in Denmark. Chatters can hook up
using either standard IRC software or proprietary clients like Microsoft's
MIChat. The site is heavily Microsoft centric; you won't even see their
home page without a browser that supports ActiveX, Microsoft's competition
for Java. If you want to know how Microsoft stacks up in the server wars,
give them a look. <A HREF="http://www.worldchat.org/">"http://www.worldchat.org/"</A>

There may be no free lunch, but these days there's free e-mail. In this
case, you get your freebie if you can endure some advertising. You read
your free e-mail anywhere via the Web, or have it forwarded to the POP
mailbox of your choice. Filtering rules can be applied to store, forward,
or delete your mail. They even have a feature which will collect your
e-mail from several ISPs and forward it to you. Sounds pretty useful, and
as the site says, "Hey, what do you have to lose? After all, it's free!"

<B><A NAME="BS6">HP UNVEILS NEW CRYPTO CONTROL FRAMEWORK</A></B>
<P>
Hewlett-Packard announced a new framework technology designed to let
governments enable and disable strong cryptography products. The framework
is independent of the method used in a given product. The heart of the
system is a small, tamper-resistant module with the cryptographic
algorithms that remain dormant until activated. A policy activation token
(basically some key bits) can be used to choose between the various crypto
algorithms stored on the module. The HP press release makes this sound like
the greatest thing since public key encryption, but in reality it appears
to be just another attempt to insert government control into private data
exchanges. Look for legislative attempts to make this technology mandatory
on all encryption products. Technology details are at the site.

<P>
Sanford Wallace of CyberPromotions is nothing if not tenacious. Threatened
by court orders and large provider shutouts with losing access to millions
of potential spamees, Sanford has turned to that tried and true Internet
censorship remedy, the distributed spam network. Shortly before he lost his
Sprint Net access, he reportedly hired 10 sites which will allow him to
hook up a PC to their networks in return for about $1000 per month. This
will allow him to spam from multiple IP addresses, making it harder for
targets to filter out the offending sites. Will it work? Probably, for a
time. It's a classic evolutionary race (see the Red Queen hypothesis)
between the spammers and the blockers, and bears watching as proof (or
disproof) of the famous aphorism that the Net routes around censorship.

too. Journalists and critics writing for major dailies and specialist

a combination gallery, newswire, and e-zine on the London graffiti scene,
with scads of photographs of legally and illegally paint-bombed trains and
walls. In addition to the visual, the site features information on the
various London crews, short histories of favorite graffiti sights, and
latest news from the local graff community. An interview with local bomber
Ser sets the rhythm and rhyme of an artful subculture where the objets

Now this is odd. You'd figure from the title, Entropy Gradient Reversals

Internet, society, and Internet society, yet it's still hilarious. It's
light, but serious. It quotes Alexis de Tocqueville and Samuel Johnson, yet
literally shouts "holy shit!" at you - repeatedly, if you hit your back

One of the classiest cultural magazines on the Web right now is the
Smithsonian's Increase and Diffusion, a masterpiece that, like the museum
itself, celebrates the richness and complexity of contemporary life with an
appealing blend of scholarship and journalism. The first issue offers
multipage, conservatively and beautifully illustrated stories, such as one
about an archaeologist who works underwater in Hawaii to clarify "one of
the most bizarre and fascinating stories in American history." Other
features include an in-depth look at the American wine industry, poetry and
the workplace, a profile of solo theater artist Brenda Wong Aoki, a
multipart audio interview with ex-Los Angeles Laker star James Worthy, and
a background piece on a luncheonette pivotal in the American civil rights
movement. Let's hope the Smithsonian continues to fund this site. What a
premiere! <A HREF="http://www.si.edu/i+d/">"http://www.si.edu/i+d/"</A>

<B><A NAME="BEZ4">AMERICAN HISTORY, ABRIDGED</A></B>
<P>
For democracy to work, you need a sense of connectedness, and it helps to
know a little history. William M. Brinton has compressed 6,000 years of
American and pre-American history (most of it the past 200 years) into a
rich synopsis on the Web. To visit "An Abridged History of the United
States" is to return to history and civics classes in high school, with a
legal bent, without the pressure of quizzes. The target audience here
consists of teachers and other educators, but this should be required
reading for many students, too. Brinton's prose is leisurely,
authoritative, and expansive. You can read it online - with or without
frames - or download the entire textbook as a zipped or StuffIt archive.

Waaaay back, in NSD 1.20, we introduced two sites devoted to the

editor, Ed Zotti, wrote to say that "The Straight Dope" hadn't given up the
ghost on the Web, it just moved. It's now a snazzy,
authorized-but-not-official site that's easy on the eyes and the download

intelligent agents, Java and JavaScript, audio, plug-ins, HTML 3.2, and
other nuts and bolts, along with the latest on trends in browsers and the
Web. Need more? There are news items and columns, book reviews, FAQs, and
technical information, too. A lot of the material pertains to Internet
Explorer and other browsers as well as to the browser king. The time to
frequent this site is now, while Netscape still rates at the top of most
Web surveys. You can bet a lot of Microsoft employees check this out.

Two Irish developers use their wry senses of humor to select Web pages and
snippets of e-mail and Usenet postings for this eclectic cybersampler. You
might get a Monty Python script, an extraterrestrial view from a NASA
probe, a look at the "Disturbing product of the month" (gourmet pet water,
for example), a "wacky, wrongful or weird ad", sound bites from
blockbusters and TV shows, audiovisual birthday cards, or e-mail humor. A
funny e-mail section called "Words Not Yet in the Dictionary" should be
highlighted and expanded rather than buried near the bottom of a page.

Mars won't stay out of the news it seems. Months after a NASA research team
announced evidence for past life on Mars, a British team has come forward
with supporting evidence and the claim that they actually had the story
seven years earlier. Meantime, the Russian Space Agency recently flung the
Mars 96 spacecraft toward the Red Planet, but fell a bit short - into the
Pacific, to be exact. Exciting stuff, maybe, but both pale before the
delightfully demented mind of Tim Burton and his retro-sci-fi flick "Mars
Attacks." Skip the snaps of itty-bitty Martian microbes and check out the
brain cases on these guys (beware the 7 MB QuickTime clip). Mars life, UK

Thanks to National Academy Press (NAP), you can access more than 1,000
health, science, and technology books for free. This site seems designed
mostly for researchers and others with professional interests, but
consumers are welcome and will quickly find much of topical interest,
including Auditorium Chat. NAP has collected digitized books in more than
26 categories in the Reading Room. Much of the dry prose comes from
government agencies, but tax dollars have at least made it plentiful,
far-reaching, and authoritative. Fresh Paint is a "What's New" with a
calendar, reviews, and discussions of hot topics in science. If you want
hard copy, go to Bookstore. (You don't really want to click through 300

<P>
An explosion and metal shards tore through the body of 12-year-old Yovav
Levy, killing him, because some men decided peace was a threat. Certain
Israelis and Palestinians have made painfully obvious in recent months and
days their intention to blow peace and democracy - along with the lives of
children and innocents - right out of the Middle East. This page provides
lists of victims of recent Israeli bombings, a form for sending your
remarks or condolences, and other info. <A HREF="http://shani.net/terror/">"http://shani.net/terror/"</A>

<B><A NAME="BS2">NETSCAPE 2.0 JAVA SECURITY HOLE AND FIX</A></B>
<P>
The culprit is the Java Applet Security Manager, a small section of
software that ensures a Java applet can only contact the host from which it
is downloaded. The Security Manager figures out which computer it came
from by querying the Domain Name System (DNS), and DNS spoofing by
hackers could result in access to computers behind a firewall. Netscape
has a fix available for downloading, with more technical information. It
appears that Sun's JDK development kit is also affected. Further info is
available from CERT.
Netscape Fix: <A HREF="http://home.netscape.com/newsref/std/java_security.html">"http://home.netscape.com/newsref/std/java_security.html"</A>

<B><A NAME="BS3">NETSCAPE JAVA SCRIPT SECURITY HOLE AND NO FIX (YET)</A></B>
<P>
The language, JavaScript - not the same as Sun's Java language - allows Web
servers to 1) secretly record file names (only) from a websurfer's hard
drive, and 2) secretly induce a websurfer's computer to send e-mail to a
third party. Netscape announced they will introduce version 2.01, which
will eliminate these bugs and allow users to turn off JavaScript, next
week. The following two pages have more information on these and other
possible security problems with JavaScript.

NT Netscape server, Website, and Microsoft Internet Information Server are
vulnerable. It's possible for hackers to execute arbitrary DOS commands on
these servers because they can pass commands unchecked to the DOS command
interpreter. Patches are available for the Microsoft server, but the others
remain vulnerable. More technical details are available at these sites.

<B><A NAME="BS5">FREE WORLD DIALUP MEANS FREE LONG DISTANCE PHONE SERVICE</A></B>
<P>
The basic idea is simple. Patch Internet phone services to regular phone
lines, allowing anyone with access to a phone free international phone
calls. Next, find a horde of volunteers who are willing to set up a PC and
a phone line in every city. Give them the software and some training, and
all of a sudden you have a free international phone network. That's just
what the well organized Free World Dialup team is doing. They've launched
their project and are looking for volunteers to help grow the
non-commercial network. No reaction so far from the telcos but then, they
have the reflexes of clay. <A HREF="http://www.pulver.com/fwd/">"http://www.pulver.com/fwd/"</A>

We often think we, as humans, have mastered certain aspects of achievement,
notable examples being writing, computer programming, junk food, and last

every day with a short bio of the painter, and an image of artist at work.
Consider this article stained with e-tears of laughter. One exhibit showed
Gumbie, an ex-cat, whose works have tripled in price to $5000 since his
untimely death. It showed Gumbie at work completing "Aviary Arsonist" at
home in Toronto. This is too stupid for words. Human stupidity and

For once, a site where "under construction" means just that. Marc
Hernandez's small program, RndPic, uses a genetic algorithm to generate
striking graphic images reminiscent of yet quite different than fractals.
The v0.5 DOS beta release of the generator is here though it is either
broken or simply crawls on a Pentium/120. What better idea then to create a
home page for the program! You're best advised to just admire the
collection of largish pre-generated sample images. Admit it, wouldn't you
love to know how RndPic graphs this
equation:
abs((-abs(var[1])^((-97/-((var[0]^(abs(68)^var[1]))/var[0]))-abs(-var[0]))))
?

This surpisingly rich site salutes the art and craft of small cinema -
small as in 8 mm, personal cinema. Crisply designed (you are using
Netscape, aren't you?) and adorned with photos and graphics of old movie
equipment, the pages offer discourses on editing, splicing, and processing
techniques. Historical selections offer small treatises on topics such as
movieolas and Super 8. There is also an excellent collection of motion
picture laboratories organized by region and presented in a tabular form
annotated with personal comments. Links to other film sites round out the
offerings. Don't go directly to "INFO" or you'll miss the main but
curiously unobvious navigational image map at the top of the first page.

Short on explanation but long on visual excitement, Hitachi's "Viewseum" is
an extensive showcase for its Digital Image System (DIS). DIS is a
computerized process for digitizing and restoring images. Examples abound
with selections from prominent art museums along with photos in categories
such as Flowers, Skydiving, and Sea Life. The clarity and intensity of
these graphics is stunning, particularly in light of the small file sizes.
Not really sure? Compare a few of the "before" and "after DIS" shots to
assuage your disbelief. You'll enjoy wandering here because the pages
naturally guide you on your journey. The only lingering question: how
quickly can we see images of this quality elsewhere on the Net?

Tasmanian photographer Tony Ryan's home page offers a sampling of erotic
art. These are beautiful, downloadable examples of the photographer's skill
and sensitivity. A fuller catalogue can be gleaned through the various
connections made available. He also offers a limited edition volume of his
prints via subscription. His commentaries on Net censorship and his
philosophy of photography are worthwhile reading.

Hitch, the e-zine of the above, features a range of weirded out stuff which
is brilliant if you're into satire, sarcasm, and the odd fruitcake site.
David Hasselhoff's Baywatch Diary, the all-consuming Mentos Site, various
articles such as "Your Rectum, Your Friend" and "Lustful Livestock" - it's
got it all. Even an analysis of the self-satisfying board game,
Beat-O-Matic, definitely worth a look. Good attitude and great content -
too bad it seems to be orphaned.

Le Coq Sportif is a Web-zine bringing the world of hockey to the Net. This
fast-growing, slick e-zine hosts a wealth of information on current
standings, team composition and statistics, as well as daily updates of
television broadcast schedules. This is a very impressive e-zine, with a
professional look and feel that will present hockey fans with a no-nonsense
avenue to the statistics, both on an individual and team basis, and the box
scores that they so desperately crave. Of particular interest is the
Stanley Cup Odds page, which lists the current chances of the Ottawa
Senators taking the Stanley Cup at 9328732-1. Whoohooo! Go, Senators!

Comet watchers both professional and amateur are nearly frothing at the

Net, where basic info along with the latest photographs are available at
several sites including Sky &amp; Telescope magazine, the Comet Observation
Home Page, and the Comet C/1996 B2 Hyakutake home page. Hyakutake will
blast by Earth the evening of March 25, when NASA is organizing the Night
of the Comet, a "virtual star party". Digital images snapped through
telescopes all over the world will be posted throughout the night, allowing
those with cloudy skies at home to follow the comet over the Net.

using Netscape 2.0 frames, you're presented with a (V-chip warning:

blood spatter closeups with explanations. Use your growing analytical

Siberia, Mongolia, and other areas of the ex-Soviet Union are the stomping
grounds of researchers of the onion-domed Russian Paleontological Institute
(RPI), the largest institution of its kind. The Institute lacks a wire to
the Web, but it has loaned some virtual exhibits to UC-Berkeley's Museum of
Paleontology, which has established a stateside Web site for the Institute.
Photos of exhibits at RPI carry explanatory text, and are linked to the
Berkeley museum's own pages. Unfortunately, the photos are fairly washed
out, though they do make one look forward to the day when the Moscow museum
will be online. <A HREF="http://ucmp1.berkeley.edu/pin.html">"http://ucmp1.berkeley.edu/pin.html"</A>

<B><A NAME="SS2">STEREOSCOPIC PHOTOS - 19TH CENTURY VIRTUAL REALITY</A></B>
<P>
Stereoscopic photographs are paired photographs that recreate the sensation
of three dimensions when viewed through a stereoscope, and Patch American
High School in Stuttgart has a page devoted to them. The lion's share of
the images depict turn of the century Yosemite. Others depict scenes from
World War I, the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, and more period sites.
Unless you have a stereoscope, or you're extremely talented at crossing
your eyes, you'll have trouble experiencing the 3-d effect, but the old
sepia photos are still fun in plain old 2-d.

Now here is a classic example of a true Renaissance man. Leonardo da Vinci

exhibit.
Organized somewhat like a museum, the Leonardo da Vinci Page features
everything from Leo's famous paintings (the Mona Lisa, the Last Supper,
etc.) to drawings of his engineering and scientific visions. There's even a

Mark Twain lovers will delight at this site, for just about everything they
could want is here. The page was designed by a doctoral student studying
the Anti-Imperialist League, for which Clemens served as vice president for
nine years. Twain's work, from "The Adventures of Tom Sawyer" to lesser
known essays, can be browsed along with discussions of his presence in
contemporary culture: appearances on "Star Trek: The Next Generation" and
in movies; banning of his books; and his literary influence. Obviously,
much information concerning Clemen's involvement in the League is provided,
but it adds to rather than detracts from the site.

The Virtual Memorial Garden presents obituary notices on a soothing green
background, notices more detailed and more permanent than newspaper obits,
and so much more personal. It is fascinating to read these personal notes
and often touching as well, though it can be depressing to read the
memorials of children. The Garden is a subdued but superb site, and worth
checking out to place an obituary or to simply visit. Originally an
offshoot of the Obituary Page, marking the passing of celebrities of
greater and lesser reknown, this page far surpasses its parent, which also
contains links to related sites elsewhere.

and attacks them for disagreeing with each other after the first hundred
thousand digits or so. Some people have waaay too much time on their hands.
Seven options are provided for voting purposes; our choice is that simple
yet elegant number: 3. Be warned that the author declares that the voting
will end only "when I say it ends." <A HREF="http://www.diku.dk/~terra/pi.html">"http://www.diku.dk/~terra/pi.html"</A>

information superhighway? "Birding on the Web," a site dedicated to the
strategic surveillance of our feathered friends. Although we're not experts
in this particular field, "Birding on the Web" appears to be a fairly

The fun things at Rodney's server are his bio, the Joke of the Day (which,
unlike children, should be heard and not seen), video clips, and the letter
of membership denial from Roddy McDowall, chairman of the Academy of Motion
Picture Arts and Sciences. The rest seems self-indulgent, and includes
reviews, interviews, LOTS of links to his new wife's commercial Web site,
and a contest called the "I Don't Get No Respect Contest", which should be
called the "Write Rodney's Material without Being Paid Contest". There's
also some stuff on sale. <A HREF="http://www.rodney.com/rodney/index.html">"http://www.rodney.com/rodney/index.html"</A>

<P>
"Your Wacky World Wide Web Adventure" suffers from many of the ailments so
common to Web pages around the world. Playing the part of an average
citizen who has just woken, you have a list of options describing what you
do when you leave your house. Anyone can submit new options, and here the
page breaks down. There are so many choices, the story loses its flow. Most
entries attempt humor and a few are uproariously successful, but others are
just dumb and/or obscene. With some judicious editing and discretion, this
site would be a winner, but right now - while there are some good bits -
it's just too cluttered with banality.

O.K., so they're not frogs. But they're close, no? The Audio Arts Page has
a .au file of late-night toad amour in a Las Cruces, N.M., pond following a
torrential downpour. There are some other sounds, too, but they are not
nearly as interesting or ranid. Kids might enjoy the Build-a-Monster toy,
also here. It's a Web variation of those books with panels that allow you
to create unique animals out of a selection of torsos, heads, and
locomotory apparati. <A HREF="http://www.rahul.net/renoir">"http://www.rahul.net/renoir"</A>

If you've never heard of Saba, you're certainly not alone. But this
Caribbean island 28 miles south of St. Maarten is sure to be all the rage
once the scuba divers and snorkelers of the world catch on. So you'd better
get on it, before this destination becomes as popular as Cozumel. Learn all
about the island, vacation facilities, and scuba diving opportunities. From
this site, you can catch the Caribbean Connection, another informative and
tropical treat. Don't forget your sunscreen.

includes some 260 KB of text with 120 color pictures, but don't let its
size scare you away as the pages seem well organized, with a table of
contents organized by month and by country visited. The photos are
intelligently presented, with small GIFs
pointing to larger JPEGs of the full images. Russell has set up a great
site to visit, for a few minutes or a few hours.

locations of habitual speed traps in each state. The page will not accept
submissions of drunk driving checkpoints or speed traps that protect road

to increase revenue are targeted. You might also want to check out the link
to Vagabond Jim's Cop Car Registry to learn which headlight style to look
out for in your rear-view mirror.

So we've got Netscape 1.1N all loaded up and ready to go and we decide to
experiment. So we type in a Web URL without using the <A HREF="http://">"http://"</A> prefix, for
example: "www.netsurf.com/nsd/index". Lo and behold, it works! It also
seems to work with <A HREF="ftp://">"ftp://"</A> and other prefixes, too. Now, our questions to
all you unwashed, washed, and somewhere-in-between masses out there is:
What other browsers does this work on? How long has this been possible? Is
this bound to become - or has it already become - some unstoppable
revolution? Let us know. mailto:<A HREF="mailto:editor@netsurf.com">editor@netsurf.com</A>

Right on the heels of being listed in April PC Magazine as one of the "100
Hot Sites" on the Web, we find our humble e-zine mentioned right in the
middle of the May edition of Playboy. You'll find our shameless four-line
spread on page 17, left column. It's part of a small blurb on "clever sites
with links to the Web's more interesting Home Pages". Little did we dream
when we started this thing that we'd find ourselves in the company of
post-feminist bad girl Camille Paglia, pre-feminist boot girl Nancy
Sinatra, and post-airbrush playmate Cynthia Gwyn Brown (34C-23-34; from
neighboring San Jose, no less). We bought a few issues - strictly for the
articles, of course. Anyway, our thanks to both publications for
recognizing our modest efforts.

The home page is cryptic, but the idea is quite good. The folks at the

That's just the start of it though. Chances are, to solve the puzzles
you'll need additional info, found playing trivia and finding secret
keywords hidden on other Web pages. Two other variations offer the
possibility of winning more cash. Unclaimed prizes roll over to the next
contest. There's no cost to register (which you must do to prove you're
over 18) since they're sponsor-supported, presumably by all those pages you
visit. If the sites are cool, this could be quite good. Click on "Sign Up"

This Vincent character (Vincent? Now really...) gets sucked into the
computer one day in an old chestnut of a premise that goes all the way back
to the movie "Tron", popular when we were mere tots. But the corny premise
here leads to an absolutely first-class implementation of an old-fashioned
Web scavenger hunt on behalf of none other than the recently hip IBM. The
objective is to find Vincent on some Web pages and ultimately win an IBM
ThinkPad 755 computer. There are rewards for being first to decipher clues
along the way. Start at the URL below
and follow the story to get at the rules. First clues will be available
April 17 and the game begins May 17. This one is definitely worth a visit.

Acrobat is the slow-to-take-off  portable, device-independent document
display software from Adobe. It seems that Adobe and Netscape have struck a
deal whereby Acrobat will be integrated with the Netscape browser.
Naturally, all this is driven by the control freak content publishers out
there who want to enslave your brain with their layout. But then, Netsurfer
could have weird fonts in every other word, and garish graphics, and those
neat neon backgrounds.... Maybe not. Here are some web sites with cool PDF:

Our colleague in the publishing biz, Brad Templeton, started this
interesting thread in <A HREF="news:news.admin.misc">news.admin.misc</A> and <A HREF="news:news.admin.policy">news.admin.policy</A> with
the premise that the alt.* newsgroups were more popular then the "Big
Seven": news.*, comp.*, sci.*, rec.*, soc.*, misc.*, and talk.*. Brad's
thesis is that the popularity of the alt.* hierarchy proves the failure of
the more regulated Big Seven hierarchy. He cites noise, Net-police, and the
hassle of newsgroup creation as some of the reasons why more and more
people are gravitating to the alt.* groups. Read the arbitron ratings,
interesting in their own right, as background to this discussion:

The Jewish holiday of Passover begins at sundown April 14, as the Matzah
Market undoubtedly realizes. It has dozens of Passover recipes and links to
rec.food.recipes Passover archives. Most recipes fall into the categories
of dessert and side dishes, but you can find instructions for matzah balls,
too - yum yum! More Passover recipes and discussions of customs are popping
up as you read this in <A HREF="news:soc.culture.jewish.">soc.culture.jewish.</A> For the curious, farfel is
matzah roughly broken into pieces about a half-inch on a side.

Some of us never got past dissecting frogs. That was enough. But for those

If all the world's a stage, and you're a writer, this might just be the
place for you. The World Wide Stage is a non-commercial global platform for
authors, poets, and artists of any work that can be presented via the WWW.
You'll find long and short fiction, poetry, lyrics, and other writings. New
contributions are always being sought. <A HREF="http://www.iol.ie/~westrock/">"http://www.iol.ie/~westrock/"</A>

some rare movie that just isn't at the local Blockbuster. They promise to
verify electronic orders by e-mail within 24 hours.

<P>
A cartoon a day to keep the psychiatrists away - or at least to keep them
smiling. Gabe Martin draws and presents some really funny cartoons called
"The Borderline". He does a new one each day, and the site keeps an archive
of his previous work. While looking for "The Borderline" we happened to
stumble into another cool home page at the same provider. Located in San
Diego, Calif., it is loaded with features, the most intriguing of which is
an almost live view of San Diego Bay. It's called Baycam; check it out once
you're in the neighborhood.

<P>
William Calvin is a theoretical neurophysiologist by trade, so what - you
undoubtedly ask - is he doing in the Books & E-Zines section? Well, he's
also a writer. Calvin's more noted sphere, non-fiction about the grander
schemes of brains and evolution, is well represented at his home page by
the full texts of his books such as "The Ascent of Mind" and "The Throwing
Madonna". His offering of fiction consists of two novels dealing with life
on the Net. Calvin's home page is large, but has a homey feel; it seems as
if he were inviting you into his living room for a chat. It is an example
of superb content and context, as would be expected from a Net veteran of
his magnitude. <A HREF="http://weber.u.washington.edu/wcalvin/index.html">"http://weber.u.washington.edu/wcalvin/index.html"</A>

<P>
WebRunner, an all-text monthly Web zine that put out its first issue in
March, was established by a co-op bored with the stale rhetoric of
newspaper op-ed pages. George Will, Charles Krauthammer, et al leave the
WebRunners wanting, while Usenet excites them with what they call the New
Essay - personal, provocative, to the point, and open to response.
WebRunner provides a Web forum for New Essayists. A couple of the first
issue's articles work, but others would benefit from carriage returns and a
less verbose style. One neat feature is links to the original sources, like
legislation, on which the authors comment.

The site is part of a new section for GNN called "Book Story" designed to
serialize interesting books on the Net. The book that kicks off the section
is by John Brockman and deals with the premise that scientists, not the
literary intellectuals, have the most to say about the future of humanity.
All the trendy topics are covered: evolutionary science, artificial
intelligence, cosmological origins, and information technology. The first
chapter has been posted and subsequent chapters will be available in the
coming weeks. The site also features an interview with the author as well
as an interactive forum where

There's a great list of Chinese e-zines out on the Web. These aren't mags
about China, not even mags about the Chinese, but are e-zines written and
viewed in Chinese characters. Then again, all three probably apply since
the articles aren't really likely to focus on Iceland, are they? E-zines
are listed by site and by WWW, FTP, and Gopher versions. Two pages offer
the list - one normal and one using HTML3's table feature, which makes
things more orderly if your browser is so capable. In case you need help, a
linked page provides info about and demos of Chinese character systems and
external viewers.

photocopies of declassified documents, an index with a neat search tool,
and a FAQ file. One of the FAQs somehow is not "How do I know if I was
zapped?" You're supposed to call something called the Helpline to find out
but the number isn't given - a serious flaw. Other FAQ answers can be
summed up as "We dunno." Ah, government. On the lighter side, there are

The DERWeb Project (Dental Education Resources on the Web) is an online

for its gross-out value. If you're particularly interested in, say,
pathology due to scurvy, DERWeb even provides a searchable image contents

honey bees (their sensible advice: RUN!). The site offers scads of images,
sound files, and movies (Insect Theater On-Line) of many varieties of
insect found in Arizona's Sonoran Desert. Our only complaint is the welcome

This Kansas site is yet another Web destination bringing outer space to

though you can hop there and to other astronomy sites via links. Helpful
text files explain some of the images, but if you're still perplexed after
reading them, you can always ask one of the astronomers for help. The
observatory has other info which might be worth viewing if you plan to
visit or are a grade-school teacher looking for astronomy teaching aids.

The Netscape juggernaut rolls on. Users now have access to groupware
features like Internet telephony, a "whiteboard" that enables users to view
and edit graphic images in real-time, an integrated VRML viewer, and
built-in audio and video viewers (fewer separate plug-ins for this).
Developers get something called LiveConnect, which lets them script and
link all sorts of live content (Java, plug-ins), more Java features, and
(surprise, surprise) new HTML tags. Administrators get a set of tools to
help configure Netscape across networks. The built-in View Source is
pretty, too. Take a look at the press release for more details. Download:

MapQuest is one of the coolest applications to hit the Web. Surprisingly,
it is also one of the most useful. Pick a place - any place. Well, make it
an American place. Type the address into MapQuest and it returns a complete
graphical full-color map that marks your requested location. Use the
buttons to zoom in or out through levels of magnification from national to
a local street map. If you're traveling afar, you can even get driving
directions. For extra pleasure, check out the mega-cool Java and ActiveX
versions of the Atlas. This is a free service but registering lets you save

in information. The hottest thing about this page is the Auto-Pilot, which
lets you get blip-verts of any of the 900+ articles. We shot through an
in-depth analysis of the voguing phenomenum, the V-chip, and biocular

A cross between celebrity worship and a venue for counter-cultural
information, Tim Leary's home page is literally a photographic tour of his
home. Travel into different rooms for glimpses of the art gallery, photo
archives, and library (featuring an HTML version of "The Psychedelic
Experience"). Much of the site is incomplete but the established framework
is clever and surprisingly slick for a site of this nature. Tim, as many
are aware, is slowly dying of cancer. You'll find health updates here along
with precise counts of his pharmaceutical (legal and illegal) intake.
Search deeper for the Leary Biscuit recipe (Ritz crackers, brie,
marijuana...). Sort of a Nixon Library for the rest of us, this site may be

digits. Pity there's no privacy anymore.... By the way, investors may find
the too-brief "Historical Analysis" listing useful. All this site needs,

Pfaff keeps a running journal of his Denny's visits with the pertinant info
available such as what they ate, who accompanied them, and - most
importantly - what free stuff they got or stole and whether or not there

Most Hollywood studios have flashy presences on the Net. To keep up with
their new releases, you'd have to spend a lot of time surfing. Here's an
alternative that centralizes links to movie trailers all over the Web. It
ain't fancy but it's complete, with lists organized by studio. There are
also sections for foreign film studios, TV shows, and music videos. Even
before trailers become available, check out the upcoming movie list for
films in production or even pre-production stages. The "Hot Trailer Pick
Awards" highlights selected film sites of the week. You may be begging for
a cable modem after downloading some of the 6 MB whoppers. Curiosity has
its costs. <A HREF="http://lyre.mit.edu/~deering/tpark.html">"http://lyre.mit.edu/~deering/tpark.html"</A>

You probably already know about this movielicious site, but to compete with
commercial databases, the Internet Movie Database (IMDb), maintained by 18
people around the world, has established itself as a company - that is,
gone pro. Thank goodness its Web services will remain free, because the
database lists over 70,000 movies, including classics and current releases,
Hollywood and other films, along with biographies and background. If you
like, IMDb will notify you by e-mail of updates to this massive and
ever-growing resource. Every film student should link to it. US:

<P>
Yearning for something other than the weekend yacht? US Submarines (USS)
offers several models of personal luxury submarines. The prices for such
goodies are steep, and even USS admits that the personal submarine concept
may seem a tad silly to the unenlightened. So, in addition to illustrations
and descriptions of the models, USS will also let you have $50,000 if you
happen to know anyone who can and eventually does purchase one of their
luxury subs. Start checking that address file. Credit USS for an
entertaining site and an idea that might shake a few cobwebs out of your
brain. After all, as the company says about its 188-foot, five-stateroom
Seattle 1000, "After one dive in Seattle, a simple megayacht will never
again suffice." That goes without saying. <A HREF="http://www.cnw.com/~ussubs/">"http://www.cnw.com/~ussubs/"</A>

Are you a stranger in the brave new wired world? Eager to graduate from
newbie status and subject yourself to flames, spams, and fingers? If you
answered at least one yes and/or you don't have a clue as to what newbie,
flame, spam, or finger means, here's the perfect site for you. "Learn the
Net: the Essential Internet Online" guides you through Camp Internet.
You'll explore the mysteries of getting connected, memorize proper
netiquette, check out e-mail and newsgroups, and even learn how to create
your own home page. Yes, that is Larry Magid waving his little cyberhand.

<P>
Yahoo's site for 8 to 14-year-olds lives up to its devilishly clever name,
delivering links kids should find intriguing. Factor in Yahooligans'
rejection of sites that are "sleazy, slimy, snarly, paranoid, hateful,
hideous, harmful, pornographic or prejudiced" (there goes, what, a quarter
of the Web?) and you end up with a safe haven for junior surfers.
Otherwise, Yahooligans follows the lead of its older sibling, with new
sites, cool sites, and random sites just a click away, along with a helpful
breakdown of categories (check out Homework Answers in the School Bell
category). Club Yahooligans offers e-mail notices of cool sites, special
offers, and other nebulous coolness for anyone willing to fill out a form
apparently devised by someone from marketing. <A HREF="http://www.yahooligans.com/">"http://www.yahooligans.com/"</A>

<P>
Such is the name of a page we're glad we came upon. This Bavarian bounty
looks good and is bursting with high-quality content. Munich Found, the
cybercompanion to a paper edition, isn't just an online tourist pamphlet,
but is an intelligent look at the town and issues of import in Germany.
Articles in the April issue looked at the establishment of an urban car ban
to create a pedestrian zone, lingering effects of the Holocaust, and dating
in Germany. The latter warns that you could find yourself with "the well
mannered work horse who schedules spontanaeity in his Filofax." News
articles, a "what's on" list, and classifieds are typical for this kind of
page, but atypically interesting in style and perception.

Out West Online is the latest homespun spin on Out West Newspaper, the

western America's roads in a 24-foot motorhome/newsroom. This ongoing
quarterly travelogue of 100% bona fide American corn ranges across the
story of Hi Jolly and the US Camel Military Corps, to a garlic-loving ghost
in Bodie, Calif., and onto e-mail roadfood testimonials (including a hot
tip about the biscuits 'n' gravy at a diner in Dayton, Nev.), all peppered
with some genuinely useful info on various sites and activities west of the
Rockies. Check out the rocky mountain oyster "Testicle Festival" in Rock

Yet another ever-vigilant video camera is wired into the Web. This time,
instead of being in the bottom of a fish tank, it's at the bottom of the

a whole lot these days, leading to crisp pictures of, well, not much. There
is a link to the midday picture, but truth be told, there's not that much
to see. For diversions the jaded or unadventurous might want to check
Mawson's weather and gloat that you're here and not there, and those in

    MECKLERMEDIA PLANS MECKLERWEB, AN ONLINE MARKETING SYSTEM
    <P>
    The publisher of Internet World magazine, Mecklermedia Corp., hopes
    that MecklerWeb will appeal to businesses who want a presence in the
    online marketplace. The online content will be divided by topic, and
    each domain, such as arts, technology, finance, medicine, law, and
    education, will be "hosted" by an organization that does not compete
    with the domain's corporate sponsors. To prepare this system
    MecklerWeb Corporation entered into agreements with Alternet, Digital
    Equipment Corporation, EIT, WAIS, Inc.,  Dun & Bradstreet, Edelman,
    Public Relations Worldwide, EDS, and Ogilvy & Mather Direct.  Visit

    VRML MAILING LIST TACKLES NEED FOR INTERNET VIRTUAL-REALITY STANDARD
    <P>
    Wired magazine is sponsoring an explosively-growing mailing list and
    corresponding HTTP server related to the development of a standard for
    the visual description and navigation of the Internet.  Tentatively
    named VRML, or "Virtual Reality Markup Language," the standard is
    expected to draw together elements of HTML and currently-extant low-
    bandwidth VR projects. The HTTP site is at "<A HREF="http://www.wired.com/vrml/">http://www.wired.com/vrml/</A>"
    and you can subscribe to the mailing list by sending mail to
    "majordomo@wired.com" with "subscribe www-vrml" in the message body.
    
<P>
    ARTIFICIAL "LIFEFORMS" ON THE INTERNET
    <P>
    Thomas Ray, a pioneer in artificial life research, is taking his
    experiments with self replicating and evolving code to the richly
    interconnected and massively parallel topology of the Internet. Ray
    will seek volunteer sites to run special virtual computer simulators
    among which his code can subsist, communicate, and evolve. Unlike
    viruses and worms his code can only subsist in the virtual computer

    TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROGRAM GETS MORE THAN 1,000 FUNDING REQUESTS
    <P>
    The Telecommunications and Information Infrastructure Assistance
    Program (TIIAP) has received more than 1,000 applications for funding
    in 1994's fiscal year. Although it is unlikely that all deserving
    projects will receive grants, according to assistant secretary of
    Commerce for Communications and Information Larry Irving, "we hope to
    work with Congress to grow this program and keep up with the demand."
    Approximately $24 million is available for this year from the program,
    which provides up to a 50 percent federal match. Award announcements
    will be made before the beginning of October, 1994. For more
    information, contact Larry Williams at +1 202 482 1551.

    ELECTRONIC CAFE NAME UNINTENTIONALLY USURPED BY INTERNET NEWBIE
    <P>
    One Mark Cheverton, a neophyte Internet user from Cambridge, England,
    ran afoul of one of the Internet's oldest cultural institutions, the
    Electronic Cafe, last month, when he issued a press release announcing
    his intention to start his own Internet-connected bistro, unwittingly
    also using the name "Electronic Cafe."  His transgression was noted
    immediately by more experienced inhabitants of the net, and a brief
    flame-war ensued, concluding with Cheverton's induction into the
    world-wide chain of electronically-linked cafes organized by Kit
    Galloway and Sherrie Rabinowitz.

    SNAIL MAIL HITS CYBERSPACE
    <P>
    Billing the US Postal Service as the "first information superhighway,"
    Postmaster General Marvin Runyon envisions the USPS as an "on-ramp to
    the electronic highway" via interactive kiosks in post office lobbies
    and by certifying electronically safeguarded E-mail. With access to
    123 million mailbox addresses, only their lack of organization (and a
    couple of disgruntled workers) are keeping the Postal Service from
    becoming a force to be reckoned with.

    ARTISTS WANT ACCESS TO CANADIAN INFO HIGHWAY
    <P>
    The Canadian Conference of the Arts fears the federal government will
    leave it behind on the first Canadian road trip down the information
    Trans-Canada highway. Canada wants to entwine all electronic and
    telecommunications networks into a single system that would provide
    Canadians with easy access to libraries, banks, entertainment, and
    other services.  The CCA claims artists will be responsible for much
    information sent along the network, and should sit among the appointed
    communication executives and consumer advocates who will meet to help
    shape federal policy on advanced information systems.

    E-MAIL FOR MONSIEUR CLINTON
    <P>
    The White House has begun to expand its use of electronic communications
    beyond American borders.  As of May 27, in honor of the 50th anniversary
    of D-Day, French citizens were able to E-mail memories of the invasion
    to President Clinton via American translators in Paris, who faxed
    translations directly to the White House.  More than 200,000 E-mail
    messages have been received by the President and Vice President since
    American lines were opened in June 1993. There are six million Minitel
    computer terminals in France and a third of the French public reports
    using one at least once a month.

    'INTERNET IN A BOX' BETA TESTERS NEEDED
    <P>
    Spry Inc., makers of "Internet In A Box", a Windows-based link to the
    net, including Email, Readnews, Gopher, Telnet & Mosaic connectivity,
    needs PC users who currently have an active PPP account with Internet
    access for trial usage. Also needed are owners of many many different
    modem types. If you're interested, mail "info@ibox.com".
    
    <P>
    A MORE MATURE NCSA MOSAIC 2.0 FOR MACINTOSH ENTERS ALPHA TEST
    <P>
    The NCSA is also supporting HTML forms and tables, as well as improved
    hotlist handling, new text modes, visual indication of aging in cached
    entires, speech recognition on AV Macintoshes, and a new fat binary
    distribution to support the PowerMacintosh in native mode.  Although
    the current alpha version isn't quite ready for prime-time in terms of
    speed or reliability, these long-awaited features will bring the
    Macintosh implementation into parity with the flagship X-Windows
    version.  The alpha version is at
    "<A HREF="ftp://ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu/Mosaic/Mac/NCSAMosaicMac.200A2.sea.hqx">ftp://ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu/Mosaic/Mac/NCSAMosaicMac.200A2.sea.hqx</A>".

<P>
    NEW HTTP BROWSER FOR THE MACINTOSH ENTERS ALPHA TEST
    <P>
    Microelectronics Computer Corporation is distributing alpha 0.98 of
    their new browser, MacWeb.  The new browser, obviously not quite
    complete yet, draws upon Unix roots for its interface, eschewing NCSA
    Mosaic's System 7 look in favor of a gray background and Helvetica
    text default config. Some users may resent being forced to name and
    save every image to disk, and many will be displeased by the lack of
    support for noncommercial versions of MacTCP.  It is available at
    "<A HREF="ftp://ftp.einet.net/einet/mac/macweb/macweb0.98alpha.sea.hqx">ftp://ftp.einet.net/einet/mac/macweb/macweb0.98alpha.sea.hqx</A>".

    SOFTWARE FOR INTERACTIVE DISCUSSION ON THE WEB
    <P>
    Ari Luotonen has written a set of CGI scripts that make it possible to
    have interactive discussions in the Web.  It's called WIT, W3
    Interactive Talk.  The "pre-alpha version of the prototype" is running
    on info.cern.ch. This is a fast and loose effort so expect bugs and
    discuss them with WIT rather then flooding his mailbox with feature
    requests. Pick up the software at "<A HREF="http://info.cern.ch/wit">http://info.cern.ch/wit</A>".

<P>
    NEW HTTP BROWSER FOR DOS
    <P>
    DosLynx, a DOS based browser for WWW hypertext is available in an
    alpha version as a "feedback tool for the developer". It has a number
    of desirable features; but, as with most programs which interface to a
    network server, the setup is for advanced DOS users only. The good
    news is that it will run under all versions of DOS from 3.0 and up,
    and only requires a 8086, 512K of memory and 2MB of hard drive space.
    It's available at "<A HREF="ftp://ftp2.cc.ukans.edu/pub/DosLynx/DLX0_71A.EXE">ftp://ftp2.cc.ukans.edu/pub/DosLynx/DLX0_71A.EXE</A>".

    promises the usual features. If you feel adventurous, you can download

<B><A NAME="SS1">THE ANARCHIST WEB PAGE</A></B>
<P>
Sex on the Net isn't the only thing upsetting certain politicians. Come
to Candyman to explore all aspects of anarchy and illegal activities.
There isn't much more than straight text here, much of it culled from
Usenet and individual rants, but you'll discover a huge treasure trove
of underground information. Articles include data on bomb-making,
radar-jamming, credit card fraud, drug recipes, lockpicking,
phone-phreaking, and counterfeiting. There are also links to other
hacker and drug pages. This is the kind of site that is likely to close
as censorship paranoia rises amongst Internet providers. If you need any
of this information, not that we endorse such activity, get it while you
can. <A HREF="http://www.mcs.com/~candyman/home.html">"http://www.mcs.com/~candyman/home.html"</A>

<B><A NAME="SS2">LETTERS FROM JESUS</A></B>
<P>
We might all go straight to Hell - do not pass Purgatory; do not collect
200 souls - just for reading this page, but we'll laugh all the way to
the Pit. Keep up with Jesus's daily happenings (usually a quest for
mortal flesh of the female variety) as he pens the Messiah Log, or take
comfort in the list of future Hellmates, quite reassuring to the cynical
among us. Those moved by the spirit can even join Jesus's latest
religion, the Church of Monty Christo. <A HREF="http://www.unc.edu/~sca4807/">"http://www.unc.edu/~sca4807/"</A>

Everybody knows Scott Thompson, right? (No, we don't mean the
congressman.) Scott, a Kid in the Hall, is now appearing on "The Larry
Sanders Show". The funniest queen on TV has now become the funniest
queen on the Web - Queen of ScottLand, that is. Scott finally has what
he wanted. No, not pink lame, peekaboo-nipple softball uniforms, but his
own country. Call it a democracy with excellent graphics. Registered
citizens are encouraged to vote for prime minister (go, Fran!),
contribute suggestions for future projects, and can get together in the
Bottoms Up Cafe (tee-hee) to chat. <A HREF="http://www.scottland.com/">"http://www.scottland.com/"</A>

<B><A NAME="SS4">TAKE TWO VALIUM AND SHRIEK LOUDLY IN THE MORNING</A></B>
<P>
Does life make you hyperventilate? Feel like letting loose a deafening
primal scream or curling up in a fetal ball but don't know why? This
might be the spot for you. The Panic Encyclopedia claims to be "the
definitive guide to the postmodern scene", and it explains panic, the
key psychological mood of postmodern culture. Read about Panic Elvis,
Panic Sex, Panic Lips, Panic Lovers, and more. Discover why Xanax
appears to be the drug of choice. It's understandable when all is "a
floating reality, with the actual as a dream world, where we live on the
edge of ecstasy and dread." Whatever. Panic attacks and tracts are, of
course, welcome. <A HREF="http://www.freedonia.com/panic/">"http://www.freedonia.com/panic/"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="SS5">MSCONSPIRACY OR MSPARANOIA?</A></B>
<P>
Once glance at Joan Grove's home page will tell you that she doesn't
exactly rank as Microsoft's greatest fan. Joan, a former Microsoft
employee, displays proof of what she considers to be crucial Microsoft
math bugs, a report on how "Microsoft Destroyed My Family", and
accusations of sexual harassment and thuggery. This WWW site won't make
Bill Gates' day. She claims Microsoft's legal department warns all
potential employers of her, as well any who try either to work with or
help her. For good measure, she acuses her ex-husband of molesting her
children and includes a photo of him naked. There's lots of other stuff,
too, but is it fact or fiction? Either option's truly scary.

<B><A NAME="SS6">MORE MSFOLLIES</A></B>
<P>
Interested in a site recognized as Geek Site of the Day and included on
the Anti-Windows homepage? Then check out the "Microsoft Conspiracy
Interpretation of American Pi" page. This quirky site deconstructs the
lyrics to the Don McLean song "American Pie". McLean was a classmate of
Bill Gates's at Harvard, and this page make the case that he
prophetically wrote the song, really called "American Pi", about Gates
and his evil empire-building future. Apparently, the chord progression
spells out "William Gates III Is Satan Kill Your Parents." Cool.

<B><A NAME="SS7">FIVE'S COMPANY</A></B>
<P>
Slap together five college students, four digital video cameras, and a
networked computer. Add a corporate sponsor and what do you get? No, not
a new sitcom, but the Virtual Dorm, a site that allows you to peep into
the students' world. The cameras, running 24 hours a day, offer live
video over CuSeeME and still shots for the video impaired. QuickTime
tours map the residence for you; video profiles introduce the
participants. You can communicate with the residents over CuSeeME or
send e-mail, which is posted on the page. There isn't much info about
the project itself or any answers to obvious questions, such as why
anyone would volunteer for this. Still, if you're one of those folks who
enjoy Netscape's Amazing Fish Cam, you may have fun here too.

<B><A NAME="SS8">IAN ELLISON'S LONG STRANGE TRIP</A></B>
<P>
Ian Ellison has set up Loki Express, he says, "to see what happens
next". He is a Generation Xer, and he's filled his pages with stories
that reflect that. It is as strange as it is appealing, with Xer-style
autobiographical stories about such topics as his convoluted reasons for
not having a car, how he filled his rent-a-car for free, things he
hasn't been to jail for yet, and his innumerable screwups. Bits of
personal anecdotal background should be perused before twisting through
this engaging page: Ian's a good story teller, but it sure helps to know
where he's coming from. <A HREF="http://www.umich.edu/~ian/index.html">"http://www.umich.edu/~ian/index.html"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="SS9">MON CHERIE, MISTRESS OF ATLANTA</A></B>
<P>
Mon Cherie, a child of Atlanta's clubland, is a fetish performer. Her
fetish Web page presents hot and rubbery fashions as seen in Fantasy
Fashion Digest and other such non-heatwave-wear mags. Information about
fetish clubs with cheap admission certainly seem to offer good, useful
entertainment value. The awesome links page is stuffed with heaps of
stuff like Virus Fanzine and PeachWeb. Lighthearted and sticky, but she
really ought to improve her French. <A HREF="http://www.mindspring.com/~moncheri/">"http://www.mindspring.com/~moncheri/"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="SS10">OLD KENTUCKY HOME PAGE</A></B>
<P>
On the other hand, there's Life As It Used to Be. Well, not really.
Duane and Eva's Old Kentucky Home Page combines high-tech art with
homespun humor. The result is an amusing, unusually creative site with
links varying from "Our Farm Photos" to "Computer Art" and SimCity 2000
city files. If you're in a rustic mood, you can check out the Forest
Management Workshop Manual and Woodland Stream links. Techies will
prefer to delve into Duane's descriptions of the more than 80 computer
programs he's written. <A HREF="http://www.webcom.com/duane/welcome.html">"http://www.webcom.com/duane/welcome.html"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="SS11">CHIP'S HOME PAGE OF HARMLESS FUN</A></B>
<P>
Chip Rowe's easy and friendly home page contains pics, trivia, and
stories about such things as the laundry room episode (the Rat Fink
link). Use the luxury of objective hindsight to pass judgement on his
apartment block crisis. Well designed for feedback, the page has some
dodgy enough Best Web Sites such as Babes on the Web and Web Voyeur,
which sports the old handy cam at a bus stop in Beverly hills, but what
do you expect? Chip works for Playboy. Harmless jock stuff.

<P>
<B><A NAME="SS12">THE ECLECTIC LAND OF OZ</A></B>
<P>
This is another personal page, but it looks better and has more depth
than many corporate sites. Somewhat eclectic, the emphasis here is on
fantasy, stories, and mysticism. Adorned with beautiful backgrounds and
pretty graphics, there are links to paganism, witchcraft, and new age
religions. Other areas cover science fiction, fantasy, and horror. A
form permits easy submission of a Santagram, to which an answer is
promised. Read the HTML version of the first sequel to "The Wonderful
Wizard of Oz" along with many other stories suitable for children. After
entertaining the kids, jump to the index of Web search engines and
pointers to collections of internet tools, shareware, and games.

If you've ever wondered how Mr.T compares to a giant redwood, Solid
Space is for you. Share Fabio's deepest thoughts, in his own voice. This
is where we learned of the dark side of Pez, featured in our Halloween
issue, but there is much more worthwhile crap than just that here. Check
out the Optigan (a disk-reading organ), View-Masters, and some really
Awful Music.  <A HREF="http://redwood.northcoast.com/~shojo/Solid.html">"http://redwood.northcoast.com/~shojo/Solid.html"</A>

<B><A NAME="SS14">THE STRUNK & WHITE FOR BUSINESS WEB PAGES</A></B>
<P>
Accept the premise that Web pages are roughly equivalent to printed
brochures and you get the concept behind Jim Heath's "Pointers To
Creating Successful Business Web Pages". This no-nonsense page, put
together by a group of professional copywriters, links to sites with
features that work and others that don't, with commentary on the why and
how of it. Obviously, much thought has gone into this topic and there's
even intelligent discussion about items the writers disagreed on, like
whether bright colors attract or detract from the business message. We
suspect that this site will prove invaluable to anyone thinking about
launching a profitable location on the Web.

<B><A NAME="OT1">OUT OF AFRICA</A></B>
<P>
We weren't sure what to expect from a site called the Alchemy of Africa.
With links titled "energy", "matter", "sprit", and "love", and a cosmic
background, we thought we might have landed at a cyber-rave. But when we
saw the Mystical Launchpad button with the rhinoceros (albeit green), we
knew this was the right URL. This is actually a pretty informative site
with facts and photos on bushmen, witch doctors, etc., as well six
African tunes authored by Steven Lifschitz. And if you're feeling a
little down and have a lot of time for the graphic to dither on, check
out the Love Pages for a "positive interruption".

<B><A NAME="OT2">BORN ON THE BAYOU</A></B>
<P>
If you're more swamp rat than Net-head, you'll feel right at home at
these two sites. Glen Pitre's Louisiana Catalog is part catalogue
hustle, part folklore lesson, and will have you wishing you were born on
the bayou. The catalogue stocks folk art, strange souvenirs, foods and
fire-breathing spices, books, music, and a slew of other items that any
Louisiana culture vulture would find hard to pass up. If bar-hopping the
Big Easy is more your style, swing by the Louisiana Home Page for a
listing of clubs, events, eateries, music festivals, shopping stops, and
Louisiana sights. The site covers the state, but, almost by necessity,
there's a strong focus on New Orleans and its environs. Laissez les bons
temps roulez.  Catalogue: <A HREF="http://www.bayoufolk.com/lacat/">"http://www.bayoufolk.com/lacat/"</A> Louisiana:

<P>
Rough Guides have been hauled around in backpacks and back pockets by
intrepid tourists for years. They're now on the Web, courtesy of
HotWired. The 900+ slick pages of travel information offer valuable
travel tips on local eateries, clubs, sights, and other haunts across
the United States. HotWired promises it will have the entire Rough Guide
library online in due time, giving ergonomically correct armchair
travelers the world at their fingertips. Of course, what works great in
a backpack loses some utility when tied to a terminal. The online Rough
Guides make up for that with Vox, where readers and visitors may comment
on spots covered in the Guides. Bored in Boston or mugged in New York,
leave your own tales for HotWired's tripping travelers.

In the mood for a little vicarious adventure? Check out this multimedia
raft trip down the Colorado River in the Grand Canyon. Really nice maps,
good comments on the geology you're sliding past, and
better-than-average photos from some knowledgable afficionados, nicely
punctuated with QuickTime movies. Sit back and enjoy the ride.

<P>
If you're tired of Big Ben, Buckingham Palace, and London's other
popular tourist attractions, perhaps you'll want to familiarize yourself
with the _real_ London, which is precisely what you'll find at the
London Calling Internet site. This "interactive entertainment magazine"
allows you to visit such places as the Surrey Docks Farm, the Notting
Hill Carnival, and our favorite, the Portobello Market. If you have an
affinity toward reggae, hip-hop, Rasta, and/or street culture, you might
avail yourself of the opportunity to sample the sights and sounds.

<B><A NAME="SS1">UNDERWATER RESEARCH PROJECT OFFERS LIVE VIDEO FEEDS</A></B>
<P>
For 10 days starting April 15, netsurfers can play stowaway with the JASON
Project. The underwater research project consists of AQUARIUS, an
underwater scientific habitat; a US Navy submarine mapping virgin Florida
Keys seafloor; and a robotic vehicle tracking shark movements. The
question, Alex, is: "What are things that are underwater?" Netsubmariners
will have access to research data, an underwater digital camera, and the
hand-held PDA of expedition leader Dr. Bob Ballard, the guy who discovered
the RMS Titanic in 1985. The site highlight may prove to be the streamed
images, video, and audio, or possibly the live underwater chat session.
Blub, blub. <A HREF="http://aquarius.eds.com/">"http://aquarius.eds.com/"</A>

<B><A NAME="SS2">ONLINE REPOSITORY FOR YIDDISH LANGUAGE AND CULTURE</A></B>
<P>
The Yiddish Language and Culture home page, which bills itself as a
"Virtual Shtetl", links to Yiddish-oriented pages for a library, synagogue,
school, memorial, and more. What's a shtetl? It's a small Jewish town or
village formerly found in Eastern Europe. You can learn much more than
definitions by visiting one of the areas; the library, for example,
contains a link to a Bibliography with topics ranging from literature and
art to theater and cinema to history and Holocaust Rescuers. Be sure to
stop by the Kitchen, where you can check out a database of kosher
restaurants or get a recipe for blintzes and other delicacies.

<B><A NAME="SS3">FANCY SEARCH AND RESCUE SITE WITH JAVA, FRAMES, AND MORE</A></B>
<P>
Learn how to hug a tree and prepare a survival pack. To get the full effect
of this professional Search and Rescue site you'll need a browser that
supports frames and Java. There are, however, interesting alternatives at
this content-rich site. One of the coolest features is a US map generator
that accepts latitude and longitude and outputs an area map with roads,
lakes, rivers and cities. It is generated dynamically using info from the
US Census Bureau. Nifty.

<B><A NAME="SS4">WEBBERDAUMMERUNG</A></B>
<P>
Not everyone takes the time to create a links list to related sites, and
those that do often do not update them. The WebRing is a novel idea that
groups in series related but independent Web sites across the Net. Member
pages include a ring icon that will link them to the next site (or a list
of the next five) in the sequence. Following all the links in any given
ring eventually leads you back where you started. The original ring has
over 250 pages, so this can take a while! Some current rings are: ESLoop
(English Language Teaching), Queering (lesbian/gay/bisexual), and Ring of
Truth (humorous slant on philosophy/religion). You can hitch your own pages
to a ring or find out how to create your own at the site.

<B><A NAME="SS5">HOW NOT TO DO BUSINESS ON THE WEB</A></B>
<P>
Before you launch your next big Web endeavor, be sure to stop by StoogeNet,
a site dedicated to showcasing big Internet boo-boos made by corporations
and individuals alike. Just click on the eyeballs and you'll soon be
learning from other people's promotional pitfalls, firewall horror stories,
virus nightmares, and more. Some of it's pretty funny.

<B><A NAME="SS6">ARE THERE VIRTUAL CABS, TOO?</A></B>
<P>
The Virtual Cities Repository is, as the name implies, a storehouse for
three-dimensional representations of urban landscapes. The cities are
stored in several formats, ranging from the mindbogglingly CPU-hogging VRML
to the more precise 3DS file format, used by Autodesk's 3D Studio
application. Current uses of these models are currently limited, at least
where the average user in concerned, but the implications are staggering.
With the hope that eventually netsurfers will be able to do the VR glide
through the Galleria (thus cutting down on the nuisance factor), this site
may just be the vanguard of a new means of getting - or rather, looking -
around. <A HREF="http://www.vir.com/~farid/ctrepos.htm">"http://www.vir.com/~farid/ctrepos.htm"</A>

<B><A NAME="SS7">NEW HOME FOR OLD FOOTAGE</A></B>
<P>
In the days before television, CNN, and the Internet, Movietone News would
project current events onto movie screens across North America. Fox News,
which owns the rights to the 10,000 hours of footage, has started to make
the newsreels available to netizens via their Internet starting point,
IGuide. The images are available as downloadable .AVI and QuickTime .MOV
files, and several interesting sections, including a "This week in History"
feature, are bound to keep surfers fascinated.

<B><A NAME="SS8">WE SURFED IT THROUGH THE GRAPEVINE</A></B>
<P>
The Diners' Grapevine is bound to have famished surfers salivating all over
their keyboards. The concept is to create the single largest resource for
those who would use the Internet in the quest for the perfect meal. The
Grapevine features selected restaurants daily, highlighting cuisine,
atmosphere, and special features, and often providing images of the
locations. More usefully, the site has a searchable database of North
American restaurants that allows users to select their dining criteria and
restrict the search accordingly. Currently, the index boasts over 6,000
entries. Yum. <A HREF="http://www.dinersgrapevine.com/">"http://www.dinersgrapevine.com/"</A>

<B><A NAME="SS9">HTML/CGI EXPERTISE AT YOUR FINGERTIPS</A></B>

Dr. Clue (a.k.a. Ian Storms) has launched a rather spiffy resource for
those looking to broaden their electronic horizons. His "HTML Guide from
InfoBON" offers helpful information on everything from beginning HTML to
advanced CGI programming. Need help with forms, frames, or tables? This is
the place. Want to know more about server-push animation? Here you go. And
if you're just plain tired of doing everything yourself, Dr. Clue is an
expert CGI programmer for hire.

<P>
Looking for a Web home to call your own? Stop by GeoCities, a virtual world
of 18 cyber-communities based on real-world places like RodeoDrive, Paris,
SoHo, and the RainForest, to name a few. In keeping with its homesteading
philosophy, GeoCities provides free personal home pages (up to 1 MB of
space). Another neighborly site is Tripod, which puts emphasis on sharing
"tools for life". Tripod was founded by a group of college grads who felt
unprepared to enter the real world. Accordingly, their site focuses on
everything you didn't learn in school. You can read the latest news, create
an online resume, and - see the them? - construct your own home page for
free, among other things. GeoCities: <A HREF="http://www.geocities.com/">"http://www.geocities.com/"</A> Tripod:

head of heaven. You can decide who to follow after studying Elvis's 31
commandments (actually a grocery list) and getting a quick medical checkup
you're a true believer, you'll want to hit the "Siteings" section, or maybe

<P>
It may not be the mother of all Web search engines, but the Cosmix Mother
Load shows enough promise to take some of the load off its ever-busy
elders. With this directory of directories and search engines, you get a
choice of three flavors: Insane ("the most thorough metasearch"); Web ("a
simplified metasearch"); and Mother Load ("a local directory search").
Insane lets you select online magazines and newspapers for your
needle-in-a-Web-haystack moments, and the Yahoo-like categories in "Mother
Load" are great for browsing. Join the crowd, Mom!

<B><A NAME="SS13">CAR AND SURFER</A></B>
<P>
Lay rubber today to Car and Driver - it's terrific! Whether you're in the
market for a new car or just want to browse, this site is a car lover's
dream. The '96 Buyer's Guide is a hot resource for road warriors. You can
search by manufacturer, price range, or vehicle type. Daily news, articles
from Car and Driver magazine, and links to automotive sites will also help
make you an informed consumer. This is quite likely the most comprehensive
collection of auto info on the Web. Even the animations are exemplary. Park
yourself in front of your monitor and get wired to this slick baby.

<B><A NAME="SS14">BOX OFFICE DRAW</A></B>
<P>
If you like Hollywood press photos and multimedia clips, Hollywood Online
is for you. The graphics are quick (as the Web goes, of course) and slick;
you'll need plug-ins for the .MOV and .AVI tidbits and RealAudio for the
sound bites. Keep in mind that everything here is designed to tease you
toward the box office. Press releases provide the only substance, and much
of the "humor" is flat. Many movie buffs will prefer 60 seconds of
continuous, televised preview on "Entertainment Tonight". For teasers,
though, it sure is tempting. <A HREF="http://www.hollywood.com/">"http://www.hollywood.com/"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="SS15">DIVE RIGHT IN</A></B>
<P>
Despite using all the latest whistles and horns, this site is surprisingly
easy to understand and navigate. Two sections will be of interest to the
surfer: first is "My Eye", a section where you can manipulate images and
add to a string-along story, and the Flying Pig section of links and other
things. The second section of interest is the business portion of the pages
which contain plenty of tools for advanced Web site design.

Where in the world is Montserrat? It's about 1,300 miles south of Miami,
near Antigua. You can find out about the island, its history, its people,
and all there is to do on this tiny Carribean island. They have an active
volcano, black sand or white sand beaches, and all the usual tourist
attractions. Every question that the traveller can ask is answered in a
running dialogue between the two characters that take you on a virtual tour
of the island. <A HREF="http://www.mrat.com/">"http://www.mrat.com/"</A>

<B><A NAME="OT2">BIG DO-IT-YOURSELF TRAVEL SITE FROM TEXAS</A></B>
<P>
A collaboration between SABRE Interactive and Worldview Systems has
produced a slick, easy-to-use travel site. The main menu choices are
reservations, destinations and interests, chats and forums, and travel
merchandise. You'll find places from at least five continents and over a
dozen main headings for things to do. The new site is easy to navigate and
well presented, and will probably get better as it matures and adds even
more information. If you crave interaction, try the chats and forums.

<B><A NAME="OT3">EURAIL</A></B>
<P>
Thinking of spending a season in Europe on the rails, travelling from city
to city, meeting new friends, eating unusual dairy products, and drinking
strange alcohols? This'll help, at least with the rail part. Take a dip in
the Cafe Elysees for threaded messages and conferences. There's lots of
advice on travel plans and what to do once you get there. Although you
can't purchase Eurail passes online, this site offers everything else you
could possibly want. Well, maybe not everything. A good croissant would hit
the spot nicely, but what can you do? <A HREF="http://www.eurail.com/">"http://www.eurail.com/"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="OT4">RIGHT IN THE BALTICS</A></B>
<P>
One place Eurail doesn't go - three places, actually - are the Baltic
countries, Eastern Europe's answer to Benelux. The Baltics Online offers a
mix of current events and financial news along with cultural info and art.
Oddly, the only available geographical information is tucked away in an
entirely French page accessed via a tiny-fonted link. And there is no
history presented at all. It's a slow load at times, but be patient - this
is straight from the horse's mouth in Tallinn, Estonia.

download clips from their site). The experience is akin to a multimedia

<P>
The official Olympic site is so bland and uninspiring it could have been
designed by committee. Come to think of it, it probably was. If you want
the real human stories of the Games, you can't do better than ESPNet. The
coverage is somewhat US-centric, but the Olympics is a ripping yarn, and
they tell it well. Check out the Chasing the Dream link for athletes'
diaries of their quest for glory. As usual, Yahoo has the best index of
relevant sites. Look at their Olympic Teams links for your favorite sport.
Now go do those sit-ups.

<P>
The summer edition of the Boardwatch Internet Service Provider Directory
decisively refutes that there is any sort of consolidation going on in the
ISP market. Boardwatch found 2461 ISPs in the US, up from 1447 in February.
They estimate a population of 6,558,333 customers account for about $1.5
billion in annual ISP revenue. Incidentally, the July issue of Boardwatch
has the best comparison of Netscape and Explorer browsers we've yet seen.
Any magazine that describes its struggle with chat software as "nothing so
much like three nervous monkeys trying to engage in intercourse with a
football on a waxed tile floor" is too good to miss.

What breaks records, grosses over $90 million in just five days, and is
likely to become one of the top grossing films of all time? "Independence
Day", a modest little movie consisting of every Hollywood SF cliche ever
written and some literally mind-blowing special effects. Fun? You bet.
Here's the official site with the usual assortment of multimedia goodies.
And for those poor souls who have to put up with the moviegoing multitudes
there's the "ID4 Survival Guide for Theater Workers". Remember, watch the

CERT has issued a security advisory aimed at Linux systems that use the dip
program to access SLIP and PPP dialup services. On a system with dip
installed as set-user-id root, anyone with access to an account can gain
root access. Programs exploiting this security hole are floating around the
Net. Fortunately, a fixed version of dip is available. The security hole
exists in versions up to 3.3.7n. Read the advisory for more information.

In late June, InterNIC, the Net's domain name registry, eliminated MSNBC's
domain because, they claimed, the Microsoft/NBC news organization had not
paid their fees. It turns out InterNIC was wrong and had incorrectly
shuffled the apropriate e-paperwork. Before shutting down the site,
InterNIC had sent MSNBC an e-mail asking for a clarification. When no
response arrived, InterNIC went ahead with the decision to terminate the
domain. The moral of the story? Don't ignore mail from InterNIC for too
long. The full story is at Media Daily:

<P>
The Texas Humanities Resource Center looks at the history of censorship of
the arts since the onset of book burning in the year 1205. A dedicated and
original site, it provides startling information: "Alice in Wonderland" was
banned in China in 1931 because "animals should not use human language."
Add to the list of banned works those of Judy Blume and the celebrated
30,000-year-old sculpture, Dolni Vestonice. This page will shock, amuse,
and increase awareness of the controlling forces of censorship.

that institution's Web page, it's here. Including 220 paintings and
pastel/pencil drawings, this collection displays Picasso's private drawings
of family and friends. The site's well organized with fairly quick

To function, armed forces have to make war seem more glorious and patriotic
than deadly serious. Propaganda departments work overtime producing
literature and images tailored to awaken the spirit of duty, honor, and
loyalty to one's country. A sampling of one technique used by the US
Government during the Second World War is found at the WWII Propaganda
Posters site, full of downloadable versions of the posters that were used
to inspire hope during the dark days of fear, rationing, and shortages.
Posters extoll the virtues of buying War Bonds and of carpooling, pictures

or not you still read newspapers, and even if you don't live in LA, you can
easily get hooked. You'll wonder why you ever thought of reading news on
America Online or CompuServe instead of the Web, as long as you use
Netscape 2.0 or 3.0. Wow and double wow! <A HREF="http://www.latimes.com/">"http://www.latimes.com/"</A>

Culture Zone is another of the gazillions of online e-mags. Why should you
check it out? Well, slick layout, good music reviews on the Wailing
Highway, an excellent featured artist in the Art House, and some fun with
the Fashion Police in the Glad Rags section. There might be some confusion
with the unnecessary intermediate pages between sections but don't let that
deter you from Cultural awareness. <A HREF="http://www.culturezone.com/current/">"http://www.culturezone.com/current/"</A>

<B><A NAME="BEZ4">CLASSICS</A></B>
<P>
The University of Virginia Electronic Text Library is an academic treasure
trove of medieval and modern literature, including prose, poetry, and
religious resources. Literary masterpieces in English, French, German,
Japanese, and Latin are freely available to all. If you've never read
classics such as "The Vicar of Wakefield" or "The Son of Tarzan", here's
your chance. Rich sites like this may not put bookstores out of business,
but libraries and publishers ought to take note. Where else can you
download "Hot-Foot Hannibal", "Baxter's Procrustes", "Buttered Side Down",
and "Howard's End" gratis in a few clicks?

There are plenty of online dictionaries; here's one with a twist. Enter any
URL, and Wordbot puts the page into a frame. It then turns every word into
a link to your choice of one of ten online dictionaries (or pick your own
by specifying the URL). Click a word and voila - the definition appears in
the top frame. Pre-existing links are noted with a distinctive graphic so
you can still navigate as usual. While for us it did a fine job with the
text, it botched several image links. This is a clever technological
demonstration and may be of use especially when reading pages written in
foreign languages. <A HREF="http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/kgolden/wordbot.html">"http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/kgolden/wordbot.html"</A>

If you're one of those hapless souls with a nose for news, a penchant for

for Finding Data on the Internet. You'll find links to data for potential
stories, statistics geared to writers, basic reference data, and topics
ranging from aviation to agriculture to "finding people" to the weather.
There's also a nifty "Need Help" link that lets you e-mail Profnet, a group

On July 16 (we think), you can begin to virtually and safely accompany a
real journey through the Amazon rain forest. You'll have guides, maps,
equipment, and, of course, images. The canoe expedition through the
northwest Amazon basin will beam data and images from faunal and
limnological field work to collaborating scientists and this Web site in a
grander experiment testing the limits of interactive research. This can be
an exciting adventure to tag along with, but it can also be a drag if you
don't have at least a 28.8 kbps connection. There are many large images,

reading glasses because most of the text is LARGE (H3 for you HTML types).
Coupled with the white backgrounds and colorful navigational icons, the

Diamonds may be a girl's best friend, but rubies, sapphires, and opals run

gorgeous gemstones, we can't possibly name them all here. At the
International Colored Gemstone Association site, you can check out the
glamorous photos, take the monthly gem quiz (you could win a very precious
prize), and learn more about gems in general. For instance, did you know
that garnets come in shades of green and orange in addition to red? Did you
know that sapphires are almost as hard as diamonds? Did you know that the
gemstone industry is making efforts to ban the use of the word
"semi-precious?" It's truly a gem of a site. Sorry.

<P>
Panix, one of New York's oldest and largest Internet service providers
(ISPs), came under crippling attack by a new class of deadly
denial-of-service assault late last week. Basically, the attacker flooded
their machines with TCP/IP packets from random IP addresses until the
machines were paralyzed and unable to accept connections from legitimate
users. The attack appears to be based on code published recently in a
hacker magazine (no, we won't tell you where). Panix and Sprint, Panix's
upstream backbone provider, are attempting to trace the source of the
attack. It appears that any machine on the Internet is vulnerable to this
same kind of attack, though eventually the attacker can be traced. A terse
statement about the situation from Panix is on the Net. At press time CERT
did not yet have a security advisory, but look for one soon. Panix:

Perhaps the best know of the anonymous servers, anon.pnet.fi, has closed

anonymity seekers all over the world. Rumors have been circulating about
the reasons for the server's demise, ranging from police raids to KGB
hacking, but the truth is a bit tamer. Johann Helsingius closed it because
it had become burdensome to operate it, and because of the unclear legal
status of anonymous e-mail in Finland. You can read his press release for

This is a juicy bit of investigative hacking on the part of the folks at
O'Reilly, the indispensable technical publisher and originator of GNN. It
seems that by setting two values in the Windows Registry you can turn an NT
Workstation operating system into the much more expensive and capable
Windows NT Server. This flies in the face of Microsoft claims that the two
are very different pieces of software. They are not. It's the same software
with a switch of configurations for control features and performance. Is
Microsoft guilty of foul mendacity, or are they just sharp business
competitors? You judge. It makes for fun reading, especially the jingoistic
and detailed hack article. Expect to see the already written
reconfiguration utilities on the Net any day now, even though they do
violate Microsoft licenses. The Story:

This lawsuit is one to watch. The National Basketball Association is
telling AOL the service can't post game scores and stats in real-time. It's
a confrontation between free speech and intellectual property. The NBA
figures it owns the online news about the games, much like it owns the
rights to auction off TV coverage. It's the first blatant big-time bid to
lock up the new online media market, and the outcome is likely to set
serious legal precedents. Interestingly, the NBA won a lawsuit against
Motorola, which was transmitting scores and stats via a hand-held wireless
device. That injunction says the device, of all things, can't be sold. As
you'd expect, the decision is being appealed. <A HREF="http://www.nba.com/">"http://www.nba.com/"</A>

So you thought phone modems would top out at 33 kbps and you'd have to

has just announced it has 56 kbps modem technology which it will
demonstrate at the November Comdex. They'll produce a chip set which will
presumably be used in various third-party modems, much like the current
28.8 kbps Rockwell chip sets. The announcement sent their stock up 8%, as
well it should. There are also rumors US Robotics will introduce its own 56

Pacific Bell has found an interesting way to get a piece of the ISP

to expand into new areas with minimal hardware investment, while the telco

<P>
America Online, responding to complaints from users, decided to block five
domains responsible for the bulk of the problem (cyberpromo.com,
honeys.com, answerme.com, netfree.com, and servint.com). It also announced
that later this month, it will roll out customized features allowing
members to block mass e-mailings. The very next day, Cyber Promotions,
which controls three of the five blocked domains, obtained an injunction
against AOL that restored the status quo pending a trial scheduled for
early November. This is another big unresolved cyberspace legal issue. Who
controls the traffic to your machine - you or the sender? PC Week has a
couple of brief articles on this story.

<P>
If you're ready for a good bit of British cyberculture, dip your toes into
the strange waters of Backspace, a site intrinsically linked to the ebb and
flow of the River Thames. Really, it is. Stop by any time of the day or
night and you'll know just how high the river is... and just how far out
Backspace's members are. Just click on the bobbing icons. Fabulous Web
effects are to be found here, along with some irreverent creativity and
freedom of expression. (Translation: some material may be unsuitable for
sensitive browsers). We particularly like the messages in the bottles.

The Pittsburgh-based Mattress Factory bills itself as a "research and
development lab for artists", and specializes in commissioned,
site-specific installations within the museum. Thus far it doesn't appear
that cyberspace has been one of those sites, as the museum's Web site only
catalogues past and present installations in the Factory itself. The art,
though, is interesting, the accompanying text informative, and information
on artist and process intriguing. Check out John Latham's installation and
delve into his concept of "Evenstruck" - short for event structure - "a
dimensionality that subsumes all alleged phenomena." (This is art,
remember.) It might be the Mattress Factory, but the site is anything but a
snooze. <A HREF="http://www.mattress.org/">"http://www.mattress.org/"</A>

that prose in other sections is not as good as prose in the Trib, but
unlike some news sites, the Sun-Times is not graphics-intensive, and you

by the Miami Museum of Science, the site offers all its information in
kid-friendly terms, from first-person accounts of surviving a hurricane to
the nitty-gritty details of what makes a hurricane tick. Much of the site
is interactive; all of it is involving. This outstanding site also includes
a teachers' guide and a "hurricane hotlist" of links to nearly a dozen
other hurricane sites. Both students and teachers would be well advised to
breeze on over to this site before the next storm.

Definitely the coolest logo of the week - a strolling caribou. And where

one small bit of the Smithsonian Institution's Web site. The Center studies
Arctic peoples, their history, and their environment. The site features a
virtual museum exhibit entitled "Crossroads of the Continents", Myst-like
in appearance but still harboring a slightly musty museum gestalt. The site
also features "The Living Yamal", a tale of native Siberians coming face to
face with one of the biggest oil companies on Earth. The outcome isn't
quite what you'd expect and the telling, through journal entries, makes for
an interesting read. <A HREF="http://nmnhwww.si.edu/arctic/">"http://nmnhwww.si.edu/arctic/"</A>

Imagine running an airline and having to toss away your planes after each

what launch vehicle operators feel when they launch ELVs - Expendable
Launch Vehicles - to orbit. The buzzwords these days are RLV, Reusable
Launch Vehicle, and SSTO, Single-Stage-to-Orbit. They're the next direction
(aside from up) for anybody who wants to get themselves or a package into
Earth orbit and beyond. NASA's RLV Technology Program home page highlights
three programs chasing the dream. News bits, technical specs, images, and
videos are available for the DC-XA, the X-33, and the X-34. So far, only
the DC-XA has flown, and then only in hops across a desert. By 1999,
though, the X-33 should be blasting along at Mach 15, ready to demonstrate
that what goes up can indeed come down, and in one piece.

<P>
The US Congress passed a new telecommunications bill last week
criminalizing the transmission or posting of indecent material on the Net.
The online uproar may have already reached you. Two campaigns are underway
to protest what the American Civil Liberties Union calls an
unconstitutional attack on the guarantee of free speech. Voters
Telecommunications Watch (VTW) and the Center for Democracy and Technology
are calling for "Interactive Days of Mourning", and hope to persuade Web
page maintainers to change their backgrounds to black.
Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) is asking maintainers to incorporate a
blue ribbon to show support for free speech. The issue will undoubtedly be
decided in court.  VTW says many online users plan to deliberately break
the new law.

that to. Netscape's FTP sites are swamped, but you get a list of mirror

of prompting the election process to produce better selections. It should
be noted that some reports come from unverified, anonymous sources. The
site dishes real dirt, but with an ugly design that makes it hard to view.
The maintainer, Real People For Real Change, is a non-affiliated,
independent political action committee. <A HREF="http://www.realchange.org/">"http://www.realchange.org/"</A>

<P>
Fans of the daily comic strip Doonesbury rejoice; creator G.B. Trudeau
actively participates in a Web site intended to present political issues
and candidates vying for votes. The Doonesbury Electronic Town Hall is full
of opinion polls ("as accurate as they are pointless") and analysis of the
current events that will influence US voters come November. The well
designed site also offers interactive chat rooms where you can discuss
everthing from the history of the comic strip to current media. This is not
only an informative site, but a socially conscious one, something that has
always been reflected in the Doonesbury strip. It's well worth your ISP
charge. <A HREF="http://www.doonesbury.com/">"http://www.doonesbury.com/"</A>

<B><A NAME="SS3">HOLLYWOOD IN YOUR FACE: SCRIPTS, SCRIPTS, AND MORE SCRIPTS</A></B>
<P>
For many of us, this site - besides the Web itself - comes 20 to 40 years
too late. If we'd had it, more of us would be Hollywood scriptwriters.
Drew's Scripts-O-Rama links to scripts scattered around the world. Be
prepared to wait, for as Drew points out, "links are moody." Still, it's
free film school. Remember "Aliens"? James Cameron's first draft is only a
click away. "Die Hard", "Jurassic Park", "Total Recall", "Pulp Fiction" -
there's so much raw and polished material available, this gateway ought to
be on every creative writer's hotlist. A new section, "Screenwriters on the
Internet", is designed to give budding Stallones exposure on the Net by
providing links to their full-length screenplays. Bravo!

<P>
No beans about it - the mouthwateringly delightful Burrito Page offers one
of the more unique ways to measure your personality and burrito savvy. Just
select your favorite fillers (beef, cheese, cilantro, etc.) from the
illustrated form, and you'll soon know exactly where you stand - at least
with Mexican food. On the side, you'll find several burrito-related sites.

What did Marilyn Monroe, Albert Einstein, and Napoleon Bonaparte have in
common - aside from a fondness for French pastry? They were all
left-handed, as were all of the candidates for the US presidency in 1992.
Are you curious to know if you're truly left-handed? Take the thoughtfully
provided test. For more interesting trivia regarding left-handers, some
myth-busting, and addresses for left-handed merchandise, go to the
Left-Handed Universe. And no, we won't include any left-handed compliments.

<P>
The question before you is, "Are you game?" The game in question is
Jumanji. This site serves as Sony's promotional Web page for the movie of
the same name, starring Robin Williams. Backstage information, cast info
with plenty of good graphics, and photos make it worth a visit. It even
allows you to play an online version of the game. It loads fairly quickly.
The free screensaver is also neat, but takes forever to retrieve.

the photos record two record-breaking firewalks. Whether you are a believer
or a skeptic, this site will provide more fuel for your fire. The design
suffers only from the limitations of being Netscape-centered, and from the
all too common practice of using backgrounds that make text difficult to
read. Blaze on over and burn some bandwidth.

Dear Boss: You're right. We're spending way too much company time at World
Village, which calls itself "a virtual community designed for the home
computing experience." But do you provide software reviews, online games,
humorous articles, interviews, shareware, kid stuff, and other entertaining
goodies?  World Village does. In fact, we have access to a members-only
region and to "Bald Guy's MultiMedia Site of the Week". We never received
even an invitation to your boardroom. Multimedia Cafe has the company
cafeteria beat. And what's our measly salary compared with the prizes we
can win there? We quit. If you need us, you can find us at World Village.

<P>
January 1, 2000 represents either another banal new year complete with new
hangover or a plague that will haunt computer programmers for days. The
Talk 2000 Forum deals with the approach of that year and the social and
personal implications that will arrival with it. The forum offers a
bi-monthly newsletter, "Let's Talk 2000", that details some of the plans
being crafted worldwide to celebrate the advent of the new millenium. The
Talk 2000 Forum Web site contains electronic conference rooms, FAQs, and
lists of resources - both Web and print - that concern themselves with the
effects of the crossover to the next thousand years. But doesn't anyone
realize the millenium really ends December 31, 2000?

<P>
The HMKES Movement page is a perfect example of how the Net encourages
exploring any personal fetish you fancy. The powerful key term "Hvor Mye
Koster En Skolisse?" in Norewegian means, "How much is one shoelace?", and
details shoelace philosophy to an exhausting extent. The translation of the
phrase in 14 different languages and the list of prices for just one lace
in a variety of places are the by-products of the philosophy that tying
your shoeslaces is really only he knotting of ONE lace. Yes, this simple
understanding has blossomed into a huge undertaking. Self-described as
"zany" and hilarious", it is amusing. Or should we say bemusing. Or
something. <A HREF="http://home.sol.no/edlund/hmkes/">"http://home.sol.no/edlund/hmkes/"</A>

Our intrepid netsurfers have uncovered another interactive frog

The tutorial combines text with 60 in-line color images and 17
QuickTime movies illustrating dissection procedures and internal
organs. Numerous clickable image maps provide interactive practice
and review without the risk of collapse from formaldehyde fumes.
This kit competes directly with Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory's
interactive frog dissection. The Virginian version is less
software-fussy, easier to use and contains scanned photos, whereas

Jordan Schwartz at the University of Washington has a WWW

through eclectic and academic
categories like Psychology, Space & Sundial Resources,
Dead Rock Stars and Mind Games. Also featured are links to The

<P>
The virtual town is a metaphor for a net resource directory
with links to hundreds of sites from an original text list of
31 major attractions (flavors?). Thank your lucky surf board
that the graphical interface is still "under construction;"
if your net connection is 14.4 or below you could
fall asleep waiting for some of the graphics to
load. However even so, we feel this is a "must see" site
for casual surfers and beginners on the World Wide Web.

You need Telnet and a Forms capable Mosaic to make it work

user has two windows, Web for graphics and user input, and a
Telnet client window for asynchronous output and conversation.
Players can move between rooms on different servers, and
anyone with a Web server can build on the MUD, using Perl, so
"features are easier to add than with ordinary MUDs." If

<B><A NAME="SS1">WIRED OPENS IMPRESSIVE HOTWIRED WEB SPACE</A></B>
<P>
The long anticipated Wired Magazine web space finaly went live this
week. Announced in the requisite breathless techno trendy prose
("HotWired is live and twitching, a product of the planet's real-time
nervous system,") it comes accross as a credibly well
edited Web-based BBS. The content roughly replicates the print magazine,
with the significant addition of the Piazza, where you can read or post to
threads and telnet to live forums and MOOs). In fact every feature has a
very nicely implemented mechanism for attaching discussion threads,
though to use this feature you must go through a Forms/E-Mail based
login and validation process (Windows users should use Netscape, Windows
Mosaic clients won't let you do this). Also worth checking out is
Renaissance 2.0, their art space.
<P>
The interface has a coherent techno-tribal look ("fresh, world-beat
colors", but we miss the beveled edges :). The labels and icons can be
somewhat cryptic and the whole thing could use a single text-based index
to make moving around easier. Mercifully, most of the menu images are
less then 20K, so casual browsing is not as painful as it could have
been. Lynx is actually better if you're after content. Overall the
technical design is well thought out and flawlessly executed, though it
bumps up against the inherent limitations of the medium. Let's face it,
Web based threads will never replace USENET. Skip the hype and the
flashy graphics and go for the content. <A HREF="http://www.hotwired.com/">"http://www.hotwired.com/"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="SS2">VISIT THE FUNNY BRITISH CATHOUSE</A></B>
<P>
Cathouse.org, a server with files and links to all things
televisional, has added the British Comedy Pages. Although new and
somewhat sparse, the site is home to the Britcomedy Digest, a new E-Zine
about - you guessed it - British comedy. Hot topics include the arrest
of Craig Charles (Lister on "Red Dwarf") for rape, whether "Brit" is an
offensive epithet, and a transcript of the rare one-time-only
performance for charity of "Blackadder, the Cavalier Years". There are
other bits and pieces, but the digest is the primary attraction.

<P>
<B><A NAME="SS3">WALL OF SHAME: NONLINEAR STORIES AND TIDBITS</A></B>
<P>
The Wall of Shame is described by its keeper, Dan Bornstein, as an
"attempt to characterize the erosion of our world by displaying true
stories and tidbits that are just too nonlinear." What he's trying to
say is he's put together a collection of mostly hilarious stories culled
from contributors and the press. This is "LOL" stuff, though some
articles smack of urban legend. Find out why the Texas House of
Representatives commended the Boston Strangler for unselfish service to
the community. Read what happens when you try to pay for a burrito with
a two-dollar bill at a restaurant whose manager thinks such currency
doesn't exist. It's even better than the Enquirer.

<P>
Say you're on walkabout in the Australian National Botanical Gardens and
you hear a "long, low drawn-out 'squelch'". Later, you hear a "rapid,
pulsing whistle 'cree-cree-cree-cree'". Hurriedly, you rush home and try
to find out what you heard. Naturally, you seek out Netsurfer Digest,
whose staff endeavors to bring you the latest, most complete frog
information available online. You quickly learn that the Gardens' WWW
server has a section devoted to its frogs. In jubilation, you offer us a
toast as you learn what you heard were an Eastern Froglet and a Whistling
Tree Frog. The server has other links as well, but at
Netsurfer, we're here for your complete amphibian needs.

<B><A NAME="SS5">MEET PEDRO, RACHEL, PUCK, AND THE REST OF THE REAL WORLD GANG</A></B>
<P>
Fans of "The Real World" (c'mon, admit it - you're one too) can sate
themselves with online Real World info. Housemate biographies, episode
synopses, and a bibliography of articles about the MTV series can be
found along with a Real World III drinking game guaranteed to make you
toss your cookies (sample: Puck tries to attract attention - one drink).
The latter portion of the Real World III synopses is a little screwy at
the moment - it looks like it was run through a Swedish translator - but
that should pass a little more quickly than Puck's lingering aroma.

<B><A NAME="SS6">THE INTERNET UNDERGROUND MUSIC ARCHIVE</A></B>
<P>
You've probably heard about those guys by now: cutting-edge music, cool
graphics. The Internet Underground Music Archive is a high-quality sound
library featuring over 220 unsigned bands, minor-label groups, and
major-label names. The airing of a recent National Public Radio story
has apparently heightened awareness of the site. Be advised that with
over 25,000 WWW accesses per day, you may have trouble connecting. Sound
capabilities are necessary to get the full effect.

<P>
Over 10,500 sayings have been compiled into a collection for your
browsing pleasure and E-Mail signature needs. The lines are catalogued
alphabetically, though there are a few lists by subject. The taglines
are searchable, and range from aphoristic to clever to sophomoric to
just plain dull - just like real life. <A HREF="http://www.brandonu.ca/~ennsnr/Tags/">"http://www.brandonu.ca/~ennsnr/Tags/"</A>

<P>
Want to show off your American football smarts? Want to do it legally?
Join a weekly NFL pool on WWW. You need a forms-capable browser for
now, though E-Mail submissions may be in the works. Send in your picks
by Sunday at noon ET, unless games are scheduled earlier in the week.
Point spreads are not used - just pick a winner in each game and rank
the games according to your confidence and strategy. No money is
accepted or won, but you can compete for everlasting fame - well, for a
week of fame, anyway. ParticipaNt rankings are kept on hand for each
week and the cumulative season. <A HREF="http://www.hal.com/~markg">"http://www.hal.com/~markg"</A>

<B><A NAME="SS9">SEND YOUR KIDS INTO SPACE</A></B>
<P>
And haven't we all wanted to do that at some point? Chris Rowan, a
sixth-grade teacher, takes his students into orbit once a month.
Actually, his class simulates a space shuttle launch, mission, and
recovery - all in the course of an eight-hour day. Five or so kids are
the "astronauts" in their permanent shuttle simulator, Columbia II, and
others make up ground-based teams: medical; navigation; and even PR.
When they launch a mission, other schools can monitor the progress via
Internet E-Mail messages sent by the PR team. Interested participants
could conduct their own missions or serve as auxiliary mission nodes to
Rowan's simulations, as some do now. Rowan also maintains a Listserv
dedicated to educational space simulation theory and practice. For nfo on
joining the Listserv, joining a mission, or starting your own space
program, E-Mail Rowan at "<B>chris@tenet.edu</B>" or visit his WWW site.

This well-organized University of Illinois site stores information from
the Center for Aquatic Ecology, the Center for Biodiversity, the Center
for Economic Entomology, and the Center for Wildlife Ecology. It features
survey reports, educational information, relevant publications, and a link
to the U.S. Geological Survey. Certainly worth a visit if you're in this

Rome Lab, the U.S. Air Force's "Super Lab for C3I Technology" (mil-speak
for Command, Control, Communication, and Intelligence) has a Web
server touting how defense tech can have commercial applications. Their
motto is "Where Visions Become Reality". Depending on your point of
view, there are either very eye-opening or very scary visions here, as well
as photos only the military-minded could love. A good directory will take
you directly to dozens of topics. There's also a Web Cam. Scariest quote:
"Language identification technology was transitioned to the NSA for
efficient categorization of intercept data." And they monitor who uses the
server. Gee, who would have guessed?

Mosaic users may have difficulties with this site, supposedly where you can
get information on new homes. However, it seems to be a construction zone
littered with tips on mortgages, what to watch out for when buying a home,
etc. The only available metro "New Homes Guide" of the planned 23 is for
Washington, D.C., and it crashed both old and new versions of Mosaic for
Windows. It's supposed to have a neat "clickable" D.C. map. Maybe we'll go
back when the walls are up, to see what they've built. You can peek through

Miller Genuine Draft is sponsoring this online space meant to evoke a
virtual tap room where you can discuss/access "music, fashion,
nightlife, art, sports, food and social issues around the country". This
grand plan has yet to be executed by what looks like a very experienced
team of journalists. They are looking for content, and plan to update the
site every month, which seems like an eternity by online standards. What
this site lacks in content, it more then makes up for in first-class
graphic design. Without a doubt, this is one of the most graphically
coherent and interesting sites out there. If their content is as good as
their graphic design this may turn out to be a neat place to hang out.

The masthead is patterned after a "tapa", an ancient cloth made from tree

aren't very large, and don't slow access much. As with so many sites today,
this one's still under construction so the content is a bit thin. There are
links to a few Hawaiian business, academic, and other sites. The visitors
info link consists of a bland travel brochure from the Hawaii Visitors
Bureau, as depressingly cheerful and lacking in usefulness as only a
government agency can make it. On the upside we learn that the State Fish
is the Humuhumunukunukuapua`a (wow!), the State Bird is the Nene, and each
island has an official flower with an equally euphonious apellation. Lots
of potential, not yet realized. <A HREF="http://www.hawaii.net/">"http://www.hawaii.net/"</A>

Earlier this month, America Online announced out of the blue that it
would start selling its member list to various direct marketers. This
created a minor furor among its membership base and even Congress,
in the august form of Rep. Edward J. Markey (D-Ma.), got into the act
with concerns about privacy. AOL head Steve Case had to hastily dispatch
a letter to AOL subscribers clarifying that: A) they will limit the info
they sell to addresses only; B) they will screen every mailing; and C) they
will make it easy to opt out (the keyword is MARKETING PREFS). Case
admitted that (timeless phrase alert) "mistakes were made" in handling
the announcement.

    The "Internet Software Guide - For the PC" from the publisher of "The
    Internet Letter", Jayne Levin, is a good little booklet packed into 27
    plastic bound pages. But it could be much better! It's a how-to and
    where-to book for new PC internet users and intends to help the
    beginner find, install, and use FREE internet navigation tools. Sadly,
    the number of factual mistakes may seriously slow the progress of
    those it is intended to help. On the plus side it recommends excellent
    software and includes over 100 "bookmark" references to interesting
    places to visit on the net. We reviewed version 1.0. It is available
    at $9.95 plus $2.95 shipping & handling, from: The Internet Letter,220

<B><A NAME="BS1">PRINCETON REPORT ON JAVA SECURITY: IS JAVA FUNDAMENTALLY INSECURE?</A></B>
<P>
In recent issues we've reported a number of security problems in Java and
Java implementations. The bugs and fixes are coming fast and furious, and
since security is a hot-button topic, the issue has attracted attention
even in the mainstream press. A recent paper by a Princeton University
computer science team received a lot of press for allegedly pointing out
that Java can't be made secure in its current incarnation. You can by read
the rather technical report, written for the professional programmer, and
judge for yourself. Our only quibble is that you can download it only in
Postscript or Adobe Acrobat formats.

<B><A NAME="BS3">LONG AWAITED NRC CRYPTOGRAPHY REPORT RELEASED</A></B>
<P>
Commissioned by Congress way back in 1993, this report on cryptographic
policy is likely to influence the ongoing national crypto debate. The full
text of the report has been placed online. To grossly oversimplify a large
document, the report found that "on balance, the advantages of more
widespread use of cryptography outweigh the disadvantages." The report
contains specific recommendations for policy and legislation that would
provide a balance between legitimate individual or commercial use and
national security and criminal law enforcement issues. It's a thoughtful
document which makes for interesting reading, not only for those who follow
the debate, but also those wishing to learn more about the topic.

The US Federal Trade Commission likened the operation they busted to an
electronic chain letter, in which people who invested $250 were told they
could get a 2,000% return. The FTC has won a court order freezing the
assets of Fortuna Alliance, which has allegedly pulled in $6 million in the
last seven months of operation. Apparently, the operators just transferred
$3.5 million to an account in Antigua. A court has ordered the company to
return the money to the US. We found the URL of the company, and it sure is
hard to believe anybody would fall for something as fishy sounding as this.
Their secret? Why, the "Explosive Fibonacci Sequence", of course.

The Explorer 3.0 Web browser, supposedly Microsoft's Netscape killer, is
now available for free download. Check the Web page for scads of new
features, notably ActiveX multimedia controls. There's no Java support just
yet, probably a major strategic mistake given the amount of developer
interest in that language. Along with Explorer, Microsoft is also releasing
NetMeeting, a groupware program which gives you real-time voice, data
communications, and application sharing over the Net. It looks pretty
spiffy. Finally, there's a bundle called Microsoft Internet Mail and News
1.0 (Beta 2), an entry into the crowded e-mail and news reader market.
Everything can be reached from the initial Microsoft URL, even an
irritatingly fawning review of the software from C|net.

satisfy your Olympic craving. All this through the wonders of satellite
technology. Qualcomm tracks a GPS receiver in the torch's chase car and
posts the result on maps of your favorite scale (national, city, street).
Totally useless, totally cool, and just right when those nightly Olympic

<P>
Back in NSD 2.13, we told you about a Delphic poll designed to predict
future global trends in the areas of society, science, war, environment,
economy, and others. In the first round, a set of consensus trends was
identified. Now, in round two, the exact time when these things will happen
will be predicted using the Delphic technique. There are a large number of
predictions here, some patently unpredictable (a major earthquake striking
California), others all too likely (civil war in Russia). The social and
economic trends identified in the first round tend to be rather
pessimistic. Is this a reflection of our state of mind or a valid
prediction of the future? Who knows. In any event, take the time to
participate, since bigger numbers give better results.

winning some prizes, ZooWorks will make the job easier." However, no
purchase is neccesary and you can download the beta of the program for
free. The program tracks and files each URL you visit and creates your own
local search index. For the contest, you visit various sites on the Net to
look for hidden pictures of animals. When you find an animal, you click on
it and answer a question. The correct answer takes you to another site.
There are 10 chains in the contest, which runs through June 30. Contest:

The most important question in education is no longer whether children are
learning readin', writin', and 'rithmetic. Now, judging by a new study, the
key to education is getting on the Web. The Children's Partnership, a
national research and action organization on children's issues, recently
issued a report called "America's Children and the Information Super
Highway: An Update". The study looked at how technological advances affect
children at home, in school, and in the community. Also provided is a
checklist, "Ten Steps to Success for Every Child," designed to help parents
and educators. Some of the statistics truly are amazing: 82% of high school
students from affluent homes have access to computers at home, compared
with 14% of poorer high school students. And 62% of schools with affluent
students have access to the Internet, compared to only 31% of schools with
students from poor families. <A HREF="http://www.koco.com/CP/report/">"http://www.koco.com/CP/report/"</A>

lament the onions, tomato, and lettuce that can't seem to decide if their
raw or cooked. We suspect their indecision might be due to some judiciously
used microwaves. Search the newsgroup for the many threads with "arch" in

Book Worms Bargainbot is a search agent that lets the bytes do the walking

including Macmillian Bookstores, Amazon.com, CompuBooks, Rutherford's, and
Books.com. Unfortunately, the agent is not too discerning, so searches can
return information on the book you're interested in, plus dozens of others
that happen to share the same word in the title. Supplying an author's name
does not help the situation (try tracking down James Gleick's "Genius").
That aside, if you'd rather shop at home than browse the musty aisles of
the local bookshop, and you know what you want, Bargainbot will help you
worm your way through the plethora of books available via the Web.

The tree of life may have found a perfect home on the Web. Housed at the
University of Arizona and elsewhere, the Tree of Life is a project designed
to present the evolutionary history of life. Wandering from the tree's root
to its innumerable branches, one can follow the evolution of species,
phyla, or any taxon. Each stop along the way offers an introduction to a
specific group of organisms, links to relevant sites on the Web, academic
references, and a discussion of evolutionary relationships. Currently the
Tree of Life numbers just 990 Web pages housed on 10 computers, leaving
plenty of work yet to be done and a good deal of the site under
construction. But, as the primary authors point out, it took 3,000,000,000
(that's billion) years to build the real thing.

to estimate the number of people who speak eac language. The information is
extensive and clickable maps allow you to pick a country and view info on
all native languages, even those that are extinct. Alternatively, there's
an alphabetical listing of languages. Fascinating.

<P>
The Ask an Astronaut home page offers access to the men and women who have
flown in space. The site offers a biography of and a letter from the
month's featured astronaut, and multimedia files. The raison-d'etre of the
whole shebang is the opportunity for all us ground-dwellers to ask the
ultrahigh flyers anything we want. Answers to selected questions will be
posted. <A HREF="http://www.nss.org/askastro/">"http://www.nss.org/askastro/"</A>

Wow! Join your host, Wendell the Worm, as he takes you on a wacky walk
through Worm World. This down-to-earth site delivers it all - exclusive
interviews with an earthworm, a leech, a flatworm, and more. Get your hands
dirty with information on worm bins and recycling. Peruse details of body
parts (cool), the worm art gallery, or a fun-filled worm arcade that's sure
to inspire a few yucks. Tapeworms never looked so friendly.

<P>
A good number of researchers bemoan what they see as a recent surge in
psuedo-science, bad science, or simply sloppy thinking. Classics of
Out(land)ish Anthropology, produced by two anthropology professors at
Lawrence University in Wisconsin, polices the Net for what they perceive as
egregious misrepresentations of anthropological fact. April's edition (the
only edition...) featured a critical review of Project Candide, a
three-week Web travelogue of East Africa, and Nissan Motors' Web site. It
finds both to be "full of outdated, colonialist ideas of Africa" and offers
links to alternate sites that focus on Kenya. The site links to whatever or
whomever might be under their critical gaze, so you can see for yourself
whether the ire is deserved.

with post-adoption depression, and obtaining general parental advice. Those

<B><A NAME="SS1">I SURFED IT MY WAY</A></B>
<P>
Customized Web services are the rage and Yahoo, one of the original Web
site roundups, has entered the fray with "My Yahoo". A simple and clear
login screen ushers you in. Smartly, it includes a user-definable hint
word for when you inevitably forget your password. After choosing which
topics you want to receive from ten broad categories like music,
recreation, sports and news, your summary page is assembled. You can
edit each section further and any of the topics you click on leads to a
list of other related pages. Our only gripe is the lack of a way back to
a personalized homepage other than a browser's "back" button, but that's
insignificant compared to the convenience of a personalized news page,
contacts page, and Internet bookmarks page. <A HREF="http://my.yahoo.com/">"http://my.yahoo.com/"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="SS2">BIOGRAPHY</A></B>
<P>
Fans of A&E's Biography will be pleased to learn that the creators of
the show have created a Web site along the same lines. More than an
Internet commercial for the TV show, the site fascinates in its own
right. One section contains the first chapters of several recently
published biographies and autobiographies, while another hosts a
Biography quiz and anagram game. Of particular interest is the large
database of biographical information on some of history's greatest
figures. A search engine and cross-referenced links provide short
synopses of the lives of those who have most influenced the way we
think, work, and live. This is a great and useful site, both in form and
in substance, and a worthy companion to the Biography series.

<B><A NAME="SS3">CHOOSE A VEGETABLE AND STICK BODY PARTS INTO IT</A></B>
<P>
The Virtual Mr. Spud Head site is a strange little Web page that revives
the spirit and tiptoes around the trademark of one of childhood's most
memorable toys, Mr. Potatohead, by allowing visitors to interactively
place graphical noses, eyes, and other body parts on a rasterized
vegetable face.  After selecting an appendage and clicking on an
appropriate (or inappropriate) location, the browser's window will
refresh with the digitally attached body part in place. Don't pass up
the opportunity to choose a new vegetable... the eggplant was our idea.

<B><A NAME="SS4">NY TIMES NEEDS NEW MOTTO</A></B>
<P>
The prestigious New York Times needs help. Famed for its "All the News
that's Fit to Print" slogan (and the reporting, we guess), the newspaper
wants a new slogan fit for their new Web site. The game: summarize, in
10 words or less, the news mission of the New York Times on the Web. A
panel of judges which include editors from the Times will select the
winning slogan. To enter the contest, e-mail your suggested slogan,
name, address and daytime phone number to <A HREF="mailto:slogan@nytimes.com">slogan@nytimes.com</A> by October
1, 1996. The prize: $100. <A HREF="http://www.nytimes.com/">"http://www.nytimes.com/"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="SS5">WALL O' FUN POSTS BIZARRE ADS AND PRODUCTS</A></B>
<P>
The Wall o' Fun is part of the "Shop! Information Services" (SIS), an
advertisement-free consumer news service directed at women. The Wall o'
Fun features monthly the funniest or eeriest products the site's authors
can locate, be it on the Web or elsewhere. Click on the issues links to
find it. An always humorous feature is the "Disturbing Product of the
Month" article, which has managed to dig up items as strange as designer
water for cats and dogs - in "tangy fish" or "crispy beef" flavors. The
"Home for Wayward Ads" section shines the harsh light of sarcasm at
sexist or just plain idiotic advertising. Other than the humor page, the
site overflows with helpful information designed to allow women to make
the most informed consumer choices possible when it comes to spending
their hard-earned buckage. <A HREF="http://www.sis.org/">"http://www.sis.org/"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="SS6">VOICE OF THE SHUTTLE FOR HUMANITIES RESEARCH</A></B>
<P>
Voice of the Shuttle, a humanities research Web site, is rather
esoteric.  (The name of the site stems from a quote by Aristotle.)
However, those who love to immerse themselves in the study of art,
archaeology, literature, and/or related lofty topics should be pleased
with this site. Clicking on the linguistics link, for example, will take
you to a page with links ranging from the Klingon Language Institute to
the Oxford University Language Centre.

<B><A NAME="SS7">INTEL INSIDE, OUTSIDE, UPSIDE DOWN</A></B>
<P>
This information site about Intel chips and products is not in any way
associated with Intel. It includes undocumented chip features,
productivity enhancements, and programming tricks, as well as excerpts
and pointers on programming articles. The site is mainly of interest to
those who write code for Intel processors. It also illustrates what
large companies do when they believe that their copyrights or trademarks
are being infringed.  <A HREF="http://www.x86.org/">"http://www.x86.org/"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="SS8">FAIR USE AND COPYRIGHTED MATERIAL</A></B>
<P>
Speaking of which, the answers are many and complicated, but this site
provides a large number of resources about the legal and non-legal use
of another's copyrighted materials. Great for legal research and insight
into the complexity of the idea of fair use, the site is sponsored by
the Council on Library Resources, FindLaw Internet Legal Resources, and
the Stanford University Libraries and Academic Information Resources.
<A HREF="http://fairuse.stanford.edu/">"http://fairuse.stanford.edu/"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="SS9">GRAVESTONES OF THE RICH AND FAMOUS</A></B>
<P>
Famous people just cannot be left alone, even when they're just a pile
of ash. Talk about your living dead. This site reveals a whole new
travel itinerary for the morbidly obsessed, with detailed guides to
finding sites (from highway turn-off to a plot's row number) of all your
favorites, including Liberace, Oscar Wilde, and Jim Morrison. Well
written biographies and genuine appreciation of the best burial grounds,
including a feature on New Orleans, make this surprisingly good fun.

<B><A NAME="SS10">TOWER OF RADIO POWER</A></B>
<P>
RadioTower holds great promise. It links to church, news, theater,
music, sports, and talk radio stations in North America and overseas.
Pick an AM or FM station and get a RealAudio stream of live real-time
radio. Problem is, many of the links lack the "Tune" button that starts
the download, so all you can do is visit that station's Web site.
Hopefully, you'll be able to listen to all the listed stations once bugs
have been worked out. Live streams on RadioTower are set at 14.4 or 28.8
kbps, so if you have an ISDN or network connection streams may sound
distorted. Even so, it's fun, and you'll hear radio you never otherwise
could without shortwave.  <A HREF="http://www.radiotower.com/">"http://www.radiotower.com/"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="SS11">AVWEB - PLANE AND SIMPLE</A></B>
<P>
Although it may sound like a hangout for audio-visual geeks, AVWeb is
actually a well-respected site for those of the aviation persuasion.
AVWeb features the latest in avionics, news, safety information,
weather, airmanship, systems and products - and that's certainly not
all. If you're a real aeronut, test your mettle with clever brainteasers
and check out the recommended vacation spots for pilot types. To enjoy
all of AVWeb, you'll need to register by filling out a simple form,
though there's no charge for access. <A HREF="http://www.avweb.com/">"http://www.avweb.com/"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="SS12">WHAT'S ON THE MENU?</A></B>
<P>
Want to know what's on the menu, how much it costs, and what credit
cards a restaurant accepts before leaving the comfort of your
EM-emitting computer monitor? You will. The DineNet Menus Online Web
site boasts a collection of over 1,900 restaurant menus from restaurants
spanning the United States.  Each restaurant's entry lists a short
description of the type of food, the type of plastic needed to purchase
said victuals, and a detailed menu describing the appetizers, main
dishes and, most importantly, the prices charged. A handy search utility
also allows netsurfers to cross-reference dining styles with restaurants
available in the city of choice. As this dining archive and others like
it grow, the answer to the burning question that has plagued all life
since the dawn of time ("Where are we going to eat?"), may be nothing
more than a mouse click away.  <A HREF="http://www.menusonline.com/">"http://www.menusonline.com/"</A>

<B><A NAME="SS13">VITAL VIRTUAL RESOURCE</A></B>
<P>
O'Reilly, publisher of those great computer books with the animals on
the cover, has produced a Net version of their "Dictionary of PC
Hardware and Data Communications Terms". Beautifully done, it contains
over 900 terms covering the Internet and TCP/IP, hardware, wireless
communications, data communication, APIs, LANs, WANs, and multimedia.
There are tips on how to construct a search and the ability to do a
wider, concept-based search as well. This is an essential bookmark for
everyone using a computer.  <A HREF="http://www.ora.com/reference/dictionary/">"http://www.ora.com/reference/dictionary/"</A>

<B><A NAME="SS14">A JURY OF WEB DESIGNER PEERS</A></B>
<P>
URLCheck is a bulletin board that lets Web designers get objective
feedback from their peers. To post a site for review, you must review
another site, and you must review a different site every 24 hours or the
link to your site is removed along with all reviews of it. Obviously,
this catch will keep you busy if you want feedback for longer than a
day. All reviews are based on a fillout form; most of the comments are
brief, probably due to the ill-conceived daily requirement. Many of the
sites reviewed here are personal pages. Racist, sexist, and pornographic
sites are not eligible for review. <A HREF="http://ohiocars.com/urlcheck/">"http://ohiocars.com/urlcheck/"</A>

Getting ready for a trip to California? Or maybe you're already there
and want to explore some different locales in the state. CoolSpots
California is a nicely designed and useful guide to historical sites and
monuments.  Also included are photographs of and information about what
the authors call "funky" spots. Check out the winners of the CoolSpot of

to the Queen Mary. <A HREF="http://www.coolspots.com/">"http://www.coolspots.com/"</A>

<B><A NAME="OT2">COVERING THE WIDE OPEN SPACES OF YELLOWSTONE</A></B>
<P>
The Yellowstone Journal is online with beautiful photos and many
articles covering all things wild and wonderful about the park. The park
covers over two million acres and the range of topics at the site does
the expanse justice. Read about geysers or the new grizzly bear research
project. Find out about fishing, wildflower viewing, or hiking. You can
also subscribe to the paper version, published five times a year. If you
want a taste of this bit of heaven, visit this site.

<B><A NAME="OT3">QTVR SEATTLE - VIRTUALLY NO GRUNGE</A></B>
<P>
VR Seattle bills itself as the largest collection of QuickTime VR (QTVR)
movies on the Web. Nicely arranged, including links for downloading the
plug-in, there are over 20 sites where QTVR panoramic movies were shot.
If you haven't experienced QTVR yet, this is a good place to start. You
can move around 360 degrees inside the movie by clicking and dragging,
which lets you look around much as you would if you were physically
standing there. It's the only way to fly. <A HREF="http://www.vrseattle.com/">"http://www.vrseattle.com/"</A>

<B><A NAME="OT4">BAHAMAS RESOURCE</A></B>
<P>
Depending on your clime, now's about the time to start planning for the
dread dead of winter, to dream of bonefishing in the Bahamas rather than
chilling your bones at home. Bahamas Accommodations and Travel resources
is nothing fancy, just a good wad of information on hotels, bonefishing
resorts, diving spots, travel agents, and the like in the Bahamas -
about everything you need to plan an escape to one of the country's 700
sunny islands. There's information for the major spots such as Nassau,
Grand Bahama, and Abaco as well as for the smaller outer islands. About
the only thing you won't find is just what the heck "goombay" means.

<P>
Cyberpuppy Software has gone whole hog and released PigMail, a Net
browser of sorts for kids. The kid-friendly software presents a map of
the world that appears to have the measles. Those red spots are cities
and buildings young Net-heads can zoom into. Once inside, PigMail can
link them to Web pages with city-specific information or, better yet,
link to home pages or e-mail addresses of like-minded kids. It's
essentially a visual, cyber pen pal club for kids. PigMail appears
promising, but is currently available only in beta for Macs and, truth
be told, there are just not that many PigMailians out there yet (unless
you consider somebody whose interests include C++ programming and oyster
shucking an appropriate pen pal for your kid). It's free at the
Cyberpuppy site and, with time and enough kids, should keep 'em busy
till the pigs come home.  <A HREF="http://www.cyberpuppy.com/pminfo.html">"http://www.cyberpuppy.com/pminfo.html"</A>

This is yet another site that attempts to tempt with a list of the top

OK, but they seem more interested in art than in substance in the
presentation of the site. However, the blatant copy of the Microsoft

Inexplicably, we screwed up the name of the creator of the Virtual

While I still go by the name 'Andrew Ryan,' Andrew Buhloone is certainly
one of the possibilites I will consider if and when I ever change my

<B><A NAME="SS1">THE JAVA WARS</A></B>
<P>
Sun Microsystem's Java has stormed the Net, as you might have heard. A
lesser known invasion was launched by Sun's lawyers, who sent missives to
registered owners of over 150 domains whose names contained the word
"java". Jon Batcheller's JAVAC site, used to discuss the Java and C
programming languages, was one of the targets. The site is now a "gripe
page" that records the status of the domain-name battle and offers selected
articles detailing the case, conciliatory comments from readers of the
page, and links to other domain-name fights. Curiously, the page concludes
with a long list of coffee (the drink) links despite a link to a letter
from JavaSoft's president saying that "Sun wouldn't take legal action
against anyone for using Java in its normal English connotations."
<A HREF="http://www.javac.com/">"http://www.javac.com/"</A>

<B><A NAME="SS2">PEOPLE - EVIL AND STUPID?</A></B>
<P>
The irony of this site is that it's brilliant, insightful, and very funny.
From debating the hypothesis that Man is inherently good (proof: welfare
states and pampered criminals), to fantastic examples of idiocy in the
media and society, this is full of good reading. The man who accidently set
himself on fire, the cat-loving recluse who was eaten by his felines after
he died, the clever links and anecdotal support of man's stupidity - it's
all engrossing and reveals a convincing dedication.

<B><A NAME="SS3">JAM SESSION</A></B>
<P>
With CU-SeeMe and the plethora of Internet phones, webheads need not leave
their chairs for social interaction. Now the Distributed Real-Time Groove
Network (DRGN) adds real-time interactive music jamming to the list of
activities you can perform in your underwear. DRGN software allows
disparate users active within a MOO or MUD to connect their midi
instruments to produce a single virtual performance. The DRGN page is
really just a placeholder that points to the Res Rocket Surfer (RRS) pages,
home of the first DRGN network. Sound complicated? Venture on to the
graphically rich and creatively designed Res Rocket site and check out the
samples (available in RealAudio, IWAVE, or WAV) and you'll be hooked. DRGN:

<B><A NAME="SS4">ARE YOU ALIVE? ONLY THIS SITE KNOWS FOR SURE</A></B>
<P>
Ours is a culture of celebrity, and from time to time who doesn't wonder
whether that certain person who captured our imagination long ago - like
Mikey, the Life cereal kid - is still alive? Meet the Dead People Server,
an alphabetic pageant of the famous and once-famous who have gone or will
go the way of all flesh. This site lets you know on which side of the
equation these now-out-of-the-spotlight celebrities reside. The logic
behind this limited trove of trivia has a simple, macabre appeal. Some
names are linked to sites devoted to the memory of the celebrities. Most
are unlinked, but disc jockeys, librarians, genealogists, and gossip
columnists may find this long and growing list useful. Some visitors may
find it as hard to face as a war memorial. <A HREF="http://www.scarletfire.com/dps/">"http://www.scarletfire.com/dps/"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="SS5">WWWVOICE YOUR OPINIONS AND OTHER ASSORTED NIFTINESS</A></B>
<P>
Put together "because we're nosey", or so the authors claim, wwwVOice is a
neat little site composed mainly in question-and-answer format. The
unwashed masses offer opinions on such pressing issues as "Will Microsoft's
browser replace Netscape" and "Do animated GIFs and scrolling text that
interfere with your mouse pointer's query of links, bother you?" These are
not easy questions (yeah, right), but the answers provided by our Net
brothers and sisters never fail to amuse. The site has other interesting
features, the best of which is "Bud Uggly Design", which treats us to a
"future" of staggeringly frightening Web page layouts. Try the wicked hard
Net trivia challenge. All in all, wwwORth the download time.

<B><A NAME="SS6">ONLINE PEZ MUSEUM</A></B>
<P>
When you're a kid, there simply isn't anything more exciting than eating
candy out of refillable plastic toys with strange and varied heads. Well,
maybe there is, but don't tell that to the creators of the Burlingame
Museum of Pez Memorabilia. Visitors to the site will undoubtedly be
fascinated by images of the gigantic collection of Pez figurines, but these
aren't the limits of the site's offering. There are also sections on what's
new in the Pez world, a Pez for-sale page, and a report and images from the
recent West Coast Pez Convention. A site to soothe the sweet tooth.

<B><A NAME="SS7">CAN'T SHUT THE DUCK UP</A></B>
<P>
Duckman, USA Network's caustic, abusive, ill-mannered, animated TV star,
has somehow garnered an opinion - or is that opinionated - column in Tap
Online's TV section. This "pet detective" brings the same wild humor that
entertains/offends viewers all over the US to the vast multimedia machine
that is the Internet with great success. The site will appeal most to
faithful viewers who tune in to Duckman Saturday nights, but anyone who
reads the column may become a convert to our hero the duck, and may find
that the weekly cartoon becomes necessary to fill the time between columns.

<P>
<B><A NAME="SS8">THE NON-LINEAR ADVENTURES OF A 20-YEAR-OLD ANTIHERO</A></B>
<P>
"This page is an example of what can happen when you have too much time on
your hands." So begins "George Has Lost His Mind", who has so much time
because he nearly lost his life in an alcohol-induced auto accident. As you
might expect, the pages lean toward introspection, but without as much
remorse as one might expect. George only hurt himself in the accident,
though, so perhaps he needs a bit more guilt. Still, this is an
entertaining read, with pages skillfully intertwined. The story doesn't
even hint of pretentiousness, which is always nice. You should visit before
George kills himself, which we don't think is too unlikely. Nice complement
to evil/stupid and alive/dead sites, don't ya think?

<B><A NAME="SS9">THE INTERESTING ADVENTURES OF MR. REIL</A></B>
<P>
By reading Ron Reil's home page and following the interesting links to
longer narratives, you can vicariously participate in his real-life
adventures. You can sail with Ron in the Caribbean, join him in looking for
gold in Alaska, and go mountaineering or to the West Indies. His adventures
continue and include teaching junior high school and raising a family. If
you have at least a 14.4 kbps modem and enjoy outdoor adventure, you'll
find this a rewarding site.

<P>
<B><A NAME="SS10">TEASE ON THE BRINK OF SLEAZE</A></B>
<P>
Remember sick-joke books? They're back. Many teens and pre-teens would like
the weird, sometimes scatological humor in Jadie's Warped Mind. To say its
humor is broad is an understatement. (For example, cracks about bodily
functions and parts abound.) Censors may point to this site as a prime
example of how the Web can corrupt your mind, and how frightfully easily a
self-publisher can become self-indulgent in public. But, as John Cougar
Mellencamp asked, ain't that America? Jadie forgoes bells and whistles for
balls and thistles. Who can guess the motivation behind this brazen misfit?
As Jadie warns: "Huggies are recommended."

<P>
<B><A NAME="SS11">SF FOR THE MASSES</A></B>
<P>
"Sci Fi Entertainment", part of the personal "Linger and Link" framed site,
offers news, reviews, and interviews with makers of speculative Hollywood
films. A recent tour turned up a visit with the writer and producer of the
SF blockbuster "Independence Day", a piece called "Be Afraid" with
background on "The Frighteners", Melissa J. Perenson's succinct preview of
digital video disk technology, and other goodies for movie fans. Web host
and writer Ed Flixman needs to work on navigation - it's often hard to find
your way back. Even so, the presentation is pretty neat.

<P>
<B><A NAME="SS12">PRO WRESTLING ONLINE MUSEUM</A></B>
<P>
The Liberaces of wrestling take the stage to reveal everything from their
real names to the grunting noises they make in the ring (a very special
RealAudio treat, especially Cactus Jack). This is a great site. From the
women in wrestling (like Mildred, who took on all the fellas and earned
more than any of them) to all the new wrestling sites (two new each week!),
this is great fun and very enlightening. No kidding. Sock it to 'em.

<B><A NAME="SS13">ABHINC MULTOS</A></B>
<P>
No, that's not a typo. Those are the first words of one of our favorite
songs, "American Pie" - in Latin. Accomplished by a Latin class at a
Wisconsin high school, this Web site features such old standbys as "Light
My Fire" (Come on baby, incende ignem meum), "Fire and Rain", and "When the
Saints Go Marching In". Memorize a verse and amuse your friends. One
warning: no keys to pronounciation are included, so if you have any friends
who do know Latin, be careful or they'll be laughing at you instead of with
you. <A HREF="http://www.execpc.com/~nexus/latin.html">"http://www.execpc.com/~nexus/latin.html"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="SS14">ADVERTISING ICONS FOR EITHER THE FAST OR THE TOTALLY COMMITTED</A></B>
<P>
The Museum of Advertising Icons is another interesting site that requires
either 56 kbps access or infinite patience. The front-door graphic is
nearly 100 kB in a page of 170 kB plus. If you do venture here, you can
view over 650 items from the history of advertising, beginning with a map
of the museum and moving on to each display of interest. You'll also get
valuable tips on collecting, storing, and displaying advertising icons.

<B><A NAME="OT1">CHILLING DISCOVERY</A></B>
<P>
It's a shocking concept, but once upon a time, instead of electronic
frontiers there were real frontiers replete with wonders and riches,
hardship and death. Web designer Rod Davidek of Aurora, Ontario, uses the
e-frontier to present "Arctic Dawn: The Journeys of Samuel Hearne", a tale
of the Canadian north nearly two centuries ago. Using Hearne's own account
of his explorations, Davidek has created a beautiful Web site that is spare
in glitz and rich in content. Hearne's narrative is woven via hypertext
with his observations of the local flora, fauna, and culture. While perhaps
lacking the fame of Roald Amundsen or the infamy of Sir John Franklin,
Hearne's tale of discovery is a small celebration of anyone who has stepped
willingly and passionately into the unknown. Davidek has established an
elegant outpost on the electronic frontier.

If you have any interest in the Crescent City, you should check out
Experience New Orleans. You can see photos from this past Mardi Gras, which
was broadcast over the Net, learn about the local Cities of the Dead (as
NSD has in the past), take a tour of Honey Island Swamp, or download the
recipe of the month. Even practicalities like how to orient yourself in a
flat city are covered. Peppered with fast-loading images and animated
icons, this site really serves up a gumbo-ya-ya of info.

<B><A NAME="OT3">RULE BRITANNIA.COM</A></B>
<P>
Britannia INternet is a phenomenally complete e-zine about (surprise!)
Great Britain. Net-anglophiles will find it to be a vast repository of
information on travel, entertainment, sports, and a plethora of interesting
topics dealing with the British Isles and their population. Some of the
topics covered include government, religion, science, and historical
locations. All in all, Brittania Internet magazine is a great place to
start plans for travel to the United Kingdom, and also for those simply
desiring a bit more information on one of the (formerly?) great powers of
the world. <A HREF="http://www.britannia.com/">"http://www.britannia.com/"</A>

<B><A NAME="OT4">WILDERNESS TOUR OF AUSTRALIA</A></B>
<P>
New Scientists has a lovely little new escape at its Planet Science site.
You must register (free) if you haven't already. The "ecotour" is an
overview of the beauty of Australian rainforests, lakes, dunes, tropics,
and mountains. Accurate, descriptive, and engaging, this would do well to
feature a few pictures beyond a brief map and a great taste of what's on.

<P>
Part of Prodigy's struggles against more successful rivals America Online
and CompuServe is an attempt to be cool with a community called STIM, a
Web-zine for those who dig deviant pop culture. Titles of some recent
features are enticing, such as "Brainwash 2000", "Waiting in line to Die:
Death at Disneyland", and "Signs of the Apocalypse". The offbeat graphics
and animations are great. STIM has plenty of content, but will this
well-staffed, ambitious, flashy jumble of a giant propel Prodigy to
prosperity? STIM has no idea - it's trying to figure out its purpose with
an advertiser's nightmare: "Every month, we pose the question 'What is
STIM?' and a member of our STIM family strives to answer it." Good luck.

It's a bird. It's a plane. It's a Canadian. It's a dog. We've no idea what
it actually is, but the Spacedog Web site should spin a few minutes of fun

John Faherty, a technology consultant for Digital Equipment, has fashioned
one of the most useful and technically impressive Web sites we've ever
stumbled upon. Forget "browser torture tests" - Faherty's Web Multimedia
Tour introduces and presents practically every extant Internet multimedia
format in the categories of Audio, Video, Animation, Virtual Reality, and
Person to Person (Internet phones, IRC, etc.). Each technology is explained
in detail with embedded examples and instruction on incorporation into your
own pages. Complete links to sites for product downloads or for more
detailed technical information round out the sections. If you've got a VRML
plug-in, be sure to take the 3-D version of the tour. Finish up with a
glance at the "What's new" in multimedia technologies and check out the
"Site of the week". Bookmark? For sure.

<P>
So, you've got a Mac and you're having trouble finding your place in the
universe. Perhaps you need some decent astronomy software. Decent is the
operative word; several high-end packages will set you back $100 or more.
Sienna Software offers Starry Night, a decent package, for a 10-day trial
period and a $28 registration fee thereafter. It doesn't have a bazillion
deep-sky objects, it won't search for planetary conjunctions for the next
three centuries, and it won't figure Mars' ephemeris for the year, but it
will give you a pretty good idea of what you'll see if you look at the sky
this eve - from any planet. Add an exceptionally friendly screen, a nifty
QuickTime movie generator, and a folder full of examples that show off the
program's capabilities and you've got a reasonably priced home planetarium
of sorts. How can you lose? At least you'll know what planet you're on.

<A NAME="SS1">NASA DIGITAL IMAGE TREASURE TROVE</A>
<P>
Photos from the manned space program, from Project Mercury
to the present, and Earth images from the latest missions are available
by FTP, Gopher or World Wide Web from Johnson Space Center's Image
Science Division. Several thousand photos and text files describing
them can be downloaded, but watch the size of the JPEG files. Some are
as large as 2 MB. Average image is 40K. We've been waiting years
for this. "<A HREF="ftp://images.jsc.nasa.gov">ftp://images.jsc.nasa.gov</A>"

<A NAME="SS2">MAKE A VIRTUAL VISIT TO THE MT. WILSON OBSERVATORY</A>
<P>
This world-famous observatory near Pasadena, California has a new WWW
site well worth visiting. In addition to the expected educational and
historical information, it features a 'Virtual Tour' designed to emulate
Mt. Wilson's real-life walking tour -- with the extra advantage that you
can go places not usually open to the public. New exhibits are added
frequently. Images of Jupiter's recent comet collision will be available
soon. "<A HREF="http://www.mtwilson.edu">http://www.mtwilson.edu</A>"
<P>
<A NAME="SS3">DIANA'S TEXTILES PAGE</A>
<P>
Right off the bat a great opening quote: "The eye that directs a needle
in the delicate meshes of embroidery will equally well bisect a star
with the spider web of the micrometer". The rest is knitaholics
nirvana. A short sample of links: The "KnitNet", Tvaandstickning,
Knitting Events, Dealing With Ends, You Know You're A Knitaholic
When..., Klein Bottle, Stitch Library, Floss Conversion Chart,
Historical Costuming FAQ, and inevitably more.

<A NAME="SS4">SOCIAL SCIENCE GOPHER SITE SERVES A VARIED FEAST OF INFO BYTES</A>
<P>
A good variety of social topics are available for exploration with Gopher
or WWW client software from the University of Michigan. A sampling
includes directories for employment, hunger, literacy, sexuality, U.S.
Social Security, consumer product and insurance information, along with
eight other topic areas. Interesting info.

<P>
<A NAME="SS5">WEATHER WEATHER EVERYWHERE, LITERALLY</A>
<P>
One of the oldest and most popular destinations on the net, the University
of Illinois' Weather Machine gopher site has been implemented as a
full-scale Environmental Information WWW server with many new options.
Called the Daily Planet, it not only links to Weather World, a collection
of over 170 continually updated images and over 600 archived surface maps,
satellite images and animations, but also to a page of multimedia
instructional modules that teach the basics of meteorology. For all you
closet weather buffs as well as folks just wondering what to wear tomorrow.
"<A HREF="http://atmos.uiuc.edu/">http://atmos.uiuc.edu/</A>"
<P>
<A NAME="SS6">FLORIDA WEATHER-WATCHING SITE: NOT A MICKEY-MOUSE OPERATION</A>
<P>
If you're worried about a hurricane destroying your Magic Kingdom vacation,
you might want to check out the new Web home page of the National Weather
Service in Tallahassee, Florida. From there, you can tap into local
meteorological and climatological data, as well as explore links to other
weather resources. The URL is: "<A HREF="http://thunder.met.fsu.edu/~nws">http://thunder.met.fsu.edu/~nws</A>"
<P>
<A NAME="SS7">YELLOW PAGES FOR THE WEB</A>
<P>
An MIT graduate student has developed the closest thing so far to Yellow
Pages on the World-Wide Web. Commercial Services on the Net currently
consists of an alphabetical list featuring 60-80% of the existing
commercial Web sites. You'll find everything ranging from biggies like
IBM and AT&T, to smaller businesses like The Sandal Dude. A search
capability and category breakdown are planned. (Internet Business
Report, July '94, p. 3). "<A HREF="http://tns-www.lcs.mit.edu/commerce.html">http://tns-www.lcs.mit.edu/commerce.html</A>"
<P>

<A NAME="SS8">PBS GOPHER STILL UNDER CONSTRUCTION</A>
<P>
The Public Broadcasting Service has launched a gopher server that will
primarily focus on online education in association with educational
programming. The Gopher itself is rather dull at the moment, despite a
planned link to Mr. Rogers Neighborhood, and we think PBS should upload
juicy video clips from Trials of Life, Blackadder, and Nova to liven up
the site. Lack of manpower and resources is cited for the dearth of
material. Volunteer anyone? What there is to be seen can now be reached
at: "<A HREF="gopher://gopher.pbs.org">gopher://gopher.pbs.org</A>"

<A NAME="OT1">PUB CRAWL IN DUBLIN</A>
<P>
So here you are bound for Dublin Ireland and already starting to
get thirsty. You could walk straight off the plane and into the
first pub you see, but hey, it might be the kind of place where
the keeper tends to change TV programs without prior notice.
Well, worry no more because czimmerm@dsg.cs.tcd.ie has put together
almost 17K worth of pub reviews (that's over 40 pubs and clubs)
which he himself has personally visited. It's candid, it's
thorough, and it's an entertaining read for real and virtual pub crawlers.

<A NAME="OT2">LITHUANIA: BOGS TO BOOKS</A>
<P>
According to its home page, "the main goal of this initiative is to
increase general awareness about Lithuania in the global networking
community." Goodness knows, they need it. A brief perusal turned up the
following: although the only natural resource found in Lithuania is
peat, they still have 100% literacy. Who'da thunk? Actually, as these
things go, the Lithuania WWW Info Service is fairly comprehensive. You
can even get a MIDI file of the national anthem.

cgi-bin scripts/programs. Many examples.

<A NAME="OS1">AOL FILLS IN COMET ACCESS VOID AS INTERNET GRIDLOCKS</A>
<P>
Pictures and information about Comet Shoemaker-Levy/9's crashes into
Jupiter were more accessible on AOL than on many Internet sites due to
the massive overloads of the WWW and FTP sites carrying this material.
AOL has a good selection accesible through their special '<U>COMET</U>' keyword
including OMNI and SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN software libraries.
<P>
<A NAME="OS2">COMPUSERVE'S VERSIONS OF THE COMET FILES</A>
<P>
Videos, GIF and Hubble Space Telescope images, and information files
related to the collision of Comet Shoemaker-Levy/9 with Jupiter can be
found in a special <U>GO COMET</U> download area online. Related discussion
can be found in the Astronomy Forum (<U>GO ASTROFORUM</U>). Both are part of
CompuServe's extended services.
<P>
<A NAME="OS3">COMPUSERVE OPENS CONSUMER ADVICE FORUM</A>
<P>
Learn how to avoid the latest rip-offs and scams, get information about
your consumer rights, and gather money-saving ideas in the CompuServe's
new Consumer Forum. One of the forum's sections, 'Ask David/FightBack'
lets the public ask questions of David Horowitz, who has produced his
syndicated U.S. television show and newspaper column 'Fight Back!' for
25 years. The extended service is reached at <U>GO CONFORUM</U>.

<P>
Those busy folks at the University of Minnesota are hard at work
creating a gopher server which runs on the Macintosh. GopherSurfer
1.0b8 is available in both Power Mac and 68K Mac versions. There
is the usual plethora of bug fixes as well as some enhancements to
access security. All the caveats of Beta software apply as usual.
Rummage around in the following directory:

<A NAME="SW2">EFFORT TO SUPPORT WWW UNDER PERL SEEKS COLLABORATORS</A>
<P>
Roy Fielding is directing an effort to develop a library of Perl4
packages which provides a simple and consistent programming interface to
the World-Wide Web. This library is being developed as a collaborative
effort to assist the further development of useful WWW clients and
tools. To this end he has just released libwww-perl 0.12 and is seeking
others to support the many protocols and also to provide better HTML
libraries. Subscribe to the mailing list <U>libwww-perl-request@ics.uci.edu</U>,
or look at "<A HREF="http://www.ics.uci.edu/WebSoft/libwww-perl/">http://www.ics.uci.edu/WebSoft/libwww-perl/</A>" for more info.
<P>
<A NAME="SW3">YET ANOTHER WWW INTERFACE FOR UNIX HACKERS: tkWWW 0.12 BETA</A>
<P>
Tk is an interpreted toolkit which allows one to build X11 applications
quickly and easily. tkWWW is a Tk interface to the World Wide Web.
tkWWW 0.12 beta is the current release. To run tkWWW you need
the tk and tcl packages, and the xli package for displaying images.
If you want to fool around with it ask <U>joe@mit.edu</U> how to get it.

<B><A NAME="BS1">CDA RULED UNCONSTITUTIONAL: RULING TEXT ON THE WEB</A></B>
<P>
"Any content-based regulation of the Internet, no matter how benign the
purpose, could burn the global village to roast the pig." So says Justice
Stewart Dalzell in an eloquent defense of free speech on the Internet as
part of a US District Court ruling which granted a preliminary injunction
against the enforcement of the Communications Decency Act (CDA). We highly
recommend reading this particular ruling, especially the "Conclusions of
Law" section, available at the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) site
below. It provides a great, readable overview of the issues that impact
freedom of speech at its limits in this country and of First Amendment
constitutional law. Even more is available at the plaintiffs' CIEC site.
Justice Dalzell goes on: "The Internet may fairly be regarded as a
never-ending worldwide conversation. The Government may not, through the
CDA, interrupt that conversation." The government has already announced its
intention to appeal the decision to the Supreme Court.

Internet newbies may wonder whence sprung all these cool/hot/moist site of
the day/week/millennium awards/sites/pages. Did they pop spontaneously into
existence or was there a creator-force behind them? The answer is Glenn
Davis, innovator of the "Cool Site" genre, and his latest and greatest is
called Project Cool. Along with lists of Web sites that meet the necessary
coolness level, Project Cool also offers "The Developer Zone", which all
Web developers should more than glance at. The section is essentially an
HTML tutorial for Web page designers from beginner to advanced, and boasts
a section on how to create low-bandwidth pages. This is very helpful
material from one of the Web's pioneers. <A HREF="http://www.projectcool.com/">"http://www.projectcool.com/"</A>

Is everyone out to get you? The folks at Parascope think they are.
Parascope is a collection of the bizarre, odd, and downright weird
conspiracies that governments and agencies around the world are planning to
dull, brainwash, and ultimately enslave the human race - and we're not
talking about daytime talk shows. The Kennedy assassination, the Loch Ness
monster, aliens among us and other such paranormal or evil phenomena are
among the topics covered at the site. On first examination, it's easy to
dismiss this site as mere fluff; however, the authors are quite serious and
dedicated to rooting out "information on the unexplained and
unexplainable." Just be careful. The covert government surveillance team
sitting in the white van outside your door is monitoring your every HTTP
access. <A HREF="http://www.parascope.com/index.htm">"http://www.parascope.com/index.htm"</A>

<P>
One of the joys of living in the San Francisco Bay area, aside from access
to great surfing beaches, is Phil Dirt's weekly "Surf's Up!" program on the
legendary Foothill College KFJC radio station. His newly reorganized site
almost overwhelms with its bounty of surf music lore. The May issue has
south-of-the-border esoterica in "Surf a la Mexicana", "Surf News" delivers
the latest on surf CD releases, while "Surf Heavies" reviews surf bands in
heavy radio rotation. In "Ask Mr. Dirt", Phil bandies surf minutiae with
his fans, and the "Chowabunga" section serves up a recipe for caramelized
brussels sprouts. Yum! Also absolutely not to be missed is the
encyclopedic, seven-part "What Is Surf Music?" series that began last July.
RealAudio files of Phil's weekly surf show should show up shortly. If
you're into surf, nothing else even comes close.

Compelling Web page? Well, you won't find fancy graphics here, nor Java,
and no Shockwave either. Come to the BingoZone to play (with your
forms-capable browser) live Bingo against other players on the Net. And
we're not talking just for fun, friends. Courtesy of friendly advertisers,
each game awards between $5 and $20. Registration is required, but play is
free. Games begin every 30 minutes mostly around the clock. A players' area
promising promotions and merchandise is empty now, but there's a forum with
players' comments and webmaster responses. This may be the ultimate model
of an Internet game - all the fun and excitement of a real-life event with
none of the social interaction. The site is attractively designed and,
admittedly, while Bingo isn't exactly challenging, playing for cash is a
kick. <A HREF="http://www.bingozone.com/TBC_home.htm">"http://www.bingozone.com/TBC_home.htm"</A>

What's hard on the outside, soft on the inside, and comes in more flavors
than you can possibly imagine? No, not Sly Stallone - it's Jelly Belly
jelly beans, of course, those small but potent delicacies that gained fame
in the '80s as Ronald Reagan's candy of choice. You can find out all about
them at Jelly Belly Online, a site loaded with information on the history
of Jelly Belly jelly beans. Participate in the Jelly Belly survey, and you
could receive a complimentary sampling of the tasty little treats (500
samples are given away each day). Take a tour of the factory. Be sure to
stop by the art gallery. And enjoy the melt-in-your-mouth recipes. Sweet!

Home Box Office hits the Net with a site worthy of its status as an

complete programming grid with search capability, features on individual
shows, contests, film reviews, and merchandise, to name just a few. There's
a spot for feedback and questions, and - uncharacteristically for a big
corporation - responses. Other featured shows include "Dennis Miller Live"
which offers transcripts of Miller's monologues, and "Taxicab Confessions"
which curiously presents both riders' secrets and historical photos of
taxis within the same section. The kids will love the "Tales From the
Crypt" area. <A HREF="http://www.hbo.com/">"http://www.hbo.com/"</A>

Tech Support Tales (TST) is not about morals but morons, those customers
and salespeople who just haven't quite gotten up to speed in the
Information Age. Each issue of TST ("The Publication Which Proves That
Stupidity Breeds Humor") features jokes and letters, but the heart and soul
are tales of true imbecility supplied by readers and fans. Examples range
from advice on what antenna might work best with a computer monitor to the
appropriate response upon seeing a Macintosh system bomb alert (clear the
house?). While the stories do afford an occasional giggle, they're not
likely to make you fall out of your chair unless you happen to be a tech
support type or a disgruntled customer. And, sadly, morons won't see the
humor in any of this. You gotta remember - no matter how long ago, we were
all there once ourselves. E-mail: <A HREF="mailto:tektales@aol.com">tektales@aol.com</A>

invest, the Web site features the plans for the trip and the film, the
T-shirts, the CD.... You get the idea. Dispatches from Anne Cushman, script

all, the pages here are packed with nice images and information, half-assed
attempts, and empty promises, all held together with a convoluted design.

If you're looking for yet another tie to bind you to your Mac, Knot may do
the trick. The aptly named shareware allows you to create color TIFFs and
animations of abstract knot designs. An accompanying manual leads you
through some of the more daunting characteristics of parametric equations,
but the friendly interface invites lots of pre-manual experimentation and
messing about. Knot will create knots for you and can create a simple
animation of your knot spinning. Knot can also handle more complex
animations of evolving knots, exploding knots, morphing knots, and whatnot.
To view the final products, you'll need software capable of displaying
24-bit TIFF files (JPEGView does nicely), and QuickTime for the animations.
The Knot site explains the program's capabilities and offers links to other
knotable sites on the Web. This is one piece of shareware that should tie
you up for hours of gainfully wasted time.

<B><A NAME="SS1">TIME, PORNOGRAPHY, AND THE FAILURE OF JOURNALISM</A></B>
<P>
A recent Time magazine cover story splashed cyberporn all over the front
page, featuring a recent study entitled "Marketing Pornography on the
Information Superhighway". The document was gleefully seized upon by
conservative special interest groups, and used to slam the Internet as
nothing more then a networked sewer. Donna Hoffman and Thomas Novak of
Project 2000, in addition to providing an excellent dissection of the
flawed study, have assembled the definitive set of documents on their
page devoted to this controversy. The other essential resource devoted
to this topic is an article on HotWired which, in its usual modest
opinion, "...destroys both story and study". We highly recommend that
you take a look at this particular media circus.

<B><A NAME="SS2">BE CONGRESS FOR A DAY</A></B>
<P>
UC-Berkeley's Center for Community Economic Research has created a slick
game that allows visitors to take Congress's place and attempt to balance
the American federal budget. Users increase or decrease government spending
in key economic areas, then receive a calculation of the resulting state of
the federal deficit and a description of the chaos they've created by
tinkering with economic concepts they know nothing about. Ignorance of
terms such as "leading economic indicators" and "deficit spending" is no
obstacle, as the site provides a short explanation of exactly what
disappears when you increase spending on space research while eliminating
the entire budget for the administration of justice. Most visitors will no
longer envy the President's, and Congress's, daunting task.

<P>
<B><A NAME="SS3">AVIATION AND AIRCRAFT</A></B>
<P>
The AirPage, a WWW site dedicated to showcasing the world's aircraft, is a
compendium of statistics, images, and weapons capabilities of military and
commercial aircraft. This site will provide information in abundance to
those interested in anything from aviation history to the specs of the
Harrier VTOL Jump Jet. In addition, the AirPage has links to other
aircraft-related resources, including manufacturers such as Boeing,
Lockheed, and Rockwell, the last of which is developing a new space station
with NASA. The site's a good layover for those interested in aviation or
for those who are just flying through.

<B><A NAME="SS4">COUNTDOWN TO DOOMSDAY 2000</A></B>
<P>
Clairvoyants, psychics, and assorted loons have often pointed to the year
2000 as the point when time, Earth, and everything we know will suffer some
kind of cataclysm. From a computer perspective, they may not be that far
off. When the the year 2000 begins, all kinds of havoc will be reaped on
information systems worldwide as they try to click over to the new date,
according to the Year 2000 Information Center. But all is not lost. The
Center provides simple tests to determine if your PC is 2000-friendly, and
offers links to several vendors who specialize in century-change
preparedness. The end of the world may not be nigh, but this may be a site
to check out for safety's sake.

<B><A NAME="SS5">"H"OW "T"O "M"AKE "L"OUSY HOME PAGES</A></B>
<P>
Jeffrey Glover has put into writing what we all know - at least
subconsciously: the blink attribute of Netscaped pages is the most annoying
thing in the universe since Pogs. Glover's page is the "Top Ten Ways to
Know If You Have a Sucky Home Page", and it's certain he isn't alone in
most of his complaints.  After all, why do people put those irritating "Men
at Work" pictures to denote that said page is under construction? Every
baboon knows that pretty much EVERY page on the WWW is currently under
construction, and will be until 20 minutes past Armageddon. In addition to
providing a valuable public service, Glover's page also contains bits of
common sense regarding the design and implementation of home pages. Visit
this page, or else. <A HREF="http://www.winternet.com/~jmg/topten.html">"http://www.winternet.com/~jmg/topten.html"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="SS6">THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN COOL ZONE</A></B>
<P>
The Cool Zone is a place of discussion, ideas, and the intersection of
cultural barriers and gateways. It's a place where people can view the soul
of African-American culture laid bare for all the world to see. It's a
place for African-Americans to view the history of the struggle for
equality, and to get to know the people and organizations that made success
possible. The Cool Zone will not coddle or candycoat the realities of life
as a minority, but it lets those directly affected know that they will have
a place in the future as the information superhighway grows and evolves.
The Cool Zone is all this, and much, much more, but above all, it's not a
place for the timid. <A HREF="http://drum.ncsc.org/~bowen/zone0.html">"http://drum.ncsc.org/~bowen/zone0.html"</A>

<B><A NAME="SS7">THE STORY OF THE TAROT</A></B>
<P>
It is said that storytelling is the heart of Tarot. Indeed, the story of
the Tarot cards themselves is quite engrossing, as evidenced by the many
resources on this site put together by dt king. This is one of those fun
eclectic sites which make Netsurfing so much fun and full of pleasant
surprises.  Want to take a correspondence course in the Tarot?  Find out
how here.  Need Tarot images for your web pages? Several decks await
you. Need to find a fortuneteller? Here is some sound advice. PC
Programs, newsletters, Tarot societies, all have links on this neat
page. There's even an Internet occult superstore. Lot's of links to
explore, both for casual browsers and serious Tarot students.

<B><A NAME="SS8">PAPYRUS ARCHIVE ON THE NET</A></B>
<P>
Egyptologists take note! Duke University's Special Collections Library
has made its collection of ancient papyri available to the masses on the
WWW.  Samples of the university's large collection are available as
GIFs. An online catalogue of Duke's collection is also located at this
site. This is an excellent source of information for anyone studying
ancient Egypt or the history of the written word, and kind of cool for
the rest of us. <A HREF="http://odyssey.lib.duke.edu/papyrus/">"http://odyssey.lib.duke.edu/papyrus/"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="SS9">X MARKS THE NET</A></B>
<P>
Generation X's been-there/jumped-off-that school of thought has been
concentrated into a Web page. The site, X Avenue, does not simply offer new
and interesting means of becoming street pizza, but also supplies
comprehensive (Xhaustive, one might say) links to the activities and
interests of today's Gen X crowd. There's an emphasis on the recreational
activities one tends to see in beverage commercials (skydiving, inline
skating, rock climbing, etc.), but the site also devotes considerable space
to safer entertainment, including some engaging trivia games, making it a
worthwhile browse for all. <A HREF="http://www.nicoh.com/the/x.html">"http://www.nicoh.com/the/x.html"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="SS10">IT HAD TO HAPPEN: A SEARCHABLE INDEX OF SEARCHABLE INDEXES</A></B>
<P>
At a site called the Internet Sleuth, you can do keyword searches for over
500 keyword search engines on the Net. You can search by word, string, Perl
regular expression, alphabetically, or by 37 different defined categories.
All of the links enable immediate searching or lead to documents containing
links to searchable interfaces. Keep in mind that many of the sites require
a forms-capable browser. <A HREF="http://www.charm.net/~ibc.sleuth/">"http://www.charm.net/~ibc.sleuth/"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="SS11">IF YOU LOVE E-MAIL, THIS IS FOR YOU</A></B>
<P>
The E-Mail Pen Pal Connection is a free educational service designed to
unite native English speakers with English students from around the world.
The Connection is sponsored by the Virtual English Language Center, an
online resource of materials, services, and products for those studying
English as a second or foreign language. The home page provides a form for
you to complete, and you must state your level of "English proficiency".
Levels range from Native to Advanced to Beginner - but, like, what about
Valley Girl talk, y'know? C'mo-on.

<B><A NAME="SS12">ASK DR. INTERNET</A></B>
<P>
Sponsored by Project Gutenberg, "Ask Dr. Internet" responds to Rick Gates'
"Internet Hunt". "Ask Dr. Internet" wants to address questions from both
newbies and more experienced users. Dr. Internet, represented by a group of
Project Gutenberg volunteers, will answer ten questions each month. The
group wants your questions (and answers if you know them) about any topic
of general interest to Internet users. mail:<A HREF="mailto:internet@jg.cso.uiuc.edu">internet@jg.cso.uiuc.edu</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="SS13">THINK BEFORE YOU ASK MR. BAD ADVICE</A></B>
<P>
So, you have a problem. If you want it to get worse, try asking Mr. Bad
Advice. Mr. Advice urges you to e-mail your problems to him - "and he'll
answer them as worst he can!" The columnist's home page includes an e-mail
address, and he promises that your questions will appear there, complete
with bad answers, of course. We should warn you before you click on the
link to his column: the answers (and questions) sound as if written by high
school boys who've watched "Animal House" too many times.

<B><A NAME="OT1">THE JERUSALEM MOSAIC</A></B>
<P>
If you've always wanted to visit Jerusalem, now's your chance to travel
inexpensively - at least virtually so. The Jerusalem Mosaic page at the
Hebrew University of Jerusalem adopts a primarily historical perspective,
as befits a city over 4,000 years old. Links to the song "Jerusalem of
Gold" and a view of Jerusalem from the sky anchor the welcome page, but
true fulfillment is found elsewhere. The different "gates" are links to
sub-pages full of wonderful sights - historic and contemporary - of people
and places. Unlike most geographic Web sites, this is not a what-to-do
list, but a what-it-is exposition. Even the inline tapestry-like graphics
are beautiful. <A HREF="http://www1.cc.huji.ac.il/jeru/">"http://www1.cc.huji.ac.il/jeru/"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="OT2">DO YOU KNOW THE WAY TO SAN JOSE?</A></B>
<P>
Will it be the Mariachi Festival along the Guadalupe River or the symphony
at the Center for the Arts? Maybe catch a hockey game at the arena or ride
a roller coaster at the amusement park? Where? It's San Jose, Calif., and
the San Jose Living page proves this city has a lot of justifiable hometown
pride, or at least a lot to offer. Scan through the events calender or
download the 3-D animation played at the start of every Sharks hockey game.
Current and thorough from kid's events to markets to cultural events, this
page is an unexpected winner in every way. <A HREF="http://www.acoates.com/sjliving">"http://www.acoates.com/sjliving"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="OT3">A NEW VIEW OF SINGAPORE</A></B>
<P>
"Singapore By The Back Door" is a charming and easy-to-navigate rest stop
on the Information Superhighway. The colorfully appealing photos
wonderfully blend the old with the new, and beyond them you'll find a
rather complete resource for Singapore recreation, business and economics,
and career opportunities, as well as links to other Asia-related sites.

<B><A NAME="OT4">BIG SKY COUNTRY</A></B>
<P>
If you need proof that the wild western sector of cyberspace has finally
been conquered, stop by "Peaks", a friendly online magazine featuring the
state of Montana and its inhabitants. It's a little quirky, with essays on
wolves and on TV violence, a prizewinning chili recipe, and a photo of the
Whitehall Homecoming Queen, but it's true to the independent spirit of the
western frontier. Other features include maps and weather, accommodations,
a "click tour", and more. This is not an all-out salute to the American
western frontier with log cabin graphics and hokey text. It's a well
organized site with sophisticated (if not trendy) visuals.

<B><A NAME="OT5">AROUND THE WORLD IN SIX MONTHS OR SO</A></B>

If you have any desire to relive your unfettered youth and wild,
unsupervised travels of yore, you might want to visit Luke's Hippy Dippy
World Trip Travelogue. Luke shares his seemingly endless - and sometimes
reckless - encounters as a young American abroad in Europe and southern
Asia. <A HREF="http://www.engr.scarolina.edu/~luker/trip/">"http://www.engr.scarolina.edu/~luker/trip/"</A>

<B><A NAME="OT6">TAKE A TRIP TO THAILAND</A></B>
<P>
Palm trees, warm weather, friendly people, an intriguing culture - Thailand
is one hot spot you should definitely include in your travel plans. Wonder
if phad thai, satay, and peanut sauce are as wildly popular there as they
are in the U.S.? General Thailand tourist information can be obtained at
the following sites:

<B><A NAME="BS1">NETSCAPE SSI 40 BIT ENCRYPTION CRACKED</A></B>
<P>
Netscape uses the Secure Socket Interface (SSI) to assure the security
of its transactions. Recently Hal Finney challenged the Net community to
crack a Netscape message exchange which used the weaker 40-bit key
allowed for export by the U.S. government. Damien Doligez found the key
after scanning little more than half the key space in eight days, though
admittedly running a program on several powerful parallel computers.
Netscape, caught in the web of silly U.S.  export policy, points out
that domestic software can support a range of stronger encryption
options, including RC4 128-bit keys which are considerably harder to
crack. Cold comfort for foreign users. Read all about it in a special
page we put together for our latest Netsurfer Focus issue:

<P>
Here in the States, the contraversies surrounding Harry Wu and Hillary
Clinton have colored perception of The Fourth World Conference On Women in
Huairou, China, about 35 miles north of Beijing. The official event is
covered by the Linkages page, but for more newsy coverage you should try
the comprehensive China site put together by James Miles, the BBC Hong Kong
correspondent. This is one of the best general resources for news about
China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Tibet. The high-quality links here seem to be
as numerous as the Chinese themselves, primarily newspapers, magazines, and
e-zines. There's also a generous sprinkling of other organizations, and
technical resources for reading Chinese on the Web. Linkages:

<P>
The international news powerhouse has just launched a new Web-based news
site that lives up to their reputation for bringing you all the news, all
the time. A front page brings you the usual menu of news categories, along
with current U.S. and international top stories. When we looked, NATO
planes were blowing up bits of Bosnia and right there was 1.68 MB of wing
camera footage of the attack in Quicktime format. Surf the Net and download
a war, real-time. Incongruously, right below the war pics was footage of
"Cuban rock iguanas at play". It must mean something, but hell if we know
what. Discreet icons near the bottom link you to sponsors' pages. Well
designed, packed with content, and reportedly getting 20,000 hits per hour.
News junkie nirvana.

Cool Site of the Day creator Glenn Davis has come up with a new award for

winner was selected by user vote from five nominees selected by Glenn. The
winner is: The Spot, "....the world's first episodic web site where you can
interact with the characters and effect their lives in a virtual hangout
that exists somewhere between fantasy and reality". You can find "The Spot"
as well as the runners up on the CSOTY site below. Really, Glenn, the

<P>
America loves halls of fame. We have one for baseball, we have one for
football - we probably have one for cheese somewhere. The only surprising
thing was that we did not have a Rock 'n Roll hall of fame until now. Well,
we did, but it was just on paper. Not surprisingly the brand spanking new
museum of kitchy Rock memorabilia has a Web site. Best reason to visit:
audio clips of numerous rock artists and groups, available in a variety of
formats. You can also win free
stuff (guitar watch with matching slip cover), share your treasured rock
moments, and check out the schedule of events. But for heaven's sake, why

Microsoft calls it the Word Prank Macro, which is definitely in the running

Marketing Flacks" contest. It's actually a clever virus hack which infects
Microsoft Word documents on both PCs and Macs. It does not appear to harm
any data. The press is having fun with it. You can get the official scoop
as well as some disinfection software from the official Microsoft Prank
Macro site. <A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/msoffice/prank.htm">"http://www.microsoft.com/msoffice/prank.htm"</A>

<P>
Albion Books, publisher of Virginia Shea's "Netiquette", has set up the
"Netiquette Center" on MSN. Netiquette, or Net etiquette, maps out socially
correct online behavior. At this here Web page, though, you'll find the
book's table of contents and the full text of Chapter Three, "Core Rules of
Netiquette". Be patient; each book page is a separate Web page. Information
on signing up for the Netiquette mailing list is also here. We suspect that
even if MSNers take Netiquette rules to heart - a BIG if - AOLers will
flame them anyway, just to let them know their place in the Net pecking
order. <A HREF="http://www.bookport.com/Albion/">"http://www.bookport.com/Albion/"</A>

<P>
After touring the many rooms of this gallery and reading some things to
read, you might get the impression that the 1990s genre of
Techno-Impressionism is being defined right before your very eyes. You
might also get the impression that some of the work of the
Techno-Impressionists does not look digital or computer generated at
all.  But then again, that's the beauty of it.

<B><A NAME="AO2">DEFINITELY NOT SATURDAY MORNING CARTOONS</A></B>
<P>
Here's a site to make Capitol Hill types - and teenage males - froth at the
mouth. Combine Japanese cartoon art with naughty pictures on the Net and
you get the Anime Picture Archive. Anime - the big-eyed artwork of Japanese
animation and comics - has attracted quite a following outside Japan. This
site offers loads of pictures from various anime series, some nasty, some
not. It also features a selection of fantasy illustrations, mostly from the
Elfquest series. It used to contain Disney characters. Suffice it to say
that when Aladdin and Jasmine rode their magic carpet, they really rode
their magic carpet.... <A HREF="http://www.lysator.liu.se:4711/">"http://www.lysator.liu.se:4711/"</A>

<B><A NAME="AO3">DIGITAL PHOTOGRAPHY '95</A></B>
<P>
This virtual gallery exhibits photographs selected for the exhibition by a
jury, a clue that the quality here might be better than average. Choosing
one of ten walls in the gallery's reception area reveals three images with
links to even higher resolution versions. The site aims to "extend the
connection between the artist and the viewer of the art", and a click on an
artist's name yields a self-portrait, a personal statement and, in some
cases, an explicative audio clip or link to the artist's home page. These
are the winners of the 1995 competition; the 1994 gallery is still online.

OK, so it's not quite the Louvre, but the U. of Maryland gallery does offer
some culturally rich collections for your online viewing pleasure. Stop by
to peruse traditional African sculpture; early Chinese ceramics; mid-20th
century Japanese prints; American social realist and regionalist work; U.S.
government-sponsored murals from the 1930s; and 20th century prints,
photographs, and paintings. New exhibits are added regularly.

As you might imagine from a self-proclaimed "symposium, exhibition,
resource and creation of the fine arts", this site features various
art-i-facts, including art publications, works of current artists, lists of
galleries, and other art, craft, and design-related sites. The main draw is
a zippy and nifty Netscaped slide show of featured features - wait for what
you want then dive right in. <A HREF="http://www.rain.org/~scultura/art.html">"http://www.rain.org/~scultura/art.html"</A>

<P>
With a Netscape-enhanced designer look, WorldCam showcases camera and film
resources. Link up to world film festival sites, motion picture studios,
film schools, and even a list of live Web video cameras. The screening room
contains humongous (typically several MB) clips from independent
productions and provides an opportunity to submit your own material. The
site holds plenty of promise but the design, while creative, is slow and
tough to comprehend. Try your hand at script writing by collaborating on
the "World's Largest First Draft" behind the Graffiti Screenplay link.

We've covered the Urban Desires e-zine before and it remains chic. Tres
chic. Tres, tres chic. This sophisticated cultural showcase may be the
Web's top hot spot for art, music, performance, and travel. It's the kind
of site that convinces bosses that moviegoers, photo buffs, connoisseurs,
and just about any other employee should never have access to the Web.
Chances are, you'll spend serious time here with your mind in other worlds,
not on your job. Urban Desires calls itself "an interactive magazine of
metropolitan passions". Cool.

from well placed correspondents, travel forums and contests, and daily
travel news updates. A fast connection and a crisp monitor will make you
glad you visited the impeccable photo gallery, especially if you like beach

please the escapist in you. Go for it. <A HREF="http://www.cntraveler.com/">"http://www.cntraveler.com/"</A>

<B><A NAME="BEZ3">JUST WHAT IS A NONCYCLOPEDIA?</A></B>
<P>
Here's an ideal fishing spot for anyone trolling for new realities (as if
one isn't enough). The Noncyclopedia of Cyberspace (NC) is "a summary of
realities that have been without substance - until they have been described
in a noncyclopedia." Bounce around the NC, and you'll encounter such
nuggets of enlightenment as semiotic particles, the lion of "existance",
and the instability of the letter "A". If it's all a bit much, keep in mind
that the NC is the product of Cybaria, "the largest non-existing
philosophical society of the netage". But if Cybaria doesn't exist, yet has
been mentioned in the NC, does that mean it then does have substance? Chew
on that for a while. Or not. <A HREF="http://www.ping.at/users/noc/">"http://www.ping.at/users/noc/"</A>

<B><A NAME="BEZ4">VANCOUVER'S BLOOD ALLEY</A></B>
<P>
Blood Alley is the Vancouver Echo's magazine of "pop culture, sex, death,
music and personal affirmation". It's a bit tame as e-zines go, which might
not be a bad thing as it's readable and makes sense. The mag offers a mix
of non-fiction, fiction, poetry, and reviews. The writing's a bit uneven -
flat here, engaging there, and kinda disturbing way over there. Music
reviews focus on local and alternative bands; witness the current issue's
list of ten reasons to blow off work and hit Lollapalooza '95. A few steps
down from Blood Alley you'll find the Echo's homepage and a collection of
columns by Randy Shore, Vancouver's answer to Dave Barry. It's worth the
wander. <A HREF="http://www.vannet.com/vanecho/magazine.htm">"http://www.vannet.com/vanecho/magazine.htm"</A>

Zoilus is an e-zine written by and geared for today's angst-ridden youth,
put together by students at Gathersburg High School in Maryland. Web
surfers are sure to experience bittersweet memories of their own high
school experiences as they read, as well as something they might not
expect: depth of character. The short stories and poems in Zoilus show a
maturity and perception that belies the stereotype of today's youth, namely
that they are Nintendo-playing, skateboard-riding, plaid-wearing snotty
brats with attention spans in the nanosecond range. If illumination is the
goal, Zoilus will provide.

Bill Arnett has already brought a bit of the heavens down to Earth through
his "Nine Planets" tour of the solar system (NSD #11). Venturing a bit
farther out in the universe, Arnett now brings us the Web Nebulae, a
collection of stunning astronomical photographs of nebulae - clouds of gas,
dust, or stars. Though the emphasis is on aesthetics, not science, Arnett's
pages offer basic information on each of the 25 or so objects featured, as
well as links to further images and to various observatories and
astronomical institutions around the world. The clean layout is anything
but nebulous and makes meandering through this small
part of the universe a joy. <A HREF="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/billa/twn/">"http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/billa/twn/"</A>

Aside from communications satellites and science fiction, not much money is

R&D gizmo to orbit and release it as a free-flyer. Researchers hope to
explore the possibility of manufacturing thin film materials in the vacuum
and microgravity of space. While Endeavour is scheduled to launch next
week, the WSF Information Center is already up. The site will offer
real-time updates during the mission, a chance to win a mission patch
carried on board Endeavour, and the opportunity to e-mail questions to WSF
scientists and the shuttle crew. <A HREF="http://www.svec.uh.edu/">"http://www.svec.uh.edu/"</A>

This sounded exciting, like an adventure game, in which you'd pretend to be an
archeologist and scout around a ficticious pharoah's tomb looking for who
knows what. However, we can only access it sporadically, and when we do,
the images take a while to chug in. Still, it's worth a try because the
concept's pretty spunky. The tomb is gorgeously rendered and is rich with
objects and murals. You choose your own route through the domain of the
dead. It sounds and looks great - in theory. It's a bit confusing without
explicit directions. Maybe wait for a rainy day for this one, but try it
sometime. <A HREF="http://www.mfet.com/katz/thetomb/thetomb.htm">"http://www.mfet.com/katz/thetomb/thetomb.htm"</A>

<P>
If you have a craving to publish your own Web pages, <I>The Web Page
Recipe Book</I> can help you cook up some very nice entrees Co-authors
Barrie Sosinsky and Elisabeth Parker focus on teaching those readers
relatively new to the world of the Web.

<P>
If you're a webmaster, advising you to get this book would be like
instructing Julia Child to memorize "The Joy of Cooking", but if your
goal is to self-publish on the Web without memorizing HTML coding and
Java, this guide should provide plenty of fodder. 

<P>
Appetite whetted? Then serve yourself from the bounty offered by the
authors.  They begin with an overview of the Web, its history and
components, then move to the "ingredients" of Web pages, including text,
graphics, links, and URLs. You'll learn how to create Web pages suitable
for individuals, small businesses, organizations, and even children.

<P>
Although the book starts out with the basics, the authors advance to
cover more complicated topics. Included, for example, are "sample meals"
for electronic resumes, photo albums, catalogues, and more.
You'll also discover how to post your Web pages on a Web server and
learn about Common Gateway Interface scripts, better known by the
initials CGI. The CD-ROM accompanying the book includes all the samples
(sorry, they're inedible), plus graphics, templates, and other
"aperatif" treats for use in whipping up your own creations.

<B><A NAME="SS1">NETSURFER TOOLS: NETSURFER DEBUTS ONLINE TECHNICAL E-ZINE</A></B>
<P>
As if we didn't have enough work around here already, we decided to
start up yet another e-zine. "Netsurfer Tools" is meant as a resource
for online technical professionals, such as webmasters, sysadmins,
content creators, and network managers. The format should be familiar,
while the contents will give you a plethora of tools and technical
pointers you can use in your career. Sprinkled throughout will be news
of various corporate goings on in the online industry and some neat
examples of online wizardry which we found interesting. Everyone on the
Netsurfer list will get the first few copies of this twice-monthly
e-zine. If you find it useful you can sign up for the mailing list
explicitly. Check it out. We think you will find it useful.

<P>
<B><A NAME="SS2">AT&T'S TERRIFIC TOUR OF YOUR TELEPHONE</A></B>
<P>
With their "Talking Power" pages, AT&T provides an entertaining and
educational tour through the telephone system, part of their multimedia
performance support systems. You can learn more about your phone line,
batteries, the central office, the U.S. telephone network, the anatomy of a
telephone call, and the training course itself. It's all part of the
impressive site that AT&T maintains. <A HREF="http://www.att.com/talkingpower/">"http://www.att.com/talkingpower/"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="SS3">MONTY PYTHON'S FLYING HOME PAGE</A></B>
<P>
Right, then. This is the somewhat official home page of that famous British
troupe of actors (and one American cartoonist) known as Monty Python's
Flying Circus. And while you're visiting these witty gents, you can catch
tidbits from their snappy TV series, hilarious movies, albums, and songs.
Biographies of the cast members and other links are also available. Not
quite as comprehensive, but worth it for fans who just can't get enough is
another page called the Holy Home Page of Antioch. MPFC:
<A HREF="http://www.iia.org/~rosenr1/python/">"http://www.iia.org/~rosenr1/python/"</A> Antioch:

<P>
<B><A NAME="SS4">ANOTHER HOME PAGE YOU CAN BLAME ON NETSCAPE</A></B>
<P>
Mark Thomas's Web site immediately assaults the visitor with flashing
screens of odd, unrelated statements, hinting at what follows. The first
few pages of this sequentially organized site feature numbered links to
something that would be best described as non sequitur poetry, except that
it's not really poetry, or maybe it is. Of all the links here, we liked "Oh
Yeah" the best, with "The Lord" a close second. Mark uses HTML 3.0 server
push technology to the limit, and the content will lead you to spend many
minutes or mere microseconds here, depending on your taste. Is the site
unique? We hope so. Nice buttons, though. <A HREF="http://anansi.panix.com/~sorabji">"http://anansi.panix.com/~sorabji"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="SS5"> THE INTERACTIVE SEINFELD APTITUDE TEST</A></B>
<P>
Now, this is what we call a fun site, if you like the NBC sitcom
"Seinfeld", that is. Although this is a promotional piece for a book of the
same title, you do get to answer 25 questions about Jerry, Cosmo, Elaine,
and George. You'll need a browser with forms capabilities to actually take
the quiz (do we still need to say this?). When you're done, you'll learn
your score and all the answers. So, are you "Master of Your Domain" or just
a "Wuss"? Give it a try. <A HREF="http://melville.books.com/scripts/mhh/sat.exe?">"http://melville.books.com/scripts/mhh/sat.exe?"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="SS6">RANDOMIZED POLITICAL SPEECHES</A></B>
<P>
"We must not be punished and instead should be forced to pay. (Applause.)
We should, we should work to help Russia, Ukraine and the education
deficit, and more of them. And I am ready to act every day." This quote
comes from a governmentspeak generator that randomizes actual speeches by
President Clinton and House Speaker Gingrich and regurgitates them every
ten minutes. Sometimes, Clinton sounds as if he's speaking just after
having inhaled. At the same site are links to the Marshall McLuhan
Quote-O-Rama, the Historical Speech Archive, and Nixon's speeches in .wav
format. <A HREF="http://www.webcorp.com/polibabble.htm">"http://www.webcorp.com/polibabble.htm"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="SS7">CECIL ADAMS ARCHIVED BY ARTICLE</A></B>
<P>
Ever wonder where the term "shortstop" comes from? Or maybe spent a
sleepless night worrying about whether cow-tipping or bizarre sexual
activities like gerbil stuffing really do go on? Cecil Adams puts your mind
at ease. The author of the syndicated Straight Dope column dedicates
himself to seeking the truth behind these and other so-called urban myths.
Early in Netsurfer's existence, we covered a Web page that archives Cecil's
columns by date; this one lists his answers by topic. Either way, it's good
and good for you.
By topic: <A HREF="http://www.teleport.com/~basehead/cecil/cecil.html">"http://www.teleport.com/~basehead/cecil/cecil.html"</A>

<P>
<B><A NAME="SS8">THE COCA COLA SITE</A></B>
<P>
Unless this is your first visit to this planet, you're probably aware that
the Cola Wars have escalated to full-scale confrontation in the past
decade. Each major beverage company has tried - very, very hard - to
convince the world that their product will turn the consumer into a
world-class cool sex deity. Coca Cola has launched another salvo with a
site on the WWW. The nostalgic, pulp-fiction look brings a wealth of
information on subjects ranging from the company's corporate profile to the
history of the world-famous drink. The site's outer space motif is a tad
wearisome, and the graphics and AV sections are still under construction,
but all in all, it's a reasonably cool site, if you can get past the
shameless marketing of it all. <A HREF="http://www.cocacola.com">"http://www.cocacola.com"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="SS9">HERBS, ASTROLOGY, AND CHEATIN' HEARTS</A></B>
<P>
Tired of mastering your destiny? Wish there were some way to divine your
future from the stars, the moon, and other celestial objects while surfing
the Net? The Herbs and Astrology Emporium is here for you. We have forseen
it. At first glance, this site seems chock-full of hokey paranormal flotsam
and jetsam, but on further inquiry, one finds not all of the links on that
page are to commercial, UFO-sighting, personality-profile-hawking loons.
Some links are entertaining, others may be useful. The link to ENLOW, found
on the Spirit Web Page, has a strange collection of private investigation
tips, including the tell-tale signs of a wayward spouse.

<B><A NAME="SS10">CALLING ALL DOCTORS</A></B>
<P>
Suppose you want to find a pediatrician who attended UCLA, charges no more
than the average for your area, and - hey, why not - resembles Dr. Kildare.
Well, we can't promise you'll be able to locate Richard Chamberlain, but if
you live in the United States, MedSearch America's Physician Referral
Service, still under construction, will be able to help you find doctors
according to criteria such as specialty, certification, years in
practice,education, location, and insurance accepted. No charge is planned
for the service, and some physicians will be available for an initial
e-mail consultation. If you're a physician,
dentist, surgeon, or other private practice specialist, and you're
interested in becoming an option, log on now to sign up.
<A HREF="http://www.medsearch.com/pro">"http://www.medsearch.com/pro"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="SS11">THIS JUST IN: CBS'S "UP TO THE MINUTE NEWS"</A></B>
<P>
Despite its promising title, "Up to the Minute News" is not exactly the
latest-breaking weather, news, and sports reports. There are no clips of
courtroom antics. No bombing updates. What it does provide is a collection
of daily features on space, the Internet, CD-ROMs, women's medicine,
parenting, and movies. Reportedly, the same information is broadcast from
2:00 a.m. to 6:00 a.m. on your local CBS station, rather early for us. From
here, you can also jump to CBS's Eye on the Net, with the latest on "The
Late Show" (Letterman), "The Late, Late Show" (Snyder), upcoming
movies-of-the-week, and more. No news about Connie and Dan though.
<A HREF="http://adware.com/uttm/welcome.html">"http://adware.com/uttm/welcome.html"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="SS12">THERE'S NO BUSINESS LIKE MR. SHOWBIZ</A></B>
<P>
If you're one of those who love to know the latest about the greatest, this
is the Web site for you. The Mr. Showbiz home page gives you the chance to
glean knowledge about celebrities, entertainment industry trends and
gossip, films, music, TV shows, and more. You can check out a movie review
(debating about seeing Meg Ryan and Kevin Kline in the new film "French
Kiss"? Mr. Showbiz's reviewer says it's "modestly pleasant"), get the scoop
on summer films, and even read what appears to be an online soap
opera/pseudo-soapy-novel. <A HREF="http://web3.starwave.com/showbiz/">"http://web3.starwave.com/showbiz/"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="SS13">THE CARTER CENTER, AS IN PRESIDENT JIMMY</A></B>
<P>
Based in Atlanta, Georgia, the Carter Center, a public policy institute,
now has its own home page. The institute was founded by the former
President and his wife, Rosalynn, in 1982, with a multitude of goals,
including "fighting disease, hunger, poverty, conflict, and oppression
through collaborative initiatives in the areas of democratization and
development, global health, and urban revitalization." Among the links
available from the Carter Center pages are policy statements and reports by
President Carter on political topics such as the Sudan and Haiti.

<P>
<B><A NAME="SS14">THE TALE OF A DUDE AND HIS DOUBLE</A></B>
<P>
Maybe it's happened to you. Someone says, "Hey, you look just like...."
Self-proclaimed artist and "web weaver" Jeff Gates has had that Twilight
Zone experience - in addition to same-name complications - so many times
that he decided it (and he) was worthy of a home page. After you read about
his early years (and a roommate named Rick Gates), click on the link ending
"in later years, my name and looks would lead to others..." to discover the
trials and tribulations caused by resembling someone named Bruce and having
the same last name as Bill Gates (Microsoft honcho), Robert Gates (CIA
honcho), and Darryl Gates (L.A.P.D. honcho).

<B><A NAME="OT1">THE NATURAL BEAUTY OF WANAKA, N.Z.</A></B>
<P>
Wanaka, New Zealand, has a home page with information on the area it
occupies, known as the Southern Alps. It has info on getting there,
activities, attractions, skiing, accommodations, and a photo gallery. After
viewing their information and the scenic pictures, you may just be enticed
to plan a visit. The site is well done and gives info on a wide variety
local activities for all types of interests, though outdoorsy types would
probably get the most out of a visit. <A HREF="http://www3.waikato.ac.nz/wanaka/">"http://www3.waikato.ac.nz/wanaka/"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="OT2">CANADIAN CONTENT</A></B>
<P>
CultureNet, a service running out of the University of Calgary,
impressively attempts to be the gateway to the rich and varied culture of
the Great White North. This well constructed site takes you across the
entire spectrum of Canadian art and culture, ranging from the world-famous
Stratford Festival (Shakespeare) to MuchMusic, Canada's answer to MTV.
There's also a fast-growing multimedia section and extensive links to other
cultural sites in the realms of dance, film, and music. If you don't know
art, but you know what you like - or even if you do know art - check out
this site. <A HREF="http://www.culturenet.ucalgary.ca">"http://www.culturenet.ucalgary.ca"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="OT3">NETWEB BERMUDA</A></B>
<P>
If you're dreaming of pink sandy beaches, quaint pastel houses, and clear
blue waters, be sure to stop by NetWeb Bermuda, a site that is just as
colorful and proper as the island it represents. The front end of NetWeb
Bermuda features a small sampling of travel information and diving
opportunities. You'll have to dig deeper within the "Related Sites" area to
find specifics about the island's history, politics, business regulations,
and a whole lot more. <A HREF="http://www.bermuda.com">"http://www.bermuda.com"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="OT4">MEXICO TRAVEL NET</A></B>
<P>
Like most travel sites, there's not quite enough information here to plan
your entire Mexican vacation, but enough to get you to start thinking about
it. You'll find a list of selected hotels, destinations, travel packages
and a map of Mexico. More could be done here, especially with a photo or
three, but as organizational aid, the site works as is.

<I>The best places to netsurf this week</I>
<P>
<B><A NAME="SS1">SANTA SITES SUCK UP</A></B>
<P>
Gifts. We want lots of gifts this year and let's face it, our naughty/nice
ratio could be better. That's why we thought we'd suck up to Santa in a
major way and give you this mini collection of the best and brightest Santa
sites. Visit them and put in a good word for us. Enjoy.
<P>
<B><A NAME="SS2">SAINT SANTA: CHRISTMAS IN CYBERSPACE</A></B>
<P>
It all started with St. Nicholas, so you might as well begin at the source.
This site, put up by the St. Nicholas Society is by far the neatest of the
bunch. Excellent graphic design complements visual treats such as Santa's
coat of arms, his signature, his medal, and a picture gallery. There's even
a CD-ROM. Spiritual, enlightening, and beautiful. Don't miss it.
<A HREF="http://193.65.230.1/mp/rec/santa/santa.htm">"http://193.65.230.1/mp/rec/santa/santa.htm"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="SS3">MAINSTREAM SANTA: CLAUS.COM</A></B>
<P>
A nice mainstream site with good design and cool content. What's your entry
in the Naughty or Nice list? Just what is the sinister Legend of the
Pickle? Graphics, history, calendar, recipies. The best of the rest.
<A HREF="http://www.claus.com">"http://www.claus.com"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="SS4">SANTA INC.: DOWNSIZING, RESTRUCTURING, AND ROUND TOP, TEXAS</A></B>
<P>
The latest report from the (funny) business rumor mill. Wall Street Journal
would be proud to run this piece and you should run to read it. And by the
way, CAN polar bears tell the difference between elves and seals? Anybody?
<A HREF="http://www.rtis.com/reg/roundtop/santa.htm">"http://www.rtis.com/reg/roundtop/santa.htm"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="SS5">SANTA TOY: THIS YEAR'S COOLEST TOY</A></B>
<P>
Well, what is it? Here's what your netsurfing peers think: "Lots of really
hot pizza. A new Lamborghini Diablo. Power Ranger punching bag. Fantastic
nails. A BIG HUGE jet. Studly Bobby doll". Add your own. Read your kids'
choice. Take out second mortgage. <A HREF="http://www.cris.com/~santa/cool.html">"http://www.cris.com/~santa/cool.html"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="SS6">SANTA SOFTWARE: TRACKING SANTA</A></B>
<P>
Cool, entertaining, and utterly usless. Who could think of a more perfect
gift for the techno-geek in your life? See where he is on the map or via
satellite view. Hear Santa talk, check his progress, add your own sounds.
Holiday hackware at its best, for Windows.
<A HREF="http://www.cyberhighway.net/~citius/santa.html">"http://www.cyberhighway.net/~citius/santa.html"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="SS7">SANTA GIMMICKS: SANTA CLAUS GOES CYBER</A></B>
<P>
You've got your cool 3-D spinning snowflake on the home page, and a nice
threaded forum with the topic of "All I want for Christmas is...". A
topical technical trip. <A HREF="http://www.kriskringle.com/">"http://www.kriskringle.com/"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="SS8">SANTA FOR THE SNOW IMPAIRED: SANTA ON BEACH PATROL</A></B>
<P>
Sand, surf, and Santa. It's a small, wet joke, but still....
<A HREF="http://www.clark.net/pub/stroh/orders.htm">"http://www.clark.net/pub/stroh/orders.htm"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="SS9">CHEEZY SPOT</A></B>
<P>
"What makes grown men cry and little kids behave?" Fertnel Snack products,
of course. This tasty site has its tongue and cheeze firmly in cheek. Ever
wonder just how many insect parts are allowed by law in your cheeze product
snackfood? Well, we're not telling. At Fertnel they have a vision: "It's
using up the environment now, before it's all gone." You're gonna love 'em
and their cheezy products. Be sure to check out the Industral Accident
Corner. This is hilarious.
<A HREF="http://www.fertnel.com/">"http://www.fertnel.com/"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="SS10">I'M SORRY I KILLED YOUR DOG</A></B>
<P>
If you've ever had to say those words, you'll appreciate the Evil Younger
Brother Excuse Generator. With a few simple vocabulary inputs from you, the
mad geniuses at Dr. Fellowbug's lab will create a complete excuse for use
in case you happened to have slept with your best friend's spouse, have
burned down someone's house, have missed your editor's deadline, or have
done a number of other things. It works like those Mad Lib pads. Remember
them? <A HREF="http://www.dtd.com/excuse/">"http://www.dtd.com/excuse/"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="SS11">YOUR HOST, SPACE GHOST</A></B>
<P>
Space Ghost is likely the best superhero/talk show host on TV, and if
you're going to visit his Ghost Planet, make sure you have plenty of time.
This is a huge site. You can pick up your favorite Space Ghost Coast to
Coast memorabilia at the Quik Stoppe, or have submit a tape to be played in
the Locust Club. Clips from the show can be viewed by those with QuickTime
capabilities. Unless you're just stubborn or have a lot of time on your
hands, do NOT take the mine shaft!
<A HREF="http://www.biggun.com/SpaceGhost/">"http://www.biggun.com/SpaceGhost/"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="SS12">HOTWIRED'S ALTERNATIVE SPORTS</A></B>
<P>
HotWired has added a new channel dedicated to alternative,
epinephrine-boosting sports. If your interests include climbing, rafting,
biking, surfing, or ultimate frisbee, check out Adrenaline on HotWired's
homepage. you'll find slick graphics (though hard to tell what's a live
link and what's window dressing), news bites on recent exploits,
first-person blurbs and photos, and a database called Core that users
update with insider info on local top-notch sites along with a words of
wisdom on how to tackle it, the hazards, and the places to unwind and
refuel afterwards. There's even space for bragging.
<A HREF="http://www.hotwired.com/adrenaline/">"http://www.hotwired.com/adrenaline/"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="SS13">TOO SICK NOT TO LOVE</A></B>
<P>
The 1990s' fads of body piercing and netsurfing get combined in this
twisted little game called Piercing Mildred, in which you get to apply
multiple body modifications to a character of your choice. You start with
enough "money" for several holes or self-designed scars, placed where on
the anatomy you wish. Of course, you also have to pay for the antibiotic
ointment when an infection crops up. Get even with your enemies, win cheap
prizes, and earn a place in the weekly Freak Show. A must-see for the
weirdo in us all. <A HREF="http://streams.com/pierce/">"http://streams.com/pierce/"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="SS14">HEY, HEY, IT'S THE MONKEES</A></B>
<P>
Riding the wave of retro that has swept North America - exemplified by the
cultural icons, the Monkees. The site's a veritable shrine to the band,
with biographical info on band members, sound clips from the albums, and
lyrics to nearly every song. There are also the requisite FAQs, addresses
of the band members (both snail and e-mail), and the most apocalyptic rumor
to hit our planet in years: there may be a Monkees movie. It's an odd sign
of things to come when the four horsemen of the apocalypse are named
Mickey, Mike, Peter, and Davy.  <A HREF="http://www.primenet.com/~flex/monkees.html">"http://www.primenet.com/~flex/monkees.html"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="SS15">RETURN TO "THE OUTER LIMITS"</A></B>
<P>
It was the 1960s. Suddenly, on your television set appeared a show unlike
any other (except maybe "The Twilight Zone"). It was "The Outer Limits",
featuring monsters and aliens whose sole purpose was to terrify and take
over unsuspecting Earthlings such as yourself. Even if you didn't watch it
back then, you can't help but admire the show's cool plots and funky, if
not funny, creatures. This site pays homage to the show with a historical
perspective, a guide to episodes, selected pictures, and sound effects.
More retro. <A HREF="http://www.webzone1.co.uk/www/brendan/outer.htm">"http://www.webzone1.co.uk/www/brendan/outer.htm"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="SS16">TODAY PAGE OFFERS NIFTY DAILY FACTLETS</A></B>
<P>
Ari's Today Page will please those who love collecting trivia with which to
surprise (or bore) their friends. You can check out the number of days
until Christmas and Chanukah, learn about historical events that happened
on that day (how could you have lived so long without knowing that December
4, 1915, brought forth the first edition of Chase's Annual Events), and
link to a news summary from Reuters. Other goodies include links to a space
calendar, a cool site of the day, an astronomy picture of the day, and the
cool word of the day.
<A HREF="http://www.uta.fi/~blarku/today.html">"http://www.uta.fi/~blarku/today.html"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="SS17">HEED THE HEADLESS</A></B>
<P>
Not to be confused with the Way of the Exploding Head (NSD 1.35), the
Headless Way presents the road to self-understanding pioneered by English
philosopher and workshop leader Douglas Harding. Seems, years ago, Harding
realized that when he looked around he could see the world, his arms, his
legs, his torso - everything but his head. He had "lost a head and gained a
world." He has since developed exercises to help others discover what and
who they are at their center, all based on the Headless Way. New Age, no
doubt, but kind of fun too. The only questions is: what about those of us
who can see the tips of their noses?
<A HREF="http://huizen.dds.nl/~ramsay/headless.htm">"http://huizen.dds.nl/~ramsay/headless.htm"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="SS18">AUTOSITE OUTTA SIGHT</A></B>
<P>
Automotive Information Center's (AIC) AutoSite proves to be a great pit
stop for car owners and buyers. AIC claims the site carries 24,000 pages of
resourcels covering every make of car on the US market, and you have to
believe them. Useful bays include a library of auto-safety and consumer
advice; info on car clubs; repair info and hints; and wholesale and retail
book values of used cars and trucks. AutoSite gleams with a Simonized shine
if you're in the market for a new car. You can grab detailed info on any
model; compare two models' features; look up dealer prices and MSRPs; and
generate a final cost for the car and package you want. Complete access
requires a "Passport" costing $4.95 for three
months, though there's plenty of valuable free info available to help you
hit the real highway. <A HREF="http://www.autosite.com/">"http://www.autosite.com/"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="SS19">FOR THE A/V GEEK IN ALL OF US</A></B>
<P>
SoundSite is devoted to all things audiovisual. From a full glossary of a/v
terms to text-only directions on how to connect all sorts of electronics
together - including how to run a TV through your stereo - this is a site
for sound buffs. There are historical highlights from both the sound and
moving image industries, current industry news and the all important list
of directions for how to set your VCR clock on ten major models.
<A HREF="http://www.soundsite.com/">"http://www.soundsite.com/"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="SS20">NAME THAT TUNE AT WORLD WIDE MUSIC</A></B>
<P>
Once you're amped to the max, you can tackle another problem, one that's
plagued us since the invention of the car radio: how to track down the
album by the band that did that song. If you've got the song title, jam on
over to World Wide Music, where you can search out albums by artist, title,
or track. Having found the album, you can listen to several 30-second song
samples. If you like it, buy it. Cool. The site also boasts a
recommendation engine: you grade albums and the site suggests others you
might enjoy. The site covers more than 20 music categories and lists the
ten top albums in each category. With more than 45,000 discs available to
browse and choose from, you won't leave singing the blues.
<A HREF="http://www.worldwidemusic.com/">"http://www.worldwidemusic.com/"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="SS21">INKTOMI'S A POWERFUL PLAYER IN THE NET SEARCH FIELD</A></B>
<P>
Inktomi, brought to you by the University of California at Berkeley, is a
Net search engine that claims a higher actual document count than Lycos and
Infoseek. A further claim to fame is that its database is distributed
across several workstations for increased processing speed. When asked to
search the name of one of our esteemed writers, Inktomi rapidly delivered
the correct document title but the wrong URL. Oh well. Document results
inform you of the actual keyword hits within each matching document. Don't
bother with the "Full Graphics" display as it only adds a graphic separator
bar to the text listings. Document retrieval is fast, but the lack of
Boolean logic may put off power
searchers. <A HREF="http://inktomi.berkeley.edu/">"http://inktomi.berkeley.edu/"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="SS22">ORDER AMONGST THE NET CHAOS</A></B>
<P>
It would take a librarian to make sense of the mass of technical reference
material on the Internet. Gerry McKiernan attempts to do just this with his
prototype, Cyberstacks, which organizes these documents under the Library
of Congress classification scheme. Navigation, by subject area, becomes
more refined as you dive into the schema. Prior categories are visible (in
a tiny two-point font) and available as links, allowing you to easily
wander through a subject area. Target resources contain useful abstracts
along with short summaries on the specifics of searching it. This is only a
demonstration with few areas fleshed out, but it's worth a look.
<A HREF="http://www.public.iastate.edu/~gerrymck/">"http://www.public.iastate.edu/~gerrymck/"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="SS23">CULTURE? ON THE NET?</A></B>
<P>
CultureFinder is one-stop shopping for performing arts information. The
central feature is US listings for classical music, opera, chamber music,
ballet, and dance, accessed through a calendar which can be searched by
date range, type of performance, and location. A news section includes
recent articles and (any moment now...) interviews with famous conductors
and performers. Enter the Library for excerpts from books and magazines,
and answers from the e-mailable "Classical Music Answer Man". This new site
does not show much depth at the moment, but will become a great resource if
updated regularly. <A HREF="http://www.culturefinder.com/">"http://www.culturefinder.com/"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="SS24">PARENTS PLACE PLEASES PROGENITORS</A></B>
<P>
Even if you don't hold the title to a tiny tot, this parenting resource can
be relatively (oops) interesting. For those who do have children, the
articles written by and for parents - on topics ranging from pregnancy and
breastfeeding to family activities and children's education - should
provide a motherlode (oops, again) of helpful tips. Parents can commiserate
with other parents via chat or public e-mail and there's a Parents Place
Birthday Club, too. Useful both for parents and those who for some mystical
reason like other people's children are the kiddy-related shopping links.
Where else can you find a title such as "Piddlers Toilet Targets: Potty
Training Fish"? <A HREF="http://www.parentsplace.com/">"http://www.parentsplace.com/"</A>

Lancaster County, Pennsylvania. And if you can't find your burning question
answered on one of the pages devoted to Amish history and habits, covered

The capital of Silicon Valley has another index and directory (see NSD

on San Jose but on the entire San Francisco Bay Area. There are more than
30 major categories - and yes, technology just happens to be one. Other
groups include associations, parks, gardens, performing arts, weather, and
shopping. Handy for tourists, this site will also be useful for Silicon
Valley job-seekers, sports fans (yup, you can link to topics ranging from
basketball to soccer to hockey), and school children assigned to write
reports on San Jose. <A HREF="http://users.aol.com/mentorms/sanjose.html">"http://users.aol.com/mentorms/sanjose.html"</A>

<B><A NAME="OS1">CORRECTION: YOU CAN USE OTHER BROWSERS WITH AOL</A></B>
<P>
Last week we reported that Compuserve was moving away from the strategy of
having its subscribers use a proprietary Web browser. They have plans to
allow the use of any browser with their service and to establish an area
where various browsers would be available for downloading. We wondered when
AOL would follow suit. Sharp eyed readers pointed out to us that America
Online subscribers already have the capability to use non-proprietary
browsers, though you'd never know it given the lack of advertising. Here's
the scoop: go to keyword "WINSOCK", download WINSOCK.DLL, stash it in the
\WINDOWS directory, start up AOL software, minimize it, launch your
favorite browser or other TCP/IP software and surf away (while paying
hourly rates, natch). More info in the WINSOCK
area. Thanks to Anthony Greene for the details.

Now this is one cool piece of software. HindSite, currently available only

your Netscape browser and remembers the information for any period of time
you specify. Much better then bookmarks, which 1) you have to set, and 2)
tell you little about the content of the page. This puppy can let you go
back to that page you remember seeing somewhere, sometime in the last six
months. Best part? For the moment its free. It was a finalist for the "Best

<P>
The service consists of a shareware search reader, a notebook program,
and copyrighted freeware database files covering various areas of
interest on the Internet. With the Internet Resources Database, you can
build and maintain your own searchable database of sites. This could be
the answer for the totally serious browser. Caution, some of the
database files are large and take a long time over slow links. The
software and databases are also available on diskette, check the site
for details.  <A HREF="http://www.mbmarktcons.com/mbmarkt/irdhome.htm">"http://www.mbmarktcons.com/mbmarkt/irdhome.htm"</A>

Time-Warner's chat shareware for Unix, Mac, and PC users is free for
trial use, and only $20 if you want full use and the ability to
customize it with your name and an image for your face. This software is
just coming out of beta, so expect some hiccups. We couldn't get it
running for a demo, but try it out for yourself if interested.

<P>
Last issue, we said The Church of Scientology's lawsuit against the
Washington Post, for allegedly conspiring with "lawless elements on the
Internet" to harm the church, had been dismissed with court costs
charged to the Post. Clearer wording would have informed you that the
Religious Technology Center was held liable for the Post's court costs.

<HR>
<I>Latest news from the online frontier</I>

<P>
<A NAME="BS1">COMET SHOEMAKER-LEVY HOME PAGE AT JPL</A>
<P>
The comet is hitting Jupiter as this issue goes to press. NASA has their
page up at "<A HREF="http://newproducts.jpl.nasa.gov/sl9/sl9.html">http://newproducts.jpl.nasa.gov/sl9/sl9.html</A>". At press time
the first fragments have struck and a time series image of the plume
from fragment A has been posted. The show continues through July 22. Up
to the minute reports, links to other astronomical sites, times of
impact, and info on TV coverage of the events (peaking on July 20) is
available.
<P>
<A NAME="BS2">NUDES WITH NUKES? LIVERMORE LAB IMAGES REMOVED</A>
<P>
Sad news for prurient netsurfers; nearly 1,000 photos of nude
women stored on a public-access site at Lawrence Livermore National
Laboratory are now out of reach. The computer containing the nude images,
many reportedly nonpornographic, though, rumor has it, 'interactive',
was taken off line after the photos were discovered by an LA Times
reporter casually surfing the lab's public sites. Livermore
officials expressed embarrassment that the "protocol" breach was
disclosed by a reporter rather than one of their own computer
experts. The lab's public-access site is now back with a different
kind of titilation: scientific reports on lasers and satellite
photos of the moon.  Lawrence Livermore is at "http://www.llnl.gov".
<P>
<A NAME="BS3">DAVE BARRY COLUMN PULLED DUE TO PIRACY</A>
<P>
ClariNet has lost its right to distribute humorist Dave Barry's columns
on Usenet. Knight-Ridder/Tribune Information Services terminated their
contract with ClariNet after finding widespread unauthorized copying of
Dave Barry on the Net (surprise!). They first became aware of this
problem when someone casually emailed a copy of a column to a
Knight-Ridder employee. Not very discreet, those copyright violators.
<P>
<A NAME="BS4">NETCOM ELIMINATES POPULAR SLIP ACCOUNT OPTION</A>
<P>
Netcom, one of the nations largest commercial Internet providers has
eliminated the very popular $17.50 per month +$2.00/hr shell+SLIP
account option. While they are no longer offering this option to new
users, old users can continue on this plan. This is widely seen as a move
by Netcom to convert their customer base to their new Netcruiser
software and connectivity option. Not surprisingly, most of the related
discussion on Usenet has been by users looking for alternatives to
Netcom which offer a service similar to the eliminated pricing plan.

<P>
<A NAME="BS5">PATENT OFFICE TO DETERMINE WHO OWNS "INTERNET"</A>
<P>
The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) has suspended applications for
trademarks that include the word "Internet." The issue: does anyone
have exclusive rights to this potentially valuable name?  The PTO has
already approved some Internet trademarks, thus blocking subsequent
requests, according to a patent office attorney. However, this situation
is being questioned, based on the viewpoint that no one should have
exclusive rights to the name. Previously approved trademarks include
Internet Inc. and Inter-Net.
<P>
<A NAME="BS6">PBS DOCUMENTARY SERIES 'P.O.V.' HOSTS MAILING LISTS</A>
<P>
The award winning 'P.O.V.' documentary series has established mailing
lists to provide discussion forums for their latest series of programs
now airing on PBS. The list address is <U>majordomo@igc.apc.org</U> and here
are the program specific subscription lists: <i>The End of the Nightstick</i>
(police brutality) "subscribe pov-nightstick", <i>The Heart of the Matter</i>
(women confronting AIDS) "subscribe pov-heart", <i>Passin' it On</i>
(perspective on Black Panther Party) "subscribe pov-panthers", <i>Dialogues
with Madwomen</i> (women confronting mental illness) "subscribe
pov-madwomen."
<P>
<A NAME="BS7">ACM REPORT ON CRYPTO POLICY AVAILABLE</A>
<P>
The Association for Computing Machinery report "Codes, Keys and
Conflicts: Issues in U.S Crypto Policy," was written by a ten
person panel comprised of a veritable who's who of the computer
industry. The 50-page document explores the complex technical and
social issues underlying the current debate over the Clipper Chip
and the export control of information security technology.

<P>
<A NAME="BS8">JOURNAL WANTS TO PROFILE SMALL BUSINESS USE OF THE NET</A>
<P>
The Internet Business Journal wants to feature small and medium sized
businesses who use the net for successful business activities. If you
want to have your business profiled in one of their regular columns,
send relevant information about your company and its internet related
activities to Aneurin Bosley, Editor, <U>abosley@ott.hookup.net</U>.

look up the answer to this and other equally crucial questions with
Encyclopaedia Britannica Online, featuring up-to-date information on
over 65,000 articles. Currently undergoing beta testing, this sizable

<A NAME="OC1">DOCTRESS NEUTOPIA ELECTED "USENET KOOK OF THE MONTH"</A>
<P>
"Doctress Neutopia" has been dubbed this month's "Usenet Kook of
the Month" as a result of her flagrant cross-posting of her
docressoral dissertation "True Love Instead Of World War:
Rebuilding Gaia's Love," across alt.romance, alt.feminism,
alt.save.the.earth, alt.consciousness and many other newsgroups.
You can find the original document at
"<A HREF="ftp://eskimo.com/fisel/neutopia/">ftp://eskimo.com/fisel/neutopia/gaia[1-8]</A>"
, or ask her about her
how to join the Neutopian Lovolution yourself at
<u>"neutopia@titan.ucs.umass.edu"</u>.  She's aware of her status; her
comment on the kook nomination was, "You'll see." Join
alt.usenet.kooks for discussion and monthly elections of other
official kooks.

<A NAME="AO1">RADICAL ART GETS A HOME (PAGE)</A>
<P>
Public Domain Inc., a non-profit arts organization floating on the
interface between art, technology, and theory, has a home page now. This
group sponsored the "Destroy All Music" experimental music festival in
Atlanta and puts out a quarterly E-Journal called <i>Perforations</i>, each
issue exploring a single aspect of life hitting technology hitting
post-punk stream-of-consciousness performance text. Their Working Papers
forum on new artists provides some food for thought and quite a bit of
amusement. Check out "The New Alien in Science Fiction."

<P>
<A NAME="AO2">ARTIST PUBLISHES MFA SHOW ON NET</A>
<P>
UC San Diego grad student Belinda di Leo has electronically published her
Masters degree art show containing 23 of her paintings with supporting text
for each. Called 'Ancestry: Religion, Death and Culture', it documents her
roots in Central Appalachian culture. Her paintings embue images of
familial settings and farm land with spiritual significance enhanced by the
etherial quality of her colors and brush techniques. A feast for the eyes,
we're lucky to have access to this as-yet unknown talent.

<A NAME="BEZ1">SERIES OF NARROWLY FOCUSED NET BOOKS LAUNCHED</A>
<P>
Random House and Michael Wolff & Company Inc. (originators of the popular
<i>NetGuide</i> book), plan to introduce Net Books, a series of books
focusing on the content and uses of the Net. </i>Net Games<i>, a guide to the
thousands of online games resources, will start off the series in
September. Other books will follow every other month.  Research by
MW&Co. has shown that games, chat, personal finance, and technology are
the fastest growing areas of interest on the Net and each will be the
focus of a volume.  The companies also plan a monthly magazine, covering
the happenings and characters of the Net. Hmmm, sounds familiar....
<P>
<A NAME="BEZ2"><i>PSYCHIC QUEST</i>: NEW AGE ELECTRONIC MAGAZINE</A>
<P>
<i>Psychic Quest</i>'s charter is to teach and inform about psychic and other
New Age topics. The premier issue has a "true-story" of a near death
experience, a psychic explaining why election predictions don't pan out,
and a recipe for a dream enhancing drink. Other features: short fiction
and reviews of books and videos. There's also a free voice-mail BBS
+1 818 834 8255 for interested parties to contact each other and discuss
psychic issues. This of course begs the old question of why they
need...oh never mind. E-mail <U>spectrum@kaiwan.com</U> with a subject line
SUBSCRIBE PSYCHIC QUEST.
<P>
<A NAME="BEZ3">FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE: COMMUNICATE WITH <i>GLASNEWS</i></A>
<P>
The Spring 1994 issue of <i>GlasNews</i> can be found on the newsgroup
soc.culture.soviet and on PeaceNet's glasnost.news. This quarterly
publication is aimed at East-West communications in such fields as
journalism, advertising, public relations and telecommunications. You can

<P>
This special issue of Netsurfer Digest is produced to coincide with
MacWorld Expo. Its purpose is to showcase some of the best Macintosh- and
Apple-related netsurfing sites available on the Internet. While certainly
not an exhaustive attempt at gathering all things sprung from the Apple
seed, it will lead you to major sites. We hope you enjoy this effort. Let
us know what you think via the E-Mail form at this URL:

Richard Huff's Unofficial MacWorld Expo Home Page. Yes, you'll find
conference shedules, new PowerMac info, and other Expo-related stuff, but
more importantly, you'll find a perfect illustration of the true power of
the World Wide Web, a list of cool parties and events.

<B><A NAME="TS2">BATTLE OF THE TITANS: MAC SHAREWARE AND FREEWARE SITES</A></B>
<P>
The FTP archives at Stanford and University of Michigan are the two titans
of the Mac archive world. If it exists you can probably find it at one or
both sites. Popularity, alas, has its price, and the sites can be difficult
to connect to, but persistence has its rewards - frequently hours of
mindless shareware game fun. If you like a nice interface to all these
files try the superbly useful and well designed Nexor Mac Software Catalog
site. It has a searchable and browsable index. Finally the Info-Mac
HyperArchive Gopher offers a nice index of many Mac file categories.

<B><A NAME="TS3">ROBERT LENTZ'S MACINTOSH RESOURCES</A></B>
<P>
This is a great set of Mac resources, possibly the best organized
collection of Mac-related links on the Web. Robert has constructed a prime
Mac browsing site for everything from games to Web utilities to software,
hardware, QuickTime, and even some mind candy. In tribute to the quality of
his work you'll notice this path in a number of items below. Put this one
on your hot list and say thanks to Robert at "<B>lentz@rossi.astro.nwu.edu</B>".

<P>
Or FAQs as they are affectionately known around the Net. This collection
ranges from "Introductory Macintosh frequently asked questions" to "The Mac

questions". There are 13 in all, and chances are that your question has an
answer somewhere here.

<B><A NAME="TS6">INFO-MAC: MODERATED MAC ANNOUNCEMENTS</A></B>
<P>
Info Mac is a mailing list and USENET news group (comp.sys.mac.digest)
covering a grab bag of Macintosh issues, primarily new software and
resource announcements. Indispensible for keeping up with developments. The
no-nonsense, minimally graphic Web site has options for searching their
extensive archive by title, author and keyword. Full texts of old
announcements are also available. All requests to be added to this list
along with questions should be sent to the moderators at
"<B>INFO-MAC-REQUEST@SUMEX-AIM.Stanford.EDU</B>". Submissions can be sent to
"<B>INFO-MAC@SUMEX-AIM.Stanford.Edu</B>". Submissions are scanned to filter out
pure speculation or opinion, and messages not pertaining to the Macintosh.

<P>
Three other good general Mac browsing sites are worth a mention. The Well
Connected Mac is still a work in progress, but already contains a nice list
of resources to browse. Brian Cole's Mac Repository is strong on links for
hardware and software developers. Finally, the Hensa gopher has a very well
constructed menu of software categories, with a great top 50 list for both
software and Hypercard stacks. We found the popular Cindy Clock (a little
desktop clock that displays pictures of super models and the current date
and time), the Kennedy Assasination Stack, HyperFrog, and other cool
things.

<B><A NAME="BR1">APPLE</A></B>
<P>
The mother of all sites, and a fairly well rounded mother at that. The site
sports a clean and straightforward design with text menu items offering
various info choices. Under "What's New" you can find QuickTime samples of
Apple's new and first ever infomercial, "Martinettis Bring Home a
Computer", and a link to the recently opened eWorld site. You can also get
details about Apple and its history (SEC filings, stock quote) and a
catalogue of all Apple products (quaintly starting with Apple II items!)
along with data sheets and customer
support items. The biggest netsurfing catches hide in "Apple Developer
Services and Products" where you can find a treasury of technical
information and tools, including the welcome news that Inside Macintosh
will be made available on the World Wide Web this spring.

<B><A NAME="BR2">CLARIS</A></B>
<P>
Here you can obtain trial software, automated demos, and screen shots of
many Claris products. Under "What's New" you can find out about their
latest offering, "Amazing Animation", a multimedia movie creator for kids.
Look under "Special Offers" to save big bucks on products like FileMaker
Pro, the "From Alice to Ocean" CD-ROM, Claris Organizer, Claris Impact, and
others.  Also available are software updaters and templates, a technical
database for FAQs, and info on how to reach Claris. The best part of the
site may be the "Solutions
Center". Here you can find a Mac consultant or trainer in your area,
pre-assembled solution bundles, as well as information on how to become one
of their listed resources. <A HREF="http://www.claris.com/">"http://www.claris.com/"</A>

<B><A NAME="BR3">KALEIDA LABS</A></B>
<P>
Kaleida is a joint venture of IBM and Apple. They are the developers of the
platform-indepedent Kaleida Media Player and of ScriptX, the dynamic object
oriented programming language for multimedia. The site is a pretty standard
corporate front end, with things like executive profiles, corporate
milestones, news releases, technical notes, and services and product info.
A highly recommended jewel at this site is "The All-Seeing, Ever-Present
Eye At The Center Of The Spinning Vortex Of Existence" page, a collection
of links from the creative and occasionally wacky employees of Kaleida.
Kaleida: <A HREF="http://web.kaleida.com/">"http://web.kaleida.com/"</A>

<P>
<B><A NAME="BR4">TALIGENT</A></B>
<P>
Another joint venture of IBM and Apple, joined in early 1994 by
Hewlett-Packard, this small 350-employee firm is working on the next
generation object oriented operating environment. If you'd like to swell
their employee ranks, check out their "New Job Listing" under "What's New".
The most intriguing link is to an article entitled "Is Schrodinger's Cat
Object-Oriented?", a rumination on the connection between C++ and quantum
mechanics (deep down you knew there had to be one, right?). The link to
Object Technology Resources is a wonderfully complete guide to object
oriented programming with sources as diverse as trainers, consultants,
conferences, associations, and a very extensive reading materials list.
Highly useful. Also worth mentioning is their nice home page graphical
menu. <A HREF="http://www.taligent.com/">"http://www.taligent.com/"</A>

<B><A NAME="BR5">MOTOROLA</A></B>
<P>
Since Motorola provides the heart of the Macintosh, it would be boorish not
to mention them here. Their site seems to be in the early throes of
construction so the information there is rather sparse. The best part is a
link to "The Motorola Archive", an independent archive of various utilities
for Motorola microprocessor development maintained at the University of
Alberta. But we'll give that to you here directly, as well as the Austin,
Tex., Motorola BBS number (512-891-3733).

and MacWEEK, and brings news, information, tested shareware and freeware,
and exclusive original software to the denizens of CompuServe, eWorld, and
AppleLink. The Web site does not have much beyond information telling you
how to join and what's available on eWorld and CompuServe, but if you have

MODEMnotes is an electronic magazine for online Macintosh enthusiasts. The
magazine is large (latest issue was 626K) and "filled with useful and fun
articles about using your Macintosh, and the software for the Mac that
you'll find on the Internet". The size of the E-Zine is explained by the
incorporation of color graphics and sound. Latest issue contains info on
the game "Barney Blaster", and a game demo for "Marathon".

Three major pieces of software on the Macintosh are battling for mind share
in the race to provide cheap and easy access the Internet and the World
Wide Web. Chances are, you are using one of them to read this issue of
Netsurfer Digest. We would be remiss if we did not include links to:

who brought the world the indispensible Disinfectant virus scanner. You'll
also find MacTCP Switcher here, a utility program that makes it easy to
save and quickly restore multiple MacTCP configurations.

There are three essential tools which should be in every well equipped
Mac-based Webmaster's toolbox. For image display, there is the wonderfully
versatile JPEGView image viewer. GifConverter can take an image in a
variety of formats and make a GIF file - the universal Web display format.
Transparency is a nifty little utility that allows you to change the
transparent color index in GIF images. Transparency and JPEGView can be
found on the prolific "Aaron G's Projects" page, while GifConverter can be
FTPed from the other site below.

Mac TCP/IP networking programs often make use of each other as "helper

developers have designed a simple standard for Apple events that programs
can send each other to ask them to open URLs. You can find out more about
this standard at this URL.

 <a name="SS1">ULTIMATE ROAD TRIP HITS THE WEB</a>
 <p>
 Three men, 4000 miles, seven days. <i>Roadside America</i> is the online
 sequel to the hardcopy travel guide to the off-beat, "New Roadside
 America." Follow along as the authors seek out odd people and
 out-of-the-way places, downloading their dispatches, photos and home
 movies every step of the way. Always wondered about the <i>Mutter
 Preserve of Medical Curiosities</i>? Look no farther than <i>Wired</i>'s Web

<p>
 <a name="SS2">WWW VIRTUAL LIBRARY: SPORTS</a>
 <p>
 The "WWW Virtual Library: Sports," formerly known as "The Stringers
 Sports Page," has changed its name and significantly broadened its
 scope. The link remains the same, only the name of the page has
 changed. Becoming part of the WWW Virtual Library, hosted by CERN,
 means more sports links are now available. Chances are that whatever
 your sport this well organized Web page will have a link to it. Links
 to all the major sports, plus windsurfing, fencing, orienteering,
 rowing, speed skating, Australian football rules and much more.

 <a name="SS4">EXPLORE EUROPEAN SERVERS WITH EASE ON THE WORLD WIDE WEB</a>
<p>
 You can explore Europe and many European Web Servers on the net from
 the colorful "European Home Page". If you can display images, it shows
 a map and flags of 26 nations, and uses them as selection points for
 navigation. Otherwise, CERN's text list of sites is available for
 selections. Also, a new Romanian Home Page from Canada points to the
 European Home as well as a Romanian language gopher in Switzerland.

 <p>
 Gopher Jewels, the phenomenally successful and comprehensive list of
 Gopher sites, has reorganized their menu structure to aid in
 navigating this extensive netsurfing resource. In addition they are
 developing new tools to automatically check broken Gopher links, tools
 they plan on making public after the usual debugging effort. Pointers
 to Gopher Jewels top menu require no change. Links to any other Gopher
 Jewels directory will be broken with this reorganization.

 The Electronic Frontier Canada (EFC) aims to ensure that the
 principles embodied in the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms are
 protected as new information technologies emerge. To that end, the
 group has instituted a Gopher with sections devoted to the Charter,
 information law and the Canadian media. Currently, much discussion
 centers on the use of electronic communication to circumvent an
 infamous Ontario publication ban on details of the ongoing Homolka
 kidnapping and murder trial. "<a href="gopher://gopher.ee.mcgill.ca">gopher://gopher.ee.mcgill.ca</a>"

 <a name="SW5">NCSA MOSAIC FOR THE MACINTOSH 2.0.0 ALPHA 2 RELEASED</a>
 <p>
 While faster then the alpha 1 release, and with several fixes for
 annoying display bugs, this version has the abort download feature
 (command-period) disabled. This is a fatal problem particularly if you
 are using it over a modem SLIP link, where long downloads are the
 rule. Now there is no way to abort a long and uninteresting data
 transfer. Recommended only for those with fast Internet links.

 <a name="SW6">SIMPLE HTML EDITOR (S.H.E.) HYPERCARD STACK FOR THE MAC</a>
 <p>
 A nifty HyperCard based editor has all the basics for producing HTML
 documents with a minimum of fuss. Advantages: Nice tool pallet, Forms
 support, comprehensive HTML support, easy to use. Drawbacks: Text
 display area limited to the size of a card, maximum text size is 32K.
 Best used for formatting text rather then composing it. A well
 designed effort.

 <DT>   <A HREF="#1">In the town of Booville</A>
 <DT>   <A HREF="#2">There lived an undead student, named Bob.</A>
 <DT>   <A HREF="#3">Bob bought a Halloween costume for trick-or-treating</A>
 <DT>   <A HREF="#4">And made up his face.</A>
 <DT>   <A HREF="#5">To get in the mood, Bob watched some horror flicks</A>
 <DT>   <A HREF="#6">And read ghost stories.</A>
 <DT>   <A HREF="#7">Bob said goodbye to his mummy and headed into the streets.</A>
 <DT>   <A HREF="#8">He heard a distant chorus singing songs of holiday cheer.</A>
 <DT>   <A HREF="#9">Bob passed by the local cemetery</A>
 <DT>   <A HREF="#10">And ran into a dead person, of corpse.</A>
 <DT>   <A HREF="#11">The streets were fraught with vampires,</A>
 <DT>   <A HREF="#12">Witches,...</A>
 <DT>   <A HREF="#13">Zombies,...</A>
 <DT>   <A HREF="#14">And skeletons performing impossible acts.</A>

 <DT>   <A HREF="#16">And strange beings pierced with metal.</A>
 <DT>   <A HREF="#17">One house's door stood ajar, so Bob peered in.</A>
 <DT>   <A HREF="#18">On the way next-door, Bob heard a loud noise</A>
 <DT>   <A HREF="#19">And turned to see a giant pumpkin of malicious intent.</A>
 <DT>   <A HREF="#20">He ran into a nearby haunted house</A>
 <DT>   <A HREF="#21">Which led him straight into the Inferno.</A>
 <DT>   <A HREF="#22">The sights horrified his eyes,</A>
 <DT>   <A HREF="#23">The sounds assaulted his ears,...</A>
 <DT>   <A HREF="#24">And the experience nauseated him to the point of Vomitus Maximus.</A>
 <DT>   <A HREF="#25">Bob entered a strange cabinet he found there</A>
 <DT>   <A HREF="#26">Which, a la CS Lewis, rescued him from the Dark Side of the Web.</A>

<P>
Want to learn the history of Halloween in a witch's own words? Via a Web
page, copied from a newsgroup, copied from a BBS, perhaps this is not
straight from the witch's mouth but it is an interesting FAQ, complete with
source references, to the ancient history of Hallowtide. Another page here
contains over 80 links to related and unrelated sites, but you're as likely
as not to end up playing Web tag in a vicious circle of contentless linked
pages. Stick with us. We're professionals.

<B><A NAME="1">IN THE TOWN OF BOOVILLE</A></B>
<P>
The USA CityLink Project, a collection of American cities on the Web, has
specially constructed the virtual city of Booville for the Halloween
season. The city metaphor effectively links you to a bevy of fright-night
Net sites via headings such as "What to See", "What to Do", etc. The copy
is amusing and the links useful, but Booville's economy must rely on the
service industries: the site lacks original content. If you're looking for
eerie entertainment, this is an effective and amusing introduction to the
spooky stuff on the Net. <A HREF="http://www.neosoft.com/citylink/boo/main.html">"http://www.neosoft.com/citylink/boo/main.html"</A>

<B><A NAME="2">THERE LIVED AN UNDEAD STUDENT, NAMED BOB.</A></B>
<P>
This is an archive of a totally weird comic strip called "The After Life of
Bob". This comes from Canada, where the long, cold winters must mean
spending too much time inside in the dark. The weekly strip is published by
The GateWay, a student newspaper at the University of Alberta, and, despite
its amateur status, matches up with the best out there. Caution, though -
downloading from this site may capture your soul, and will certainly
capture your IP address in the logs (peek if you must).

<P>
Still searching for that hard-to-find body part? Just can't get a hold of
that much-needed severed head? Not to worry: the Web can deliver body bits
as well as data bits. The Halloween Mart and Tombstone Productions both
offer vast selections of seasonal weirdness. Along with visceral props,
both sites offer masks and costumes, some available for viewing, others
left to your twisted imagination. The offerings run from high-end ensembles
such as a $3,000 RoboCop costume to a gold lame Elvis outfit for just $35.
You need to supply your own gut. Of course, real undead make their costumes
from scratch.

<P>
Every Halloween for 22 years, Knott's Berry Farm in Buena Park, Calif., has
transformed into Knott's Scary Farm to host a huge party with literally
hundreds of hideous monsters to scare you witless. You can have an
unofficial backstage look at the shebang through the eyes Mike Strong, who
played a vampire for three years. See steb by step how monsters are made or
take a limited virtual tour of the setup. A complete tour is promised for
next year. What else is new? <A HREF="http://lucky.biomol.uci.edu/">"http://lucky.biomol.uci.edu/"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="5">TO GET IN THE MOOD, BOB WATCHED SOME HORROR FLICKS</A></B>
<P>
The Web's a great place to find others with the same weird obsessions you
have. It's so comforting to know you're not alone. And no-one should be
alone when watching any of the movies listed at Horror Haven. A
self-proclaimed horror movie buff since childhood, Tammy Kearns has
arranged a text listing of 20 old classics (Dracula, Psycho, Night of the
Living Dead), 20 new classics (Alien, Halloween, The Shining, Rosemary's
Baby), a Die Laughing set (The Brain That Wouldn't Die), the gorefest best
(Hellraiser, Re-Animator, Scanners) and a category she calls Grim Remnants.
A short storyline for each would've been nice, but having seen nearly all
these flicks ourselves, we can say there's not a loser in the bunch.

<B><A NAME="6">AND READ GHOST STORIES.</A></B>
<P>
The glow of the VDT replaces the glow of the campfire for those gathered
round the <A HREF="news:alt.folklore.ghost-stories">alt.folklore.ghost-stories</A> newsgroup. Home to academics,
psychics, the curious, and the spooked, the group offers tales of hags,
spirits, and other denizens of the land of the not-quite-dead. The stories
are true, or so claim some tellers. True or tall, the tales will make you
think twice about ghosts in your machine. If bloodsuckers - or blood - are
more your taste, spread those bat wings and flap over to
<A HREF="news:alt.books.anne-rice">alt.books.anne-rice</A>, the electronic watering hole for vampire
wannabes. It sports poetry, "speculation stories", and Anne Rice fang - er,
fan news. Questions like "If you were made into a vampire, whose blood
would you drink first?" have to make you stop and think. Or drink.

<B><A NAME="7">BOB SAID GOODBYE TO HIS MUMMY AND HEADED INTO THE STREETS.</A></B>
<P>
Two days after Halloween, Mexicans celebrate the Day of the Dead. The Museo
de las Momias (the Museum of the Mummies) is a site that nicely frames the
spooky picture of Mexican death fascination. Dan Harrison describes in
words and pictures his visit to the museum in Guanajuato, Mexico. The
corpses there have been so well preserved by the "magical" soil that
they've been exhumed and put on display. Good incentive to check out the
real thing. <A HREF="http://www.sirius.com/~dbh/momias.html">"http://www.sirius.com/~dbh/momias.html"</A>

<P>
Our editor spent four brutally interesting years living in Rice
University's Wiess College, four Halloween evenings of which were spent
pumpkin caroling around the campus. You too can experience the sublime -
visit the Wiess College page, download the lyrics, get a group together,
and go serenade the neighbors. The tunes are all familiar Christmas carols,
and it's pretty obvious which lyrics follow which tune. There's also a
description of the traditional route around the campus, but this is a waste
of time unless you know the university. For some reason, people are really
confused by this behavior.

<P>
Dress in black and take a tour of the World Wide Cemetery, "a place where
Internet users, their family and friends, can erect permanent monuments to
our dead." If you have a dear departed who deserves to be immortalized in
virtual reality, here's your chance. You can even leave flowers at the
monument. After all, as the sweetly sincere home page owners point out, the
WWW "is an ideal place to announce the loss of someone we cherish and to
erect a permanent monument to their memory." Just hope the network doesn't
crash. <A HREF="http://www.io.org/cemetery/">"http://www.io.org/cemetery/"</A>

<B><A NAME="10">AND RAN INTO A DEAD PERSON, OF CORPSE.</A></B>
<P>
If you're into the body beautiful, you'll love the Interactive Volume Browser.
Sound boring? It consists of an all-too-realistic human corpse, including a
hauntingly dead face, negotiable through a variety of views: up/down;
left/right; zoom in/pull out. Not exactly the right site for kids, unless
you want them to have nightmares, but it could enliven a dull party. Note
that the data upon which this site is built is the same cryosectioned guy
mentioned in Netsurfer Digest vol. 1, no. 33.

<B><A NAME="11">THE STREETS WERE FRAUGHT WITH VAMPIRES,</A></B>
<P>
Brad Middleton, alias Vlad III, has assembled Vampyres Only, an impressive
and comprehensive collection of vampire resources. Among the pages of what
is clearly a labor of love, you'll find lists of books and movies, FAQs,
author interviews, shareware games, even gothic fonts. Dig deeper for
vampire mailing lists and recipes for "vampiric drinks". If you have any
energy left, visit the Pointe du Lac Gallery with its photos and art, or
sit down for a disturbing read among the vampiric e-fiction. Before you
leave, you may want to try the Vampire Vulnerability Test, just to see if
you need to worry. <A HREF="http://www.vampyre.wis.net/vampyre/index.html">"http://www.vampyre.wis.net/vampyre/index.html"</A>

If you desire a more serious historical approach to the subject of

everything from the history of witch persecution to witches in art. There
are plenty of interesting reference materials and suggestions as to why
witches were singled out for elimination during the Middle Ages.

The skeletons can be found in glorious red, white, and black at the Den of

more, including a handful of useful Halloween party hints. While not
spectacularly designed, the inline images are worth a gander, especially
those skeletons. A similar page is Trix's Halloween-O-Webbery, which like
the Den of the Dead, features spooky stories.

Erotic. Bizarre. Sublime. Downright weird. These adjectives can all be
easily assigned to "The Ugly", a Web page chock full o' links to Web sites
that may alternately offend and titillate netsurfers. This page is
definitely not for the weak of disposition. It's replete with links to
horror, sex, UFO, and body modification sites, the latter dealing with body
piercing, tattooing, radical decapitation, and the like. It's the perfect
site for a bit of macabre surfing on All Hallow's Eve, as long as three
criteria are met: get the kids off the computer; don some fine leather
goods; and put a sweat-guard on the mouse.

<B><A NAME="17">ONE HOUSE'S DOOR STOOD AJAR, SO BOB PEERED IN.</A></B>
<P>
Gint's Haunted House puts netsurfers in the endangered shoes of a private
detective investigating an acrid smell permeating an old, abandoned house.
The odor, unfortunately for our brave detective, is the palpable smell of
death. This expedition resembles the old Infocom games that led players
through mazes in which one wrong move resulted in a grisly death, usually
by something like high explosives or tractors. The good thing about a Web
game of this nature is that reincarnation is only a click of the back
button away. In any event, this mystery is a welcome bit of diversion.
Beware the knob of death, children, beware!

was the evil laugh (echo and everything!), worth every irretrievable
instant of the over three minutes we had to wait for it to download. Choose
between spooky pictures, QuickTime movies, sounds, stories, and anything
else you could possibly want if you're into Halloween. Definitely worth a

This is the home of giant pumpkins. We're talking 900-pounders, the kind
Cinderella used, seriously large squash. Howard Dill, a Canadian farmer,
developed the Atlantic Giant variety pumpkin and now offers seeds to
hobbyists and competitive pumpkin growers via the Internet. There's also
story here about mysterious lights and, if you just happen to have an ant
problem, there's a recipe for their destruction via internal explosion you
might be interested in. That's kinda frightening, especially if you're an
ant. <A HREF="http://www.ips.ca/ibp/neat_things/">"http://www.ips.ca/ibp/neat_things/"</A>

Though Dallas is scary enough on its own (keep those cards and letters

little town of Forney, you'll find the Haunted Verdun Mansion, a
7,000-sq-ft antebellum home which just happens to be filled to the roof
with werewolves and other monsters. There are some good photos of the
special effects and the mansion itself, in case you can't make it to Texas.

If you're wandering weak and weary, here's a site that's not too dreary.
Called the "Ninth Circle of Hell", it's stuffed with Dante Alighieri's "The
Inferno" and a nice little gallery of images by Vallejo, Nagel, and some
Japanese anime. Links teleport you to the opuses of Mary Shelley and Bram
Stoker. If you've been waiting for the right moment to finally descend into

pics gleaned from <A HREF="news:alt.binaries.pictures.misc">alt.binaries.pictures.misc</A> and arranged into a

Phantasmagoria! is a Pennsylvania Halloween event with a Web presence of

horror page offers scores of sound files of mood music, creepy effects, and
movie and television dialogue and themes. There are also film clips,
shareware, and pics, all of the pertinent genre though some lean to the
humorous or satirical. The page's graphics are stunningly superb, and we

<P>
The Vomitus Maximus Museum is an online collection of the works of San
Francisco-born artist RS Connett. As you might guess, this site contains
some pretty disturbing imagery brought forth from the depths of Connett's
subconscious, and all the standard disclaimers about parental guidance and
weak stomachs most definitely apply - in short, Vomitus Maximus Grossimus
Outimus. Those brave hearts who make the journey will learn why this
controversial artist has been met with reactions varying from revulsion to
morbid fascination. Don't forget to pass by the Vomitus Gift Shoppe to pick
up a severed head for the kidlets. <A HREF="http://www.vomitus.com/vomitus/">"http://www.vomitus.com/vomitus/"</A>

<P>
If your thoughts have turned to the horror genre, the Cabinet of Dr. Casey
will fill all your dark longings for fright. Want to see a map featuring
every known fictional reference to your home state in a horror movie or
story? Look at the Horror Atlas. How about a historical timeline detailing
every horror-related event from the 15th century on? The graphics and audio
archives thoughtfully include brief text descriptions of the files. Also on
hand are excerpts from recent horror novels, newsgroup links, and Tales
from the Internet, where unpublished authors can weave their magic.

<P>
Although administered by a rude, arrogant webmistress, Dark Side of the Web
is the best collection of links to various depressive and dank pages,
ranging from "Cemeteries, Funeral Homes and Death" to 94 Gothic sites
alone. The Halloween entries have something for everyone, including
"Halloween Fun for Kids" with great recipes, games, stories, and decorating
ideas for creating a non-virtual haunted house. This is the truly THE
one-stop center for all your macabre needs. But be forewarned, my pretty -
this site could keep you tied up 'til well past the witching hour.

<P>
Oh boy, this is more than a little scary. Alphabetized candy bar wrappers. This
Robert Batina guy must have a friendly dentist. If you have a wrapper that
he lacks, then e-mail him; he's really keen to hear from you! To quote
Robert, "I plan on doing this until I die. (seriously)". All in all, it's
not a bad obsession, at least it has the perk of some chocolate thrown in,
which is never a bad thing. It's not a pretty page but it sure makes you
think, and get the munchies. Robert's must be the most popular house in the
neighborhood come trick-or-treat, unless he gives out unwrapped candy bars.

If you think PEZ is just a wholesome, harmless toy/candy product, think

skull PEZ dispenser) and numerological analysis of the dark side of PEZ.
While humorously annotated, even funnier are quotes from the four
unfortunate PEZ defenders who e-mailed the author with protests. This is a
small site, so hop along on the pointer to the larger world of either more
normal or more naive PEZ afficionados.

<B><A NAME="BS1">US SUPREME COURT AGREES TO RULE ON CDA</A></B>
<P>
The US Supreme Court has agreed to hear the appeal of a ruling that the
Communications Decency Act (CDA) is unconstitutional. Earlier this year, a
three-judge panel in Philadelphia ruled that the CDA violated rights
protected by the First Amendment to the US Constitution. A decision is
expected by July. The CNN article comes with a pic of Santa Claus looking
at naked Jenny McCarthy holding a Dalmatian. How timely, for both the
Christmas season and Disney's "101 Dalmatians" are being foisted at us from
every corner. And Jenny? Well, she's timeless.

<P>
The eight-day Jewish festival of lights and grease began Thursday at
sundown, and we've taken pains to seek out a few points of Chanukah
brightness and clarity from the deep dark Web. Jewish Communication Network
(JCN), offers lots of guidance for those who want to celebrate a
traditional holiday. You'll learn how to light the candles, what to recite,
and meditations for every night. Other links at the site include the
history of Chanukah, the JCN's "Top 12 Reasons We Like Hanukkah," the
Chanukah Carol Competition, and a recipe exchange (including latkes, of
course!). Much of the same is found at the Jewish Post site. JCN:

<P>
Personal stories make important events seem so - well, personal. Seeing as
how we've just passed the 55th anniversary of the Japanese attack on Pearl
Harbor, we decided to look online for eyewitness accounts. William Innanen,
a soldier, describes the scene at the naval base in the wake of the attack.
Ginger, a 17-year-old high school student living in Pearl Harbor at the
time of the attack, gives another point of view. Her concern for friends
and family killed or missing is vivid and touching. Innanen:

<P>
Picture an ordinary family in Minnesota, a mother, a father, two boys, and
an infant girl. Now picture them thrust into a nightmare, with the parents
and the baby girl infected with HIV. This photodocumentary takes a
sensitive and emotional look at one family's struggle with AIDS,
particularly how the infected parents of the three-year-old dealt with her
illness and the reactions of their town and church. A photographer and two
writers tracked the family's six-year odyssey and have put together a site
with as many positive insights as are possible. The pages are as elegant as
they are heart-wrenching, and the somber gray-scale frames tell the story
as it should be told.

Phillip's Vision of the Future Magazine is a dive into a whole new world of

up with is nothing short of fascinating. Make sure you check out the
Personal Touch issue and the background information on the project.

<P>
According to mythical metamegacorporation Robon Corp., life is upgradeable.
That's all you need know before you enter this wry, wise, and slick site
dedicated to the belief that all cyber-hype is indeed true. Whether Robon
is Bill Gate's wettest dream or your worst nightmare, it's good for more
than a few laughs, and shivers. <A HREF="http://www.robon.com/">"http://www.robon.com/"</A>

Things are really hopping in Washington, D.C. Especially at the National

to check out the naked mole rats and newly born rhinoceros via
freeze-framed, live-action photos. <A HREF="http://www.si.edu/organiza/museums/zoo/">"http://www.si.edu/organiza/museums/zoo/"</A>

<B><A NAME="SS5">ATTACK OF THE BOTS</A></B>
<P>
Bots are entities that have been around almost as long as the Net. These
pseudo-beings, originally created as a means of bridging the gap between
computers and ordinary linguistic communication, have evolved into a
powerful means of translating simple questions into powerful Internet
database queries. The big low-down on bots, their origins, and their
current capabilities now resides at the Bot Info site, full of data on
current bot trends. There's even a link to Eliza, the "original" bot,
created in the late 1960s. This site holds a great deal of information,
including several FAQ's and reviews of bots deemed important enough to
communicate to the Internet community as a whole. <A HREF="http://www.botspot.com/">"http://www.botspot.com/"</A>

The C|Net downloading engine makes it easy to find, read about, and
download just about any online software that you might be looking for. It's
convenient to search or browse by categories at the well designed site.
Links are easy and navigation is quick. Some of the groups of software that
they classify for downloading are: business; development tools;
educational; games; home and personal; Internet; kids; multimedia and
design; and utilities. Test drive it. <A HREF="http://www.download.com/">"http://www.download.com/"</A>

Anyone who's ever tried looking for the images hidden in those inane
stereoscopic pictures (Ooh, look! I'm dizzy!) might get a kick out of the
3-D hypercube page. A Java applet runs a three-dimensional simulation of a
hypercube, and those who have held on to those 3-D movie glasses will be
able to take full advantage of the effect. Plenty of other optical
illusions abound, and some of the programming that went into creating the
displays might also confuse you. <A HREF="http://www.sover.net/~manx/hyprcube.html">"http://www.sover.net/~manx/hyprcube.html"</A>

<B><A NAME="SS8">ANCIENT HISTORY SEARCH ENGINE</A></B>
<P>
Argos is a search engine whose focus is limited to matters of ancient
history, myth, and fable. The Argos site draws from a variety of sources to
be a handy tool for researchers and academics interested in the legends
that populate humankind's collective unconscious. Some of the sources drawn
from include the Labyrinth's medieval site and the Duke Papyrus Archive,
the Internet's most exhaustive study of ancient Egyptian papyri.

<P>
The days of quirky, remote URLs loaded with personal neuroses, boasting,
and occasional banality seem to be vanishing before the onslaught of slick,
commercial Web sites. Sentimentalists longing for the good old days should
check into the Catacombs Cyber Cafe where proprietor Scott Klender is
selling nothing but himself: what books he reads, what movies he likes,
what bands he listens to. There's more: admittedly bad poetry; the "random
psychosis generator"; his own Another Brilliant Site award - so much more
that it feels like you've taken a can opener to his skull. It's worth the
peek inside. <A HREF="http://www.rust.net/~sklender/catacombs_home.html">"http://www.rust.net/~sklender/catacombs_home.html"</A>

If you love mysteries and don't mind eyestrain, you'll like "The Light

Broad Daylight", opens with a very dark, dismal, and hard-to-scan home
page. Get past that obstacle, and you can try to solve the mystery. As an
enticement, the sponsoring company (SouthPeak Interactive) is offering a
$5,000 reward. <A HREF="http://www.lightfiles.com/">"http://www.lightfiles.com/"</A>

Talk about walking a mile in somebody's shoes.... Robert Swan and
colleagues are going to walk 1,300 kilometres across Antarctica. If you
want to join them, along with 35 young explorers from around the world,
slip on your mukluks and head for One Step Beyond. The site covers both
Swan's stroll across the Antarctic wastes and the activities of a select
group of 16 to 24-year-olds who will undertake their own month-long
expedition to the Antarctic environs, meeting up with Swan and company in
January 1997. The site promises daily notes from the field and expedition
updates. For those with the juice to support it, the site features a 3-D
virtual reality walk across Antarctic terrain. Those without it can stare
at a white screen and pretend it's a blizzard.

different tours around the small Central American country, including visits
to the Mayan Ruins, the national parks, and other localities. It's the next

<P>
Both come from Tasmania, as do these vicarious adventures you can
experience with your Web browser. Tour Australia's smallest state and one
of its most popular tourist attractions from the comfort of your chair.
This tour is designed as a brief guide to "Tassie", as it's called in the
local vernacular. It provides a nice, well designed sampling of the diverse
and spectacular scenery and attractions of Tasmania. An interesting and
informative tour, it's also a good way to plan a trip there.

While we'd love to write this ultra-commercial site off as just another
pretty travel page, the World Travel Guide, sponsored by AT&T and the
Columbus Group, is actually a glorious collection of information for
would-be travelers. Based on the best-selling World Travel Guide books,
this site provides tourist and business travel information; essential
details about climate, visas, currency and customs; listings of public
holidays; and, of course, so much more. Use its spiffy Hotel Finder to
search a database of over 6,000 hotels worldwide. <A HREF="http://www.wtgonline.com/">"http://www.wtgonline.com/"</A>

<B><A NAME="OT5">WHEN'S THE FLIGHT ARRIVING?</A></B>
<P>
What the online World Travel Guide doesn't have, TheTrip.com does. This
travel resource aims squarely at the business air traveler. The coolest
feature is the real-time flight tracking page. The page will retrieve
flight info - from ETA to speed and altitude of the airplane -
lickety-split for airline and general aviation aircraft. The technology
uses Federal flow control data, piped and formatted for the Web interface.
It works only for flights wholly within the US, but you don't need a flight
number. The airport guides would be more useful if they mapped gates. On
the horizon, TheTrip.com promises a customized bargain airfare e-mail list.

<I>Latest news from the online frontier</I>

<P>
    <A NAME="BS1"><i>GNN</i> ANNOUNCES THE BEST OF THE NET</A>
    <P>
    <i>Global Network Navigator</i>, the leading free net link to over 650
    info servers has issued their Editors' Choice awards to the 12
    "most fascinating" destinations on the net. Selections include the
    UC Berkeley Paleontology Museum's interactive guide to natural
    history, the Underground Music Archive, Xerox PARC's Map Viewer
    application, and ArtServe, a graphical archive of 15th-19th
    Century images. These folks sift through enough material online to
    know when they've hit paydirt. Check it out at 
    "<A HREF="http://gnn.com">http://gnn.com</A>".
    
    <P>
    <A NAME="BS2">U.S. AIR FORCE SPAMS USENET</A>
    <P>
    On June 24, Air Force officials posted a wanted poster in
    uunencoded JPEG format across more than fifty Usenet newsgroups.
    The fugitive, Edward Zakrzewski, is an Air Force officer wanted in
    connection with the slaying of his wife and children. While Air
    Force's motive was applauded, many questioned the propriety of
    posting such a large investigator, justified the action, saying
    that the message was urgent and there was no time for newsgroup
    creation, as is planned in the future. (alt.airforce.wanted?) The
    FBI, in searching for the academic mail-bomber a few years ago,
    took a more discreet approach: a short message posted to several
    newsgroups pointing to a long text in news.announce.important.
    
    <P>
    <A NAME="BS3">COMMERCIAL HTTP CLIENTS AVAILABLE SOON</A>
    <P>
    Businesses are clamoring for HTTP clients which, unlike NCSA
    Mosaic, may be used for commercial purposes, and a number of
    software companies have leapt to fill the gap with commercially-
    supported applications, several of which should be released this
    summer.  One such company, Spyglass, has arranged for their client
    to be bundled with most major Digital Equipment systems. Marc
    Andreeson, principal creator of NCSA Mosaic and now co-principal
    of Mosaic Communications, says his company is currently building a
    "next generation version, from the ground up, that will be
    commercially compelling."
    
<P>
    <A NAME="BS4">SECURE HTTP TRANSACTIONS POSSIBLE BY END OF YEAR</A>
    <P>
    Terisa Systems, a spin-off of WWW software developer EIT, has
    promised an HTTP client for commercial use, with the added
    attraction of support for SHTTP, the Secure HTTP variant,
    currently under joint-development by EIT and CommerceNet, using
    NCSA and RSA technology.  The public key cryptography-based
    technology will add authentication, authorization, encryption, and
    electronic-funds-transfer to HTTP's feature-set. Although the
    CommerceNet implementations are available only to their full
    members at US$37,000/year license fee, Terisa Systems plans to
    have much more reasonably-priced products available by year's end.
    Terisa Systems can be reached at "<U>terisa@eit.com</U>"
    or +1 415 617 1836.

<P>
    <A NAME="BS5">CONFUSION RAMPANT IN WAKE OF LISTSERV LICENSE FEE RESTRUCTURE</A>
    <P>
    The price of licenses to commercially use LISTSERV, the popular
    mailing-list management software from L-Soft ("<u>info@lsoft.com</u>"),
    of Wallkill, New York, has recently been dropped.  The previous
    price for commercial users was in the US$30,000 range, while a new
    license which allows the management of only a few medium-sized
    lists now costs only US$1,200. Rumors flew when L-Soft announced
    the price-restructuring, as many list administrators mistakenly
    assumed that the high-end license price would be going up.

<P>
    <A NAME="BS6">ADAM CURRY'S POPULAR MTV.COM WEB SERVER MOVED TO METAVERSE.COM</A>
    <P>
    Adam Curry, ex-MTV-video-jockey, and well-known figure in Internet
    music circles, is currently facing a lawsuit from MTV, who a year or
    so ago granted him the right to the mtv.com domain, and now that it's
    a success, want him to give it to them.  Pending the outcome of the
    lawsuit, which MTV will likely win, Adam Curry has moved his operation
    to "<A HREF="http://metaverse.com/vibe/index.html">http://metaverse.com/vibe/index.html</A>", 
    which currently features
    information on Woodstock '94 and the MTV v. Curry lawsuit.
    
    <P>
    <A NAME="BS7">NIST ADOPTS DIGITAL SIGNATURE STANDARD (DSS)</A>
    <P>
    On May 19, the National Institute of Standards and Technology
    approved its cryptographic standard to provide digital signatures
    for electronic documents. The DSS has been controversial since
    documents obtained by CPSR reveal that the National Security
    Agency pressured NIST into adopting the DSS instead of an
    algorithm that also provided privacy  protection. RSA Data
    Security claims that the DSS standard infringes several of its
    patents, but NIST disagrees.
    
<P>
    <A NAME="BS8">10,000 INTERNET ACCOUNTS FOR GRADE-SCHOOL STUDENTS</A>
    <P>
    A New York county school library system and Hofstra University is
    planning to make 10,000 Internet accounts available to students,
    and 5,000 more for teachers and principals.  School librarians
    will serve as Internet trainers and managers. The university will
    donate the needed modem, phone line, and mainframe resources, and
    provide training for a price of $65/year. More info is available
    from Barbara Behrens at +1 516 997 8700 or 
    "<U>wcxc09a@prodigy.com</U>".

<P>
    <A NAME="BS9">PC VIRUS MASQUERADES AS CD-RECORDABLE DEVICE DRIVER UTILITY</A>
    <P>
    A newly reported virus named "CD-IT" is said to corrupt your PC
    hard drive if you download it. The program is supposed to be a CD
    shareware utility that would convert any CD-ROM drive into a
    recording device. The shareware file is also said to make
    unauthorized use of the Chinon name. Warning information credited
    to a Usenet posting by <U>lmeissne@u.washington.edu</U>

<P>
    <A NAME="BS10">DOMAIN REGISTRATION AND OTHER STATISTICS AVAILABLE</A>
    <P>
    Internet Info, in a report posted to the Internet-Privatization
    mailing list "<U>com-priv@psi.com</U>", reports 1,326 new commercial
    domains (of a total 15,384) registered in the past month, 10% more
    than last month.  More than 30% of the new companies are in
    computer related fields, and most are small or very new. The
    largest number of new companies registered this month were in
    California (350), Canada (95), and Colorado 85. Mail
    "<U>info@internetinfo.com</U>" for more details.

<P>
    <A NAME="BS11">U.S. SENATOR SUPPORTS PUBLIC ACCESS</A>
    <P>
    Hawaiian Democratic Senator Daniel Inouye has introduced
    legislation (S. 2195) to ensure access to the infobahn for
    non-commercial and governmental uses.  Inouye is chairman of the
    Senate Communications Subcommittee.  More info is available from
    Anthony Wright at "<U>cme@access.digex.net</U>".

<P>
    <A NAME="BS12">INTERNET SOCIETY REACTS TO SPAMMING</A>
    <P>
    In a June 17 meeting in Prague, the Internet Society's Board of
    Trustees took action to update the ethical guidelines laid out by
    the Society's Internet Architecture Board (IAB). Reacting to
    recent public concern about the practices of small numbers of
    users and service providers, the Board asked the IAB and the
    Advisory Council to propose a new code of ethics. Cited abuses
    included unsolicited E-Mail and deceptive marketing practices by
    service providers.  Tony Rutkowski, Exective Director of the
    Internet Society ("<U>amr@isoc.org</U>"), has lead discussion on the
    "<U>com-priv@psi.com</U>" mailing list.
    
<P>
    <A NAME="BS13">CLINTON TO HOLD PUBLIC NII DATA SECURITY MEETING</A>
    <P>
    At 9:00am, July 15, the Clinton administration will hold a public
    meeting on security issues related to the National Information
    Infrastructure in Washington D.C.'s Commerce Department
    auditorium. Questions can be addressed to Marty Ferris at

    <P>
    CalTrans, the California state department of highways and
    transportation in conjunction with S-Cubed, a southern California
    software development firm, is providing real-time traffic-flow feeds
    to the Internet on a trial basis.  The sensors report the speed of
    each car which passes the many monitored points on the San Diego-area
    highways, and an HTTP server aggregates this data into a handy
    statistical display.  Average speeds recently have ranged from less
    than 2mph during commute hours, to a peak we saw of 89mph at 2am.
    CalTrans plans to expand the service to cover Los Angeles, Orange
    County, and the San Francisco Bay Area in its next phase.  One can
    easily imagine such a service becoming indispensable in choosing a
    commute-route home from the office every day.  The server can be

    <P>
    The recently born Generation X mailing list came and went in the
    space of a couple of weeks. Before its untimely demise at the
    hands of too many subscribers and mailing list software problems
    it offered an in-depth discussion of what's up with
    twenty-somethings.  Recent topics included clothes (why black?),
    Douglas Coupland (thumbs down), how old you have to be to be in
    Generation X, and whether it really exists at all or is simply a
    marketing phenomenon. It was born, it grew up fast, and then it
    slacked off into obscurity. Go figure.

    <A NAME="OC2">NETIQUETTE MAILING LIST</A>
    <P>
    A marketing offshoot of "Netiquette", a book by Virginia Shea,
    this list offers advice and debate on many facets ofonline
    behavior. Current topics: the correct length of a .signature (4
    lines or less), whether or not to include a signature with every
    letter, and how to "troll" with flair (let the 'fish' know gently
    that he's been had as soon as he responds).  Of special interest
    to newcomers should be the core netiquette document, which sets
    ground rules for net behavior.  Rule #1? "Remember the human."

    <P>
    The newsgroup for anyone who likes disruptive, non-damaging pranks
    is alt.shenanigans.  A recent thread concerned the faking of
    UFO's: ultralight aircraft and garbage-bag hot air balloons were
    suggested, and detailed instructions for making crop circles were
    offered.  Other threads elaborated on elevator shenanigans
    (switching the buttons and the floor plates in the hall facing the
    elevator) and getting rid of telephone solicitors (if someone
    wants to sell you a newspaper, tell them you can't read.)  So, if
    you have a beef tongue you just don't know what to do with, check
    out alt.shenanigans.

    <A NAME="TW2">IT'S BEEN A GOOD WEEK FOR NEW NEWSGROUPS...</A>

    Leading the pack with the most postings are
    sci.electronics.repair, rec.travel.usa-canada, rec.travel.europe,
    and alt.religion.mormon.  That latter seems to be stirring up a
    bit of religious controversy, and is leading
    alt.religion.zoroastrianism more than ten-to-one with threads like
    "Hot Drinks (was Re: Polygamy)", which has mutated into a
    discussion of Jewish dietary laws and the use of hot milk as a
    culture for micoorganisms.  Also attracting sizable readership are
    comp.dcom.cabling, alt.internet.media-coverage,
    alt.fairs.renaissance, alt.aol.sucks, alt.clothing.lingerie, and
    an interesting pair: alt.fan.oj-simpson and

<P>
Hard on the heels of the infamous US Department of Justice Web page hack
comes another home page grafitti incident. The home page of no less then
spook central USA (a.k.a. the CIA) was hit by some nebulous, politically
adolescent entity calling itself "Power Through Resistance". The stupidity
of this act can only be compared to... well, actually we can't think of
anything as stupid at the moment. The incident is so obviously inflammatory
to the already paranoid law enforcement and government communities, there
are rumors it was an inside job by some right-wing civil service flake - a
poor hacker's version of the Reichstag fire. Nothing good will come of it.
In the meantime, to satisfy your morbid curiosity, check out these mirrors
of the hacked site. The real CIA site was still down at press time, and may
stay that way permanently. So much for the eminently useful CIA World Fact
Book.

<P>
In typical Orwellian newspeak, they call it "Safety-Net". The organization,
endorsed by the British government, will publish a legality indicator for
Usenet news groups to indicate what kind of illegal and pornographic
material each contains. No doubt, ratings will be based on some
legislators' dimly remembered sexual arousal, but even so we foresee the
birth of a surprisingly popular, government-financed guide to naughty bits
online. Of course, it will be just as easy to access your favorite kinky
knickers page, but now you'll be able to narrow your prurient search
courtesy of Her Majesty's Government. The site below has a full description
of the organization. Visit <A HREF="news:comp.org.eff.talk">comp.org.eff.talk</A> and <A HREF="news:alt.censorship">alt.censorship</A>

It started with the Chinese. Then came Alexander. In due course, the
British took their turn, and how can we forget the Soviets. All left a
sorry mess in their wake. Afghanistan has been been a victim of the Great
Game for a long, long time, and the current bloodshed is just another
pathetic episode in this sad, albeit strategic, region of the world. For
background, as well as the latest news on what appears to be the newest
Islamic state, see this site. It has lots of good material, offers a huge
number of links, and is worth the visit.

<P>
Sendmail is the workhorse of Internet e-mail. Chances are that if your
access provider runs Unix (and the sane ones do) they use Sendmail to
shuffle your bits around. Two security holes in versions up to 8.7.5
potentially allow local users to gain access to root accounts. A patch and
a new version are available. Sysadmins will need to look at the advisory
itself for details.

<P>
Cisco has submitted a new router technology called "tag switching" to the
Internet Engineering Task Force as a proposed standard. The technical
details are in the press release, but the gist of the announcement is that
networks now have the technology to prioritize their traffic, and
presumably charge extra for high priority feeds such as multimedia. Trials
will begin in the first half of 1997, but the tech wizards among us need to
know about this now. In other news, Cisco and Ascend Communications each
unveiled new high-speed routers which should help alleviate the now chronic
Net congestion.

<P>
Awake readers of NSD will remember our report on AOL's blocking a number of
professional e-mail spam dispensers. One of the larger targets, Cyber
Promotions, promptly sued the network. The court ordered AOL to unblock
e-mail from the Cyber Promotions domains until judges could sort out what's
what. In the latest round, the Court of Appeals has vacated the earlier
injunction and granted AOL permission to reblock the spam. The issue may be
moot, however, since AOL will shortly unveil software which will allow
users to block spam sites directly themselves. Here is the AOL Press

<B><A NAME="OC2">CAN YOU PASS THE ELECTRIC KOOL-AID HYPERTEXT?</A></B>
<P>
It's sorta annoying when you need a dictionary to interpret a Web site. The
ADH (Audience Delivers Hypertext) home page was created to, supposedly,
demonstrate unique ways of dealing with hypertext. The purpose, according
to the authors of the page, is to show "a new way of delivering hypertext
that will be multilinear or rhizomatic." The authors also note that they
plan to give a "performance" at the 1997 Conference on College Composition
and Communication Annual Conference created by collaborators from the
C-FEST group, who have been meeting at the Lingua MOO. If you'd like to
involve yourself in this intrigue, check out the recordings of their
meetings and/or learn more about Lingua MOO. Possible paths of exploration
include "Aristotelian notions of audience and delivery", "cybernetic
delivery", "Nietzsche gets a modem3 (french fried delivery)", and more.
Whatever happened to studying Shakespeare?

Photojournalist Doug Menuez showcases photos that document the last decade
in the computer and technology industries, beginning with a young Steve
Jobs in 1986. The photos and accompanying text intrigue the visitor and the
site design is smart. The coolest feature is unadvertised: click on any pic
to reveal an image of the actual negative. The negative is also flipped 180
degrees, creating the illusion of seeing the photo from behind, and the
accompanying text changes, exploring the photographer's thoughts at the
time of the shoot. Notes on the site tell us that the images are supposed
to be ephemeral; presenting a different set of 36 on each visit, but they
didn't change for us. That's OK. Despite the sluggish Web server behind the
site, it's worth repeated visits. <A HREF="http://www.menuez.com/">"http://www.menuez.com/"</A>

your chance to satisfy your craving. The Georgia O'Keeffe site has an
excellent collection of her works, but there's more to it than just a
gallery. The paintings run parallel to a history of her life. Entertaining
vignettes about the paintings are often included, as is a series of photos
of O'Keeffe that follows her through the course of her 98-year life.

We spent countless sleepless nights trying to solve this riddle - what do
Oprah Winfrey, Quincy Jones, Volvo, Arthur Anderson, and the US Embassy in
Japan have in common? Turns out, they've all chosen a bit of artwork by
Alexandra Jacobs to grace their corporate walls. Corporate is the operative
word here, both Webwise and artwise. The Alexandra Corporation features a
plenitude of Alexandra's artwork, plus a few diverting gimmicks. The
hands-down goofiest is "Art at Work" wherein you get to change the painting
hung in a conference room or behind a reception area. the most useful is
the ability to send a Net postcard of any painting you select. Alexandra's
art is nice in the way Muzak is nice - it's elevator music for the eyes.

The Fritz is a column by Fritz Holznagel that amuses, bemuses, and
occasionally abuses. We like it for Fritz's offbeat shotgun approach to
stuff. One recent column covered stoning, with pills not rocks, pigeons at
Denver's new pie-in-the-sky airport. Another looked at the grossness to be
found inside his computer keyboard. The daily essays are short and more or
less to the point, if there is one. Oh, and the headline? That's the winner
of Fritz's slogan contest. Personally, we'd have chosen "The Fritz -
Because Lycos Won Him in a Poker Game". Yeah, he's a PointCommie....

Zeitgeist is a daily feed of opinions, news and unsubstantiated rumors, or
so they say in their press releases, brought to you by the folks at the
Transom, an ISP/online service/news feed. Zeitgeist is a daily dose of
words culled from the larger organization. It is simple, in a good way. The
essays are short and zippy, sometimes maybe a bit too short. While the home
page seems to emulate the too frequent "we're a hip-cool, nipple-pierced
outfit" style, with articles like "Love Noise", about a lover who screams
too loudly, or "33 Reasons the Transom Loves LA", the content is better
than you're likely to expect. We found the print a little too small, but

refreshing moment later. After you pick a pseudonym - for protection, of
course - you'll have to contend with the yawping contentiousness of others,
because the comments don't seem to be threaded. You have your choice of
forums: "Gridiron Grumblings" and "The Losers' Lounge." Sometimes they may
seem the same. Be careful, because "we don't hold back any punches!" This

Wolves were recently re-introduced, not without controversy, into
Yellowstone National Park. Soon, Mexican gray wolves will be returning to
the American Southwest. This site offers a balanced discussion of this
issue giving literal voice to each side of the battle, delivered
automatically with Netscape 3.0 (AIFF), RealAudio, or AU files. Most of the
audio is thankfully repeated as text on the screen, but hearing the
speaker's voice does add a dimension. The site designers have implemented
"cognitive flexibility hypertext", which translates into a bad case of
link-itis in which nearly every word is a link. Not surprisingly, we turned
up the odd "404 (not found)" error. If you have a cat, you simply must go
to the home page and test its reflexes with the wolf howls.

good for your entire visit. You then get to see who else is online (and
display their location on a map), communicate with them, and even cooperate
with them to solve a puzzle (if you have Win95/NT and Netscape). This and
other features seem to be aimed at kids. The best part of the site is an
historic timeline covering 1945-1995. Click on a year to yield photos and
details about that year. Parts of the site are still in development, such
as the online store, the forums, and an interactive robot feature. The
server is also a bit pokey, but this is a site with lots of potential.

Net-A-Thons, sponsored by the nonprofit National Educational Technology

celebrity memorabilia for the auctions, which occur during Comdex and the
Electronic Entertainment Expo. The next will be held November 1-18. The
main attraction of the Web site is the collection of goodies to be

<I>The best places to netsurf this week</I>
<P>
<B><A NAME="SS1">LADIES & GENTLEMEN: JOSIP BROZ TITO</A></B>
<P>
Who? You know, that militantly non-aligned communist who held
Yugoslavia together for 40+ years after kicking the Nazis
out. So here we have this virtual Web shrine to the guy
complete with texts of his speeches, tons of photos hobnobbing
with other world renowned leaders, (Yassir Arafat, Idi Amin,
Richard Nixon) and a section entitled "His Last Battle" reenacting his
lingering death in an equally lingering photo series.
Conceptually weird in some deep hind brain manner. We can't
figure out if these guys are serious in their adoration or
what. But then, maybe anyone who managed to hold Yugoslavia
together all these years deserves a shrine. Then again, maybe
not. You decide. <A HREF="http://www.fer.uni-lj.si/tito/tito-eng.html">"http://www.fer.uni-lj.si/tito/tito-eng.html"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="SS2">ROADKILLS-R-US AND THE PRICE OF "BAT, FRUIT"</A></B>
<P>
Somewhere between ridiculously bizarre and spectacularly inspired
lies Roadkills-R-Us. Apparently it's not just a Web page; it's a
way of life, and to link there is to be sucked under the wheel of
its creative juggernaut. We recommend you check out the Roadkill
Payment Schedule before going on to the whole history of RRU, and
culminate your visit with links to either Page.bIZARRE or the
Obituary Web Pages. Do yourself a favor and visit this place
before life runs you over. <A HREF="http://hostname.pencom.com/rru.html">"http://hostname.pencom.com/rru.html"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="SS3">NASA'S VOLCANOLOGY INFO, PART OF "MISSION TO PLANET EARTH"</A></B>
<P>
Lots of goodies about volcanoes and the Earth Observing System of
satellites coming in 1998 as a major part of NASA's "Mission to
Planet Earth." For educators, a series of slide sets covering
"Surface & Atmospheric Effects of 1991 Eruption of Mt. Pinatubo"
is available for downloading. For the rest of us, info and images
on EOS activities and future plans, satellite views, FAQ from
sci.geo.eos and links to related sites.

<P>
<B><A NAME="SS4">ONCOLINK: A DEFINITIVE NET SITE FOR CANCER INFO</A></B>
<P>
Find out about cancer and how not to get it. For cancer doctors
OncoLink offers information organized by speciality. At the
request of cancer patients and families it's also organized by
disease. While it may be the most used site for cancer information
(getting 4000 accesses/day) it also gives links to other oncology
sites on the Net. The organizers believe that this Gopher/WWW
server offers the best general interest cancer information
anywhere, being a better organized single source than journals and
less narrowly focussed than other Net sites.

<P>
<B><A NAME="SS5">APPLAUSE, APPLAUSE - THE SCREENWRITERS' & PLAYWRIGHTS' HOME PAGE</A></B>
<P>
From Aristophanes to Alien 3, this extensive resource offers a
ton of information for drama lovers, film buffs and
professional writers alike. You'll find online scripts of
classic and contemporary plays, film reviews, screenplays, a
searchable film database, links to relevant discussion groups,
plus marketing and writing tips from the pros. All in all, we
give it two thumbs up.

<B><A NAME="SS6">SECULAR WEB: ATHEISM AND DARWIN FISH</A></B>
<P>
These folks are serious about atheism. In addition to being
philosophically interesting, this page is also rather
entertaining. Aside from the expected newsgroup archives,
FAQs, serious magazines and documents, they include links to
religious satires, Heathens & Heretics at MIT, a chance to
order the Darwin fish as a sticker or T-shirt, and a link to
the ever-relevant "Devil's Dictionary" by Ambrose Bierce (in
HTML courtesy of Project Gutenberg). Naturally there are also
links to religious servers. <A HREF="http://freethought.tamu.edu/">"http://freethought.tamu.edu/"</A>

<B><A NAME="SS7">AEON FLUX PAGE OF INTEREST TO FANS AND ARTISTS</A></B>
<P>
Aeon Flux is the lithe and lethal heroine best known for her
exploits in short animated segments on MTV's Liquid Television.
This site holds two pieces of text which are of interest to fans
of this often surreal work. An interview with Peter Chung, the
character's creator, covers his original concept and his plans for
her continuing adventures. Also of interest is a copy of the
original proposal Peter sent to MTV pitching the series. The
interview makes absorbing reading as it delves into the thinking
behind the series. Artwork also available.

<B><A NAME="SS8">THE U.S. LIBERTARIAN PARTY WEB AND FTP SITES</A></B>
<P>
America's third largest political party now
has a number of sites on the Internet. Their official site has
info on Libertarian history, philosophy and positions, directories
and lists, official documents, current activities and membership.
There is also a list of e-mail addresses for their national, state
and local officers, committees, managers and staff.

<P>
This site, the Navy's official Web presence, turns out to be a
fascinating surfing source for the curious military science
research junkie. The home page has links to a number of Navy
research labs and operational facilities worldwide, some of
them classified (those won't let you connect). You can be
thrilled by such tantalizing sites as the Space and Naval
Warfare System Command (home of the boldly named SPAWARRIOR
newsletter), read the Navy News Service which brings you
Marine Corps, Medical, and European sections, or go diving
into other Dept. of Defense sites. <A HREF="http://www.navy.mil/">"http://www.navy.mil/"</A>

<B><A NAME="SS10">ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE LIST OF RESOURCES ON FTP</A></B>
<P>
The prolific John Makulowich has given the net community another
of his excellent lists. This one, Alternative Medicine, is a list
of newsgroups, discussion groups, gopher servers, and web servers
which have information on alternative medicine. He also gives some
pointers about how he developed the list for those who would like
to develop their own lists of resources. It is available at:

<P>
The Tampa Tribune (8/15/94) reports that a CompuServe-offered
service called CompuTrace will find the last known address
for any person in the U.S. You can also find out how long
someone has had a particular phone number or lived at a
particular address and who else lives there. Information on
how to obtain driving records in every state is also
available. Scary stuff. CompuServe is not (yet?) an evil
empire, but there are plenty of such out there. Be paranoid.

<P>
Playing in a Windows 3.1 or Windows For Workgroups 3.11 theater
near you! Those wishing to put up their own Web site in a PC
Windows environment will be interested in the latest Web
server for Microsoft Windows. It closely follows the NCSA "httpd"
v1.3 Unix Web server, including common log file format,
automatic directory indexing and access authorization, etc.
Impressive features including true multi-threading of up to 8
simultaneous users. Important info and file pointer at

Created to allow graphs, charts and the like to be generated on
the fly for use on the World wide Web, but is suitable for any
application in which custom GIFs are useful. It is a library
(gd 1.0) for use by programs that wish to create GIF-format
diagrams, graphs, charts, and so on, and includes functions
for loading and manipulating existing GIF and XBM images.

<B><A NAME="SW3">EMAIL FORMS 2.0 PROVIDES SIMPLE E-MAIL FORMS SETUP </A></B>
<P>
It's a C program which can give you professional looking e-mail
forms on your Web documents. Users can mail the accounts you choose
directly from Forms capable browsers. You'll need a CGI-compliant
server (like NCSA or CERN httpd) and an ASCII standard
compiler (e.g. gcc). Simple to set up, secure, generally a
cool piece of software. Thank to Thomas Boutell.

<B><A NAME="SW4">WEBSTAT V1.4 USEFUL FEATURES, WEIRD LANGUAGE</A></B>
<P>
The package promises (and probably delivers) a raft of useful
features such as a list of usages per provided service, top
ten of accessing domains, list of accessing countries, and
list of accesses per file (page). However the author in a fit
of misguided loyalty chose to write it in some weird hybrid of
Perl and TCL called Python. We don't know anything about it,
and frankly don't have the time to learn yet another
programming language. But the Python home page does have some
sounds from Monty Python so it can't be all bad.

<B><A NAME="SW5">COMBINED LOG FILE SYSTEM FOR WWW, GOPHER, AND FTP</A></B>
<P>
Designed to enable the automatic handling of log files
generated by info-server daemons (ftp, gopher, http...) for
Internet archives. It does this by providing a combined format
for the transfers, and converting each of the raw log files
into this combined format. The results are then stored by
date/time, summarized and compressed. A complex system, aimed
at administrators but apparently it works well once configured.

<P>
It seemed to be a down year for April Fool's jokes, perhaps because so much
Net reality has become so silly to begin with. This Canadian spoof
pretended V-chip legislation was to be applied to books and fooled many
librarians. Ross Kerber of the Wall Street Journal wrote: "The librarians
hadn't noticed the April 1 date of the release. (Neither, at first, had a
certain Internet-surfing reporter, who thought he had a hot scoop in
hand.)" We like it, and doff our caps in the direction of David Jones,
president of Electronic Frontier Canada and author of the joke press

<B><A NAME="SS2">THE EASTER BUNNY LEAVES A TRAIL</A></B>
<P>
Once you get past the nauseating pink/purple rabbit fetish background (just
try to surf it early in the morning after a traditional Netsurfer
all-nighter), this is not a bad site. True, the cuteness factor is way over
the top, but forgivable given the context. There's the obligatory religious
perspective and Easter craft info, such as making natural egg dyes. But the
best parts include tips on finding eggs from savvy kids ["Cheat and watch
them hide em:)"], instructions for making mindblowing Ukranian egg designs,
and a $1000 Internet Easter egg hunt contest which is just begging for some
happy holiday hacker to whip up a Web spider. We'd tell you to "hop on
over", but you'd beat us up if we used that
kind of language. <A HREF="http://usacitylink.com/easter/default.html">"http://usacitylink.com/easter/default.html"</A>

<P>
By the time you get this, New York's Temple Emanu-El may have already
broadcast a Passover seder over the Net, but there will still be loads of
unleavened online fun. There's a collection of illustrated Haggadot (texts
outlining the ritual meal), Judaica resources, and history and virtual tour
of the Temple - the world's largest Jewish congregation. The online seder,
for which you need Xing Technologies' StreamWorks plug-in, will remain
online through April 4, 7 pm EST. This fall, the Temple plans to broadcast
High Holy Days services. <A HREF="http://emanuelnyc.org/home.html">"http://emanuelnyc.org/home.html"</A>

<P>
With 20,000 site reviews, iGuide is terrific, compendious, and compelling.
A team of journalists from print and electronic media provides slick
original content, including Web links designed around general themes such
as those on online services: books, computing, games, Internet, kids, etc.
Each theme hosts various topics; each topic has original site reviews with
links to the featured sites. The wealth of resources in the inSites
database is fascinating. Enjoy it
while it's free! Your lunch break may well become an iGuide break. A
browser that handles frames is strongly recommended. <A HREF="http://www.iguide.com/">"http://www.iguide.com/"</A>

<B><A NAME="SS5">HOLOCAUST HISTORY</A></B>
<P>
Logos Research Systems has set up a preview site for a new multimedia
CD-ROM titled "Lest We Forget - A History of the Holocaust". This is more a
tease than a full-fledged web experience, but it will give you a good sense
of what to expect from the product scheduled to be released on Holocaust
Remembrance Day (April 15). The pages contain a complete table of contents
and screen shots, and movie clips from three major topic areas. The
presentation is crisp and the content chilling, but the marketing is a
somewhat weak. There is no indication that this is a CD-ROM and there is no
pricing or order information to be found. Keep an eye on the site for more
information. <A HREF="http://www.logos.com/holocaust/MAIN.HTML">"http://www.logos.com/holocaust/MAIN.HTML"</A>

If you're the kind of person who doesn't just eat a hamburger, but eats the

get it?) site. Here you'll find your one stop animal shop, with connections
to information on Meat (all varieties), Leather, Fur, Biomedical Research,
Taxidermy, and Hunting. In the Miscellaneous section, you'll find some
interesting and thought provoking essays on plant sentience and the ethical
soundness of being an omnivore. The real PETA (People for the Ethical
Treatment of Animals) is not amused and has initiated legal action.

Consumers will enjoy "CARveat Emptor: Tricks of the Great American Car

manipulation in the auto industry. The first page alone will ring so many
bells you'll wonder how you're ever going to remember all the dos and
don'ts before the next time you're taken to the cleaners. Hard feelings are
evident - the authors recommend you take public transportation instead of a
car. Of course, car dealers too will get a lot out of this site. Visit

the answer to a qualifying question, but after that you can take on the

but still love trivia, you can submit a question for others to ponder.

This tribute to the great chanteuse, Edith Piaf, is peppered with quotes
about her from many renowned artists and RealAudio sound clips that don't
do her real justice. The sorrowful story behind the mesmerizing voice that
poured from this fragile four-foot-ten woman is mostly presented in text,
but it reads easily. For further flavor, take the tour of Paris. It's all
part of a masterful concept called Soundprint, a combo radio documentary
series/Net site. <A HREF="http://soundprint.org:80/~soundprt/more_info/piaf.html">"http://soundprint.org:80/~soundprt/more_info/piaf.html"</A>

Pitcairn Island, the paradise found by the mutineers on the HMS Bounty, has
put together a Web page to inform the Net community of its truly
fascinating history. The island currently supports a population of around
50, all of whom can trace their ancestry to Fletcher Christian and five
other Bounty mutineers.  The place names on the island (Christian's Cave,
John Catch A Cow, Bounty Bay) read like a Who's Who of the sailors who
stood up to Captain Bligh's tyranny in August 1789. Several images of the
island's more picturesque locations are available for download.

page? A great home page graphic, a text version for fast access (good
design), greetings in text and audio from the Prez and the Vice, and a
guest book complement a goofy picture of Bill and Hillary along with a
cute, politically correct, and picture-filled family bio in "First Family".
A White House tour, nice set of White House publications online, and a very
complete set of links to US Government Net resources fill out the rest.
Absolute faves: Al Gore's Cartoon Gallery under "What's New" and the cool
picture of Socks the cat, complete with an AU sound file, under "First
Family". Good design, worthy content, great netsurfing.

Cruciform is Andrew Tong's personal Web enterprise, created at the expense
of his GPA. It is quite the unusual collection. It contains a thorough
"Star Trek:TNG" page with episode synopses, trivia, and cast bios; the
disturbing "Grotesque in Art"; a Phrack magazine archive for hackers and
crackers; a library of suggested classical music essentials; and Biblical
Contradictions, in which Christian apologists explain why they aren't.
There's also some personal info. (werdna = Andrew backwards, get it?)

<P>
A great place to begin your netsurfing is University of Michigan's Clearinghouse
for Subject-Oriented Internet Resource Guides. They present over 140
topical guides to Net resources available via FTP, Gopher, and WWW. The
guides cover a diverse range of topics from theatre to chemistry to
midwifery, and are WAIS-indexed for full text searching. General Net users,
librarians, Net trainers, and Internet system designers will find these
guides useful. In honor of their first anniversary, they have updated their
Web home page with a "nifty
new low-bandwidth logo". Other Web developers need to follow suite.

State Government Network page has prominent links to both Net surfing

there are the usual links to government agencies, but also the California
Virtual Tourist, state arts and entertainment (Scottso the Clown,
Shakespeare Santa Cruz, Survival Research Laboratories), sports and

sprinkled with neat tidbits: on August 13, record high temperatures were
reached as the mercury topped off at a sizzling -37 degrees C. The Times
also contains other polar links, polar science data, and a history of polar
exploration. It's a tough life down there, so send some cheery E-Mail to

and the great sounding Chile Today - Hot Tamale's "Gourmet Peppers and Hot
Sauces from around the world". Write a letter to Santa (Santa's Hangout)
and win a sampler of all those wares.  After shopping, try the list of
Broadway shows or a tour of the various sections of New York City. Those
are somewhat interesting in text format, but could be really exciting with
some well chosen graphics and simple maps. The site has promise.
