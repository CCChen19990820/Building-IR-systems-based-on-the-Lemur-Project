<h4>The Special Problem of Caching and Copyright Protection</h4>
</center>
DRAFT: September 1, 1995 <p>

<h5>Background</h5>
          An author's exclusive right to control the making of "copies" of original works is the
fundamental building block of any copyright regime.<a href="#Caching Note 1">[NOTE 1]</a>  Application of this concept to
electronic documents on the global Internet is proving difficult, in light of the fact that "copying"
-- duplicating the information stored in binary files -- is an essential step in the transmission of
information across the Internet, and thus is required for any and all utilization of works of
authorship in this environment.  To the extent the transitory duplication of electronic files is
characterized as copying for purposes of section 106 of the U.S. Copyright Act -- a view that,
arguably, has been endorsed by several courts <a href="#Caching Note 2">[NOTE 2]</a>  and, less arguably, by the federal
government's National Information Infrastructure Working Group on Intellectual Property
<a href="#Caching Note 3">[NOTE 3]</a> -- much of what takes place over electronic networks (including the Internet) is
potentially subject to a claim of copyright infringement.<p>

          The practice of "caching" files in conjunction with currently popular software for World
Wide Web applications on the Internet illustrates the difficulties both of applying current
copyright concepts to electronic transmissions and of crafting a privilege under copyright law that
exempts legitimate caching from prima facie direct copyright infringement. <a href="#Caching Note 4">[NOTE 4]</a><p>

          Uncertainty surrounding the scope of permissible file copying threatens the continued
development of a unique communications resource, and exposes existing content and service
providers to liability for acts that virtually all participants would, ex ante, deem legitimate.  That
is, even if one believed that caching involves a prima facie infringement of the Web page owner's
exclusive right to produce "copies" of the Web page in question, it seems reasonable and
appropriate to describe basic forms of caching (such as those described in <a href="#Caching Appendix">Appendix A</a>) as
impliedly authorized by the content provider, inasmuch as they merely facilitate access to, and
utilization of, the information placed on the Web by the content provider -- to assert, in other
words, that the context in which these transactions take place, and the "custom and usage" of the
relevant community, provide sufficient authorization for basic caching transactions.<p>

          Difficulties arise, however, in trying to distinguish privileged caching of this kind from acts
of copying less clearly authorized, and in determining whether -- or to what extent -- the owner of
a web page may expressly override such implied authorization and impose restrictions and
conditions on such caching. For example, the principle that implied authorization is limited to
ephemeral copying, i.e., transitory storage in RAM, is likely to prove too narrow a privilege,
because many web browsers (including the current industry standard, Netscape) store copies of
cached material even after the session is terminated and the browser is exited (so that the next
time the browser is run, the cached files are available to it), and we see no principled reason to
distinguish between caching procedures on this basis. <a href="#Caching Note 5">[NOTE 5]</a>  On the other hand, simply
extending the privilege to all cached copies made merely to facilitate retrieval of the same material
in the future is likely to prove overbroad, because such a privilege could frustrate a content
supplier's legitimate interest in restricting secondary copying in some ways. <a href="#Caching Note 6">[NOTE 6]</a>           
Ideally, the uncertainty regarding the respective rights of web page owners and those engaged in
caching would be resolved by agreement.  The capabilities of the technology are evolving so
rapidly that no static description of rights and duties would do justice to the potential for the
relationship between those who upload web pages and those who make them available to users to
evolve. The most serious problems arise, however, when the owner of a web page seeks to
impose the terms of an "agreement," or "license" to cache, including specific restrictions that
might take many forms, by means of placing the terms and conditions of this "license" on the face
of the page or otherwise seeking to communicate conditions by means of English (or other) text. 
The problems stem from the fact that caching results from automated algorithms and occurs at a
scale that renders attention to idiosyncratic terms and conditions infeasible. <p>

          One way to avoid the problem of attempting to comply with terms and conditions on
caching imposed by the owners of web pages, purportedly based on their ownership of the
copyrighted status of the web pages coupled with the claim that caching constitutes the making of
an infringing copy (absent an express or implied license), would be to argue that the owners of
web pages do not have a right to impose such terms -- because (1) caching does not produce an
infringing copy, (2) the imposition of such terms and conditions is an abuse of copyright or an
impermissible restraint on alienation or antitrust offense, or (3) the posting of a web page
constitutes the implied grant of an irrevocable license to employ caching for the purpose of
enabling users to browse the page. Such arguments may be raised in defense against any claim of
infringement. But the better way to avoid the problem would be to foster widespread agreement
on acceptable practices or, better yet, encourage those posting web pages to EXPRESSLY assert
any conditions they wish to impose on caching, using the technical means provided by standard
protocols (and processable by standard server software).<p>

     In short, the ideal situation would be one in which the owner of a web page is permitted to
impose restrictions on caching to the extent, but only to the extent, that such restrictions are
capable of being communicated and implemented by means of the standard technical protocols
that control automatic caching algorithms. New technology will likely emerge to allow page
authors to set an expiration date for the page, and to allow server software to determine whether
the original web page has been updated since the cached copy was made. Web page owners may
well have an interest in conditioning caching, for example, on the ability to receive information
regarding the number of hits to the cached page, or on the continued ability to implement
password protections or to charge fees, or on the receipt of demographic information regarding
users of the page. We are conducting inquiries to determine the extent of other means available to
web page owners to use html to embed instructions regarding caching in web pages, which
instructions might then be carried out by servers using the http protocol. As the protocols
develop, there is every reason to believe that the community of web page authors and publishers,
Internet service providers and users will be able to reach agreement on standard protocols that
support reasonable restrictions desired by publishers but that do not interfere unduly with the
ability of service providers to render efficient access to web pages to their users.<p>

     As these technical means develop, the remaining risk will be that individual web page owners
who do not agree to use technical means to communicate and implement desired restrictions on
caching will use litigation, and claims of copyright infringement, to hold up system operators.
Resolving this problem, given the rather unique context of law-making in electronic communities,
calls for some innovative action.  Re-assessment and revision of the U.S. Copyright Act, whether
via common-law or statutory development, is not likely to be a sufficient response in light of both
the multi-jurisdictional characteristics of many of the affected transactions and the generally rather
glacial pace of common-law and statutory revision.  Particular cases could be litigated, but that
takes time and has uncertain significance in an international environment. We could attempt to
impose a requirement for express agreement to applicable terms and conditions on the part of all
who post web pages, by means of agreements imposed on service providers as a condition of
obtaining an Internet addresses -- but that seems infeasible at this time. We could try to establish a
new doctrine of international law or foster a treaty regarding the intellectual property rights
involved -- but that would be extremely difficult. And we could try to develop general agreement
among responsible netizens regarding customary practices -- but that would not necessarily
operate to override the express reservation of rights (assuming such rights exist) by web page
owners.<p>

     Accordingly, the very best means that now appear available to reduce uncertainty regarding
rights and duties applicable to web caching appears to be the strategy of building the technical
means to assert and comply with any desired restrictions into standard protocols and server
software. The easier it is for a web page owner to express desired restrictions in machine-readable
format, as part of standard protocols that the server software is readily capable of interpreting and
implementing, the harder it will be for (1) a web page owner to assert an additional right to
impose restrictions by merely asserting such rights in any other way, and (2) for a system operator
to claim a right not to comply with the desired restrictions.  In turn, the availability of such means
to implement reasonable restrictions will make it easier to assert that the "default" condition, in
the absence of the utilization of these technical procedures, is that caching can be freely utilized. 
For example, if a web page owner could easily set a bit in the html source code to instruct the
server not to cache the web page, then (1) the server could comply with that instruction (not
likely to be sent by most page owners, since it would slow user access to the page), and (2) the
web page owner can reasonably be required to use that technical means to impose the restriction
and not to use the mere assertion of a copyright and/or precatory language on the face of the page
as the means of asserting such a right.<p>

     As technical means develop to allow expression of and compliance with licensing restrictions,
we can act to build consensus that all parties should be required to use such technical means, to
the exclusion of other forms of asserting alleged legal rights. We will talk with leading copyright
experts as well as the technical community to seek to develop consensus on that proposition.

<a name="Caching Note 4"></a>Note 4.  Caching, for this purpose, is defined to mean the copying of a web page, made incidental
to the first access to the page, and storage of that copy for the purpose of speeding subsequent
access; a brief overview of caching usage is set forth in Appendix A.<p>

<a name="Caching Note 5"></a>Note 5.  That is, we are not persuaded that the distinction, central to U.S. copyright law, between
"transitory" and "non-transitory" fixation is a useful guidepost in this context.<p>

<a name="Caching Note 6"></a>Note 6.  For example, if a content provider were to attempt to impose restrictions on the content
published on the Web -- charging a fee, for example, for access to certain material -- potential
users might find it convenient to access the material on the intermediary's host computer (see
Appendix A, Example 3), thus avoiding the fee.  Or, Consumer might pay once for an access to
Content Server, but then obtain another copy from cached version on the provider's host and
make prohibited copies of that second cached copy, arguing that the restrictions applicable to the
original accessed material do not apply to material accessed from the provider's host.  Or caching
might be used to circumvent any system on Content Server that records the number of "hits" from
Consumers.    <p>

<a name="Caching Note 7"></a>Note 7.  With regard to mirroring, the situation is somewhat different. Because mirroring involves
FTP sites, it typically applies to files that can be password protected -- so technical means already
exist for the owner of the file to impose any desired restrictions. Having not done so, the owner
can be said to have granted an implied license for copying without restriction. Some owners may
argue that they did not contemplate wholesale copying for the purpose of providing a site from
which files can be downloaded for a fee. But that argument is somewhat undermined by (1) the
fact that the owner did not attempt to charge a fee and therefore loses no sought-after economic
advantage, and (2) the likely fact that the ultimate number of end users who get access to the files
is not significantly affected (or, at least, not necessarily affected in a manner adverse to that
contemplate by the act of posting the file to an open FTP site) by the number of intermediate
points from which such files may be downloaded. For the moment, we conclude that no new
technical developments would increase the degree of certainty regarding the entitlement of a
service provider to engage in mirroring and that the best arguments favor continuation of that
practice.<p>

<a name="Caching Appendix"></a><h5>Appendix A: Caching on the World Wide Web</h5>
Discussion of this issue may be facilitated by considering the following examples.              <p>

Example 1.  The simplest World Wide Web transaction involves a consumer (using some Web
browser client software) and a Web server to which the consumer has access.   The server may
provide "pointers" to other servers (in which case we can refer to the server as a "Pointer
Server"), or it may provide content that can be retrieved by the consumer ("Content Server") --
or, of course, it may be both a Pointer Server and a Content Server.  For simplicity, assume that
the World Wide Web consists of a single Pointer Server and a (large) number of Content Servers.  
    Consumer initially establishes a connection with Pointer Server to locate material of interest,
finds a pointer to an item on a particular Content Server, and clicks on this pointer.  Typically,
Pointer Server then transmits the selected pointer, in the form of a URL, to Consumer's computer,
and the web browser software running on Consumer's computer establishes a connection with
Content Server and retrieves the web file referenced by the URL.  Consumer's web browser then
caches the file thus retrieved; as a result, if Consumer requests it again, the cache copy can be
loaded directly from RAM rather than requiring another transmission over the Internet.      <p>

Example 2.  As a second example, suppose that Consumer's computer is connected through a
Local Area Network that in turn is connected to the Internet through a firewall computer.  While
there are a variety of firewall configurations, one common one would cause the firewall to serve
as a proxy for Consumer; most popular web browser applications have a proxy option to
accommodate such a firewall role. The proxy function works as follows:  when Consumer
attempts to activate a pointer on Pointer Server, the request is initially transmitted to Firewall
Computer, which duplicates the request and sends it to Pointer Server.  Pointer Server returns the
requested information (the URL pointer) to Firewall Computer, which then caches it and sends a
copy along to Consumer.  After Consumer's computer establishes the connection to Content
Server, Content Server returns the requested file to Firewall Computer; Firewall Computer caches
the file and sends a copy to Consumer's computer, which also caches it (as in example 1 above).<p>

Example 3.  As a third example, consider an information service provider such as Compuserve,
Delphi, Prodigy, or America Online. The service provider might want to provide its subscribers
with the most rapid access possible to World Wide Web documents.  It would be natural for the
service provider to design its client software to include a web browser function that would work
somewhat differently than the web browser software described in Examples 1 and 2. The service
provider's World Wide Web access system may provide for the caching of material retrieved
through the web on the service provider's host, so that if another subscriber wish to retrieve the
same material, the second subscriber could do so directly from the service provider's host
computer, without the host having to go out and fetch the material again across the Internet.<p>

Draft November 12, 1996
The Price of Netizenship

By: David R. Johnson
Introduction

        The Question Presented. Conflicts between trademark owners and
the holders of domain names issued on a first come first served
basis by those registering internet identifiers have triggered a
reassessment of basic questions regarding net governance. To the
surprise of many, it is just not clear who has the ultimate right
to set policy regarding the terms and conditions on which key net
identifiers -- IP addresses and domain names -- are issued,
"registered" and effectively reserved for continuing use (or,
indeed, revoked). Does a domain name holder have any right to
complain if the registry that reserved that address decides to
cancel it? Does a registry have a duty to cancel a block of
identifiers issued to an ISP that harbors illegal activity? Nobody
knows, because there is no consensus at the moment regarding any
particular set of terms and conditions that ought to apply as a
required condition for (1) operation of a domain name registry or
(2) the continued enjoyment of a domain name (or IP number) or
subsidiary address on the net. Thus, because owners of traditional
intellectual property in the "real world" have raised challenges
to the right of some to hold new forms of real estate and identity
in cyberspace, we now face a critical question: What terms and
conditions may (or must) be imposed, by whom, as a requirement for
granting or receiving and continuing to enjoy access to (and
identity on) the net?

        We should address this question now. To proponents of an
indefinite continuation of the form of anarchy that characterized
early development of the net, even raising the question regarding
minimum obligations for all owners of net IDs might seem like
treason or, at the least, a disastrous sign that civilization will
encroach on the freedoms that flourished online in early days. In
contrast, those who know that the current system of issuing online
identities is administered pursuant to contracts granted by the US
government, may consider the opportunity to rethink who controls
policies regarding online identity as a golden opportunity to pry
these basic questions out of the hands of unduly self-protective
bureaucratic authorities -- or to challenge the non-accountable
control actually exercised by a small technical elite. From either
perspective, the current challenge is both daunting, because it
involves figuring out the right relationship between
self-governance of the net and the application to online
activities of a multitude of local laws.  If we address the
question promptly, before local governmental authorities attempt
to extend their rules to cover the net, we may have a chance to
fashion a private contract regime that finds a workable balance
between centralized control and local diversity, that encourages
and allows experimentation while providing a stable environment
for online commerce, that protects both private property and civil
rights, and most importantly, that helps keep most of the
regulatory instincts of local governmental authorities at bay. If
we do not etsablish a private, contractually based self-governance
regime, using the allocation of net identifiers as the fundamental
legitimating and enforcement mechanism, we will face the growth of
conflicting, geographically-based regulatory regimes that impose
substantial costs and create uncertainty that will stunt the
growth of the new medium for global commerce and community.
Potential Sources of Conditions Imposed on Enjoyment of Access to
and Identity on the Net

        Traditional, geographically based laws cannot adequately
establish the conditions on net identity. It may come as a
surprise, perhaps even a dismaying one to some, that traditional
legal institutions are not well situated to control the issuance
and use of identities on the net. Obviously, each country
maintains authority to control the actions of those people and
properties (including registries) within its boundaries and over
which it has control. But, unless effectively prohibited by local
laws, a citizen of any country can establish an identity -- a
domain name or a subsidiary email address -- that is issued by
(and, directly or indirectly registered with) an authority located
in any other jurisdiction. There is no geographical limitation on
the holders of ".com" domains, much less on the location of those
to whom they in turn issue addresses and ID's. Indeed, there are
not even universal policies tying issuance of an identity based on
a top level domain tied to a particular country (e.g., ".ca" for
Canada or ".de" for Germany) in such a manner that its holder is
necessarily subject to the authority of that country. Various
countries may have registries that impose such conditions -- but
some may not.  Moreover, in theory at least, anyone anywhere in
the world can (unless local law prohibits this and is enforced)
set up a "registry" and associated lookup tables that map domain
names to IP addresses. If local ISP's point their domain name
resolution software at such root servers, then not even the
established administrators of internet technology could prevent
such an alternative registration system from arising. There is, in
short, no effective source in geographically based law for
regulation of the issuance of identities on the net.

        The technical community has not provided a complete alternative
source of policy guidance or dispute resolution.  There are well
established and functioning non-governmental institutions that
have, albeit sometimes acting under contracts with governments,
operated to administer the issuance of IP addresses and domain
name registrations.  Despite the theoretically open nature of the
internet standard, as a practical matter control over the issuance
of internet identities has been exercised by a limited number of
private parties (such as IANA, InterNIC, RIPE-NCC and AP-NIC, the
latter two of which are private consortia).  But, perhaps again
surprisingly to those newly aware of the important policy
questions raised by net-based activities, these organizations have
functioned by choice primarily as technical and ministerial bodies
-- not as policy making forums. NSI (working as the agent of
InterNIC) has promulgated some policies for dealing with trademark
disputes. But the thrust and obvious goal of its efforts has been
to avoid liability for its actions as a registry, rather than to
clarify more generally the terms and conditions applicable to
holding an online identity or owning an online space. When IP
addresses and domain names seemed in ample supply and "policy
neutral", the technical groups established first-come first-served
allocation. Now that legal conflicts have started to arise, these
same allocation mechanisms are understandably unable to help
formulate and resolve those disputes. The general attitude of the
techies who have run the net has been: "We'll obey a court order,
but keep us out of law and politics." The result has been a policy
vacuum that invites litigation and accelerates questions regarding
who, if anyone, has jurisdiction over disputes about identities
and activities on the net.

        The top level registries could establish a contract that
establishes core policies and creates an enforcement and dispute
resolution mechanism.  Another potential source for conditions to
be imposed on the ownership and use of net identities might be
contracts entered into both (1) among registries and (2) between
the registries and those who receive registered blocks of IP
numbers and particular domain name addresses. There is already in
place an informal set of agreements among registries and between
the registries and major internet service providers,  to the
effect that all will accept IP numbers allocated by the current
procedure and that all will point their domain name lookup tables
to the same roots.  The net itself arises from protocols, such as
TCP/IP, that gain their validity from widespread adoption by
individual network owners -- the kind of "agreement" that an open
standards process produces. These types of de facto agreements
among those who operate the net and the IP address block
allocation process and the domain name registries have not, yet,
addressed the question whether continued enjoyment of a domain
name or IP address ought to be conditioned upon compliance with
any particular minimum contractual terms and conditions. But they
could readily do so, simply by including such conditions in the
contracts already at least implicitly in place.

        The Internet Services Providers also impose conditions on access
to net identities, but they want and need to impose a diverse set
of policies.  Most individuals who gain access to the net obtain
an email address or space for a web page from an internet service
provider. And most ISPs require that the user sign a contract
including various conditions on continued access to that
identifier or, indeed, reserving the right to cancel the ID at any
time for any reason. But these conditions are not uniform. Some
ISPs (like AOL) have elaborate "terms of service" and actively
enforce at least some content and online conduct standards. Others
are much more permissive policies or, at the extreme, promise
users not to monitor or interfere in any way even with otherwise
"public" online activities. Some ISPs demand extensive informaton
regarding the real world identities of their users; some require
no information at all. Moreover, users dissatisfied with the
policies of one ISP can relatively quickly move to another
provider. As more people invest more time and effort in building
up the reputation attached to a particular online identity (an
email address or screen name), there will be some questions
regarding a right to portability or a right to due process before
extinction of an online name. But, for the moment, the mobility of
online users and the number of competing sources for individual
online identifiers means that ISPs could not themselves serve as
the source of any standardized, minimum uniform set of terms and
conditions attached to online access or identity. The work of
creating a core set of obligations associated with online access
-- establishing the "price of netizenship" -- will have to be
done, if at all, by the central registries that hand out blocks of
IP addresses and register domain names.

What ought to be the Price of Netizenship?

        The adoption by most registries of some minimal set of terms and
conditions attaching to the continued use of a net ID -- and an
agreement on the procedures to be used to apply those terms to
specific situations and to resolve disputes -- would create the
foundation for an enforceable regime of self-regulation for the
net.  But the governments of the world would only defer to such a
regime if it were considered "responsible". And the private
participants would only go along with this regime if it served
their interests in facilitating the new electronic trade. What can
we say, in advance, regarding which contractual terms would be
likely to meet these criteria -- gaining widespread agreement from
private parties and convincing governments to accept the results?
Let's examine that question at two different levels: (1) the
conditions registries are likely to want to impose on one another,
and (2) the conditions they are likely to agree to impose on
registrants (and, indirectly, on the registrants' subsidiary
grantees).

Conditions for Operating A Registry -- to be Agreed Upon Among
Registries

        Coordination. The most obvious term of agreement among registries
-- which is already in effect as a practical matter -- is
agreement to stay within the bounds of the blocks of IP addresses
and domain name spaces allocated to them. No one in the business
of registering net identifiers would want to be involved in a
system in which two different registries, in an uncoordinated
fashion, could give the same address to two different people (or
map the same domain name to two different IP addresses, or reserve
a port number for two incompatible services). This is not to say
that there might not be competition among registries to issue
addresses drawn from a central registry. There may be room for
competition on service even with regard to issuance of the same
block of potential addresses. But, ultimately, identifiers must be
unique to be useful and, therefore, those who seek to add value to
the online world will want to coordinate to produce useful,
non-confusing, consistent identifiers and associated
registrations.

        Payment of Fees. A second goal shared by all registries is the
enforcement of obligations to pay any fees due for the
registration (and policy making) service. There might be price
competition among those who charge fees for registration services
-- and there might be multiple parties with authority to issue
identities drawn from the same general block (with coordination by
means of a central meta-registration database). But, even if there
were some competition, all involved would want to make sure that
the fees they charged could be collected. So all might agree, for
example, that a domain name ought not be allowed to be transferred
from one IP address to another such address if they payments
clearly due to the previous registry have not been made.

        Security.  Insofar as net identifiers are used to authenticate
messages, it will become increasingly important to be able to be
sure that the source of a message is accurately reflected in the
identifying data. And it will be correspondingly important to
limit access to the right to change contact information and other
indicia of ownership of online identities. The registries will
thus have an incentive to cooperate to establish minimum security
practices.

        Dispute Resolution. Another key issue on which most registries of
internet addresses and identities will want to agree is how to
resolve disputes.  By contract among themselves (and, as more
fully discussed below, by means of contracts they agree to enter
into with their customers as a condition for registration), the
registries could require resort to some form of arbitration --
perhaps online arbitration that looks to a uniform body of law
developed with a view to fostering the growth of the net. Such
private agreements requiring arbitration are broadly enforceable
in the international context -- more easily enforced, in fact,
than the judgments of local courts. Most or all registries will
have an interest in obtaining the agreement of most or all
registries to impose such conditions -- because some of the
challenges aimed at any particular registry may come from parties
that have a need for registration with another authority. If
access to net identifiers is generally conditioned on a promise to
arbitrate disputes relating to the net, then the registries and
their customers will be spared lots of expensive litigation.

        Rules Designed to Preempt "Real World" Disputes.  It may turn out
to be advantageous for registries to adopt uniform practices
designed to defuse controversies with those who feel threatened by
online activity. For example, disputes and law suits regarding
alleged "infringement" or "dilution" of trademark rights might be
kept to a minimum by a set of practices that reserve domain names
that resemble "famous" marks for registration by those who have
obtain the most extensive protection of such marks in the "real
world" (by registering the marks in multiple jurisdictions). Such
practices might be adopted by registries taking action
independently from one another. But a uniform "trade practice"
would have some advantages in providing protection to those who
adopt it -- insofar as it serves as a measure of what actions are
commercially reasonable.

Minimum Terms Applicable to Registrants -- to be Established as
Conditions for Access, by Ageement Among Participating Registries

        The most important question posed for the registries as a group
is what set of terms and conditions, if any, to agree, mutually,
to establish as requirements for registration of net addresses and
identifiers. One possibility is that there might be no agreement
on any such "mandatory minimum" terms. This would maximize
innovation and diversity -- but it would also cripple any effort
to persuade local governments to refrain from regulation of the
net. If there is no "price of netizenship", then there is no
credible claim that the net is engaged in responsible
self-regulation or that the most serious forms of misconduct that
might be engaged in online will not be harbored for long but will
instead by rooted out by means of banishment.  At the other
extreme, an elaborate contract that established detailed
conditions for net access would be difficult to sell. No global
consensus could be achieved on many issues. So any agreed-upon
"flow down" conditions must be carefully limited.  Consider the
following areas on which agreement to impose minimum requirements
as a condition for issuance of a net identity might be reached:

        Fraud Prohibited. It is not now an express condition for
obtaining an IP address or domain name that the recipient promises
not to engage in or facilitate fraud. On the other hand, most ISPs
would quickly terminate the email address of a user found to have
engaged in such activity. Fraud differs from other controversial
online activities because the presence of such activity undermines
confidence in the entire online marketplace.  Of course, it should
quickly be noted that different people and cultures may have
differing views regarding what constitutes self-interested
deception. But those differences would not necessarily prevent the
entry into and enforcement of an agreement, and associated dispute
resolution procedures, that are designed to stamp out at least
those kinds of activities that most obviously threaten confidence
in online commerce. There will be serious questions of due process
and line drawing. But it seems likely that holding and using an
online address, obtained from a mainstream registry, will become
conditioned an on express undertaking not to engage dishonest
actions for personal gain (and an accompanying commitment to
submit disputes to a particular dispute resolution process.)

        Other Crimes Against the Net Prohibited.  There may well be other
actions that are generally agreed to be so disruptive of online
commerce that most or all registries will agree to make their
registrants promise not to engage in such actions.  The
intentional launching of destructive software code might be one
such example. It is the equivalent of the use of "force" --
because, unlike the passive software filters and labels to which
others can readily response with technological countermeasures,
destructive code is specifically designed to defeat
self-protective measures and to impose the will of the individual
propounder on the net as a whole.  Surely, any registry or ISP
found harboring a person who regularly sends out computer viruses
would be cut off from the central cooperating domain. Elimination
of net identifiers (and establishment of filters to stop all
incoming messages from "outlaw" domains) may be the best way to
control such activity -- likely more effective than any
geographically based law enforcement.

        Dispute Resolution and Enforcement. The registries would probably
agree to require all registrants to resolve all disputes regarding
use of the net by means of the same international arbitration
process the registries use to resolve disputes among themselves.
This would increase efficiency, of course, but its other primary
positive effect would be to produce a consistent "law" applicable
to all participants in the net.  Moreover, because many of those
who now use traditional courts to challenge the right to hold and
use particular net identifiers (e.g., on trademark grounds) want
to obtain such identifiers themselves, imposing an obligation to
arbitrate disputes about online activities as a condition of
access to net identity could serve to prevent a good deal of
counterproductive litigation that might produce inconsistent and
confusing results. Much attention will need to be paid to making
any such arbitration regime fair and expert and reasonably
responsive to the interests of key constituencies. But a regime of
arbitration established by private contract seems likely to be the
most responsive and effective means of deploying the power of
"banishment" to counter the two great evils of  "fraud" and
"force" online.

        Disclosure of Rules. Even if the central registries did not agree
to impose an elaborate set of  standardized conditions on all
registrants, they might nevertheless agree that each separate
registry, operating at its own discretion within the resulting
realm of permissible options, must disclose clearly the conditions
it has imposed on registrants. And another such condition might
well be a requirement that registrants themselves clearly identify
the conditions they impose on and enforce against their subsidiary
grantees.  The key to reconciling meaningful self-regulation with
diversity may be mandatory disclosure -- designed to allow all
concerned to adjust their own behavior based on the known
practices of others.  For example, it may be impossible (and might
be unwise) to reach general agreement on a single set of rules
applicable to authentication of users, protection of the privacy
of information about or communications by users, the rights of
participants in online forums to copy or republish material
originating in such forums, the rights of certain types of
organizations to own and operate online identities as a group, or
the standards applicable to content control. What is critical, for
responsible self-regulation of the net, is not that such rules be
uniform, but, rather, that the rules applicable to any particular
online space be clearly disclosed and conveniently ascertainable
by those who might want to avoid (or seek out) particular rule
sets (or who might want to avoid contact with those who follow, or
decline to follow) particular practices.

        Candidates for mandatory disclosure include all the issues that
press the hot buttons of governments and net users. For example,
even if we allow some users to remain anonymous, each holder of an
online identity might well be required to indicate in some fashion
whether or not information about the "real world" identity of the
user is available, directly or from the sysop or higher level
domain name holder, and upon what terms and conditions such
information is available. That way, those who want to avoid
dealing with anonymous parties can set their own software to
filter out such communications. Local government that want to
allow or prohibit their local citizenry to engage in anonymous
communications can do so without seeking to regulate the entire
net. And, while the resulting mixed regime will likely please no
one, it will allow diversity and empower individual choice.
Insofar as users of the net can readily determine with whom they
deal, the resulting diversity will best serve the growth and free
flow of global commerce, while also allowing those who seek to
live within a specific set of rules governing online trade to do
so.

Constraints on this Contracting Process

        Should we be concerned that, once registration contracts contain
any conditions at all they will evolve to include oppressive
limitations on the rights of all net users? I don't think so. The
ultimate decision-maker as to which activities are so seriously
wrongful that they ought to be cause for banishment would be the
collection of registries, which would seek to serve the interests
of a diverse, global constituency. If a substantial minority of
registries disagreed with a majority, they would be free to form
their own coalition with different rules.  That might be a painful
choice -- but the pain would also be felt by those from whose
coalition the dissenters defect. Because relatively widespread
agreement on a few enforceable core rules will be most valuable to
the majority of registries and their constituents, those
attempting to press for conditions that go beyond the core
consensus (prohibiting "fraud" and "force") will likely fail.
(Even an effort to agree on a general formula, such as a required
promise not to use the net to "conspire to violate applicable
local law", would soon unravel as participants realized that (1)
what is unlawful in one country may be constitutionally protected
in another and (2) determining which local government's law should
apply to activities online is a very difficult if not inherently
incoherent exercise.) The need for an agreement among a large
number of international actors will tend to keep the power of the
central registries in check.

        Perhaps the contracting process would prove partially
ineffective.  As noted, no registry can be forced (by the rest) to
go along with any particular version of the contract. On the other
hand, there is reason to think that a generally acceptable set of
agreements would gain widespread acceptance -- in part because the
ISPs and users who agree to live within one particular set of
rules and dispute resolution procedures might well decide to
filter out messages from, and to avoid, online spaces living under
a different regime. While there is a risk that some registry might
become a haven for wrongdoers, such an online venue could be
shunned as a "den of thieves" and the IDs it creates would likely
be filtered out. If an outlaw registry persisted in issuing net
identities that could not be so filtered or that were designed to
be confusing or to conflict with those issued by others, the
coalition of registries would be justified in seeking the help of
local law enforcement authorities to eliminate this practice. And
the registry that tolerated such activity would, unlike individual
wrongdoers, be relatively easy to find and discipline.

        A key remaining question is whether a contractually-based
self-governance regime constructed in this way would, ultimately,
be deemed "responsible" by the governments that would otherwise
feel impelled to regulate online activity. Only time will provide
the answer to this question. But there is reason for hope that
governments can be persuaded to defer to such a regime. For
starters, the power of the registries to banish users provides a
much more effective enforcement tool than might otherwise be
available to any particular government. Moreover, the contractual
regime decentralizes (and largely privatizes) all the costs of
enforcement and dispute resolution. Some governments may want to
become a party to any contractual regime, insofar as they
administer their own top level domains (e.g., ".gov") and need to
coordinate with other registries. It would be hard for governments
to both agree to the contract and to challenge this contractually
based regime.  In addition, the contracting parties in aggregate
possess the necessary mastery of technical issues and the ability
to react quickly to fast developing policy issues, to a much
greater degree than do governmental bodies. Most importantly, the
private contracting parties can determine what key provisions the
governments consider to be essential and take action to defuse
threatened confrontations. An ongoing conversational process among
registries, governments, and end users, will probably lead to
contractual provisions that protect the vital interests that
governments seek to protect, without imposing new enforcement
burdens on limited government resources and without sacrificing
the fundamental freedoms (any assault on which would cause
netizens to move on to less regulated territory).

Conclusion

        The dispute between domain name registries and trademark owners,
seemingly a minor quarrel of interest primarily to a small group
of intellectual property lawyers and techies, has opened up a
series of vital questions regarding who governs the net. Because
online identifiers and addresses are the core requirement for
participation in the net, the conditions that may or may not be
imposed on their use are fundamental to the preservation of both
property rights and individual freedoms in this new sphere of
human endeavor. Because local governments lack jurisdiction -- and
a clue -- we cannot look to them to set applicable rules. In
contrast, because the central ID registries and their sysop
registrants hold the on-off switches that provide a means of
enforcement, we can look to agreements among these private parties
as the source of responsible self-regulation of net based
commerce.  We will need to redefine due process in this new
context, because the procedures for making the law of the net will
not resemble the assembly of legislatures, the issuance of binding
court decrees or even the solemn entry into international
treaties. To the contrary, the law of the net will be made around
a bargaining table, by private agreements, among those who, more
than any others, wish the net well. Perhaps the most fundamental
protection for freedom, in this context, will remain the ability
of the user -- and even the ISP and registry -- to refuse to agree
to any particular set of contractual provisions.   The "price of
netizenship" will mostly likely be (1) an agreement not to engage
in fraud or actions destructive to the net as a whole and (2)
continuous  involvement in a negotiation process -- between users
and sysops, between sysops and address dispensers, between address
dispensers and registries, and ultimately among registries -- a
new form of collective "eternal vigilance", if you will -- that in
aggregate determines the terms and conditions under which online
identities and addresses are made available and revoked.

<H2>And How Shall the Net Be Governed?</H2>

<H3>A Meditation on the Relative Virtues of Decentralized, Emergent Law</H3>

<h4>By: David R. Johnson & David G. Post</h4>
<P>

Introduction 

<P>
	Now that lots of people use (and plan to use) the internet, many  -- governments, 
businesses, techies, users and system operators (the "sysops" who control ID issuance and 
the servers that hold files) -- are asking how we will be able to<br> 

	<P>(1) establish and enforce baseline rules of conduct that facilitate reliable 
communications and trustworthy commerce, and<br> 

	<P>(2) define, punish and prevent wrongful actions that trash the electronic commons 
or impose harm on others.<br>   

<P>In other words, how will Cyberspace be governed, and by what right?  

<P>	By creating a new global, border-disregarding, place that cannot readily be 
controlled by any existing sovereign -- an argument we make in more detail in our paper 
"Law and Borders:  The Rise of Law in Cyberspace," available at 
http://www.cli.org/X0025_LBFIN.html -- the net weakens many of the institutions that 
we have come to rely on for a solution to the basic problems of collective action -- the 
selection of means by which individuals coordinate and order their interactions so as to 
achieve what they believe is a greater good. Thus, the very nature and growing importance 
of the net calls for a fundamental re-examination of the institutional structure within which 
rulemaking -- at least as applicable to the activities conducted solely on the net -- takes 
place. As more fully discussed below, that re-examination might lead us to conclude that 
the net allows the problem of collective action to be solved by a new, decentralized 
process that does not closely resemble those we have used in the past to pass laws and 
enforce behavioral norms.

<P>	Questions about whether and how the net shall be governed are now arising most 
pointedly in connection with the issuance of domain names (like "ibm.com"). Domain 
names are translated by means of lookup tables distributed across the net into the IP 
addresses (like "123.45.67.89") that determine how messages are routed over the net. 
Because domain names are easier to remember than long strings of numbers, and because 
top level domains are often used in email addresses (like "fred@ibm.com"), they have 
become a particularly valuable form of  "virtual real estate".  Yet, despite their value and 
importance, it is far from clear who (if anyone) has the authority to determine who has the 
right to use any particular domain name (and on what terms and conditions they have that 
right), or to establish the basic structure of the domain name system -- the combination of 
technical standards and trade practices pursuant to which domain names are registered and 
the associated lookup tables are distributed across the net.
	
<P>	As described in RFC 1591 (available at http://ds.internic.net/rfc/rfc1591.txt), the 
Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA)<br> 
<P>
"is responsible for the overall coordination and management of the 
Domain Name System (DNS), and especially the delegation of 
portions of the name space called top-level domains.  Most of these 
top-level domains are two-letter country codes taken from the ISO 
standard 3166.  A central Internet Registry (IR) has been selected 
and designated to handled the bulk of the day-to-day administration 
of the Domain Name System.  Applications for new top-level 
domains (for example, country code domains) are handled by the IR 
with consultation with the IANA.  The central IR is 
INTERNIC.NET.  Second level domains in COM, EDU, ORG, 
NET, and GOV are registered by the Internet Registry at the 
InterNIC.  . . . Currently, the RIPE NCC is the regional registry for 
Europe and the APNIC is the regional registry for the Asia-Pacific 
region, while the INTERNIC administers the North America 
region, and all the as yet undelegated regions."
<P>
	Although both IANA and InterNIC (which has delegated the DNS administration 
to Network Solutions, Inc. (NSI), a private company) receive US government funds for 
their operation, no contract, constitution, or treaty gives either these bodies or the US 
Government the right to set policy regarding domain names on the global network.  Nor 
do these bodies have any obviously valid claim to make the exclusive delegation of 
registration duties.  The financial support provided by the US Government has not given it 
ownership of any intellectual property or physical asset essential (other than in the very 
short term) to the operation of a domain name system. To the contrary, domain name look 
up tables function because local hosts point their domain name servers at these tables; a 
form of custom, and not 'law,' dictates the particular root servers to which local hosts 
point for this information.

<P>	The current uncertainty regarding governance of the domain name system extends 
to much more than the technical standards governing domain name registration and 
selection of root servers. Basic economic and policy questions remain unanswered. At 
present, NSI (with NSF's blessing) demands payment for registration of domain names.  
But, again, no statute or international convention -- nor even a universal acceptance of 
trade practice -- clearly legitimizes NSI's right to charge that fee (or justifies any particular 
amount that might be charged). Nor is there any obvious source of guidance regarding 
what other conditions (such as a promise to abide by particular laws, to resolve disputes in 
a specified manner, or to waive certain claims) may be imposed as a prerequisite to 
domain name registration. Thus, no one can now say that any given condition must, may, 
or may not be imposed as a minimum requirement for this particular passport to 
"netizenship".  Nor do any of the many different private and governmental organizations 
that are currently discussing a range of questions in this area -- e.g., how many "top level 
domains" should be allowed, whether multiple registries should be allowed to compete, 
and what duties might reasonably be imposed on those who operate registries -- have an 
uncontested or clearly legitimate claim to the authority to decide these matters unilaterally. 

<P>	These questions are of crucial strategic importance, despite the uncertainty 
surrounding them, because only through an IP address and an association of that address 
with a findable reference, whether through a domain name or a directory, can an individual 
meaningfully enter Cyberspace in the first instance. An IP address block and a Domain 
Name are necessary to become a sysop offering access to the net.. Domain name based 
email addresses are the essence of online identity for individual users.  Dispensers of those 
virtual addresses thus stand at the border checkpoint between the virtual and the non-
virtual world, and the contract pursuant to which one receives a domain name or other 
online ID can potentially serve as the means -- perhaps the most effective means -- by 
which the most basic rights and obligations of all Cyberspace participants can be 
specified.  

<P>	Thus, although the current domain name policy debate appears to apply primarily 
to ministerial duties performed by a registry, for the purpose of avoiding duplicative 
names, the contracts entered into with such a registry (and any associated subsidiary 
contracts through which individual users contract with the domain name/address-holder to 
obtain access to the net) could prove of primary importance in determining both the 
degree of freedom and the level of order on the net.

<h4>Why Must the Net Be "Governed" At All?</H4>

<P>	Some may ask why the net must be "governed" at all?  Even the three judge 
Federal court in Philadelphia that threw out the Communications Decency Act on First 
Amendment grounds seemed thrilled by the "chaotic" and seemingly ungovernable 
character of the net. And the net now prospers precisely because of its decentralized 
architecture and the absence of centralized rule-making authority.  Everyone who can buy 
a computer and has access to the global telephone network is free to establish a node on 
the net. Everyone is free to create editorial value by pointing to others' creations. New 
users connect by agreement with any nearby node or by getting an email address from any 
commercial or non-commercial supplier. Lots of systems have lots of different rules 
governing the behavior of users, and users -- at least in most countries -- are free to leave 
any system whose rules they find oppressive. Some systems demand full identification 
from users; some allow or even encourage anonymity. Some impose editorial controls to 
create "kid friendly" or "lawyer friendly" environments; others act more like common 
carriers who accept all comers. Some require and enforce promises to abide by traditional 
copyright laws; others require all participants to waive claims that interfere with 
redistribution of the materials users post online. And, up until now, access by sysops to 
domain names and IP addresses that make it possible to settle new territory in Cyberspace 
has not been conditioned on any required promises to comply with (or to require users to 
comply with) specific laws or behavioral standards. That has, to be sure, left sysops free to 
impose their own rules on end users. But the diversity of differing venues on the net, and 
the ability of users to decide where to visit (and where not to visit) and with whom to 
communicate, has tended both to keep sysop tyranny in check and to limit the adverse 
impact of wrongdoing by individual users.

<P>	This decentralized decision-making has helped to make it possible for large 
numbers of people with different goals to get interconnected.  But the problem of 
collective action remains and, indeed, grows more urgent as the net becomes larger and 
more complex.  Anarchy, after all, has costs. It just won't do for packets, for example, to 
be systematically misrouted. People won't trust their important commercial and private 
dealings to a network where a domain name might be translated to a different IP address 
depending on where the message happens to originate. Nor, indeed, will large numbers of 
users visit online spaces if they encounter systematic fraud or vandalism or other activities 
they view as harmful or antisocial. There are activities that, when permitted even in only a 
few online venues, impose costs on all others, and against which individuals may want to 
protect themselves.  Spamming is a form of wrongdoing that may be beyond the capacity 
(or desire) of a particular local sysop to control but that can make lots of users of lots of 
other systems miserable. The same could be said of launching destructive code. Some web 
pages may invade your privacy on contact. Some parts of the electronic forest path may 
even be conducive to highway robbery. As the global village transforms itself into complex 
electronic city, crime cannot be far behind.  If the natural result of decentralized activities 
on the net were the development of unpredictable technical environments and unsafe social 
spaces, then calls for top down, centralized forms of collective action would become 
louder and more persuasive.  Thus, even with respect to activities that take place solely on 
the net, we face the questions whether and how to generate and enforce rules to control 
anti-social users and the sysops who tolerate them.
	
<P>	Moreover, the net can be used to facilitate communications among individuals 
whose online actions impose harm even on those who only frequent the nonvirtual world. 
Most real world communities will want to be assured that the net will not be used 
systematically to undercut their security.  Online tax havens could harm the physical 
infrastructure of local communities that lose tax revenues.  Online conspiracies to commit 
violence in the real world will surely draw a response from the potential victims. 
Accordingly, both users of the net and all of those affected by their actions will likely 
demand some form of "governance" or "order" that prevents wrongdoing. The key 
question now posed, in connection with the domain name system and derivatively with 
respect to every other aspect of online interaction, is whether that governance must take 
the traditional form of centralized, top down lawmaking or whether, instead, the nature of 
the net allows decentralized creation of another, very different, form of public order.
<P>
<h4>Competing Models</h4>

<P>	There are four basic competing models for the governance of the global net. 

<P>		First, existing territorial sovereigns can simply seek to extend their 
jurisdiction, and to amend their laws as necessary, to attempt to govern all actions on the 
net that have substantial impacts on their own citizenry.  

<P>		Second, sovereigns can enter into multi-lateral international agreements to 
establish new and uniform rules specifically applicable to conduct on the net. 

<P>		Third, a new international organization can attempt to establish new rules -
- and new means of enforcing those rules and of holding those who make the rules 
accountable to appropriate constituencies.

<P>		Fourth, de facto rules may emerge as a result of the complex interplay of 
individual decisions by domain name and IP address registries (regarding what conditions 
to impose on possession of an online address), by sysops (regarding what local rules to 
adopt, what filters to install, what users to allow to sign on, and with which other systems 
to connect) and by users (regarding which personal filters to install and which systems to 
patronize).

<P>	We believe that, in part because of serious problems with the first three, traditional 
models, and in part because of the surprising ability of decentralized action to address 
serious problems that might previously have been thought to require "top down" 
centralized law making by a sovereign with a monopoly on the authorized use of force, the 
net may well be capable of being "governed" primarily by the fourth method -- a 
mechanism that Tom Bell (following Hayek) calls "polycentric law" (see the article by that 
name at http://osf1.gmu.edu/~ihs/w91issues.html) and that we will call "decentralized, 
emergent law."  The decentralized, emergent form of collective action involves voluntary 
acceptance of standards (or, as the Internet Engineering Task Force motto would have it: 
"rough consensus and working code"). Despite the fears of those who cannot conceive of 
order as arising from anything other than top down, hierarchical control, this is not a 
process that necessarily leads to chaos and anarchy. To the contrary, the technical 
protocols of the net have in effect created a complex adaptive system that produces a type 
of order that does not rely on lawyers, court decisions, statutes, or votes. We will argue 
that the same decentralized decisionmaking that created the net at a technical level may be 
able to create a workable and, indeed, empowering and just form of order even at the 
highest level of the protocol stack -- the realm of rules applicable to the collective social 
evaluation and governance of human behavior.  

<P>	Because decentralized action may well be capable of generating responsible self-
regulation of the net, those who propose other forms of collective action might be best 
advised to hold off any efforts to achieve top down control -- lest they prematurely 
preempt the growth of what might be the most efficient and empowering form of net 
governance. Existing sovereigns need not waive their ultimate power to take action to 
protect the well-being of their citizens, of course. But they should sensibly defer action to 
see whether the collective actions of domain name registries, sysops and users produces a 
set of operational rules that provides reasonable protection for the vital interests they are 
charged to protect. If the net is allowed to develop a responsible self-regulatory structure, 
by means of decentralized, emergent law making, and if this new mechanism proves up to 
the task of building a productive and non-predatory order, then all concerned will have 
saved the large resources that might otherwise have been spent trying, perhaps without 
similar success, to impose rules from a centralized source.
<P>	
<h4>The Problems with Traditional Models for Centralized, Top Down Governance, as 
Applied to the Net</h4>

<P>	1.  Geographically-Based Law.  

<P>	The non-geographic character of the net makes it very difficult to apply current, 
territorially-based rules to activities online. See "Law and Borders: The Rise of Law in 
Cyberspace" at http://www.cli.org/X0025_LBFIN.html.  Local sovereigns may have a 
monopoly on the lawful use of physical force, but they cannot control online actions 
whose physical location is irrelevant or cannot even be established. 

<P>	To be sure, any local sovereign can seek to control the persons within its 
geographic jurisdiction. Thus, it has not escaped the attention of current governments that 
system operators collectively hold the effective monopoly on the "lawful use of electronic 
force" with regard to actions on the net -- at least with respect to the admission of users 
and messages into their own online areas. Moreover, because sysops must have physical 
hard disks that are present within particular territorial areas, they are clearly subject to the 
jurisdiction of the countries where they conduct their operations. The US could pass a law 
threatening to shut down the operations of all sysops within its reach that do not abide by 
specific rules. And, if such a bill were to pass, substantial compliance by US-based systems 
would surely follow. 

<P>	But overly aggressive regulation operates to drive disfavored activities "offshore" -
- what Michael Froomkin and others have described as "regulatory arbitrage" -- and to 
disconnect the local territory from the new, valuable global trade. And any legal doctrine 
that gives the right of regulation of the net to one country (or state, county or city) must 
give that right to all sovereigns -- with resulting conflicts that render any such system 
internally contradictory and totally unworkable. The US will surely resist assertions of 
jurisdiction by other countries over servers within its own territory. And other countries 
would just as surely reject any effort to impose US law on the rest of the world. 

<P>	The problem with using existing territorial governments as the source of rules for 
activity on the net is not merely that such rules are unlikely to have universal, long-term 
impact; it is that no existing sovereign possesses the legitimate authority to make such 
rules.  This model of governance represents, in effect, an extra-territorial power grab when 
transposed to the net, a form of colonialism long rejected (and rightly so) in the non-
virtual context.  Not only are the political institutions of established sovereigns not well 
suited to create wise rules for the net -- because any sovereign's rules for online conduct, 
even if they are arrived at democratically, do not take into account the interests of all of 
those who are affected by those rules when they are implemented in the online world -- no 
country's efforts to "plant its flag" on the net and in effect declare sovereignty over the net 
is more clearly grounded in legitimatacy than any other's, and is going to -- and should -- 
be met with fierce resistance.
<P>
<P>	2.  International Treaties.  

<P>	The problems raised by conflicts between national laws, and the ability of users and 
sysops to flee (virtually) across physical borders, might be addressed by means of creating 
a uniform law of the net by treaty. But this second model for governance also has many 
problems. The treaty process is agonizingly slow, especially in contrast to the extremely 
rapid development of new technologies, new behaviors, and new governance issues, on 
the net. Moreover, it is not clear that any treaty process could obtain agreement from all 
nations -- and, again, the opportunities for regulatory arbitrage in such contexts, and the 
negative externalities created by actions sanctioned in countries that do not agree with the 
majority, are likely to be substantial. It's one thing to live with the fact that some few 
countries sanctions fraud (or, for example, gambling of a type banned locally), when those 
countries are far away and hard to get to. It's quite another thing to have every tax-haven 
or money-laundering-friendly sovereign right next door electronically.  No treaty regime is 
likely to succeed in imposing any uniform rules on the net unless every sovereign whose 
citizens connect to the net joined in the agreement. The very difficulty of that task -- and 
the increasing rewards to those who disagree with the majority view and invite widely 
condemned activities under their protective sovereign umbrella -- suggests that the treaty 
route to net governance is unlikely to be enormously successful. 

<P>	Even if some core principles for the governance of the net could be agreed upon by 
treaty, such an agreement would almost certainly take the form of a high level document 
written with a fair degree of generality. But the devil is in the details. The net continuously 
presents novel questions that test our prior understandings of law -- and many of those 
questions need rapid resolution if the potential for development of new forms of business 
and community on the net is to be realized. For example, a new treaty might declare that 
copyright law is applicable to the net (or, if the US has it way, might even amend that law 
in various ways). But such a treaty would not likely resolve the question whether caching 
a web page under certain conditions is permitted by an implied license. Such a treaty 
would not likely make clear whether and how to apply US-based First Amendment 
doctrines to web sites outside the US. Such a treaty would not likely provide for 
sufficient, low cost, easily accessible dispute resolution procedures to give those arguing 
about whether some posting represents a "fair use" meaningful guidance. The bottleneck 
characteristics of any any centralized law-making machinery, and the natural frailties of 
law-making processes based on writing authoritative texts --  make centralized systems 
unsuitable for tackling a diverse, rapidly changing, large scale set of problems -- like those 
posed by the net.

<P>	3.  International Organizations

<P>	Suppose we created a new international organization, not tied (directly or by 
treaty) to the sovereign power of any territorial government, whose mission was merely to 
establish and enforce the most basic rules for the net (such as the key conditions 
associated with establishing a domain name registry or holding a domain name and  IP 
address). This third model could avoid some of the problems identified above, because it 
would not be tied to a particular territory or need to obtain, as a condition of addressing 
any particular issue, the agreement of all interested governments. But it would create new 
problems of its own. While some territorial governments might be content to defer to such 
a self-regulatory regime, how could such a non-governmental organization impose its rules 
on the net as a whole? Even if it somehow controlled the current domain name system, 
how could it prevent the creation of a new one?  And by what right would any such 
organization "govern"?

<P>	The problems with any "top down" governance of the net, even by an institution 
specially created for that purpose, become apparent if we try to apply democratic values -- 
as surely we would, and should -- in this new environment.  To prevent domination of 
some global governance body by any single group, the "legislative" arm would have to be 
held accountable by means of some form of election of representatives. But who would be 
represented, given a world in which the notion of separate "individuals" is virtually 
meaningless? Should we have an upper house elected by current domain name holders and 
a lower house representing those who merely have email addresses? How could we 
prevent -- or even define -- vote fraud in an environment in which identity on the net need 
not trace back to unique, singular identity in the real world? Should we allow for 
representation by constituencies who are importantly affected by online activities but who 
are not themselves online? We intuitively believe that "top down" governance mechanism 
for the net should be made accountable to relevant constituencies.  But, once we abandon 
as unworkable the current system of national sovereignties as the source of such 
accountability,  it's not easy to find an acceptable alternative.

<P>	More fundamentally, what would keep such a governance mechanism from being 
captured by factions?  The right to set the rules for the global network would be too 
valuable not to become the focus of intense factional strife or, worse, to be bought. This is 
especially troubling in light of  the ability of oppressive majorities to use the net itself to 
marshal support for their cause.  As Phil Agre has pointed out to us, Madison's optimism 
in Federalist 10 about the ability of a large geographic territory to damp down the 
influence of factions is seriously undermined by the use of global communications. At a 
minimum, the risk of corruption would be heightened by the absence in this context of 
intermediary social institutions of the type that can contend for influence and generally 
prevent extremism and oppression. Thus, even if we could create an apparently 
satisfactory method for making a new international governance mechanism "accountable", 
any such mechanism might all too rapidly be captured, by one means or another, by special 
interests.

<P>	Moreover, even if we could devise some sort of centralized "governance" 
mechanism that would be consistently and appropriately politically responsive to online 
constituencies, it is far from clear how we could protect the most basic rights of unpopular 
minorities or of those whose property the majority might prefer to take. Without a 
judiciary and a bill of rights, any such institution would find it all too easy to pick on the 
weakest sysops and users. It is not easy to set up an appropriate balance of powers within 
a new organization with quasi-governmental powers when the participants and 
constituents come from geographic places that have widely divergent views regarding 
democratic institutions, centralized authority and even "fairness" itself. And, even if we 
could write a "bill of rights" for the net and create a judiciary branch capable of 
interpreting it, such mechanisms would deal only with the most fundamental problems -- 
hardly supplying an appropriate source for the myriad decisions that must be made, 
somehow, every day regarding whether some particular online behavior is or is not 
permitted in the context in which it occurs.

<h4>Can Net Policies and Rules be Made and Enforced without Centralized Decision-
Making?</h4>

<P>	We certainly do not mean to suggest that the governance models sketched out 
above will have, or that they should have, no impact on the net.  Merely to suggest that 
there are "problems" with implementation of any or all of these models, is not to prove 
that they are inadequate for any of the tasks at hand; after all, proponents of representative 
democracy are fond of saying that while it is a terrible system, it's better than any known 
alternative. The fundamental question is whether, at least for the global electronic 
communications network, the fourth governance model of decentralized and emergent 
law-making might have significant advantages over the alternative models and should be 
looked at as the presumptively primary source of online order.

<P>	Consider what makes the net work. The net itself solves an immensely difficult 
collective action problem: how to get large numbers of individual computer networks, 
running diverse operating systems, to communicate with one another for the common 
good. And, yet, the net is really nothing more than a set of voluntary standards regarding 
message transmission, routing, and reception.  There is not now and never was a central 
governmental body that decreed or voted to adopt a law stating that TCP/IP is required to 
be used by those wishing to communicate electronically on a global scale, or that HTTP is 
required to be used if you wish to communicate over a particular portion of the global 
network (the World Wide Web).  If you connect to a neighboring host and send out 
packets of data that conform to the protocol, your messages can be heard by others who 
have adopted the protocol. All are free to decline to follow the standard and to obey some 
other protocol, and they will communicate only to those who, literally, speak their 
language.  Many people and groups have, in fact, seceded (or declined to join) the global 
net, forming local area, or proprietary wide area, networks.  

<P>	The "rule-making" process for baseline protocols of the net had none of the vices 
of centralized, top down, bureaucratic or political, governance. The rules instead evolved 
from the decentralized decisions by individuals to adopt a promising standard because it 
served their own interests.  To be sure, the successful rules were created by individuals 
and small groups and they spread more quickly as a result of some government funded 
innovation and communications. But they did not stem from or rely in any way on the law 
of a geographically defined territory. They did not require any agreement among 
representatives of sovereign nations. And they did not require the creation of a new policy 
making apparatus that required an international bureaucracy or that faced questions 
regarding the accountability of decisionmakers to particular constituencies. Minorities are 
protected by their right to propose inconsistent rules and, indeed, to follow those 
alternative rules if they believe the benefits of doing so outweigh the costs. Enforcement 
of a predominant rule set stems naturally from uncoordinated, decentralized decisions.

<P>	Can this same decentralized process, used to choose technical protocols, also 
successfully govern the behavior of users and sysops and domain name registries -- and 
allow an effective and just pursuit of the public good on the net?  A number of objections 
might be raised:

<P>	-- Objection 1: Any system of rules governing human behavior must have 
mechanisms to define, identify, and punish wrongdoing.  The rules heretofore adopted in 
regard to transmission protocols can do so unambiguously because a packet either has 
TCP/IP headers or it doesn't, a document either complies with HTML standards or it 
doesn't, and violators are automatically detected and "punished" by becoming effectively 
dysfunctional and invisible to the system as a whole.  How can rules regarding "fraud" or 
"infringement" emerge from a similar decentralized process of voluntary sysop adherence, 
when those actions cannot be so identified by the automatic interaction of software 
protocols?  

<P>	Clearly, the preservation of civilized interaction on the net will require something 
other than mere "working software code."  But sysops already can, and do, using words, 
define the kinds of behavior that they consider wrongful in the context of their own 
systems. The contracts they offer to their subscribers describe minimally acceptable 
behavior.  And sysops can and do banish users who violate their rules. Moreover, both 
users and sysops can and do interpret the rules they set for themselves to decide what 
messages they wish to accept and from whom.  Thus, human intervention -- wetware code 
-- substitutes for the software code that enforces the rules at lower levels in the protocol 
stack. The resulting programs may not operate with flawless consistency. But they can 
"work" -- in the sense of producing relatively predictable results. (Indeed, some of the 
technical protocols produce results that have a certain amount of unpredictability -- and 
the interactions between software agents will increase that uncertainty.) Thus, the mere 
fact that any decentralized, emergent law would involve subjective judgments does not 
mean that it could not have the same virtues that have been demonstrated for such 
decentralized mechanisms as a source of the "rough consensus and working code" that 
makes the net possible.

<P>	-- Objection 2: At present, virtually anyone can get a Domain Name and IP address 
from some source and set up a system.  What prevents the rise of  "data havens" that 
harbor a new type of pirate ship? Or, given pervasive interconnections, what prevents 
someone from moving rapidly from one system to another, perpetrating harm on each but 
escaping before being caught? 

<P>	These are substantial objections, to be sure.  It may be that the best answer is that 
system operators and their users possess an entire arsenal of means by which wrongdoers 
may be excluded and repelled. Sysops could point their domain name servers only to 
registries that condition access to domain names on agreement to abide by whatever 
minimum standards of conduct they deem appropriate. Sysops can themselves deny access 
to anyone who does not act responsibly, as they define that term. Insofar as particular IP 
addresses are associated with "wrongdoing" (however one may choose to define that), 
sysops and users can establish software filters that exclude messages from that address -- a 
form of electronic confederation of local communities. Insofar as domain names and IP 
addresses underlie the links on the world wide web, sysops who host and users who create 
web pages can decide who to point to -- and can point to other web sites only if satisfied 
with the policy choices made by those other parties. Those who are especially concerned 
about potential harm from outside sources could, at the extreme, install software filters 
that preclude receipt of any message that does not originate from a known location or that 
has not been rated by a trusted source.

<P>	Although it would certainly seem an over-reaction to screen out all 
communications with anyone who has not passed some "good netizenship" test, the many 
different kinds of filters available to sysops and users serve to demonstrate that the real 
power to create a responsible public order on the net lies with the participants themselves.  
Sovereigns cannot compel agreement by rogue countries to accept a new global law.  
Outlaws cannot be isolated and "punished" based on their physical location -- because the 
net cannot readily recognize the geographical location from which online activities take 
place.  But it is relatively easy -- or, at least, easier -- for sysops to isolate and shun 
wrongdoers on the basis of their virtual location. And it is relatively easy for domain name 
registries and sysops to use the ID-issuance process as the occasion to establish minimum 
standards of behavior applicable inside particular domains.

<P>	And the problem posed by the ability of individuals to perpetrate harm, suffer 
banishment from particular communities, and re-appear in new electronic guises to 
perpetrate further harm can be "solved" by the use of registries tying issuance of electronic 
identities to identifiable individuals (and the use of stable authentication devices).  This, it 
need hardly be said, is a controversial suggestion, replete with deep consequences for 
personal privacy and the control over one's personal identity -- and that is precisely the 
point:  rather than attempt to achieve a worldwide consensus on the "right" answer to this 
question in order to decide in some quasi-legislative fashion whether or not to implement 
such registries, we can allow individual users to decide for themselves whether the benefits 
of such systems in terms of personal security outweigh the costs to their personal privacy 
or other values they may hold dear.

<P>	-- Objection 3: How can we know that a decentralized, emergent form of law 
making for the net will produce a definition of the "public good" with which we agree? 
How can the nations of the world defer to this semi-chaotic process of private decision-
making without knowing how far the net result will diverge from whatever set of rules 
existing sovereigns would have adopted if they had undertaken to deal with the problems 
of the net by traditional means?

<P>	This objection can be turned on its head. As suggested in the prior paragraph, 
ultimately the best case for decentralized, emergent law stems from the lack of any 
objective criteria by which to measure whether any particular rule set is optimal.  Should 
we have one uniform set of rules on any particular topic, such as the application of 
copyright law to online postings, or should we allow every "local" online area to set its 
own rules? That question, obviously, must be answered by both local and global 
constituencies -- and there is a strong argument that decentralized decisionmaking is the 
most cost effective and accurate means of reflecting the real preferences of participants on 
the net with regard to the structure of electronic federalism. Insofar as we want a form of 
collective action that is relatively sure to reflect the views of participants of the net, and 
that attains this accuracy at minimum cost, we probably cannot find a better mechanism. 
The interaction between rulemaking by sysops and navigational decisions of users 
produces a very close fit between the overall desires of the online public and the actual 
experiences of these participants.  The option and burden of identifying connections to 
avoid, or users to banish, or specific messages to filter, can be spread across the entire 
base of net users, as sysops and users decide unilaterally whether or not to rely on the 
recommendations of others. This new form of "net leverage" makes policing the 
boundaries of one's personal portion of Cyberspace light work indeed, as compared with 
the task of projecting your views onto some centralized global policy making process.

<P>	The central problem for the regulation of the net is not how to enforce widely 
agreed upon rules but, rather, how to define what we mean by wrongdoing. What is 
infringement? or defamation? or a privacy invasion? or unacceptably obscene? The net 
creates many different phenomena requiring the development of new rules. Is it wrong to 
send large volumes of unsolicited commercial email? What notice should be given before a 
host system writes a cookie file to my hard disk? Under what circumstances is it wrong to 
"cache" a web page?  The great virtue of the net is that it allows multiple, incompatible 
resolutions of such policy questions -- by giving those who disagree about the resolution 
of any particular question the means to avoid contact with one another.  If many people 
disagree on applicable standards, then the remedy is to allow each set to migrate to 
different areas of the net (and to filter out messages from non-congenial areas). If almost 
all agree on certain basic standards, then that agreement itself solves the problem, because 
outliers can be banished and their negative externalities filtered into irrelevancy.  There 
will always be "outlaws" on the net, but the power of digital filtering is such that they can 
be kept safely away from the mainstream, and vice versa,  most of the time.

<P>	-- Objection 4: How can a decentralized, private system of this type produces 
anything we should call "law"? Consensual adoption of standards of behavior is just 
"ethics" or "custom." And protection against wrongdoers has always required something 
stronger than that -- the ability to deploy physical force in the real world, to put people in 
real jails.  And justice has always meant treating like cases alike, giving everyone equal 
rights.

<P>	Because the decentralized system creates a different sets of rules for people who 
visit different online spaces, those who think of law as a single, consistent set of timeless, 
top-down authoritative texts will be unconvinced -- or unhappy.. A decentralized, 
emergent rule-evolving system does destroy traditional notions of equality before the law. 
Even thinking about the idea that applicable rules may be different for every single user, 
depending on where the user goes, and how that user's electronic agents negotiate with 
incoming messages, makes a lawyer's head ache.  (It certainly brings a new meaning to 
"choice of law"!) But the best answer to this objection is that the basic purpose of law is 
to maximize individual rational choice, and to minimize the role of power or force enjoyed 
by the few, in determining outcomes. Because the net allows easy movement among 
differing spaces, and also allows easy (online) separation of people who don't agree on 
basic groundrules, it can afford NOT to be consistent. Its inconsistency gives all users an 
equal right to create or select the rule sets they find most empowering. This new emergent 
law of the net can thus maximize individual, well informed, choice without failing to give 
clear prospective guidance regarding applicable rules (for any particular online space). 

<P>	The more daunting part of this objection is the suggestion that, ultimately, the only 
way to subdue a determined wrongdoer -- a really nasty person or group -- is with the use 
of physical force. We certainly can't allow physical force to be deployed in a decentralized 
way by private parties. But the objection that online rules are not truly "law" until backed 
up by physical force is, at most, a semantic challenge -- because the premise of the 
decentralized means of net governance is that the nations of the world would agree to 
enforce the rules established by sysop and user interactions, just as they now enforce 
contracts entered into by private parties. Contracts are more than mere ethics. They can 
and do guide behavior.  They get enforced.  And their mandatory terms constrain options 
available to those who would rent a car, or a hotel room, just as clearly as would a local 
ordinance (indeed, usually more clearly and flexibly, because the sources for contractual 
rules are more dispersed, more market driven and more flexible than any legislature or 
bureaucracy). Thus, the prospect of governance of the net by means of decentralized, 
emergent decisionmaking does not imply that the use of force by governments would be 
irrelevant -- only that it would be deployed in the service of rules made predominantly by 
private actors.

<P>	-- Objection 5: Even if the nation states were to agree to defer, in general, to the 
results produced by decentralized, emergent rulemaking of the type described, surely they 
would feel the need to intervene to outlaw actions that threatened important interests of 
their constituencies. And, given the degree of disagreement, worldwide, on any given 
issue, wouldn't those exceptional interventions gobble up the general rule, leading us back 
to governance by territorially-based sovereigns, some international treaties and maybe 
some transnational organizations gingerly establishing some non-controversial rules?

<P>	There is no doubt that every country -- and state, county and city -- will feel a 
strong urge to intervene, to try to regulate the net, in some instances. But there is an 
existing international law doctrine of "comity" that strongly suggests that no local 
jurisdiction should have the right to impose its own law in preference to that of a foreign 
jurisdiction that has a stronger interest in the appropriate resolution of the dispute in 
question. How often and how strongly local sovereigns will seek to intervene to regulate 
the net will depend, in turn, on how strong a case can be made by net participants that 
they, collectively, have the strongest interest in being allowed to make the rules. And this 
will turn, in part, on whether the net in fact engages in responsible self-regulation or, 
instead, becomes a haven for types of activities that large numbers of local authorities 
define as serious wrongdoing. In short, decentralized, emergent law can work to create 
some form of order -- but whether that order will face a determined onslaught of local 
regulation depends on whether the self-regulatory order is sufficiently "responsible" from 
the perspective of the territorial powers that be. 

<P>	-- Objection 6: The law that emerges from this decentralized process is not 
predictable. It may not be stable. It might not produce results we would, from our current 
perspectives, consider wise.

<P>	It's true that complex adaptive systems can behave in ways that are difficult, or 
even impossible to predict. But the top down lawmaking process is itself unpredictable 
and can produce results many think are unwise. Moreover, if anything, decentralized 
systems can behave in a much more stable fashion than those driven by centralized 
decisionmaking. The failure (or success) of a particular domain name registry, or a specific 
set of policies imposed on a subset of users, will have far less disruptive effect than the 
failure (or mistake) of a single centralized policy body. If a user leaves an online system 
because she disagrees with the local rules, or a particular system fails because many users 
share such a view, merely normal marketplace disruptions result. Finally, the beauty of 
complex adaptive systems is that they conduct very efficient searches. By allowing the 
"initiative" of individual components to find a wide range of alternative starting points, and 
then relying on the uphill march of imitation and the copying facilitated by online 
communications of the reputations of various online venues, the decentralized, emergent 
law-making system will, quite likely, find the high ground in policy space.
<P>
<h4>The Net Needs a Good Foreign Policy</h4>

<P>	The strongest apparent objection to a decentralized, emergent law of the net is that 
actions on the net can have unacceptable real world impacts on people who have not 
agreed to abide by the rules of the online space from which those negative externalities 
arise. It's one thing to say that a person cruising the net can steer clear of a known "den of 
thieves" (and, indeed, much more readily than ever before find out whom to avoid). It's 
quite another thing to suggest that no centralized or territorially-based law should govern 
the use of the net by a den of real world thieves to track your physical movements and to 
plot to burgle your house! Even activities conducted solely online may have significant 
real world effects. The unauthorized use of logos and domain names might (conceivably) 
cause confusion or dilution with respect to the real world trademarks attached to physical 
goods. Havens for online copyright infringement might detract from an author's ability to 
sell a physical copy of a book And, perhaps, an obscene file might warp the mind of a 
pervert who lives down the street from your children.

<P>	But the argument that all online activities must be governed by traditional, top 
down, "real world" legal standards, just because they might have an important impact on 
the real world, proves a little too much. The very same thing could be said about forms of 
interaction among all self-regulatory groups, including churches, clubs, stock-exchanges, 
business firms and non-governmental organizations. We want, in general, to empower 
individuals and groups to regulate their own affairs.  The mere possibility of negative 
externalities cannot itself, in the abstract, answer the question of net governance.

<P>	More importantly, even with respect to those online activities that do have 
demonstrable and negative impacts on the real world, the claim that rules must be imposed 
from above depends ultimately on the right of the persons who wish to impose those rules 
to govern the conduct of the persons who, by definition, have decided to adopt a different 
set of rules. If the offending online activity is conducted by people who live in a different 
country from those who are offended, the "wrongdoers" may have a legal right (under the 
law of their local state) to engage in the activity in question. No matter how strongly the 
residents of Tennessee feel about an obscene web page based in Amsterdam, there may be 
no basis in current law on which to control that activity by means of top-down traditional 
legal rules.

<P>	Nevertheless, one might postulate some activities online that threaten most "real 
world" citizens and that are not even tolerated and protected by any geographic state. 
Imagine, for example, a host computer based in international waters, using wireless 
technology to broadcast messages that enable terrorist groups to make chemical weapons 
and coordinate an attack. In such a case, the small net "community" that patronized that 
online venue would be, in effect, at war with both the remainder of the online world and 
the authorities and citizens of the real world as well.  Any scheme for responsible self-
regulation of the net must deal, conceptually, with this kind of  "hard case."  The 
decentralized, emergent form of order deals with this kind of case by conceding that, at 
this extreme, the national sovereigns may exercise force to defend their interests -- just as 
sysops and users may use their own electronic form of force (their prerogatives to banish 
users or to leave a particular system) to set boundaries on others' otherwise uncontrollable 
wrongdoing.

<P>	Because the net does have real impacts on the real world, it can best hope to 
preserve its decentralized, emergent character if it "renders unto Caesar what is Caesar's". 
If online commercial transactions radically undermine the tax system needed to build the 
physical infrastructure, territorial governments may be entitled to defend that core interest 
by shutting down host sites specially designed to facilitate such transactions.  Perhaps the 
sysops who facilitate online transactions should anticipate this problem and create a 
centralized means for online commerce to pay a fair tax, to a single collector, as a means 
of discouraging more disruptive and potentially duplicative enforcement proceedings by 
local authorities. In the face of such responsible action by the net itself, local authorities 
would be more likely to recognize that they do not possess a writ that automatically runs 
to all areas of the net, and that they should not seek to set the rules governing online 
interactions that don't seriously negatively impact the tangible world they govern.

<P>	It bears remembering that the users of the net and the policy-setting inhabitants of 
the "real world" most affected by online activities are, to a first approximation, the same 
people. As a group, netizens will not want to support activities that threaten core values 
they share as citizens of the tangible world. There are lots of novel issues that arise from 
the ability of electronic messages to cross territorial borders -- but those issues will be 
resolved in part by means of the ability of every user and system to filter out unwanted 
messages, and, in part, by means of the ability of such cross-border communications to 
bring the world into close agreement about core values. 

<P>	Notwithstanding the overlap between real world policy makers and participants on 
the net, there is reason to fear that the communications process by which various 
constituencies come to understand their own interests -- and as a result of which the 
various sources of authoritative decision making will decide to proceed or to defer to 
others better situated to make and enforce applicable rules -- needs to be enhanced. Rule-
setting on the net has traditionally been done by a small group of engineers who have had 
an aversion even to discussion of softer policy matters. Those who make national laws 
have not generally understood the special policy issues posed by the net or been aware 
that the net is capable of producing responsible self-regulation. If either has had a concern 
that rules made by the other would impinge to an unacceptable degree on the vital interest 
of a particular geographic or online territory, there has been little opportunity to 
communicate that concern effectively to the other.

<P>	The need for workable, accepted rules to govern the new trade in ideas and 
services that takes place online can be largely satisfied without any massive new legislative 
agenda or rulemaking spree engaged in by the established authorities of the tangible world. 
But what may be needed is an enhanced communications process by means of which 
territorially based communities can make known to the net community when online actions 
threaten their vital interests. And, of course, there is a need for methods by which the 
online community can more effectively communicate to the governments and citizens of 
the "real world" when the actions and policies of these traditional venues impinge strongly 
on online values or freedoms. 
<P>
<h4>Domain Name Policy as a Key First Problem for Collective Action -- Revisited</h4>

<P>	To determine whether the combination of decentralized decision-making and better 
communications between real world authorities and virtual communities could lead to a 
workable form of governance for the net, let's examine more closely the current core hard 
case: the policies governing creation of new top level domains.  If there is any question on 
which there at first appears to be a need for strong centralized rule, it's the question of 
how domain names are issued and how they are translated into IP numbers. The Domain 
Name System determines where your data packets are sent.  If two separate registries both 
issued a "right" to use "ibm.com", and mapped this domain name to different IP addresses, 
and if half of the net derived its DNS lookup tables from each of these two incompatible 
regimes, massive confusion would ensue. If different registries impose differing conditions 
on access to net real estate or online identity, then there will be no single definition of 
"netizenship" -- and wrongdoers (by someone's definition) could seek out the most 
tolerant regimes.  Because of their mnemonic character, certain domain names and domain 
name uses are already being challenged as infringing of trademark rights deemed vital by 
companies who sell branded products. And there are now or soon will be lots of other 
questions that implicate the potentially intense and conflicting interests of particular 
communities: Can a registry charge for the use of a domain name? How much? And what 
decision making process governs the expenditure of the money? May "indecent" domain 
names be registered? Must those who use domain names agree to resolve their disputes by 
arbitration? Agree to abide by copyright laws? Issue email addresses only to identifiable 
users? The domain name system thus already poses stark questions regarding the 
relationship between any self-regulatory system for the net and the powers of existing 
legislatures and courts. 

<P>	There is reason to believe that even these challenging and contentious issues can be 
resolved by decentralized, emergent decision-making. For example, even the apparently 
fatal conflict between inconsistent domain name registration systems seem likely to be 
avoided without top down controls. Most users and sysops are interested in accurate 
routing of messages. They will want to connect to the DNS sources that most other 
people use. The confusing dual and inconsistent system hypothesized above is unstable 
(or, rather, could never arise in the first place) because the most widely used of the two 
system would soon attract virtually all of the traffic (or all of the connections from 
downstream systems). Thus, the successful deployment of two incompatible versions of a 
top level domain, or two widely distributed yet incompatible sets of lookup tables, is about 
as likely as the simultaneous growth in one country of two languages that have the same 
words mapped onto different meanings. Because people look to reliable sources for their 
information, good data drives out bad.  Network economies, and the creation of order 
from positive returns to information structure, save the day. Thus, while it is physically 
possible and currently lawful for system operators to create a mess by pointing their 
domain name resolving software at multiple incompatible sources, that nightmare scenario 
probably won't occur and need not be prohibited by legislation of any kind.

<P>	Similarly, there is good reason to believe that some combination of domain name 
registries and domain name holders will impose rules, in connection with issuance of 
access to the net, that reflect widespread agreement regarding what constitutes wrongful 
action. And there is reason to think that the actions of users in selecting the online venues 
they visit and support will in general keep such regulation from becoming either too 
oppressive or too lax. The online public will band together to electronically shun tyrants 
and detectable crooks. (We may need to worry more about due process, to protect 
unpopular minorities from mobs, than law enforcement.) Dens of thieves -- and packets of  
data sent from known dens of thieves -- can generally be avoided online. If your concern is 
privacy, you can avoid web sites that don't post verifiable tokens indicating that they 
observe rules that you deem satisfactory.  If you don't want certain sites to link to your 
web page, you can use software code to preclude such links.  No matter what your policy 
goal, acting through the filtering power of sysops and users is much more likely to 
produce rapid and effective results than lobbying for the enactment of some rule by a new 
transnational legislative body.

<P>	To be sure, no decentralized, emergent lawmaking scheme of this kind could be 
100% effective. But substantial consensus is, operationally and practically, quite important 
even when total compliance cannot be achieved (as, by the way, is always the case, even 
under centralized law enforcement regimes run by non-democratic sovereigns). The reason 
is, again, that screening applicants for IDs and filtering out known sources of wrongful 
messages reduces the impact of wrongdoing even when it does not put the wrongdoer 
totally out of business. Trademark infringement tolerated on web pages in a small corner 
of the net, and filtered out by most responsible sysops once they are on notice of the 
problem, simply cannot cause very much confusion.

<P>	In contrast, efforts to use traditional top down, centralized lawmaking to solve the 
problems posed by the domain name system seem very likely to fail in more brittle ways. 
Take the question whether the establishment of alternative top level domains should be 
allowed. (See, in this regard, the Internet-Drafts "New Registries and the Delegation of 
International Top Level Domains," available at 
ftp://ds.internic.net/internet-drafts/draft-postel-iana-itld-admin-02.txt, and "Creation of 
and Registration in the '.NUM' Top Level Domain," available at 
ftp://ds.internic.net/internet-drafts/draft-rfced-info-schultz
-00.txt.)  In the context of decentralized, emergent law, this question is decided in the 
marketplace -- by multiple independent decisions whether to register with a new purported 
provider of a ".biz" domain or whether to point a local domain name server at another 
root lookup table. If, in contrast, the US were to purport to exercise its powers to prohibit 
the establishment of alternative top level domains, it would simply fail to attain jurisdiction 
over the actions of some host provider operating entirely outside the US. Perhaps the US 
could effectively prohibit all US hosts from pointing their local domain name servers at 
that remote root table, but the First Amendment might constrain such restrictions, which 
in any event would look silly if they contrasted with practices in other countries and the 
desires of the US market. If the US instead sought to negotiate a new treaty agreement 
governing the establishment of new top level domains, it would likely still be defining the 
shape of the bargaining table while the issue was decided, de facto, by engineering 
decisions. If it sought to delegate decisions on top level domain structure to a new 
international organization, it would face unanswerable questions about how to compel 
compliance with that organization's decisions by private actors. And even if most countries 
agreed to defer to and enforce the decisions of such an organization, there would be a 
serious question how to assure that its decisions reflected the needs and preferences of all 
participants in net based commerce. The best indicator of those needs and preferences 
would be the independent actions by sysops and users to accept a new standard. 
Traditional law making processes become, in the context, a counterproductive extra loop 
that at most delays or misdirects decisions otherwise likely to evolve rapidly from a 
decentralized process.

<P>	Similarly, contrast the likely outcome of traditional approaches to a problem 
involving potential conflicts between online behavior and the interests of those who may 
not even participate in net commerce: the use of domain names that overlap in some way 
with trademarks used on physical products.  A US statute outlawing the registration of a 
domain name by someone other than the holder of the corresponding copyright would face 
many problems. The registrant (and even the registry) might not be subject to US 
jurisdiction, unless the US is prepared to take the expansive view that anyone making use 
of pointers on computers in the US can be governed by US law (a position that would 
come back to bite the US, badly, in its efforts to stave off regulation of US businesses by 
foreign governments). Treaties regarding intellectual property rights might address this 
issue -- but they would likely founder on the problem that multiple trademarks applicable 
to particular types of goods in particular geographic areas, and subject to differing local 
laws, might all seem equally entitled to preempt the others. As John Gilmore has said, you 
just cannot pour ten pounds of trademarks into a one pound domain name sack. And some 
countries might well take the view that domain names should be treated somewhat 
differently from traditional marks. A new international organization might try to establish a 
uniform policy.  But the unsatisfied trademark owners could still file suit in local courts, 
which might not defer to this new international organization. And, in any event, 
dissatisfied domain name holders could support a competing registry. The apparent 
simplicity and uniformity of centralized, top down solutions to the new issues posed by the 
net tends to vanish upon closer inspection.

<P>	The issuance of domain names is a good core problem in connection with which to 
consider net governance because this natural "real estate" of the net presents, by its very 
nature, the occasion for solving the governance problem in a more general way. Every 
domain name, and every subsidiary email address, is issued by a registry or party that 
enters into a contract with the recipient. That contract, pursuant to which access to 
netizenship is granted, might contain various conditions that facilitate the growth of 
responsible self-governance by the net. The right balance between those conditions that 
ought to be imposed at the top level (on the domain name holder, by the registry) and 
those that ought to be imposed at lower levels (either on an ID holder, or as a condition 
for entry into a particular online space) will emerge as a result of a continuous negotiation 
between the various levels. We probably need competing domain name registries to allow 
this system to operate in a dynamic and responsive manner. While this contract-driven 
process will surely result in diversity, it (and the filtering and free movement provided by 
the net) will help to prevent conflicts and to limit the impact of any actions considered 
"wrongful" by particular constituencies. 
<P>
<h4>Conclusion</h4>

<P>	Let's review the alternatives. Can we make territorial laws applicable to online 
activities that have no relevant or perhaps even determinable geographic location? We 
doubt it.  Can we look to international treaties to set forth workable rules that give good 
guidance for online commerce? Not in our lifetimes (now measured in accelerated net 
years). Should we allow the rules of the net to be encoded into software by a technical 
elite, with no mechanism of accountability to the online population? The question answers 
itself. Should we create a new international forum for net policy making? Well, maybe not 
until we demonstrate that less formal mechanisms won't work. Has it been shown that 
decentralized decision-making will produce unworkable chaos that threatens the vital 
interests of established governments? Not really. We've hardly tried a collective 
conversation designed to allow responsible participants to set their own rules and to help 
all concerned -- online and off --seek to understand and respect others' vital interests.  Yet 
that kind of conversation is precisely the kind of activity the net itself is designed -- thanks 
to the engineers -- to facilitate. 

<P>	Of course, we know that this model can work in some contexts -- it&iacute;s called 
federalism, and we have witnessed its success in our own constitutional system and 
elsewhere.  Net federalism looks very different than what we have become accustomed to, 
because here individual network systems, rather than territorially-based sovereigns, are the 
essential governance units.  The law of the net has emerged, and we believe can continue 
to emerge, from the voluntary adherence of large numbers of network administrators to 
basic rules of law (and dispute resolution systems to adjudicate the inevitable inter-
network disputes), with individual users &igrave;voting with their electrons&icirc; to join the particular systems they find most congenial.  Or perhaps we should think of this as the law of the 
nets, for one possible (or even likely) consequence of this evolutionary development is the 
emergence of multiple network confederations, each with their own &igrave;constitutional&icirc; 
principles -- some permitting and some prohibiting, say, anonymous communications, 
some imposing strict rules regarding redistribution of information and others allowing 
freer movement -- enforced by means of electronic fences prohibiting the movement of 
information across confederation boundaries.  

<P>	This governance model does not, of course, &igrave;solve&icirc; all problems (any more than 
the existing system of international law perfectly administers and enforces rules in the non-
virtual world), and these governance issues will not be resolved overnight.   Nor will they 
be resolved without a struggle; existing sovereigns are not about to blithely relinquish their 
law-making prerogatives and go quietly into that &igrave;Twilight of Sovereignty&icirc; that Walter 
Wriston presciently foresaw several decades ago.  But the Internet itself is testament to 
the enormous power of this rule-making model that we ignore at our peril and to the likely 
detriment of all those seeking to take advantage of the remarkable potentials of the new 
medium.

<H2><A NAME="Introduction">Introduction</A></H2>


Global computer-based communications cut across territorial 
borders, creating a new realm of human activity and 
undermining the feasibility--and legitimacy--of applying 
laws based on geographic boundaries.  While these electronic 
communications play havoc with geographic boundaries, 
a new boundary, made up of the screens and passwords 
that separate the virtual world from the &quot;real 
world&quot; of atoms, emerges.  This new boundary defines 
a distinct Cyberspace that needs and can create new 
law and legal institutions of its own.  Territorially-based 
law-making and law-enforcing authorities find this 
new environment deeply threatening.  But established 
territorial authorities may yet learn to defer to the 
self-regulatory efforts of Cyberspace participants 
who care most deeply about this new digital trade in 
ideas, information, and services.  Separated from doctrine 
tied to territorial jurisdictions, new rules will emerge, 
in a variety of online spaces, to govern a wide range 
of new phenomena that have no clear parallel in the 
nonvirtual world.  These new rules will play the role 
of law by defining legal personhood and property, resolving 
disputes, and crystallizing a collective conversation 
about core values.

<H3><A NAME="A.  Territorial Borders in the &quot;Real World&quot;">A.  Territorial Borders in the &quot;Real World&quot;</A></H3>

We take for granted a world in which geographical borders--lines 
separating physical spaces--are of primary importance 
in determining legal rights and responsibilities:  
&quot;All law is <I>prima facie</I> territorial.&quot;<A HREF="./X0026_LBFINFN.html#1">\1\</A> 
 Territorial borders, generally speaking, delineate 
areas within which different sets of legal rules apply. 
 There has until now been a general correspondence 
between borders drawn in physical space (between nation 
states or other political entities) and borders in 
&quot;law space.&quot;  For example, if we were to 
superimpose a &quot;law map&quot; (delineating areas 
where different rules apply to particular behaviors) 
onto a political map of the world, the two maps would 
overlap to a significant degree, with clusters of homogenous 
applicable law and legal institutions fitting within 
existing physical borders, distinct from neighboring 
homogenous clusters.
<p>
<H4><A NAME="1.  The Trademark Example">1.  The Trademark Example</A></H4>

Consider a specific example to which we will refer throughout 
this article:  trademark law--schemes for the protection 
of the associations between words or images and particular 
commercial enterprises.  Trademark law is distinctly 
based on geographical separations.<A HREF="./X0026_LBFINFN.html#2">\2\</A>  Trademark rights 
typically arise within a given country, usually on 
the basis of use of a mark on physical goods or in 
connection with the provision of services in specific 
locations within that country.  Different countries 
have different trademark laws, with important differences 
on matters as central as whether the same name can 
be used in different lines of business.  In the United 
States, the same name can even be used for the same 
line of business if there is sufficient geographic 
separation of use to avoid confusion.<A HREF="./X0026_LBFINFN.html#3">\3\</A>  In fact, 
there are many local stores, restaurants, and businesses 
with identical names that do not interfere with each 
other because their customers do not overlap.  The 
physical cues provided by different lines of business 
allow most marks to be used in multiple lines of commerce 
without dilution of the other users' rights.<A HREF="./X0026_LBFINFN.html#4">\4\</A>  There 
is no global registration scheme<A HREF="./X0026_LBFINFN.html#5">\5\</A>; protection of 
a particularly famous mark on a global basis requires 
registration in each country.  A trademark owner must 
therefore also be constantly alert to territorially-based 
claims of abandonment, and to dilution arising from 
uses of confusingly similar marks, and must master 
the different procedural and jurisdictional laws of 
various countries that apply in each such instance.
<p>
<H4><A NAME="2.  When Geographic Boundaries for Law Make Sense">2.  When Geographic Boundaries for Law Make Sense</A></H4>

Physical borders are not, of course, simply arbitrary 
creations.  Although they may be based on historical 
accident, geographic borders for law make sense in 
the real world.  Their relationship to the development 
and enforcement of legal rules is logically based on 
a number of related considerations.
<p>
<b>Power</b>.
<BR>
  Control over physical space, and the people 
and things located in that space, is a defining attribute 
of sovereignty and statehood.<A HREF="./X0026_LBFINFN.html#6">\6\</A>  Law-making requires 
some mechanism for law enforcement, which in turn depends 
(to a large extent) on the ability to exercise physical 
control over, and to impose coercive sanctions on, 
law-violators.  For example, the U.S. government does 
not impose its trademark law on a Brazilian business 
operating in Brazil, at least in part because imposing 
sanctions on the Brazilian business would require assertion 
of physical control over those responsible for the 
operation of that business.  Such an assertion of control 
would conflict with the Brazilian government's recognized 
monopoly on the use of force over its citizens.<A HREF="./X0026_LBFINFN.html#7">\7\</A>
<P>
<b>Effects</b>.
<BR>
  The correspondence between physical boundaries 
and boundaries in &quot;law space&quot; also reflects 
a deeply rooted relationship between physical proximity 
and the effects of any particular behavior.  That is, 
Brazilian trademark law governs the use of marks in 
Brazil because that use has a more direct impact on 
persons and assets located within that geographic territory 
than anywhere else.  For example, the existence of 
a large sign over &quot;Jones' Restaurant&quot; in 
Rio de Janeiro is unlikely to have an impact on the 
operation of &quot;Jones' Restaurant&quot; in Oslo, 
Norway, for we may assume that there is no substantial 
overlap between the customers, or competitors, of these 
two entities.  Protection of the former's trademark 
does not--and probably should not--affect the protection 
afforded the latter's.

<P>

<b>Legitimacy</b>.
<BR>
  We generally accept the notion that the 
persons within a geographically defined border are 
the ultimate source of law-making authority for activities 
within that border.<A HREF="./X0026_LBFINFN.html#8">\8\</A> The &quot;consent of the governed&quot; 
implies that those subject to a set of laws must have 
a role in their formulation.  By virtue of the preceding 
considerations, the category of persons subject to 
a sovereign's laws, and most deeply affected by those 
laws, will consist primarily of individuals who are 
located in particular physical spaces.  Similarly, 
allocation of responsibility among levels of government 
proceeds on the assumption that, for many legal problems, 
physical proximity between the responsible authority 
and those most directly affected by the law will improve 
the quality of decision making, and that it is easier 
to determine the will of those individuals in physical 
proximity to one another.
<P>
<b>Notice</b>. 
<br>
 Physical boundaries are also appropriate for 
the delineation of &quot;law space&quot; in the physical 
world because they can give notice that the rules change 
when the boundaries are crossed.  Proper boundaries 
have signposts that provide warning that we will be 
required, after crossing, to abide by different rules, 
and physical boundaries -- lines on the geographical 
map -- are generally well-equipped to serve this signpost 
function.<A HREF="./X0026_LBFINFN.html#9">\9\</A>
<P>
<H3><A NAME="B.  The Absence of Territorial Borders in Cyberspace">B.  The Absence of Territorial Borders in Cyberspace</A></H3>

Cyberspace radically undermines the relationship between 
legally significant (online) phenomena and physical 
location.  The rise of the global computer network 
is destroying the link between geographical location 
and: (1) the <I>power</I> of local governments to assert control 
over online behavior; (2) the <I>effects</I> of online behavior 
on individuals or things; (3) the <I>legitimacy</I> of the 
efforts of a local sovereign to enforce rules applicable 
to global phenomena; and (4) the ability of physical 
location to give <I>notice</I> of which sets of rules apply. 
<P>
 The Net thus radically subverts a system of rule-making 
based on borders between physical spaces, at least 
with respect to the claim that cyberspace should naturally 
be governed by territorially defined rules.
<P>
Cyberspace has no territorially-based boundaries, because 
the cost and speed of message transmission on the Net 
is almost entirely independent of physical location: 
 Messages can be transmitted from any physical location 
to any other location without degradation, decay, or 
substantial delay, and without any physical cues or 
barriers that might otherwise keep certain geographically 
remote places and people separate from one another.<A HREF="./X0026_LBFINFN.html#10">\10\</A> 
 The Net enables transactions between people who do 
not know, and in many cases cannot know, the physical 
location of the other party.  Location remains vitally 
important, but only location within a <I>virtual </I>space 
consisting of the &quot;addresses&quot; of the machines 
between which messages and information are routed.
<P> 
 The system is indifferent to the <I>physical </I>location 
of those machines, and there is no necessary connection 
between an Internet address and a physical jurisdiction. 
<P>
 Although a domain name, when initially assigned to 
a given machine, may be associated with a particular 
Internet Protocol address corresponding to the territory 
within which the machine is physically located (e.g., 
a &quot;.uk&quot; domain name extension), the machine 
may move in physical space without any movement in 
the logical domain name space of the Net.  Or, alternatively, 
the owner of the domain name might request that the 
name become associated with an entirely different machine, 
in a different physical location.<A HREF="./X0026_LBFINFN.html#11">\11\</A> Thus, a server 
with a &quot;.uk&quot; domain name may not necessarily 
be located in the United Kingdom, a server with a &quot;.com&quot; 
domain name may be anywhere, and users, generally speaking, 
are not even aware of the location of the server that 
stores the content that they read. Physical borders 
no longer can function as signposts informing individuals 
of the obligations assumed by entering into a new, 
legally significant, place, because individuals are 
unaware of the existence of those borders as they move 
through virtual space.
<P>
The power to control activity in Cyberspace has only 
the most tenuous connections to physical location. 
 Many governments first respond to electronic communications 
crossing their territorial borders by trying to stop 
or regulate that flow of information as it crosses 
their borders.<A HREF="./X0026_LBFINFN.html#12">\12\</A>  Rather than deferring to efforts 
by participants in online transactions to regulate 
their own affairs, many governments establish trade 
barriers, seek to tax any border-crossing cargo, and 
respond especially sympathetically to claims that information 
coming into the jurisdiction might prove harmful to 
local residents.  Efforts to stem the flow increase 
as online information becomes more important to local 
citizens.  In particular, resistance to &quot;transborder 
data flow&quot; (TDF)  reflects the concerns of sovereign 
nations that the development and use of TDF's will 
undermine their &quot;informational sovereignty,&quot;<A HREF="./X0026_LBFINFN.html#13">\13\</A> 
will negatively impact on the privacy of local citizens,<A HREF="./X0026_LBFINFN.html#14">\14\</A> 
and will upset private property interests in information.<A HREF="./X0026_LBFINFN.html#15">\15\</A> 
 Even local governments in the United States have expressed 
concern about their loss of control over information 
and transactions flowing across their borders.<A HREF="./X0026_LBFINFN.html#16">\16\</A>
<P>
But efforts to control the flow of electronic information 
across physical borders--to map local regulation and 
physical boundaries onto Cyberspace--are likely to 
prove futile, at least in countries that hope to participate 
in global commerce.<A HREF="./X0026_LBFINFN.html#17">\17\</A>  Individual electrons can easily, 
and without any realistic prospect of detection, &quot;enter&quot; 
any sovereign's territory. The volume of electronic 
communications crossing territorial boundaries is just 
too great in relation to the resources available to 
government authorities to permit meaningful control. 
<P>
 U.S. Customs officials have generally given up.  They 
assert jurisdiction only over the physical goods that 
cross the geographic borders they guard and claim no 
right to force declarations of the value of materials 
transmitted by modem.<A HREF="./X0026_LBFINFN.html#18">\18\</A>  Banking and securities regulators 
seem likely to lose their battle to impose local regulations 
on a global financial marketplace.<A HREF="./X0026_LBFINFN.html#19">\19\</A>  And state Attorneys 
General face serious challenges in seeking to intercept 
the electrons that transmit the kinds of consumer fraud 
that, if conducted physically within the local jurisdiction, 
would be more easily shut down.
<P>
Faced with their inability to control the flow of electrons 
across physical borders, some authorities strive to 
inject their boundaries into the new electronic medium 
through filtering mechanisms and the establishment 
of electronic barriers.<A HREF="./X0026_LBFINFN.html#20">\20\</A>  Others have been quick 
to assert the right to regulate all online trade insofar 
as it might adversely impact local citizens.  The Attorney 
General of Minnesota, for example, has asserted the 
right to regulate gambling that occurs on a foreign 
web page that was accessed and &quot;brought into&quot; 
the state by a local resident.<A HREF="./X0026_LBFINFN.html#21">\21\</A>  The New Jersey 
securities regulatory agency has similarly asserted 
the right to shut down any offending Web page accessible 
from within the state.<A HREF="./X0026_LBFINFN.html#22">\22\</A>  
<P>
But such protective schemes will likely fail as well. 
<P>
 First, the determined seeker of prohibited communications 
can simply reconfigure his connection so as to appear 
to reside in a different location, outside the particular 
locality, state, or country.  Because the Net is engineered 
to work on the basis of &quot;logical,&quot; not geographical, 
locations, any attempt to defeat the independence of 
messages from physical locations would be as futile 
as an effort to tie an atom and a bit together.  And, 
moreover, assertions of law-making authority over Net 
activities on the ground that those activities constitute 
&quot;entry into&quot; the physical jurisdiction can 
just as easily be made by any territorially-based authority.
<P> 
 If Minnesota law applies to gambling operations conducted 
on the World Wide Web because such operations foreseeably 
affect Minnesota residents, so, too, must the law of 
any physical jurisdiction from which those operations 
can be accessed.  By asserting a right to regulate 
whatever its citizens may access on the Net, these 
local authorities are laying the predicate for an argument 
that Singapore or Iraq or any other sovereign can regulate 
the activities of U.S. companies operating in cyberspace 
from a location physically within the United States. 
<P>
 All such Web-based activity, in this view, must be 
subject simultaneously to the laws of all territorial 
sovereigns.
<P>
Nor are the effects of online activities tied to geographically 
proximate locations.  Information available on the 
World Wide Web is available simultaneously to anyone 
with a connection to the global network.  The notion 
that the effects of an activity taking place on that 
Web site radiate from a physical location over a geographic 
map in concentric circles of decreasing intensity, 
however sensible that may be in the nonvirtual world, 
is incoherent when applied to Cyberspace.  A Web site 
physically located in Brazil, to continue with that 
example, has no more of an effect on individuals in 
Brazil than does a Web site physically located in Belgium 
or Belize that is accessible in Brazil.  Usenet discussion 
groups, to take another example, consist of continuously 
changing collections of messages that are routed from 
one network to another, with no centralized location 
at all; they exist, in effect, everywhere, nowhere 
in particular, and only on the Net.<A HREF="./X0026_LBFINFN.html#23">\23\</A>

Nor can the legitimacy of any rules governing online 
activities be naturally traced to a geographically 
situated polity.  There is no geographically localized 
set of constituents with a stronger claim to regulate 
it than any other local group; the strongest claim 
to control comes from the participants themselves, 
and they could be anywhere.
<P>
The rise of an electronic medium that disregards geographical 
boundaries also throws the law into disarray by creating 
entirely new phenomena that need to become the subject 
of clear legal rules but that cannot be governed, satisfactorily, 
by any current territorially-based sovereign.  For 
example, electronic communications create vast new 
quantities of transactional records and pose serious 
questions regarding the nature and adequacy of privacy 
protections.  Yet the communications that create these 
records may pass through or even simultaneously exist 
in many different territorial jurisdictions.<A HREF="./X0026_LBFINFN.html#24">\24\</A>  What 
substantive law should we apply to protect this new, 
vulnerable body of transactional data?<A HREF="./X0026_LBFINFN.html#25">\25\</A>  May a French 
policeman lawfully access the records of communications 
traveling across the Net from the United States to 
Japan?  Similarly, whether it is permissible for a 
commercial entity to publish a record of all of any 
given individual's postings to Usenet newsgroups, or 
whether it is permissible to implement an interactive 
Web page application that inspects a user's &quot;bookmarks&quot; 
to determine which other pages that user has visited, 
are questions not readily addressed by existing legal 
regimes--both because the phenomena are novel and because 
any given local territorial sovereign cannot readily 
control the relevant, globally dispersed, actors and 
actions.<A HREF="./X0026_LBFINFN.html#26">\26\</A>
<P>
Because events on the Net occur everywhere but nowhere 
in particular, are engaged in by online personae who 
are both &quot;real&quot; (possessing reputations, 
able to perform services, and deploy intellectual assets) 
and &quot;intangible&quot; (not necessarily or traceably 
tied to any particular person in the physical sense), 
and concern &quot;things&quot; (messages, databases, 
standing relationships) that are not necessarily separated 
from one another by any physical boundaries, no physical 
jurisdiction has a more compelling claim than any other 
to subject these events exclusively to its laws.

The question who should regulate or control Net domain 
names presents an illustration of the difficulties 
faced by territorially-based law-making.  The engineers 
who created the Net devised a &quot;domain name system&quot; 
that associates numerical machine addresses with easier-to-remember 
names.  Thus, an Internet Protocol  machine address 
like &quot;36.21.0.69&quot; can be derived, by means 
of a lookup table, from &quot;leland.stanford.edu.&quot; 
<P>
 Certain letter extensions  (&quot;.com,&quot; &quot;.edu,&quot; 
&quot;.org,&quot; and &quot;.net&quot;) have developed 
as global domains with no association to any particular 
geographic area.<A HREF="./X0026_LBFINFN.html#27">\27\</A>  Although the Net creators designed 
this system as a convenience, it rapidly developed 
commercial value, because it allows customers to learn 
and remember the location of particular Web pages or 
e-mail addresses.  Currently, domain names are registered 
with specific parties who echo the information to &quot;domain 
name servers&quot; around the world.  Registration 
generally occurs on a &quot;first come, first served&quot; 
basis,<A HREF="./X0026_LBFINFN.html#28">\28\</A>  generating a new type of property akin 
to trademark rights, but without inherent ties to the 
trademark law of any individual country.  Defining 
rights in this new, valuable property presents many 
questions, including those relating to transferability, 
conditions for ownership (such as payment of registration 
fees), duration of ownership rights, and forfeiture 
in the event of abandonment, however defined.  Who 
should make these rules?
<P>
Consider the placement of a &quot;traditional&quot; 
trademark on the face of a World Wide Web page.  This 
page can be accessed instantly from any location connected 
to the Net.  It is not clear that any given country's 
trademark authorities possess, or should possess, jurisdiction 
over such placements.  Otherwise, any use of a trademark 
on the net would be subject simultaneously to the jurisdiction 
of every country.  Should a Web page advertising a 
local business in Illinois be deemed to infringe a 
trademark in Brazil just because the page can be accessed 
freely from Brazil?  Large U.S. companies may be upset 
by the appearance on the Web of names and symbols that 
overlap with their valid U.S.-registered trademarks. 
<P>
 But these same names and symbols could also be validly 
registered by another party in Mexico whose &quot;infringing&quot; 
marks are now, suddenly, accessible from within the 
United States.  Upholding a claim of infringement or 
dilution launched by the holder of a U.S.-registered 
trademark, solely on the basis of a conflicting mark 
on the Net, exposes that same trademark holder to claims 
from other countries when the use of their U.S.-registered 
mark on the Web would allegedly infringe a similar 
mark in those foreign jurisdictions.

Almost everything involving the transfer of information 
can be done online: education, health care, banking, 
the provision of intangible services, all forms of 
publishing, and the practice of law.  The laws regulating 
many of these activities have developed as distinctly 
local and territorial.  Local authorities certify teachers, 
charter banks with authorized &quot;branches,&quot; 
and license doctors and lawyers.  The law has in essence 
presumed that the activities conducted by these regulated 
persons cannot be performed without being tied to a 
physical body or building subject to regulation by 
the territorial sovereign authority, and that the effects 
of those activities are most distinctly felt in geographically 
circumscribed areas.  These distinctly local regulations 
cannot be preserved once these activities are conducted 
by globally dispersed parties through the Net.  When 
many trades can be practiced in a manner that is unrelated 
to the physical location of the participants, these 
local regulatory structures will either delay the development 
of the new medium or, more likely, be superseded by 
new structures that better fit the online phenomena 
in question.<A HREF="./X0026_LBFINFN.html#29">\29\</A>
<P>
Any insistence on &quot;reducing&quot; all online transactions 
to a legal analysis based in geographic terms presents, 
in effect, a new &quot;mind-body&quot; problem on a 
global scale.  We know that the activities that have 
traditionally been the subject of regulation must still 
be engaged in by real people who are, after all, at 
distinct physical locations.  But the interactions 
of these people now somehow transcend those physical 
locations.  The Net enables forms of interaction in 
which the shipment of tangible items across geographic 
boundaries is irrelevant and in which the location 
of the participants does not matter.  Efforts to determine 
&quot;where&quot; the events in question occur are 
decidedly misguided, if not altogether futile.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="II.  A New Boundary for Cyberspace">II.  A New Boundary for Cyberspace</A></H2>

Although geographic boundaries may be irrelevant in 
defining a legal regime for Cyberspace, a more legally 
significant border for the &quot;law space&quot; of 
the Net consists of the screens and passwords that 
separate the tangible from the virtual world.  Traditional 
legal doctrine treats the Net as a mere transmission 
medium that facilitates the exchange of messages sent 
from one legally significant geographical location 
to another, each of which has its own applicable laws. 
<P>
 Yet, trying to tie the laws of any particular territorial 
sovereign to transactions on the Net, or even trying 
to analyze the legal consequences of Net-based commerce 
as if each transaction occurred geographically somewhere 
in particular, is most unsatisfying. 
<P>
<H3><A NAME="A.  Cyberspace as a Place">A.  Cyberspace as a Place</A></H3>

Many of the jurisdictional and substantive quandaries

could be resolved by one simple principle: conceiving 
of Cyberspace as a distinct &quot;place&quot; for purposes 
of legal analysis by recognizing a legally significant 
border between Cyberspace and the &quot;real world.&quot; 
<P>
 Using this new approach, we would no longer ask the 
unanswerable question &quot;where&quot; in the geographical 
world a Net-based transaction occurred.  Instead, the 
more salient questions become:  What rules are best 
suited to the often unique characteristics of this 
new place and the expectations of those who are engaged 
in various activities there?  What mechanisms exist 
or need to be developed to determine the content of 
those rules and the mechanisms by which they can enforced? 
<P>
 Answers to these questions will permit the development 
of rules better suited to the new phenomena in question, 
more likely to be made by those who understand and 
participate in those phenomena, and more likely to 
be enforced by means that the new global communications 
media make available and effective.

Treating Cyberspace as a separate &quot;space&quot;

occurs through a screen and (usually) a &quot;password&quot;

strays across the border into Cyberspace.<A HREF="./X0026_LBFINFN.html#32">\32\</A>  To be 
sure, Cyberspace is not a homogenous place; groups 
and activities found at various online locations possess 
their own unique characteristics and distinctions, 
and each area will likely develop its own set of distinct 
rules.<A HREF="./X0026_LBFINFN.html#33">\33\</A>  But the line that separates online transactions

as the physical boundaries between our territorial 
governments--perhaps more so.<A HREF="./X0026_LBFINFN.html#34">\34\</A>

Crossing into Cyberspace is a meaningful act that would

 As noted, a primary function and characteristic of 
a border or boundary is its ability to be perceived 
by the one who crosses it.<A HREF="./X0026_LBFINFN.html#35">\35\</A>  As regulatory structures 
evolve to govern Cyberspace-based transactions, it 
will be much easier to be certain which of those rules 
apply to your activities online than to determine which 
territorial-based authority might apply its laws to 
your conduct.  For example, you would know to abide 
by the &quot;terms of service&quot; established by 
CompuServe or America Online when you are in their 
online territory, rather than guess whether Germany,

their right to regulate your activities and those of 
the &quot;placeless&quot; online personae with whom 
you communicate.

The ultimate question who should set the rules for uses 
of names on the Net presents an apt microcosm for examining 
the relationship between the Net and territorial-based 
legal systems.  There is nothing more fundamental, 
legally, than a name or identity--the right to legally 
recognized personhood is a predicate for the amassing 
of capital, including the reputational and financial 
capital, that arises from sustained interactions.  
The domain name system, and other online uses of names 
and symbols tied to reputations and virtual locations, 
exist operationally only on the Net.  These names can, 
of course, be printed on paper or embodied in physical 
form and shipped across geographic borders.  But such 
physical uses should be distinguished from electronic 
use of such names in Cyberspace, because publishing 
a name or symbol on the Net is not the same as intentional 
distribution to any particular jurisdiction.  Instead, 
use of a name or symbol on the Net is like distribution 
to all jurisdictions simultaneously.  Recall that the 
non-country-specific domain names like &quot;.com,&quot; 
and &quot;.edu&quot; lead to the establishment of online 
addresses on a global basis.  And through such widespread 
use, the global domain names gained proprietary value. 
In this context, assertion by any local jurisdiction 
of the right to set the rules applicable to the &quot;domain 
name space&quot; is an illegitimate extra-territorial 
power grab. 
<P>
  Conceiving of the Net as a separate place for purposes 
of legal analysis will have great simplifying effects. 
For example, a global registration system for all 
domain names and reputationally significant names and 
symbols used on the Net would become possible.  Such 
a Net-based regime could take account of the special 
claims of owners of strong global marks (as used on 
physical goods) and &quot;grandfather&quot; these owners' 
rights to the use of their strong marks in the newly 
opened online territory.  But a Net-based global registration 
system could also fully account for the true nature 
of the Net by treating the use of marks on Web pages 
as a global phenomenon, by assessing the likelihood 
of confusion and dilution in the online context in 
which such confusion would actually occur, and by harmonizing 
any rules with applicable engineering criteria, such 
as optimizing the overall size of the domain name space.
<P>
A distinct set of rules applicable to trademarks in 
Cyberspace would greatly simplify matters by providing 
a basis to resist the inconsistent and conflicting 
assertions of geographically local prerogatives.  If 
one country objects to the use of a mark on the Web 
that conflicts with a locally registered mark, the 
rebuttal would be that the mark has not been used inside 
the country at all, but only on the Web.  If a company 
wants to know where to register its use of a symbol 
on the Net, or to check for conflicting prior uses 
of its mark, the answer will be obvious and cost effective: 
the designated registration authority for the relevant 
portion of the Net itself.  If we need to develop rules 
governing abandonment, dilution, and conditions on 
uses of particular types of domain names and addresses, 
those rules--applicable specifically to Cyberspace--will 
be able to reflect the special characteristics of this 
new electronic medium.<A HREF="./X0026_LBFINFN.html#36">\36\</A>

<H4><A NAME="1.  Defamation Law">1.  Defamation Law</A></H4>

Treating messages on the Net as transmissions from one 
place to another has created a quandary for those concerned 
about liability for defamation:  Messages may be transmitted 
between countries with very different laws, and liability 
may be imposed on the basis of &quot;publication&quot; 
in multiple jurisdictions with varying standards.<A HREF="./X0026_LBFINFN.html#37">\37\</A> In contrast, 
the approach that treats the global network 
as a separate place would consider any allegedly defamatory 
message to have been published only &quot;on the Net&quot; 
(or in some distinct subsidiary area thereof)--at least 
until such time as distribution on paper occurs.<A HREF="./X0026_LBFINFN.html#38">\38\</A> 
<P>
 This re-characterization makes more sense.  A person 
who uploads a potentially defamatory statement would 
be able more readily to determine the rules applicable 
to his own actions.  Moreover, because the Net has 
distinct characteristics, including an enhanced ability 
of the allegedly defamed person to reply, the rules 
of defamation developed for the Net could take into 
account these technological capabilities --perhaps 
by requiring that the opportunity for reply be taken 
advantage of in lieu of monetary compensation for certain 
defamatory net-based messages.
<A HREF="./X0026_LBFINFN.html#39">\39\</A>  
The distinct characteristics 
of the Net could also be taken into account when applying 
and adapting the &quot;public figure&quot; doctrine 
in a context that is both global and highly compartmentalized 
and that blurs the distinction between private and 
public spaces.
<P>

<H4><A NAME="2. Regulation of Net-Based Professional Activities.">2. Regulation of Net-Based Professional Activities.</A></H4>

The simplifying effect of &quot;taking Cyberspace seriously&quot; 
likewise arises in the context of regimes for regulating 
professional activities.  As noted, traditional regulation 
insists that each professional be licensed by every 
territorial jurisdiction where she provides services.<A HREF="./X0026_LBFINFN.html#40">\40\</A>
<P> 
 This requirement is infeasible when professional services 
are dispensed over the Net and potentially provided 
in numerous jurisdictions.  Establishing certification 
regimes that apply only to such activities on the Net 
would greatly simplify matters.  Such regulations would 
take into account the special features of Net-based 
professional activities like tele-medicine or global 
law practice by including the need to avoid any special 
risks caused by giving online medical advice in the 
absence of direct physical contact with a patient or 
by answering a question regarding geographically local 
law from a remote location.<A HREF="./X0026_LBFINFN.html#41">\41\</A>
  Using this new approach, 
we could override the efforts of local school boards 
to license online educational institutions, treating 
attendance by students at online institutions as a 
form of &quot;leaving home for school&quot; rather 
than characterizing the offering of education online 
as prosecutable distribution of disfavored materials 
into a potentially unwelcoming community that asserts 
local licensing authority.
<P>

<H4><A NAME="3. Fraud and Antitrust.">3. Fraud and Antitrust.</A></H4>

Even an example that might otherwise be thought to favor 
the assertion of jurisdiction by a local sovereign--protection 
of local citizens from fraud and antitrust violations--shows 
the beneficial effects of a Cyberspace legal regime. 
<P>
 How should we analyze &quot;markets&quot; for antitrust 
and consumer protection purposes when the companies 
at issue do business only through the World Wide Web? 
<P>
 Cyberspace could be treated as a distinct marketplace 
for purposes of assessing concentration and market 
power.  Concentration in geographic markets would only 
be relevant in the rare cases in which such market 
power could be inappropriately leveraged to obtain 
power in online markets--for example by conditioning 
access to the net by local citizens on their buying 
services from the same company (such as a phone company) 
online.  Claims regarding a right to access to particular 
online services, as distinct from claims to access 
particular physical pipelines, would remain tenuous 
as long as it is possible to create a new online service 
instantly in any corner of an expanding online space.<A HREF="./X0026_LBFINFN.html#42">\42\</A>
<P>
Consumer protection doctrines could also develop differently 
online--to take into account the fact that anyone reading 
an online ad is only a mouse click away from guidance 
from consumer protection agencies and discussions with 
other consumers.  Can Minnesota prohibit the establishment 
of a Ponzi scheme on a Web page physically based in 
the Cayman islands but accessed by Minnesota citizens 
through the Net?  Under the proposed new approach to 
regulation of online activities, the answer is clearly 
no.  Minnesota has no special right to prohibit such 
activities.  The state lacks enforcement power, cannot 
show specially targeted effects, and does not speak 
for the community with the most legitimate claim to 
self-governance.  But that does not mean that fraud 
might not be made &quot;illegal&quot; in at least large 
areas of Cyberspace.  Those who establish and use online 
systems have a interest in preserving the safety of 
their electronic territory and preventing crime.  They 
are more likely to be able to enforce their own rules. 
 And, as more fully discussed below, insofar as a consensually 
based &quot;law of the Net&quot; needs to obtain respect 
and deference from local sovereigns, new Net-based 
law-making institutions have an incentive to avoid 
fostering activities that threaten the vital interests 
of territorial governments.

<H4><A NAME="4.  Copyright Law.">4.  Copyright Law.</A></H4>

We suggest, not without some trepidation, that &quot;taking 
Cyberspace seriously&quot; could clarify the current 
intense debate about how to apply copyright law principles 
in the digital age.  In the absence of global agreement 
on applicable copyright principles, the jurisdictional 
problems inherent in any attempt to apply territorially-based 
copyright regimes to electronic works simultaneously 
available everywhere on the globe are profound.  As 
Jane Ginsburg has noted:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>A key feature of the GII [Global Information Infrastructure] 
is its ability to render works of authorship pervasively 
and simultaneously accessible throughout the world. 
<P>
 The principle of territoriality becomes problematic 
if it means that posting a work on the GII calls into 
play the laws of every country in which the work may 
be received when . . . these laws may differ substantively. 
<P>
 Should the rights in a work be determined by a multiplicity 
of inconsistent legal regimes when the work is simultaneously 
communicated to scores of countries?  Simply taking 
into account one country's laws, the complexity of 
placing works in a digital network is already daunting; 
should the task be further burdened by an obligation 
to assess the impact of the laws of every country where 
the work might be received?  Put more bluntly, for 
works on the GII, there will be no physical territoriality 
. . . . Without physical territoriality, can legal 
territoriality persist?<A HREF="./X0026_LBFINFN.html#43">\43\</A> </BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
But treating Cyberspace as a distinct place for purposes 
of legal analysis does more than resolve the conflicting 
claims of different jurisdictions:  It also allows 
the development of new doctrines that take into account 
the special characteristics of the online &quot;place.&quot; 
<P>
The basic justification for copyright protection is 
that bestowing an exclusive property right to control 
the reproduction and distribution of works on authors 
will increase the supply of such works by offering 
authors a financial incentive to engage in the effort 
required for their creation.
<A HREF="./X0026_LBFINFN.html#44">\44\</A> 
But even in the &quot;real 
world,&quot; much creative expression is entirely independent 
of this incentive structure, because the author's primary 
reward has more to do with acceptance in a community 
and the accumulation of reputational capital through 
wide dissemination than it does with the licensing 
and sale of individual copies of works.<A HREF="./X0026_LBFINFN.html#45">\45\</A>  And that 
may be more generally true of authorship in Cyberspace; 
because authors can now, for the first time in history, 
deliver copies of their creations instantaneously and 
at virtually no cost anywhere in the world, one might 
expect authors to devise new modes of operation that 
take advantage of, rather than work counter to, this 
fundamental characteristics of the new environment.<A HREF="./X0026_LBFINFN.html#46">\46\</A> 
<P>
  One such strategy has already begun to emerge: giving 
away information at no charge -- what might be called 
the &quot;Netscape strategy&quot;
<A HREF="./X0026_LBFINFN.html#47">\47\</A> -- as a means 
of building up reputational capital that can subsequently 
be converted into income (e.g., by means of the sale 
of services).  As Esther Dyson has written:: 
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Controlling copies (once created by the author or by 
a third party) becomes a complex challenge. You can 
either control something very tightly, limiting distribution 
to a small, trusted group, or you can rest assured 
that eventually your product will find its way to a 
large nonpaying audience _ if anyone cares to have 
it in the first place. . . .
<P>
Much chargeable value will be in certification of authenticity 
and reliability, not in the content. Brand name, identity, 
and other marks of value will be important; so will 
security of supply. Customers will pay for a stream 
of information and content from a trusted source. For 
example, the umbrella of The New York Times sanctifies 
the words of its reporters. The content churned out 
by Times reporters is valuable because the reporters 
undergo quality-control, and because others believe 
them. . . .
<P>
The trick is to control not the copies of your work 
but instead a relationship with the customers -- subscriptions 
or membership. And that's often what the customers 
want, because they see it as an assurance of a continuing 
supply of reliable, timely content.<A HREF="./X0026_LBFINFN.html#48">\48\</A>

between the costs and benefits of copyright protection 
in Cyberspace, calling for a reappraisal of long-standing 
principles.<A HREF="./X0026_LBFINFN.html#49">\49\</A>  
So, too, do other unique characteristics 
of Cyberspace severely challenge traditional copyright 
concepts.<A HREF="./X0026_LBFINFN.html#50">\50\</A>  
The very ubiquity of file &quot;copying&quot; 
-- the fact that one cannot access any information 
whatsoever in a computer-mediated environment without 
making a &quot;copy&quot; of that information<A HREF="./X0026_LBFINFN.html#51">\51\</A> -- implies 
that any simple-minded attempt to map traditional notions 
of &quot;copying&quot; onto Cyberspace transactions 
will have perverse results.<A HREF="./X0026_LBFINFN.html#52">\52\</A>  Application of the 
&quot;first sale&quot; doctrine (allowing the purchaser 
of a copyrighted work to freely resell the copy she 
purchased) is problematic when the transfer of a lawfully 
owned copy technically involves the making of a new 
copy before the old one is eliminated,<A HREF="./X0026_LBFINFN.html#53">\53\</A> as is defining 
&quot;fair use&quot; when a work's size is indeterminate, 
ranging from (1) an individual paragraph sold separately 
on demand in response to searches to (2) the entire 
database from which the paragraph originates, something 
never sold as a whole unit.<A HREF="./X0026_LBFINFN.html#54">\54\</A>
<P>
 Treating Cyberspace as a distinct location allows for 
the development of new forms of intellectual property 
law, applicable only on the Net, that would properly 
focus attention on these unique characteristics of 
this new, distinct place while preserving doctrines 
that apply to works embodied in physical collections 
(like books) or displayed in legally significant physical 
places (like theaters).  Current debates about applying 
copyright law to the Net often do, implicitly, treat 
it as a distinct space, at least insofar as commercial 
copyright owners somewhat inaccurately refer to it 
as a &quot;lawless&quot; place.
<A HREF="./X0026_LBFINFN.html#55">\55\</A>  The civility of 
the debate might improve if everyone assumed the Net 
should have an appropriately different law, including 
a special law for unauthorized transfers of works from 
one realm to the other; we could, in other words, regulate 
the smuggling of works created in the physical world, 
by treating the unauthorized uploading of a copy of 
such works to the Net as infringement.  This new approach 
would help promoters of electronic commerce focus on 
developing incentive-producing rules to encourage authorized 
transfers into Cyberspace of works not available now, 
while also reassuring owners of existing copyrights 
to valuable works that changes in the copyright law 
for the Net would not require changing laws applicable 
to distributing physical works.  It would also permit 
the development of new doctrines of implied license 
and fair use that, as to works first created on the 
Net or imported with the author's permission, appropriately 
allow the transmission and copying necessary to facilitate 
their use within the electronic realm.<A HREF="./X0026_LBFINFN.html#56">\56\</A>

 Someone must also decide threshold membership issues

recognition that these rules will only be meaningful

makes these decisions as a legitimate governing body.

Every system operator who dispenses a password imposes

  System operators (sysops) have 
an extremely powerful enforcement tool at their disposal 
to enforce such rules--banishment.
<A HREF="./X0026_LBFINFN.html#65">\65\</A>  Moreover, communities 
of users have marshaled plenty of enforcement weapons 
to induce wrongdoers to comply with local conventions 
such as rules against flaming,<A HREF="./X0026_LBFINFN.html#66">\66\</A> shunning,<A HREF="./X0026_LBFINFN.html#67">\67\</A> mailbombs, 
and more.<A HREF="./X0026_LBFINFN.html#68">\68\</A>
  And both sysops and users have begun 
explicitly to recognize that formulating and enforcing

While many of these new rules and customs apply only 
to specific, local areas of the global network, some

exists about core principles of &quot;netiquette&quot; 
in mailing lists and discussion groups<A HREF="./X0026_LBFINFN.html#70">\70\</A>--although, 
admittedly, new users have a slow learning curve and 
the Net offers little formal &quot;public education&quot; 
regarding applicable norms.<A HREF="./X0026_LBFINFN.html#71">\71\</A>
  Dispute resolution 
mechanisms suited to this new environment also seem 
certain to prosper.<A HREF="./X0026_LBFINFN.html#72">\72\</A>  Cyberspace is anything but 
anarchic; its distinct rule sets are becoming more 
robust every day.
<P>
Perhaps the most apt analogy to the rise of a separate 
law of Cyberspace is the origin of the Law Merchant--a 
distinct set of rules that developed with the new, 
rapid boundary-crossing trade of the Middle Ages.<A HREF="./X0026_LBFINFN.html#73">\73\</A> 
Merchants could not resolve their disputes by taking 
them to the local noble, whose established feudal law 
mainly concerned land claims.  Nor could the local 
lord easily establish meaningful rules for a sphere 
of activity he barely understood, executed in locations 
beyond his control.  The result of this jurisdictional 
confusion, arising from a then-novel form of boundary-crossing 
communications, was the development of a new legal 
system--<I>Lex Mercatoria</I>.<A HREF="./X0026_LBFINFN.html#74">\74\</A>  The people who cared most 
about and best understood their new creation formed 
and championed this new law, which did not destroy 
or replace existing law regarding more territorially-based 
transactions (e.g. transferring land ownership).  Arguably, 
exactly the same type of phenomenon is developing in 
Cyberspace right now.<A HREF="./X0026_LBFINFN.html#75">\75\</A>
<P>
Governments cannot stop electronic communications coming 
across their borders, even if they want to do so.  
Nor can they credibly claim a right to regulate the 
Net based on supposed local harms caused by activities 
that originate outside their borders and that travel 
electronically to many different nations; one nation's 
legal institutions should not, therefore, monopolize 
rule-making for the entire Net.  Even so, established 
authorities likely will continue to claim that they 
must analyze and regulate the new online phenomena 
in terms of some physical locations.  After all, the 
people engaged in online communications still inhabit 
the material world.  And, so the argument goes, local 
legal authorities must have authority to remedy the 
problems created in the physical world by those acting 
on the Net.  The rise of responsible law-making institutions 
within Cyberspace, however, will weigh heavily against 
arguments that would claim that the Net is &quot;lawless&quot; 
and thus tie regulation of online trade to physical 
jurisdictions.  As noted, sysops acting alone or collectively 
have the power of banishment to control wrongful actions 
online.<A HREF="./X0026_LBFINFN.html#76">\76\</A>  Thus, for online activities that minimally 
impact the vital interests of sovereigns, the self-regulating 
structures of Cyberspace seem better suited than local 
authorities to deal with the Net's legal issues.<A HREF="./X0026_LBFINFN.html#77">\77\</A>
<P>

<H2><A NAME="IV.  Local Authorities, Foreign Rules: Reconciling Conflicts">IV.  Local Authorities, Foreign Rules: Reconciling Conflicts</A></H2> 

What should happen when conflicts arise between the 
local territorial law (applicable to persons or entities 
by virtue of their location in a particular area of 
physical space) and the law applicable to particular 
activities on the Net?  The doctrine of &quot;comity,&quot; 
as well as principles applied when delegating authority 
to self-regulatory organizations, provide us with guidance 
for reconciling such disputes.
<P>
The doctrine of comity, in the Supreme Court's classic 
formulation, is &quot;the recognition which one nation 
allows within its territory to the legislative, executive, 
or judicial acts of another nation, having due regard 
both to international duty and convenience, and to 
the rights of its own citizens or of other persons 
who are under the protections of its law.&quot;<A HREF="./X0026_LBFINFN.html#78">\78\</A> 
<P>
 It is incorporated into the principles set forth in 
the Restatement (Third) of Foreign Relations Law of 
the United States, in particular Section 403, which 
provides that &quot;a state may not exercise jurisdiction 
to prescribe law with respect to a person or activity 
having connections with another state when the exercise 
of such jurisdiction is unreasonable,&quot;<A HREF="./X0026_LBFINFN.html#79">\79\</A> and 
that when a conflict between the laws of two states 
arises, &quot;each state has an obligation to evaluate 
its own as well as the other state's interest in exercising 
jurisdiction [and] should defer to the other state 
if that state's interest is clearly greater.&quot;).<A HREF="./X0026_LBFINFN.html#80">\80\</A> 
<P>
 It arose as an attempt to mitigate some of the harsher 
features of a world in which lawmaking is an attribute 
of control over physical space but in which persons, 
things, and actions may move across physical boundaries, 
and it functions as a constraint on the strict application 
of territorial principles that attempts to reconcile 
&quot;the principle of absolute territorial sovereignty 
[with] the fact that intercourse between nations often 
demand[s] the recognition of one sovereign's lawmaking 
acts in the forum of another.&quot;
<A HREF="./X0026_LBFINFN.html#81">\81\</A>  In general, 
comity reflects the view that those who care more deeply 
about and better understand the disputed activity should 
determine the outcome.  Accordingly, it may be ideally 
suited to handle, by extension, the new conflicts between 
the a-territorial nature of cyberspace activities and 
the legitimate needs of territorial sovereigns and 
of those whose interests they protect on the other 
side of the cyberspace border.  This doctrine does 
not disable territorial sovereigns from protecting 
the interests of those individuals located within their 
spheres of control, but it calls upon them to exercise 
a significant degree of restraint when doing so.
<P>
Local officials handling conflicts can also learn from 
the many examples of delegating authority to self-regulatory 
organizations.  Churches are allowed to make religious 
law.<A HREF="./X0026_LBFINFN.html#82">\82\</A>
  Clubs and social organizations can, within 
broad limits, define rules that govern activities within 
their spheres of interest.<A HREF="./X0026_LBFINFN.html#83">\83\</A>  Securities exchanges 
can establish commercial rules, so long as they protect 
the vital interests of the surrounding communities. 
<P>
 In these cases, government has seen the wisdom of 
allocating rule-making functions to those who best 
understand a complex phenomenon and who have an interest 
in assuring the growth and health of their shared enterprise.
<P>
Cyberspace represents a new permutation of the underlying 
issue:  How much should local authorities defer to 
a new, self-regulating activity arising independently 
of local control and reaching beyond the limited physical 
boundaries of the sovereign.  This mixing of both tangible 
and intangible boundaries leads to a convergence of 
the intellectual categories of comity in international 
relations and the local delegation by a sovereign to 
self-regulatory groups.  In applying both the doctrine 
of &quot;comity&quot; and the idea of &quot;delegation&quot;<A HREF="./X0026_LBFINFN.html#84">\84\</A> 
to Cyberspace, a local sovereign is called upon to 
defer to the self-regulatory judgments of a population 
partly, but not wholly, composed of its own subjects.<A HREF="./X0026_LBFINFN.html#85">\85\</A>
<P>
Despite the seeming contradiction of a sovereign deferring 
to the authority of those who are not its own subjects, 
such a policy makes sense, especially in light of the 
underlying purposes of both doctrines.  Comity and 
delegation represent the wise conservation of governmental 
resources and allocate decisions to those who most 
fully understand the special needs and characteristics 
of a particular &quot;sphere&quot; of being.  Although 
Cyberspace represents a new sphere that cuts across 
national boundaries, the fundamental principle remains.
<P> 
 If the sysops and users who collectively inhabit and 
control a particular area of the Net want to establish 
special rules to govern conduct there, and if that 
rule set does not fundamentally impinge upon the vital 
interests of others who never visit this new space, 
then the law of sovereigns in the physical world should 
defer to this new form of self-government.
<P>
Consider, once again, the trademark example.  A U.S. 
government representative has stated that, since the 
government paid for the initial development and administration 
of the domain name system, it &quot;owns&quot; the 
right to control policy decisions regarding the creation 
and use of such names.<A HREF="./X0026_LBFINFN.html#86">\86\</A>  
Obviously, government funds, 
in addition to individual efforts on a global scale, 
created this valuable and finite new asset.  But the 
government's claim based on its investment is not particularly 
convincing.  In fact, the United States may be asserting 
its right to control the policies governing the domain 
name space primarily because it fears that any other 
authority over the Net might force it to pay again 
for the &quot;.gov&quot; and &quot;.mil&quot; domain 
names used by governmental entities.<A HREF="./X0026_LBFINFN.html#87">\87\</A>  To assuage 
these concerns, a Net-based authority should concede 
to the governments on this point.  For example, it 
should accommodate the military's strong interest in 
remaining free to regulate and use its &quot;.mil&quot; 
addresses.<A HREF="./X0026_LBFINFN.html#88">\88\</A>  A new Net-based standards-making authority 
should also accommodate the government's interests 
in retaining its own untaxed domain names and prohibiting 
counterfeiting.  Given responsible restraint by the 
Net-based authority and the development of an effective 
self-regulatory scheme, the government might well then 
decide that it should not spend its finite resources 
trying to wrest effective control of non-governmental 
domain names away from those who care most about facilitating 
the growth of online trade.
<P>
Because controlling the flow of electrons across physical 
boundaries is so difficult, a local jurisdiction that 
seeks to prevent its citizens from accessing specific 
materials must either outlaw all access to the Net--thereby 
cutting itself off from the new global trade--or seek 
to impose its will on the Net as a whole.  This would 
be the modern equivalent of a local lord in medieval 
times either trying to prevent the silk trade from 
passing through his boundaries (to the dismay of local 
customers and merchants) or purporting to assert jurisdiction 
over the known world. It may be most difficult to envision 
local territorial sovereigns deferring to the law of 
the Net when the perceived threat to local interests 
arises from the very free flow of information that 
is the Net's most fundamental characteristic--when, 
for example, local sovereigns assert an interest in 
seeing that their citizens are not adversely affected 
by information that the local jurisdiction deems harmful 
but that is freely (and lawfully) available elsewhere. 
<P>
 Examples include the German government's attempts 
to prevent its citizens access to prohibited materials<A HREF="./X0026_LBFINFN.html#89">\89\</A>, 
or the prosecution of a California bulletin board operator 
for making material offensive to local &quot;community 
standards&quot; available for downloading in Tennessee.<A HREF="./X0026_LBFINFN.html#90">\90\</A>
<P> 
 Local sovereigns may insist that their interest (in 
protecting their citizens from harm) is paramount, 
and easily outweighs any purported interest in making 
this kind of material freely available.  But the opposing 
interest is not simply the interest in seeing that 
individuals have access to ostensibly obscene material, 
it is the &quot;meta-interest&quot; of Net citizens 
in preserving the global free flow of information. 
<P>
 If there is one central principle on which all local 
authorities <I>within</I> the Net should agree, it must be 
that territorially local claims to restrict online 
transactions (in ways unrelated to vital and localized 
interests of a territorial government) should be resisted. 
This is the Net equivalent of the First Amendment, 
a principle already recognized in the form of the international 
human rights doctrine protecting the right to communicate.<A HREF="./X0026_LBFINFN.html#91">\91\</A> 
<P>
 Participants in the new online trade must oppose external 
regulation designed to obstruct this flow.  This naturally 
central principle of online law bears importantly on 
the &quot;comity&quot; analysis, because it makes clear 
that the need to preserve a free flow of information 
across the Net is just as vital to the interests of 
the Net as the need to protect local citizens against 
the impacts of unwelcome information may appear from 
the perpective of a local territorial sovereign.<A HREF="./X0026_LBFINFN.html#92">\92\</A> 
<P>
 For the Net to realize its full promise, online rule-making 
authorities must not respect the claims of territorial 
sovereigns to restrict online communications when unrelated 
to vital and localized governmental interests.
<P>

<H2><A NAME="V.   Internal Diversity">V.   Internal Diversity</A></H2>

One of a border's key characteristics is that it slows 
the interchange of people, things, and information 
across its divide.  Arguably, distinct sets of legal 
rules can only develop and persist where effective 
boundaries exist.  The development of a true &quot;law 
of Cyberspace,&quot; therefore, depends upon a dividing 
line between this new online territory and the nonvirtual 
world.  Our argument so far has been that the new sphere 
online is cut off, at least to some extent, from rule-making 
institutions in the material world and requires the 
creation of a distinct law applicable just to the online 
sphere.
<P>
But we hasten to add that Cyberspace is not, behind 
that border, a homogeneous or uniform territory behind 
that border, where information flows without further 
impediment.  Although it is meaningless to speak of 
a French or Armenian portion of Cyberspace, because 
the physical borders dividing French or Armenian territory 
from their neighbors cannot generally be mapped onto 
the flow of information in Cyberspace, the Net has 
other kinds of internal borders delineating many distinct 
internal locations that slow or block the flow of information. 
<P>
 Distinct names and (virtual) addresses, special passwords, 
entry fees, and visual cues --software boundaries--can 
distinguish subsidiary areas from one another.  The 
Usenet newsgroup &quot;alt.religion.scientology&quot; 
is distinct from &quot;alt.misc.legal,&quot; each of 
which is distinct from a chat room on Compuserve or 
America Online which, in turn, are distinct from the 
Cyberspace Law Institute listserver or Counsel Connect. 
 Users can only access these different forums through 
distinct addresses or phone numbers, often navigating 
through login screens, the use of passwords, or the 
payment of fees.  Indeed, the ease with which internal 
borders, consisting entirely of software protocols, 
can be constructed is one of Cyberspace's most remarkable 
and salient characteristics; setting up a new Usenet 
newsgroup, or a &quot;listserver&quot; discussion group, 
requires little more than a few lines of code.<A HREF="./X0026_LBFINFN.html#93">\93\</A>
<P>
The separation of subsidiary &quot;territories&quot; 
or spheres of activity within Cyberspace and the barriers 
to exchanging information across these internal borders 
allow for the development of distinct rule sets and 
for the divergence of those rule sets over time.<A HREF="./X0026_LBFINFN.html#94">\94\</A> 
<P>
 The processes underlying biological evolution provide 
a useful analogy.<A HREF="./X0026_LBFINFN.html#95">\95\</A>  Speciation--the emergence over 
time of multiple, distinct constellations of genetic 
information from a single, original group--cannot occur 
when the original population freely exchanges information 
(in the form of genetic material) among its members. 
<P>
 In other words, a single, freely-interbreeding population 
of organisms cannot divide into genetically distinct 
populations; while the genetic material in the population 
changes over time, it does so more or less uniformly--e.g. 
the population of the species <I>Homo erectus</I> becomes 
a population of <I>Homo sapiens</I>--and cannot give rise 
to more than one contemporaneous, distinct genetic 
set.  Speciation requires, at a minimum, some barrier 
to the interchange of genetic material between subsets 
of the original homogeneous population.  Ordinarily, 
a physical barrier suffices to prevent one subgroup 
from exchanging genetic data with another.  Once this 
&quot;border&quot; is in place, divergence within the 
&quot;gene pool&quot;--the aggregate of the underlying 
genetic information--in each of the two subpopulations 
can occur.<A HREF="./X0026_LBFINFN.html#96">\96\</A>  Over time, this divergence may be substantial 
enough that even when the physical barrier disappears, 
the two subgroups can no longer exchange genetic material--i.e., 
they have become separate species.
<P>
Rules, like genetic material, are self-replicating information.<A HREF="./X0026_LBFINFN.html#97">\97\</A> 
<P>
 The internal borders within Cyberspace will thus allow 
for differentiation among distinct constellations of 
such information--in this case rule-sets rather than 
species.  Content or conduct acceptable in one &quot;area&quot; 
of the Net may be banned in another.  Institutions 
that resolve disputes in one &quot;area&quot; of Cyberspace 
may not gain support or legitimacy in others.  Local 
sysops can, by contract, impose differing default rules 
regarding who has the right, under certain conditions, 
to replicate and redistribute materials that originate 
with others.  While Cyberspace's reliance on bits instead 
of atoms may make <I>physical</I> boundaries more permeable, 
the boundaries delineating digital online &quot;spheres 
of being&quot; may become <I>less </I>permeable.  Securing 
online systems from unauthorized intruders may prove 
an easier task than sealing physical borders from unwanted 
immigration.<A HREF="./X0026_LBFINFN.html#98">\98\</A>  Groups can establish online corporate 
entities or membership clubs that tightly control participation 
in, or even public knowledge of, their own affairs. 
<P>
 Such groups can reach agreement on or modify these 
rules more rapidly via online communications.  Accordingly, 
the rule sets applicable to the online world may quickly 
evolve away from those applicable to more traditional 
spheres and develop greater variation among the sets.
<P>
How this process of differentiation and evolution will 
proceed is one of the more complex and fascinating 
questions about law in Cyberspace--and a subject beyond 
the scope of this Article.  We should point out, however, 
an important normative dimension to the proliferation 
of these internal boundaries between distinct communities 
and distinct rule-sets and the process by which law 
will evolve in Cyberspace.  Cyberspace may be an important 
forum for the development of new connections between 
idividuals and mechanisms of self-governance by which 
individuals attain an increasingly elusive sense of 
community; commenting on the erosion of national sovereignty 
in the modern world and the failure of the existing 
system of nation-states to cultivate a &quot;civic 
voice,&quot; a moral connection between the individual 
and the community (or communities) in which she is 
embedded, Sandel has written:
<P>
&quot;The hope for self-government today lies not in 
relocating sovereignty but in dispersing it.  The most 
promising alternative to the sovereign state is not 
a cosmopolitan community based on the solidarity of 
humankind but <I>a multiplicity of communities and political 
bodies--some more extensive than nations and some less--among 
which sovereignty is diffused.  </I>Only a politics that 
disperses sovereignty both upward [to transnational 
institutions] and downward can combine the power required 
to rival global market forces with the diffeentiation 
required of a public life that hopes to inspire the 
allegiance of its citizens. . . . If the nation cannot 
summon more than a minimal commonality, it is unlikely 
that the global community can do better, at least on 
its own.  A more promising basis for a democratic politics 
that reaches beyond nations is a revitalized civic 
life nourished in the more particular communities we 
inhabit.  In the age of NAFTA the politics of neighborhood 
matters more, not less.&quot;<A HREF="./X0026_LBFINFN.html#99">\99\</A>
<P>
Furthermore, the ease with which individuals can move 
between different rule sets in Cyberspace has important 
implications for any contractarian political philosophy 
deriving a justification of the State's exercise of 
coercive power over its citizens from their consent 
to the exercise of that power.  In the nonvirtual world, 
this consent has a strong fictional element:
<P>
State reliance on consent inferred from someone merely 
remaining in the state is particularly unrealistic. 
 An individual's unwillingness to incur the extraordinary 
costs of leaving his or her birthplace should not be 
treated as a consensual undertaking to obey state authority.<A HREF="./X0026_LBFINFN.html#100">\100\</A>
<P>
To be sure, citizens of France, dissatisfied with French 
law and preferring, say, Armenian rules, can try to 
persuade their compatriots and local decision-makers 
of the superiority of the Armenian rule-set.<A HREF="./X0026_LBFINFN.html#101">\101\</A>  
However, their &quot;exit&quot; option, in Albert Hirschman's 
terms, is limited by the need to physically relocate 
to Armenia to take advantage of that rule set.<A HREF="./X0026_LBFINFN.html#102">\102\</A> 
<P>
 In contrast, in Cyberspace, any given user has a more 
accessible exit option, in terms of moving from one 
virtual environment's rule set to another's, thus providing 
a more legitimate &quot;selection mechanism&quot; by 
which differing rule sets will evolve over time.<A HREF="./X0026_LBFINFN.html#103">\103\</A>
<P>
The ability of inhabitants of Cyberspace to cross borders 
at will between legally significant territories, many 
times in a single day, is unsettling.  This power seems 
to undercut the validity of developing distinct laws 
for online culture and commerce:  How can these rules 
be &quot;law&quot; if participants can literally turn 
them on and off with a switch?  Frequent online travel 
might subject relatively mobile human beings to a far 
larger number of rule sets than they would encounter 
traveling through the physical world over the same 
period.  Established authorities, contemplating the 
rise of a new law applicable to online activities, 
might object that we cannot easily live in a world 
with too many different sources and types of law, particularly 
those made by private (non-governmental) parties, without 
breeding confusion and allowing anti-social actors 
to escape effective regulation.
<P>
But the speed with which we can cross legally meaningful 
borders or adopt and then shed legally significant 
roles should not reduce our willingness to recognize 
multiple rule sets.  Rapid travel between spheres of 
being does not detract from the distinctiveness of 
the boundaries, as long as participants realize the 
rules are changing.  Nor does it detract from the appropriateness 
of rules applying within any given place, any more 
than changing commercial or organizational roles in 
the physical world detracts from a person's ability 
to obey and distinguish rules as a member of many different 
institutional affiliations and to know which rules 
are appropriate for which roles.<A HREF="./X0026_LBFINFN.html#104">\104\</A>  Nor does it 
lower the enforceability of any given rule set within 
its appropriate boundaries, as long as groups can control 
unauthorized boundary crossing of groups or messages. 
<P>
 Alternating between different legal identities many 
times during a day may confuse those for whom cyberspace 
remains an alien territory, but for those for whom 
cyberspace is a more natural habitat in which they 
spend increasing amounts of time it may become second 
nature.  Legal systems must learn to accommodate a 
more mobile kind of legal person.<A HREF="./X0026_LBFINFN.html#105">\105\</A>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="V1.  Conclusion">V1.  Conclusion</A></H2>
Global electronic communications have created new spaces 
in which distinct rule sets will evolve.  We can reconcile 
the new law created in this space with current territorially-based 
legal systems by treating it as a distinct doctrine, 
applicable to a clearly demarcated sphere, created 
primarily by legitimate, self-regulatory processes, 
and entitled to appropriate deference--but also subject 
to limitations when it oversteps its appropriate sphere.
<P>
The law of any given place must take into account the 
special characteristics of the space it regulates and 
the types of persons, places, and things found there. 
 Just as a country's jurisprudence reflects its unique 
historical experience and culture, the law of Cyberspace 
will reflect its special character, which differs markedly 
from anything found in the physical world.  For example, 
the law of the Net must deal with persons who &quot;exist&quot; 
in Cyberspace only in the form of an email address 
and whose  purported identity may or may not accurately 
correspond to physical characteristics in the real 
world.  In fact, an e-mail address might not even belong 
to a single person.  Accordingly, if Cyberspace law 
is to recognize the nature of its &quot;subjects,&quot; 
it cannot rest on the same doctrines that give geographically 
based sovereigns jurisdiction over &quot;whole,&quot; 
locatable, physical persons.  The law of the Net must 
be prepared to deal with persons who manifest themselves 
only by means of a particular ID, user account, or 
domain name.
<P>
Moreover, if rights and duties attach to an account 
itself, rather than an underlying real world person, 
traditional concepts such as &quot;equality,&quot; 
&quot;discrimination,&quot; or even &quot;rights and 
duties&quot; may not work as we normally understand 
them.  New angles on these ideas may develop.  For 
example, when AOL users joined the Net in large numbers, 
other Cyberspace users often ridiculed them based on 
the &quot;.aol&quot; tag on their email addresses--a 
form of &quot;domainism&quot; that might be discouraged 
by new forms of Netiquette.  If a doctrine of Cyberspace 
law accords rights to users, we will need to decide 
whether those rights adhere only to particular types 
of online appearances, as distinct from attaching to 
particular individuals in the real world.
<P>
Similarly, the types of &quot;properties&quot; that 
can become the subject of legal discussion in Cyberspace 
will differ from real world real estate or tangible 
objects.  For example, in the real world the physical 
covers of a book delineate the boundaries of a &quot;work&quot; 
for purposes of copyright law;<A HREF="./X0026_LBFINFN.html#106">\106\</A> those limits may 
disappear entirely when the same materials are part 
of a large electronic database.  Thus, we may have 
to change the &quot;fair use&quot; doctrine in copyright 
law that previously depended on calculating what portion 
of the physical work was copied.<A HREF="./X0026_LBFINFN.html#107">\107\</A>  Similarly, a 
web page's &quot;location&quot; in Cyberspace may take 
on a value unrelated to the physical place where the 
disk holding that Web page resides, and efforts to 
regulate web pages by attempting to control physical 
objects may only cause the relevant bits to move from 
one place to another.  On the other hand, the boundaries 
set by &quot;URLs&quot; (Uniform Resource Locators, 
the location of a document on the World Wide Web) may 
need special protection against confiscation or confusingly 
similar addresses.  And, because these online &quot;places&quot; 
may contain offensive material, we may need rules requiring 
(or allowing) groups to post certain signs or markings 
at these places' outer borders.
<P>
The boundaries that separate persons and things behave 
differently in the virtual world but are nonetheless 
legally significant.  Messages posted under one e-mail 
name will not affect the reputation of another e-mail 
address, even if the same physical person authors both 
messages.  Materials separated by a password will be 
accessible to different sets of users, even if those 
materials physically exist on the very same hard drive. 
 A user's claim to a right to a particular online identity 
or to redress when that identity's reputation suffers 
harm, may be valid even if that identity does not correspond 
exactly to that of any single person in the real world.<A HREF="./X0026_LBFINFN.html#108">\108\</A> 
 
<P>
Clear boundaries make law possible, encouraging rapid 
differentiation between rule sets and defining the 
subjects of legal discussion.  New abilities to travel 
or exchange information rapidly across old borders 
may change the legal frame of reference and require 
fundamental changes in legal institutions.  Fundamental 
activities of lawmaking--accommodating conflicting 
claims, defining property rights, establishing rules 
to guide conduct, enforcing those rules, and resolving 
disputes--remain very much alive within the newly defined, 
intangible territory of Cyberspace.  At the same time, 
the newly emerging law challenges the core idea of 
a current law-making authority--the territorial nation 
state, with substantial but legally restrained powers. 
 
<P>
If the rules of Cyberspace thus emerge from consensually 
based rule sets, and the subjects of such laws remain 
free to move among many differing online spaces, then 
considering the actions of Cyberspace's system administrators 
as the exercise of a power akin to &quot;sovereignty&quot; 
may be inappropriate.  Under a legal framework where 
the top level imposes physical order on those below 
it and depends for its continued effectiveness on the 
inability of its citizens to fight back or leave the 
territory, the legal and political doctrines we have 
evolved over the centuries are essential to constrain 
such power.  In that situation, where exit is impossible, 
costly, or painful, then a right to a voice for the 
people is essential.  But when the &quot;persons&quot; 
in question are not whole people, when their &quot;property&quot; 
is intangible and portable, and when all concerned 
may readily escape a jurisdiction they do not find 
empowering, the relationship between the &quot;citizen&quot; 
and the &quot;state&quot; changes radically.  Law, 
defined as a thoughtful group conversation about core 
values, will persist.  But it will not, could not, 
and should not be the same law as that applicable to 
physical, geographically-defined territories.<P>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<hr>
<P>
This section will contain a constantly changing list of issues facing system operators and users, along with discussion of those issues.
<P>
Who should resolve these issues is a different question. Our intent is to discuss these issues from the standpoint of a global electronic medium, not to track developments in the laws of particular countries. <P>
For now, most of "cyberspace law" -- as created and applied by territorially local courts and legislatures -- is "foreign policy", from the perspective of those engaged in online communications and commerce. But new sources of self-regulatory norms and dispute resolution procedures, indigenous to the net, are arising every day.

<H2><A NAME="Introduction">Introduction</A></H2>
     The emergence of the global network -- the "Internet"and its constituent
networks -- and the associated "digital revolution" -- the ability to access, store,
and transmit vast amounts of information in digital form (computer software,
videogames, music, text, etc.) -- presents an array of new problems and
opportunities for lawyers preparing to practice in the 21st Century.  It is becoming
increasingly evident that the process of "mapping" existing legal concepts and tools
into this new domain is not going to be straightforward, and that a number of
familiar legal concepts will need to be rethought before they can be efficiently
applied in the new environment.
     The goal of this course is threefold:
     First, to introduce you, by means of a series of specific case studies chosen
to illustrate the clash between existing legal regimes and new technologies, to a
reasonably comprehensive subset of the legal problems that will need to be
addressed in this new environment;
     Second, to help you, through fairly intensive work on your research papers,
to prepare publishable quality written work; and
     Third, to help you become comfortable with the information-retrieval and
transmission capabilities of this new medium, both because no discussion of the
"law of cyberspace" can be very fruitful without some basic understanding of the
special characteristics of the new domain, and because lawyers will increasingly be
called upon to demonstrate some familiarity with Internet navigation as businesses
(including law firms) increasingly utilize the global network as a means of
delivering their services.<HR>
<A NAME="Housekeeping Details"></A><H2>Some Housekeeping Details</H2>
     The class meets on Tuesdays, from 5:45 - 7:45.
     My office hours (Room 519, McDonough) will be (a) before class
(Tuesday, 4:30 - 5:45), (b) Wednesday evenings (4:30 - 5:30).
     I'm always happy to meet with you at another mutually convenient time.=

Please use any of the following methods to contact me to set up an appointment:
	Phone: 	202-662-9387 (Georgetown Office)
               		202-364-5010 (Home office)
          	Email:    <A HREF="mailto:Postd@erols.com">Postd@erols.com</A>=

	Or
               <A HREF="mailto:david.post@counsel.com">david.post@counsel.com</A><BR>
     	We will <STRONG>not </STRONG>be meeting the first week of classes; our first class will meet
Tuesday, September 2.  We will find some mutually convenient time for a makeup
class later in the semester.<HR>
<H2>Requirements</H2>
<A NAME="Readings"></A><H3>Readings</H3><BR>Readings for each class are listed below, divided into
"Required" reading and "Optional."  As the term suggests, you are responsible for
all of the required reading.  This class will be most productive for everyone if we
have all read the relevant material and are prepared to discuss its implications in
class.  I have tried to limit the material in the "required" category so as to enable
everyone to complete each of the assignments.
     	I have provided the optional material primarily for those of you who are (a)
particularly interested in the subject matter, and/or (b) writing a paper in that area.
In addition, people on the "team" responsible for the issue under discussion (see
below) will be expected to have taken a look at some of the optional material, at
least, so that they can bring more expertise to bear on the class discussions.
     	Finally, there are Web links listed under each class assignment.  Please
spend at least some time exploring these links (or others you uncover), just to get
a feel for the relevant material available on the Web.  One of the themes of this
class is that the "law of cyberspace" is, at least to some extent, already being made
in cyberspace itself; we all have to spend at least some time "out there" in order to
talk intelligently about this subject matter.<HR>
<A NAME="Class Participation"></A><H3>Class Participation. </H3>
<P>I expect, and encourage, everyone to participate actively in class discussions. 
A (small) portion of your grade will be based on your participation in class,
at least to the extent that I will bump up the grade you might otherwise receive if you have
 actively and productively contributed to those discussions.
	I will also be dividing up the class into four "teams" covering the four
major sub-areas of the course: Intellectual Property, Privacy, Free Expression, and
Governance/Jurisdiction.  If you have a preference, please let me know by the end
of the second class meeting (September 9); I will honor that if possible (though I
reserve the right to randomly assign students to teams as necessary to get balance
in the relative numbers).  Members of each team are responsible for:
     	(a) Reading at least a reasonable subset of the "recommended" material for
those classes in their assigned sub-area, so as to bring a somewhat richer and more
broadly informed perspective to bear on the class discussions;
     	(b) Helping to lead the class discussions in that sub-area.  I do mean
"helping"; I do not expect you to take responsibility for conducting those
discussions -- which is my responsibility -- or to have prepared a presentation for
class.  But I will, at the simplest level, ask you to sit at the front of the class and to
help move the discussions along. 
     	(c) Preparing a brief (i.e. 1 page maximum) description of some Internet
site or activity that raises a particularly interesting question of law in that sub-area.
This should describe, in general terms, the nature of the activity that you have
identified, its location in cyberspace (i.e., where one could find it in order to verify
its existence or learn more about it), and a brief description of the legal question(s)
presented.  These will be due on the next-to-last class dealing with your particular
sub-area (indicated on the Reading List below).  I will then distribute these to all
class members, and I expect all class members to spend at least some time (an hour
or so) "visiting" the sites prior to the following week's class, at which we may
focus on one or more of these sites in the class discussion.<HR>
<A NAME="Paper Deadlines"></A><H3>Paper</H3>
	This is an "A" writing seminar, requiring from each student a
substantial research paper.  Much of what you take away from this class will, I
hope, be greater facility in putting together quality work-product of this kind, and
there is nothing more important in the practice of law than your ability to do so.  I
am committed to helping you produce the highest quality paper you are capable of
producing.  I have put together some general points about the writing process (see
<A HREF="#Paper-Writing Guidelines">Appendix 2</A>).  As to deadlines, the following are set in stone barring some major
unforeseen calamity:
<STRONG>A.  Description of Paper Topic </STRONG>     Due Date: Tuesday September 17
<STRONG>B.  Outline </STRONG>
     Due Date: Tuesday, October 22
     Each of you should be sure to schedule a meeting with me during the week
October 22-29, so that we can review your outline.
<STRONG>Paper, First Draft </STRONG>     Due Date: Tuesday, November 19
<STRONG>Final Paper </STRONG>
     Due Date: Tuesday, December 10<HR>
<A NAME="Background Readings"><H2>GENERAL BACKGROUND READINGS AND RESOURCES</H2> </A>
     	Much -- probably most -- of the material relevant for the issues we will be
discussing can be found on the Net.  A general listing of useful Net resources in
provided in <A HREF="#General Web Resources">Appendix 1</A>; specific Net resources are also included (under "Links")
in the assignments for each class.
<A NAME="Books on Reserve "><H3>Books on Reserve </H3></A>
     The following books have been placed on reserve.  You might find them
generally useful, both for background to the issues we will be addressing here and
as a starting point for research on any number of specific topics.
     Nicholas Negroponte, Being Digital
     M. Ethan Katsh, Law in a Digital World
     Lance Rose, Netlaw
     Kevin Kelly, Out of Control
     Henry Perritt, Law and the Information Superhighway
     Cavazos & Morin, Cyberspace and the Law
     Sherry Turkle, Life on the Screen: Identity in the Age of the Internet=


     I recommend any and all of the above for general browsing purposes -- the
Negroponte, Kelly, and Turkle for more general treatments of the question of what
life in the electronic world is, or will be, like, the others for the somewhat narrower
(but perhaps more directly relevant) focus on the development of law in this new
domain.  Useful resources all.

     Other material on Reserve is indicated (with the notation (R)) in the class
assignments.

<STRONG>Journals</STRONG>
     The following are generally worth perusing:

          Harvard Journal of Law and Technology
          Rutgers Journal of Computer & Technology Law
          Santa Clara Journal of High Technology Law
          <A HREF="http://www.law.cornell.edu/jol/jol.table.html">Journal of Online Law </A>
          Richmond Journal of Law and Technology (http://www.urich.edu)
          Wired Magazine
          Internet World<HR>
<A NAME="Classes 1-2"></A><H2>Classes 1-2:  Introduction to Cyberspace</H2>
     	In our first two classes, we will look at the "architecture" -- or is it the
"geography"? -- of cyberspace.  As the court in ACLU v. Reno -- a case we will be
examining in more detail later in the course -- discovered, one cannot talk about
law in cyberspace without first examining the rather remarkable, and certainly
unique, features of this new medium.  Who operates cyberspace? Who owns it, or
any of its constituent pieces? 
<H4>Assignments</H4>
     	On the theory that one way to learn about the geography of a new place is
to spend some time there, please spend an hour or two at some of the sites listed in
the "Guide to Legal Resources on the World Wide Web" in <A HREF="#General Web Resources">Appendix 1</A>.  Do a few
searches at AltaVista -- look for information on copyright law, or Italian opera, or
your home town -- and at Deja News. [What's the difference between the two?] If
you need a "project" to keep you going, here's one: who, or what, is
Cancelmoose?

     	Also: I want to spend at least some time talking generally about your
papers, and the process we will follow in regard to those.  In addition to the
reading below, please look over the "Paper-Writing Guidelines" I have put
together in <A HREF="#Paper-Writing Guidelines">Appendix 2</A>, as well as the
list of potential paper topics in <A HREF="#Paper Topics">Appendix 3</A>.

<A NAME="Classes 3-6 - Intellectual Property"></A><H2>TOPIC 1:  INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY</H2>
<H3>Class 3:  Trademarks in cyberspace.</H3>  How should trademark conflicts on
a global scale be handled in cyberspace?  If an entity has a protected trademark in a
terrestrial jurisdiction (e.g., the United States), what will happen -- and what
should happen -- if another entity using the mark in another country makes it
available over the World Wide Web?  And, as a related but distinct matter, should
trademark protection be afforded for domain names on the Internet? On a sui
generis basis, or should there be some presumption that strong "terrestrial" marks
are carried over into cyberspace?  If protection is to be granted, how should it be
enforced?

network service providers and commercial online services -- is a critical question in
the law of cyberspace.  This is an issue that cuts across most of the substantive
areas of the law that we will be looking at this semester, and I want to focus on
this question in the context of intellectual property disputes and, more narrowly, in
the copyright context:  Who should be liable for copyright infringements in
cyberspace? More generally, what rules of liability should apply to intermediary
behavior?</P>

     <H3>Class 8: Protecting, or Not, Transactional Data</H3>
<P>Cyberspace raises profound questions about individual identity, personhood, and the nature of the
"self"; if you believe that is hyperbolic, I urge you to browse through any part(s) of
Sherry Turkle's Life on the Screen: Identity in the Age of the Internet (R).  In
such an environment, where even fundamental notions of personhood are under
siege, difficult questions about the nature and scope of "personal privacy" interests
infuse virtually all activities and transactions.  We will try to structure our
discussions of this most complex set of questions by focusing first on the question
of "ownership" of personal information: what information might others obtain
about your personal identity, or your electronic identity, and what tools
does/should the law give you to exercise control over the use or disclosure of that
information?  The technology lowers the cost of gathering information about
individuals. The technology increases the value in gathering information about
individuals. Ergo: More information about individuals is collected. Is there a
principled way to oppose this phenomenon?  In particular, we will contrast the
approach taken to these questions under US law with the apparently contrary
approach being developed in the European Union.

    <H3>Class 9: Regulating Encryption Technology</H3>
<P>Just as the technology increases the vulnerability of private space, it also increases
 individuals' ability  to protect private space, most notably through the medium of encryption technology. 
But "perfect privacy," achievable through encryption, may have significant social costs,
at least insofar as it renders the job of law enforcement more difficult.  United States policy
in regard to encryption technology is an attempt to reconcile these competing demands;
how successful has that balance been struck?  
What is the proper scope of government regulation of encryption software or hardware? 
Will "commercial key escrow" systems programs satisfy the demands of all parties to the debate?

<A NAME="Paper-Writing Guidelines"></A><H2>APPENDIX 2: PAPER-WRITING GUIDELINES</H2>
<PRE>
     A few notes to help you begin work on your research papers.

     1.  <STRONG>Research papers are persuasive documents, not book reports.</STRONG> 
The goal, ultimately, is to state a specific question (or set of questions) on which
you will be focusing, and to provide the reader with an answer to that question,
along with a logical argument designed to persuade the reader that the answer
that you have come up with is the best one.  I cannot stress this strongly
enough; far and away, the most significant reason that student papers are
unsatisfactory is the absence of any sense that they are designed to marshall
arguments in support of some particular position. 

     The structure is not all that dissimilar from the litigation documents
that you're probably familiar with -- briefs, memoranda of law, or the like.=

The process is more difficult because with (most) documents in the litigation
context you start from a well-defined end-point: -- e.g. my client should not be
liable for certain activity because . . . - - and work backwards.  With a research
paper, you don't know what the end point is going to be when you begin --
and, in fact, you often don't know what the end-point is going to be until you
are well along in your research.  There is no way to make that problem
disappear; it is inherent in the process of putting a good paper together.  But
recognizing it as a problem will help to work through it.

     2. <STRONG> Choosing the Topic.  </STRONG>
     Necessarily, you have to begin by choosing a topic to write about,
some general area of the law on which you will focus your attention -- e.g.,
copyright in cyberspace, privacy interests in electronic mail, the control of
encryption software, first amendment and communication on the Internet, etc.=

You may choose any issue that we are covering in class, or any other issue
raising questions of law, or law-making, in cyberspace.  See Appendix 3 for a
very tentative list of possible paper topics. 

     A description of your topic is due on September 17.  This can be a
brief, one paragraph statement, simply setting forth the topic that you will be
examining.  The point here is simply to indicate the area of law that you will
be addressing, to reassure me that you are heading in a direction that will
sustain a research paper of the scope required here (and to enable me to
suggest possible lines of argument, and resources, that may be available to
you).

     3.  <STRONG>Beginning the Outline: Choosing a question.</STRONG>
     Choosing a topic is, usually, the easy part; it should not be too difficult
for you to find some issue bearing on the law of cyberspace that you think is
particularly interesting and that you would like to spend more time thinking
about.  Once you have your topic, you should spend several weeks reading
everything you can get your hands on about the general area, with a single
goal in mind: to find the specific question(s) that you will be focusing on and
to which your paper will provide, or at least attempt to provide, an answer.
"Copyright in cyberspace" is an interesting topic, but it is not a question that
your paper can answer -- indeed, it is not even a question at all.  Your job
during the first few weeks after you have chosen your basic topic is to find the
question or questions within the general subject area that (a) are likely to be
interesting enough to support a fairly extensive treatment (i.e., are not so
narrow that they can too easily be disposed of in a few pages), and (b) not so
broad that they cannot be adequately answered in the 25-35 or so pages that
you will be devoting to them. 

     Finding the  right' question or questions is the single most important
part of the entire process.  You can't write persuasively until you know what
you are trying to persuade your readers about, and you can't have a well-constructed
argument until you know what question you are addressing.  For
example:  "Is file caching on the World Wide Web copyright infringement,
and, if so, is it excused by either the doctrine of  fair use' or "implied
license'?" or "Is employer monitoring of employee e-mail communications a
violation of the Electronic Communications Privacy Act?", or "Can states,
consistent with the Due Process Clause, exercise criminal jurisdiction over
non-residents based on their provision of services over the World Wide Web?",
or "What are the constraints on the use or disclosure of aggregated information
derived from Internet usage by marketers?", or . . .  You get the idea.

     There are no tricks here -- you can't simply say that your topic is
"copyright in cyberspace" and that the question you want to answer is "what
should copyright law look like in cyberspace?", simply because that is not,
realistically, a question that you can really answer in a paper of this length. 

     4.  <STRONG>The Outline.  </STRONG>
     Once you know the question that you will be focusing on, the paper,
fundamentally, consists of nothing more (!) than your answer to the question
you have posed, along with a logical argument designed to persuade your
reader that your answer is, in fact, the best available one.  This is an iterative
and dynamic process.  After you have selected a question, you may do research
on that question and discover that there is a different, related question that is in
fact more interesting.  Or, as you are constructing your argument in support of
a particular answer you may realize that your initial answer is in fact
completely wrong, and that the evidence strongly supports the precise opposite
conclusion.  This is not only unavoidable, it is part of what makes this process
interesting and exciting -- and you must be flexible enough to be open to
modifications of all of these components as your research proceeds. 

     But flexibility does not mean that you proceed without any goal in
mind.  The best way to accomplish this project is settle on your preferred
answer early in this process, and then to get to work producing the argument
that supports that answer.  This is a bit counter-intuitive; your instinct is likely
to be that you want to "wait until all your research is completed" before
settling on the answer to the question you have posed.  That is, in virtually all
cases, a mistake; first, because you never magically reach the point where your
"research is completed," and, second, because you will be far more capable of
making sense of the material you uncover in your research if you are trying to
fit it into a logical structure early on. 
    
     The Outline -- due Tuesday, October 22 -- is probably the most
important document of all.  It must contain a short (i.e., one- or two-sentence)
thesis statement, consisting of the question you will be addressing and the
proposition that you hope to establish in your paper (i.e., your answer).  The
remainder of the outline sets forth the overall structure of the argument you
will be making in order to persuade the reader of the correctness of this
proposition.

     THE OUTLINE IS NOT MERELY AN EXPANSION OF THE
TOPIC THAT YOU ARE ADDRESSING.  IT MUST SET FORTH THE
PROPOSITIONS THAT YOU HOPE TO ESTABLISH -- THE
ARGUMENT -- TO PERSUADE THE READER THE YOU HAVE
PRODUCED A SATISFACTORY ANSWER TO THE QUESTION THAT
YOU ARE ADDRESSING.  Avoid passive constructions and future tense at
all costs, the former because they allow (and encourage) you to obscure your
own views and ideas, the latter because I want you to present me with a logical
argument in the outline (not a description of what you hope to cover in the
future).  The following is NOT an acceptable outline:

     Anonymity in cyberspace
     A.  This paper will look at the regulation of anonymity in cyberspace,
and will discuss the ways that the "perfect anonymity" achievable in
cyberspace affects our analysis of the constitutionality of such regulation.
     B.   I will first look at the constitutionality of regulating anonymity in
the context of laws compelling disclosure of  identity in the context of political
campaigns.  The case of McIntyre v. Ohio Elections Comm. will be discussed.
          1.  The Court's analysis of anonymity in McIntyre will be
contrasted with its discussion of the constitutionality of compelled disclosure
in Buckley v. Valeo.
     C.  The question whether anonymity deserves protection beyond the
boundaries of "political speech" will be considered.
[etc. etc]
    
     The above would be perfectly acceptable as the beginning of a
"research plan," pointing out the directions that you hope to move through
your research; it is not, however, an outline, for the architecture of the
argument you are making is not at all clear.  What is the author going to say
about McIntyre v. Ohio Elections Comm.?  What does the author think is
revealed by the comparison between McIntyre and Buckley?  What is the
question being answered?

     The following is an example of an outline that more adequately deals
with these problems.  The specific argument that is being made is irrelevant;
the point is that a position is taken, and a logical argument set forth to justify
that position.  Because the logic of the argument works, the only remaining
question is whether each of the main points can be substantiated in the paper
itself.

I.   File Caching and Copyright in Cyberspace
     Thesis Statement: File caching -- the creation of copies of electronic
documents on the World Wide Web in order to speed up subsequent access to
those documents -- should not be considered an infringement of the Web page
owner's copyright
    
     A.   File caching is of potentially great benefit to the Internet as a
          whole via its effects in increasing transmission speeds
     B.   File caching does involve acts that appear to be
          "reproductions" under current law (as well as possible
          violations of the copyright owner's display and
          distribution rights), and are therefore prima facie
          copyright infringements
          1.   The precise status of caching under copyright
               law is somewhat uncertain, however, due to
               uncertainty surrounding the definition of an
               actionable "copy" in the electronic context
     C    The treatment of caching, however, should be not be based on
          the mechanical application of definitions derived from the non-electronic context,
          but should instead be based on an analysis
          of the purposes of copyright law -- to promote the progress of
          Science and the Useful Arts
     D.   If transactions costs were absent, the designation of
          caching as infringing activity (or not) under copyright
          law would have no effect on the amount of caching
          that took place, because parties would be able to agree
          by contract as to whether caching was or was not
          permissible in particular cases
     E.   But the transactions costs that are present (even in
          cyberspace) will lead to "overdeterrence" if caching is
          treated as actionable activity under copyright law
          1.   Because of the uncertainty that necessarily
               surrounds the defenses to a claim of
               infringement -- fair use and  implied license,'
               in particular -- individuals will not be able to
               determine whether or not caching is, or is not,
               unlawful in particular circumstances
          2.   The availability of statutory damages for
               caching will likely produce  opportunistic'
               behavior by content providers
          3.   Individual agreements between parties wishing
               to cache and content providers will not take
               into account the system-wide (external)
               benefits that are derived from caching
     F    The "market for caching" -- the ability of individuals to agree
          upon the proper scope of caching of individual Web pages --
          will function more effectively if users are given the "right" to
          cache (rather than copyright owners the  right' to prevent
                    caching)<HR>
<A NAME="Paper Topics"></A><H2>APPENDIX 3:  POSSIBLE PAPER TOPICS</H2>

<P>

{par. 1} The legal rules that will govern cyberspace are yet to

be clarified. Important as those rules will be, a prior question

is &quot;who will make and enforce those rules?&quot; Professor

Post examines various &quot;controllers,&quot; or points from

which rules can issue, ranging from technical network protocols,

to private organizations like universities, to Congressional statutes.

These controllers vary in their ability to enforce whatever rules

they choose to adopt, depending on the existence of conflicting

higher-level controllers, and on the possibility that those who

are subject to the rules can change jurisdictions to seek a more

favorable rule set. The Internet allows a relatively easy change

of jurisdiction, or &quot;exit,&quot; from any given controller,

leading to the unprecedented-and unpredictable-situation of a

&quot;free market&quot; in rule sets.<HR>



<H2><A NAME="Introduction">Introduction</A></H2>



<P>

{par. 2} Increasing attention is currently paid to important and

interesting questions about the rules that will, or should, govern

behavior within the global networked environment: What shape should

copyright protection take in a world of instantaneous, costless,

and undetectable copying? Should the First Amendment be interpreted

to encompass a right to post anonymous messages, or commercial

messages, across Usenet groups, or a right to send encrypted messages

that are, for all intents and purposes, immune to eavesdropping

by law enforcement? What standard of liability should be imposed

on system operators in regard to the availability of &quot;obscene&quot;

material on their systems?

<P>

{par. 3} This focus on the substantive content of legal rules

reflects, at least in part, what Oliver Williamson has called

&quot;legal centralism.&quot; <A NAME="FN2A"> </A><A

HREF="#Note_2">[FN 2]</A>  A

&quot;centralist&quot; inquiry focuses on alternative sets of

substantive laws-with an eye toward determining which set is optimal

in terms of some pre-defined criterion such as aggregate welfare.

This is an entirely appropriate model for an inquiry where some

law-making body-typically a sovereign government-is in a position

to choose the optimal set of laws.

<P>

{par. 4} My focus in this essay, however, is elsewhere. To the

extent that the global network proves relatively resistant to

centralized control-and I believe that it will so prove, for some

of the reasons addressed below-the question &quot;Which copyright

law is 'best'&quot; must at least be supplemented by the question

&quot;What are the forces that govern the legal system's trajectory

through 'rule-space', and which configuration(s) of copyright

law is likely to emerge from the operation of those forces over

time?&quot; <A NAME="FN3A"> </A><A HREF="#Note_3">[FN 3]</A> 

Before we try to answer

the substantive questions-before we try to decide what the &quot;best&quot;

copyright law for the global network might look like-we should

pause to consider a necessarily antecedent question: what mechanisms

exist whereby such a law could be implemented? Who can make and

enforce the rules in cyberspace, whatever the substantive content

of those rules might be?

<P>

{par. 5} What follows is a rough sketch both of the reasons why

these are particularly interesting and rich questions in the context

of electronic networks, and also of a framework that may help

to structure the inquiry into law and law-making on the global

network. Cyberspace has itself already demonstrated the immense

power of collective intellectual efforts, and I offer this essay

in the hopes of spurring others to think about these important

questions in new and fruitful ways. <A NAME="FN4A"> </A><A

<H2><A NAME="Law-Making">Law-Making and Social Control in <BR>

Network Communities<TT> </TT></A></H2>



<P>

{par. 6} Robert Ellickson's framework for behavioral controls

is a useful starting point for a discussion of the various forces

governing individual behavior in electronic networks. <A NAME="FN5A">

</A><A HREF="#Note_5">[FN 5]</A>

{par. 7} Ellickson identifies five &quot;controllers&quot; that

can provide substantive rules governing an individual's behavior:

the actor him/herself, other individuals being acted upon, non-hierarchically

organized social forces, hierarchically-organized non-governmental

organizations, and, finally, governments, i.e., hierarchical organizations

&quot;widely regarded as having the legitimate authority to inflict

detriments on persons within its geographically defined jurisdiction

who have not necessarily voluntarily submitted themselves to its

authority.&quot; <A NAME="FN6A"> </A><A HREF="#Note_6">[FN 6]</A> 

Ellickson's descriptive

labels for each controller's substantive rules, and the rewards

and punishments through which each enforces those rules, are set

forth below.

<P>

{par. 9} For an illustration of the application of this framework,

consider the various rules that combine to determine the frequency

with which a particular behavior-say, the transmission of messages

containing any of the FCC's &quot;seven dirty words&quot; might

occur on my university's local area network. <A NAME="FN7A"> </A><A

HREF="#Note_7">[FN 7]</A>

 Each network participant may have a personal ethical position

in regard to the propriety or impropriety of such messages.

<P>

{par. 10} One can imagine-not terribly realistically, perhaps,

in this context-bilateral agreements between network users regarding

the use of particular words in e-mail messages or in files stored

on the network, or even resort to self-help (in the form of authorized

or unauthorized file deletion) by individual network users. Each

of these is, in turn, at least partially determined by each user's

response to various social forces such as cultural or professional

norms. Formal or informal organization rules, promulgated by the

network administrators (i.e., by Georgetown University itself),

may apply to this conduct, as may federal or state laws regarding

the transmission of &quot;obscene&quot; messages.

<P>

{par. 11} The question I am here addressing-whose rules will govern

behavior in cyberspace?-can thus be rephrased: how does the competition

among these controllers proceed? What are the &quot;controller-selecting

rules&quot; <A NAME="FN8A"> </A><A HREF="#Note_8">[FN 8]</A>  that

determine which

controller's rules take precedence in the event of conflict? To

take a concrete example, how would the Communications Decency

Act recently introduced in the US Senate <A NAME="FN9A"> </A><A

HREF="#Note_9">[FN 9]</A>

 affect the frequency with which &quot;indecent&quot; or &quot;obscene&quot;

communications appear in any particular network community if the

proscriptions in that Act conflicted with other behavioral

&quot;controllers&quot;

within that community? And most specifically, what are the special

characteristics of electronic networks that might influence the

way in which these controller-selecting rules operate?

<H2><A NAME="The Nature of Networks">The Nature of Networks </A></H2>



<BLOCKQUOTE>

{par. 12} <strong>1. Networks-electronic or otherwise-are particular

kinds of &quot;organizations&quot; that are not merely capable

of promulgating substantive rules of conduct; their very essence

is defined by such rules-in this case, the &quot;network protocols&quot;.

Accordingly, the person or entity in a position to dictate the

content of these network protocols is, in the first instance at

least, a primary &quot;rule-maker&quot; in regard to behavior

on the network. </strong>

</BLOCKQUOTE>



<P>

{par. 13} What we call &quot;cyberspace&quot; can be characterized

as a multitude of individual, but interconnected, electronic communications

networks , e.g., individual BBS systems, Prodigy, the Georgetown

University LAN, the Cyberia discussion list, or the network of

machines that can communicate across the World Wide Web. Communication

networks of any kind-a number of individuals meeting together

in a room or the network comprising the people who read this essay,

in addition to the network of computers communicating on America

Online-are defined at a minimum by a set of rules-the &quot;network

protocols&quot;-specifying (a) the medium through which messages

can travel, (b) the characteristics of the messages that are permitted

to enter the network, and the manner in which messages are routed

through this medium to network members.

<P>

{par. 14} A group of children playing the game of &quot;telephone,&quot;

for example, constitutes a network, as do the participants in

a university seminar presentation. In both, the network protocols

require audible sounds transmitted through the atmosphere (though

at low volume in the case of &quot;telephone&quot;). Each network

has its own message origination and routing rules; in &quot;telephone,&quot;

messages originate with the child on one side of the room and

are routed from one child to the child immediately adjacent. At

the seminar, the rules may require that all messages originate

from the speaker (&quot;No questions until I'm finished&quot;)

from whom they are routed simultaneously to all participants (&quot;Can

you hear me in the back row?&quot;).

<P>

{par. 15} Similarly, the local area network at Georgetown University

on which I am composing this essay requires that messages be transmitted

through special cabling installed in our building, and further

that those messages obey certain formatting and coding conventions,

embodied in the LAN operating system software, that will allow

them to be appropriately managed by the central LAN server.

<P>

{par. 16} In one sense, then, networks are not merely governed

by substantive rules of conduct, they have no existence apart

from such rules. Viewed in this light, the network protocols have

a kind of first-order competitive advantage over other controllers

in regard to the behavior that occurs there by virtue of their

ability to control entry onto the network by excluding behavior

that is inconsistent with the message entry rules. Accordingly,

the person or entity in a position to dictate the content of these

network protocols is, in the first instance at least, a primary

&quot;rule-maker&quot; in regard to behavior on the network.

<P>

{par. 17} This is, admittedly, something of a definitional trick

in regard to most ordinary networks, unlikely to illuminate behavioral

questions of real interest, because the boundary between being

&quot;on&quot; and &quot;off&quot; the network has little objective

meaning with respect to whatever questions we are likely to have

about the frequency with which particular behaviors manifest themselves.

For example, suppose that during our game of telephone one of

the children stands up and says, in an inappropriately loud voice:

<BLOCKQUOTE>

{par. 18} &quot;This is a stupid game, here's what the message

is: 'Johnny and Susie were holding hands in class yesterday'.&quot;

</BLOCKQUOTE>



<P>

{par. 19} If we are interested in how these children behave on

the &quot;telephone game&quot; network, we can ignore this comment;

because it violates the network protocols, we can simply deem

it to have occurred &quot;off the network.&quot; But that is unlikely

to help us understand the children's behavior in any meaningful

sense. The other children have heard the message, and have observed

this conduct, even though it took place &quot;off the network.&quot;

To the extent that this particular network is largely an artificial

construct existing almost exclusively in the mind of the observer,

the fact that in some technical sense the protocols exclude this

particular behavior will have few, if any, meaningful consequences.

<P>

{par. 20} Entry of messages into, and routing of messages across,

digitally-based electronic networks, however, are controlled by

more effective protocols than in our game-of-telephone example:

each network's technical specifications (typically embodied in

software or switching mechanisms) constitute rules that precisely

distinguish between compliant and non-compliant messages. This

boundary is less easily dismissed as an artificial construct because

the rules are effectively self-enforcing. To put the matter simply,

you can't &quot;almost&quot; be on the Georgetown University LAN

or America Online-you are either transmitting LAN- or AOL-compliant

messages or you are not.

<P>

{par. 21} As a consequence, the ability of this control mechanism

to impose its rules on network conduct is considerably less trivial

for electronic networks than for their non-electronic counterparts,

because permissible behavior can be more precisely demarcated

from that which is impermissible. Any discussion of rule-making

in cyberspace therefore should begin by looking at the role of

the entities and institutions defining the network protocols,

because this level of organizational controller has what might

be termed &quot;competitive advantages&quot; over other controllers

in electronic network communities.

<P>

{par. 22} Are these network technical specifications, then, part

of the &quot;law of cyberspace&quot;? I believe that they are-or

at least that it would be profitable to analyze them as such.

On the one hand, they would appear to govern a fairly narrow range

of what we might want to call &quot;behavior.&quot; Whether one

is using an HTML-compliant Internet browser, even or odd parity

to communicate over a network, fixed- or variable-length message

packets, or the SMTP mail-routing protocol, would not appear to

have much to do with the behavioral questions of copyright infringement,

transmission of obscene messages, fraud, and the like that we're

really interested in when we speak of the &quot;law of cyberspace.&quot;

Because network technical specifications generally operate on

those message characteristics unrelated to message content, they

might appear to be of little relevance to our understanding of

the constraints on behaviors that can only be defined with reference

to precisely that content.

<P>

{par. 23} But we shouldn't dismiss them quite so quickly as entirely

irrelevant to our inquiry, because these technical specifications

may reach further down into message content and meaning than one

might think at first glance. It is easy to overlook the fact that

the message traffic over digital networks consists entirely of

strings of binary digits. In this environment, the line between

the meaning contained in message transmissions, and the purely

technical contours of those messages, is blurred indeed.

<P>

{par. 24} One can hardly imagine, to be sure, a rule regarding,

say, fraudulent transactions that would be capable of digital

embodiment in these engineering specifications. One can imagine,

however, a digital embodiment of rules regarding other activities-for

example, the transmission of anonymous messages, or encrypted

files-that can be more easily expressed in digital form and thereby

enforced at the level of the technical network specifications.

The scope for digitizing behavioral rules represents a particularly

fruitful avenue of inquiry in any attempt to determine the role

that these specifications may play in setting the rules of conduct

on these networks. <A NAME="FN10A"> </A><A HREF="#Note_10">[FN

10]</A> 

<P>

{par. 25} And note also that these digitally-embodied network

specifications are not the only means by which the network organization

controller can impose its rules regarding permissible or prohibited

network behaviors. Any centralized network architecture involving

a single location through which all messages must pass-whether

it is a client-server LAN or a moderated Internet newsgroup-allows

for the examination of all transmissions for compliance with specific

behavioral rules. That is, whether or not Georgetown University's

LAN can implement in its operating system software a rule excluding

&quot;obscene&quot; messages, the LAN administrator can, though

perhaps at significant cost, screen all messages for compliance

with a rule prohibiting such transmissions. <A NAME="FN11A"> </A><A

HREF="#Note_11">[FN 11]</A>

 Similarly, a discussion group moderator can announce and enforce

a rule providing that any messages not meeting certain criteria-of

relevance to the group's focus, or taste or propriety, etc. will

be deleted.

<P>

{par. 26} My thesis, then, is that this controller-the individual

network &quot;organizations&quot; themselves-possesses at least

certain inherent advantages in the competition for rule-making

precedence in cyberspace, and that this controller is therefore

potentially the locus for much of the substantive rule-making

that will take place there.

<P>

{par. 27} &quot;Potentially&quot; is the operative word. Saying

that cyberspace may consist of a large number of individual networks,

each with its own rules (about, e.g., the propriety of obscene

text and the definition of &quot;obscenity&quot;) does not tell

us whether or not the law of cyberspace will in the aggregate

consist of a diverse set of such rules or will converge on a single,

or a small number, of such rules. To analyze that question we

need to examine one additional feature of the competition among

controllers.

<BLOCKQUOTE>

{par. 28} <strong>2. The competition among controllers is asymmetric,

at least insofar as the State holds a monopoly on the imposition

of coercive sanctions on controllers lower down in the controller

hierarchy. The State's ability to impose its substantive law by

means of such sanctions, however, is substantially constrained

by the existence of the global Internet itself, which provides

a credible exit strategy for networks and other lower order

controllers.</strong>



</BLOCKQUOTE>



<P>

{par. 29} There is something of an asymmetry in the ranking of

controllers, at least insofar as the State has a monopoly on the

use of coercive sanctions when faced with violations of whatever

rules it promulgates. Thus, we can speak of the ability of this

controller to impose its laws on the individuals, contracting

parties, or organizations lower down in the controller hierarchy,

but not vice versa; neither individual actors, nor contracting

parties, nor organizations, can similarly impose their preferred

substantive rules on the State where the State's laws are in conflict

with theirs. The effectiveness of the State's sanctions, generally

speaking, is an inverse function of the ease with which the lower-order

controllers can &quot;exit&quot; from the regime defined by those

laws-by evading detection of rule-violating behavior, evading

the State-imposed sanctions for such violations, or somehow withdrawing

from the rule-making jurisdiction of the State as controller.

<A NAME="FN12A"> </A><A HREF="#Note_12">[FN 12]</A> 

<P>

{par. 30} This notion of &quot;exit&quot; may be generalized to

apply across the entire controller hierarchy, i.e, it may be useful

to think of each controller possessing the ability to impose its

rules on lower-order controllers, each of whom needs to rely on

some form of exit in order to counter that imposition. Thus, the

organization by whom I am employed, Georgetown University, can

impose its rules regarding proper faculty conduct on my behavior,

subject to my ability to evade detection should I behave in contravention

of those rules, my ability to evade the sanctions that Georgetown

imposes in the event such behavior is detected, and, finally,

my ability to obtain substantially equivalent employment elsewhere

and thereby leave Georgetown's jurisdiction entirely.

<P>

{par. 31} Returning, then, to our question of diversity and uniformity

of network rule-sets, imposition of governmental laws on those

individual network rule-sets is one way that a measure of rule-uniformity

may emerge in cyberspace. The State will experience obvious difficulties

in attempting to monitor the behavior of individual network users,

who are numerous and dispersed across many such networks. Because

each such network functions as a gatekeeper for its users in cyberspace,

however, we might expect that governments will try to rely instead

on their ability to impose coercive sanctions on network administrators

(and thereby on the network rules) in order to implement their

own particular preferred set of rules on behavior in this environment.

<A NAME="FN13A"> </A><A HREF="#Note_13">[FN 13]</A> 

<P>

{par. 32} The extent to which this will occur, and the substantive

areas in which this strategy is most likely to be tried and in

which it is most likely to be effective, are important and complex

questions the full explication of which is far beyond the scope

of this essay. I have, again, a single observation that may shed

some light here: the existence of the global internetwork functions

as a significant constraint on any sovereign's ability to implement

this strategy.

<P>

{par. 33} The Internet, like any network, is not a physical object

with a tangible existence, but is itself a set of network protocols

that has been adopted by a large number of individual networks

allowing the transfer of information among them. There may well

be no principle more important for understanding rule-making in

cyberspace than that of distinguishing between the Internet as

a whole and the individual networks that are its component members;

it is indeed the interplay between the vast number of largely

centralized individual networks and the decentralized internetwork

through which they can communicate that will prove to be of fundamental

importance in determining the efficacy with which State law can

be imposed on individual network communities. <A NAME="FN14A"> </A><A

HREF="#Note_14">[FN 14]</A>



<P>

{par. 34} The State's ability to impose sanctions on law-violators

is fundamentally constrained by the need for physical proximity

and physical control. This is by no means an absolute constraint;

mechanisms do exist, of course, whereby individual sovereigns

can impose their rules on persons or entities not physically present

in the area over which the sovereign has control.

<P>

{par. 35} Such mechanisms, however, entail additional enforcement

costs, both in terms of the direct costs of projecting sovereign

power extra-territorially and the costs of coordinating and harmonizing

the legal regimes of competing sovereigns. Thus, United States

law is not ordinarily applicable to, nor can the United States

ordinarily apply sanctions on, a network operator in, say, Singapore;

attempts by the United States to go around these limitations require

either some means of obtaining control over the network operator

or its assets, or some measure of cooperation with State authorities

in Singapore or other jurisdictions where the operator maintains

physical assets on which judgments can be executed.

<P>

{par. 36} The Internet, of course, is multi-jurisdictional in

the obvious sense that messages can travel from a network in Washington

to one in Singapore, or Kazakhstan, or anywhere on the globe where

there are computers with access to the Internet's medium of communication.

But the Internet is not merely multi-jurisdictional, it is almost

&quot;a-jurisdictional:&quot; physical location, and physical

boundaries, are irrelevant in this networked environment in a

way that has, I believe, no parallel elsewhere.

<P>

{par. 37} Moving through the World Wide Web, for example, by following

hypertext links from one Internet site to another, the user is

almost completely indifferent (and, indeed, may have no way of

knowing) whether the file she is viewing resides on a computer

down the street or across the globe; similarly, whether control

of the Cyberia listserver is exercised by a computer in Williamsburg,

Virginia or Williams Corner, New South Wales, has almost no effect

on the functional capabilities of that particular network or the

ease with which any individual with Internet access can participate

in the activities taking place on that network.

<P>

{par. 38} This independence from geographical constraints results

from both the electronic nature of the message transmission, which

largely decouples the physical distance between communicating

machines from message travel times and, more significantly, from

the decentralized design of the Internet. Because the Internet,

unlike most of its constituent networks, was designed without

a centralized control mechanism or any single location through

which all internetwork traffic must travel, all network nodes

are effectively equipotent, each equally capable of performing

the key internetwork message routing functions.

<P>

{par. 39} As a consequence, the Internet itself is an &quot;exit

strategy&quot; for individual network rule-makers, in two senses.

First, the Internet allows one to exit by evading detection. Decentralization

implies that the costs of monitoring behavior are substantially

higher, and rule-violative behavior substantially more difficult

to detect, than would be the case under a centralized internetwork

design.

<P>

{par. 40} The second sense pertains to exit by withdrawal from

jurisdictional control, the relocation of rule-violative behavior

so that it is outside the jurisdiction of any physically-based

sovereign. Should a particular network rule-set be incompatible

with the law of sovereign X, the network rule-set itself can,

with relative ease, be transferred elsewhere on the internetwork,

outside of the sovereign's jurisdictional boundaries. Georgetown

University, that is, may indeed choose to implement a particular

rule prohibiting the transmission of certain kinds of pornographic

images across the Georgetown LAN, and it may well do so because

the District of Columbia, or the United States, government has

forced it to do so (i.e., has decided to impose sanctions on networks

within its jurisdictional control who do not implement such rules).

And Georgetown may indeed be able to enforce this prohibition

in regard to its own network, subject to whatever difficulties

it may encounter in trying to detect violations of this rule.

<P>

{par. 41} The effect of Georgetown's rules on the behavior itself,

however-on the availability of pornographic images and the frequency

with which such images are transmitted across the aggregated internetwork-may

be considerably attenuated or even non-existent. To the extent

that those conducting this behavior on the Georgetown LAN can,

by virtue of their access to the Internet, equally easily access

some other network whose rules are not subject to the control

of the District of Columbia or United States, this rule-set, and

the images themselves, can migrate to the less restrictive jurisdiction.

<HR>



<H2><A NAME="Conclusion">Conclusion </A></H2>



<P>

{par. 42} The model sketched out above implies that although each

individual network can be constrained from &quot;above&quot; in

regard to the rule-sets it can, or cannot, adopt, the aggregate

range of such rule-sets in cyberspace will be far less susceptible

to such control. A kind of competition between individual networks

to design and implement rule-sets compatible with the preferences

of individual internetwork users will thus materialize in a new

and largely unregulated, because largely unregulatable, market

for rules. The outcome of the individual decisions within this

market-the aggregated choices of individual users seeking particular

network rule-sets most to their liking-will therefore, to a significant

extent, determine the contours of the &quot;law of cyberspace.&quot;

<P>

{par. 43} What kind of rules will emerge from this process? We

have almost no experience with unregulated markets for social

control rules, and hence have little basis for predicting the

criteria that people are likely to use in choosing among these

alternative rule-sets and to predict the outcome of this competition.

<A NAME="FN15A"> </A><A HREF="#Note_15">[FN 15]</A>  Two points

seem clear, however.

First, the prospect of relatively unfettered individual choice

among competing sets of rules is surely an attractive prospect,

to the extent that what emerges represents the rules that people

have voluntarily chosen to adopt rather than rules that have been

imposed by others upon them.

<P>

{par. 44} Second, rules governing behavior in individual networks

may generate negative externalities in regard to participants

in other networks in much the same way that an individual geographical

community's laws (regarding, say, water pollution) can impose

costs on neighboring communities. <A NAME="FN16A"> </A><A

HREF="#Note_16">[FN 16]</A>

 All communities may benefit from an agreement establishing a

rule prohibiting polluting activities, but absent a means to enforce

that agreement it may be in each individual community's interests

to &quot;cheat.&quot; This, of course, is the familiar Prisoner's

Dilemma, and to the extent that my description of rule-making

in cyberspace is accurate, there may be no more important task

facing those interested in the future course of cyberspace than

to develop ways in which this coordination problem can be solved

with a minimum of interference with the freedom of individuals

to choose the rules under which they wish to operate.<HR>

these differences in approach. To understand why cockroaches are

the way they are, biologists do not begin with questions of the

form &quot;what is the optimally-designed cockroach?&quot; or

&quot;would a cockroach with 8 legs, or one capable of photosynthesis,

be a 'better' cockroach?&quot; Those questions might well be appropriate

if we were in the business of designing some organism to do cockroach-like

1995, S. 314, was introduced on February 1, 1995 by Senator Exon

or otherwise makes available&quot; by means of a &quot;telephone

or telecommunications device&quot; any &quot;obscene, lewd, lascivious,

filthy, or indecent&quot; comment. This has occasioned much controversy;

<A NAME="Note_10">NOTE 10</A>: To take another example, the design

of the next generation of the hypertext transfer protocol-HTTP,

the set of specifications permitting transmission of World Wide

Task Force. <I>See</I> &lt;<A HREF="http://www.w3.org

/hypertext/WWW/Protocols/Http-ng/http-ng-status.html">HTTP copy</A>&gt;.

One of the design goals under consideration for implementation

within this new version of HTTP would optimize the &quot;caching&quot;

of World Wide Web pages; caching involves downloading and copying

Web pages off of their host machines and onto intermediate servers

(a LAN server, for example, or some other individual network host),

which enables those users with direct connections to that intermediate

host to access those pages without the need to wait for files

to be transferred over the Internet. Caching, of course, raises

difficult questions under U.S. copyright law; if storing a Web

page in a cache constitutes the making of a &quot;copy&quot;-as

it well might under the view of such cases as <I>MAI Systems Corp.

v. Peak Computer, Inc., </I>991 F.2d 511 (9th Cir. 1993) and <I>Advanced

Computer Services v. MA Systems Corp.,</I> 845 F.Supp. 356 (E.D.

Va. 1994), holding that transitory fixation in RAM constitutes

copying for purposes of the Copyright Act-then each instance of

caching constitutes prima facie copyright infringement. My point

here is not to debate whether or not copyright law should be interpreted

in this manner, but rather that anyone interested in that question

must take a long look at the new HTTP standards, for any view

of the copyright rules that will govern on the Internet that does

not take these technical rules regarding permissible copying into

account will necessarily be sorely deficient.<A HREF="#FN10A"><I>Return to

<P>
DRAFT<BR>
March 4, 1996<P>

The hoopla surrounding passage of the Telecommunications 
Reform Act of 1996 -- and its provisions regarding 
the provision of &quot;obscene&quot; or &quot;indecent&quot; 
materials over computer networks -- suggests that this 
is, at least, the sexiest story thus far regarding 
Congress' attempts to regulate activities on the Internet. 
 I doubt, however, that it is the most significant 
one.  Congress is now considering amendments to the 
Copyright Act that would likely have far greater impact 
on the development of electronic communications than 
will the Communications Decency Act, though, since 
it lacks any reference to children poring over pornographic 
images, press coverage has been less than overwhelming. 
 <P>

The bills were originally proposed in the Administration's 
&quot;White Paper&quot; on Intellectual Property and 
the National Information Infrastructure, published 
last Fall, as a way to &quot;accommodate and adapt 
[copyright] law to technological change so that the 
[balance between producer and users] is maintained 
and the Constitutional purpose&quot; -- to &quot;promote 
the progress of science and the useful Arts&quot; -- 
is served.  The White Paper labels these changes as 
only a &quot;minor clarification&quot; and &quot;limited 
amendment&quot; of current law, a &quot;few alterations&quot; 
that will update a &quot;fundamentally adequate and 
effective&quot; Copyright Act.  But I, and others, 
believe that they may represent far more than that. 
 This is not just a trivial semantic point; after all, 
who cares (or should care) about some &quot;minor clarification&quot; 
of an already complex, technically intricate, and at 
times incomprehensible statute? But if these proposals 
will in fact fundamentally re-shape the way that copyright 
law applies to digital information on the global network, 
then anyone with an interest in how the law is going 
to shape this global resource -- and that, surely, 
is a <I>large</I> category -- should care, and care deeply.<P>

Two themes draw together many (but not all) of the White 
Paper's recommended changes..  First, although we all 
know that copyright deals with rights in intangible 
&quot;intellectual property,&quot; current law generally 
requires a &quot;material object&quot; before the law's 
protections apply.  For example, no work obtains any 
copyright protection at all unless it is &quot;fixed 
in a tangible medium of expression&quot;; that great 
poem you've been mulling over in your head does not 
become a copyrighted work unless and until &quot;its 
embodiment . . . is sufficiently permanent or stable 
to permit it to be perceived, reproduced, or otherwise 
communicated for a period of more than transitory duration.&quot; 
 Similarly, the copyright holder's fundamental rights 
to control copying and distribution of her work extend 
only to control over the production and distribution 
of &quot;copies,&quot; defined as &quot;<I>material objects 
. . in </I>which a work <I>is fixed </I>by any method now known 
or later developed, and from which the work can be 
perceived, reproduced, or otherwise communicated, either directly or with the 
aid of a machine or device.&quot;  Any other form of 
reproduction or distribution is not covered by the 
Act (and is, therefore, outside the control of the 
copyright holder -- &quot;user rights,&quot; if you 
will).<P>

In summary, copyright law is, generally speaking, looking 
for something in material form to wrap its hands around 
before its protections for authors kick in.  But in 
cyberspace, where information consists of little more 
than electrons whizzing from one machine to the next, 
&quot;material objects&quot; are conspicuously absent. 
 This is, to put it mildly, a hard problem -- indeed, 
it may be <I>the</I> hard problem regarding development of 
law in cyberspace.  If we deem the transmission of 
electronic information from one computer to another 
sufficient to constitute the &quot;fixation&quot; of 
a &quot;copy,&quot; then there is virtually no action 
one can take online -- from reading your email to posting 
a comment on a discussion group to browsing on the 
World Wide Web -- that will not constitute a prima 
facie case of copyright infringement, subject to the 
control of the copyright holder.  Will subjecting every 
single transaction in cyberspace to the claim of some 
copyright holder really &quot;promote the progress 
of science and the useful Arts&quot;?  It looks more 
like promotion of the economic interests of copyright 
holders (and their lawyers) to me, with users, thinking 
that they are participating in ordinary &quot;conversations&quot;online, 
suddenly awash in copyright claims.  But on the other 
hand, if we declare that those whizzing electrons are 
<I>not</I> sufficiently fixed to constitute the subject matter 
of copyright, then virtually <I>nothing</I> that takes place 
in cyberspace falls within the copyright holder's control, 
and we have, in effect, a copyright-free zone, where 
the legitimate expectations of copyright holders can 
be destroyed with impunity at the click of a mouse. 
<P>

A more nuanced approach to these questions is clearly 
called for, a re-thinking of what kinds of protections 
best promote those legitimate expectations while insuring 
that users' freedom to utilize this medium for communication 
is not choked off.  No single rule is likely to deal 
adequately with all possible forms of &quot;copying&quot; 
in cyberspace, e.g., copying of files into Random Access 
Memory to allow display of a file on a computer screen, 
copying of files into a storage &quot;cache&quot; as 
a way to speed up access to documents on the World 
Wide Web, copying of files to permit indexing of World 
Wide documents.  Perhaps we need to distinguish these 
forms of copying from other kinds of copying that more 
obviously and dramatically implicate the author's interests 
(e.g., ordinary &quot;piracy&quot; -- the copying and 
distribution of reproductions of information in competition 
with the author and in derogation of her reasonable 
expectations of receiving compensation for that information). 
 Perhaps copyright law should treat material that originates 
in cyberspace -- that the author has voluntarily placed 
into this new domain -- differently than material &quot;smuggled 
over the border&quot; from the real world (in which 
the author ha not indicated any consent to operate 
under the kinds of copying so easy to achieve in cyberspace)? 
<P>

But nuance is not the White Paper's strong suit; its 
&quot;limited amendment&quot; of copyright law will 
settle this problem once and for all, by &quot;clarifying&quot; 
that, indeed, every transaction in cyberspace <I>does 
</I>implicate the Copyright Act.  Shouldn't we think twice 
before incorporating this notion into our fundamental 
copyright law?  That is, of course, what our common 
law decision-making system is designed to do -- to 
think twice (and more than twice if necessary) about 
difficult questions, to look at the various factual 
contexts in which those questions arise and seek some 
understanding, in an incremental fashion, of new phenomena. 
 These questions have begun to percolate through the 
courts, and are slowly coming into better focus.  Are 
we really ready, as the White Paper appears to be, 
to give a final, definitive answer to this question? 
 Or should we, perhaps, wait a bit while that decentralized 
common-law process has a chance to chew this question 
over a bit more?  <P>

A second theme that sounds loudly in the White Paper 
recommendations is that of giving copyright holders 
the power to preserve their (greatly expanded) &quot;rights&quot; 
through technological means.  The White Paper -- correctly, 
in my view -- recognizes that in the emerging age of 
digital information, &quot;copyright owners [will] 
look to technology, as well as the law, for protection 
of their works,&quot; that &quot;[c]ontent providers 
will rely on a variety of  technologies [such as encryption 
and automatic licensing scheme], based in software 
 and hardware, to protect them against unauthorized 
uses of their information products and services. . 
. .&quot; <P>

The White Paper recommends adoption of several provisions 
designed to strengthen these developing technological 
protections for copyright holders.  It provides that 
it will henceforth be a civil (and in some circumstances 
a criminal) violation to &quot;knowingly provide false 
&euml;copyright management information'&quot; -- which 
includes &quot;the name and other identifying information 
of the author of a work, the name and other identifying 
information of the copyright owner, [and] terms and 
conditions for uses of the work . . .&quot; --  or 
to &quot;knowingly remove or alter any copyright management 
information.&quot;  These provisions are <I>not</I> restricted 
to copyrighted works in cyberspace or in digital form, 
but will apply across-the-board.  Are pseudonymous 
works -- which would appear to contain &quot;false 
copyright management&quot; -- henceforth prohibited? 
 Perhaps that is too far-fetched an interpretation. 
 But the prohibition against removing or altering copyright 
management information would appear to give authors 
an enforceable &quot;right of attribution&quot; to 
their works.   An attribution right is a staple of 
continental &quot;moral rights&quot; copyright schemes, 
and it may be a grand idea to import this idea into 
US copyright law.  But the question of whether, and 
to what extent, to recognize this and other moral rights 
is one of the most contentious in all of copyright 
law; the history of our entanglement with notions of 
moral rights goes back over 100 years, and was at the 
heart of the debate over US adherence to the Berne 
Convention on Literary Property.  Is it a &quot;minor 
clarification&quot; to resolve <I>that </I>debate once and 
for all? <p>

Finally, the proposed amendments include a prohibition 
on the manufacture of any device whose &quot;primary 
purpose or effect&quot; is to &quot;bypass, deactivate, 
or otherwise circumvent&quot; any copy-protection system 
-- that is, any &quot;system which . . . inhibits the 
violation&quot; of the copyright holder's reproduction 
or distribution rights.  We can agree with the White 
Paper that in the (near) future, copyright holders 
will begin using document management schemes that are 
sufficiently sophisticated and efficient that they 
will be able to track all distribution and usage of 
their digitized works on the global network, and under 
which user access to those works may be conditioned 
upon payment of a licensing fee.  And true, as the 
White Paper again notes, what the technology giveth 
the technology can taketh away; there is likely to 
be a thriving market in schemes to defeat these kinds 
of tracking, monitoring, and copy protection schemes. 
 <I>Current law strikes a careful and delicate balance 
between these opposing technological forces, a balance 
the White Paper will undo</I>.  By prohibiting the manufacture 
of any device whose &quot;primary purpose or effect&quot; 
is to &quot;circumvent&quot; any copy-protection system, 
the proposal stands upside down the principle laid 
down by the Supreme Court in <I>Sony Corp. v. Universal 
City Studios, Inc., </I>464 US 417 (1984), the &quot;home 
taping case.&quot;  In that case the Court held that 
even if copying devices (like VCRs) can be used for 
infringing purposes, the manufacturer of such equipment 
cannot be liable for those infringements so long as 
the equipment &quot;merely . . . capable of substantial 
noninfringing uses.&quot; But under the new proposals, 
even if such a device is capable of substantial noninfringing 
uses -- even if, in other words, it can pass the <I>Sony</I> 
test -- the manufacturer must show that these legitimate 
uses constitute its &quot;<I>primary</I> purpose or effect&quot; 
or face liability. There are, of course, valid and 
legitimate reasons why one might want to disable protection 
schemes of this kind -- to gain access, via some form 
of &quot;reverse engineering&quot;, for example, to 
<I>unprotected</I> information contained in the document (e.g., 
facts, public domain information, or ideas), or to 
engage in various forms of &quot;fair use&quot; (such 
as the home taping at issue in <I>Sony)</I>.  But who will 
dare give users the tools to do that, knowing they 
face civil and criminal liability for having done so? 
 When copyright holders utilize powerful technological 
means to control access to their works, having the 
theoretical legal right to make fair use of that material 
will mean little if this legislation deprives you of 
the technological means for doing so.<P>

These recommendations may, or may not, be wise policy; 
these are hard questions on which reasonable people 
may disagree.  &quot;Minor clarification and limited 
amendment&quot; of the Copyright Act, however, this 
is not.  The White Paper's characterization of these 
as a kind of &quot;tinkering around the edges&quot; 
 has shielded these proposals from the kind of public 
scrutiny that might have greeted, say, an announcement 
that &quot;Copyright law is being fundamentally reshaped 
for the next century.&quot; What the White Paper says 
is correct; in this new and exciting, though uncertain, 
context, we should leave copyright law alone for a 
while.  What the White Paper does, however, belies 
this principle.  With so many difficult new questions 
cropping up each day, and with the technology and the 
market changing so rapidly, we are unlikely to yet 
have all of the answers and to be ready to codify those 
answers in our statute books.  Decentralized, case-by-case 
consideration of the applicable principles, utilizing 
ordinary common law adjudicative procedures, may be 
far better suited to this task than one-fell-swoop 
statutory revision. The public might want to pay a 
bit of attention lest this process be short-circuited.<P>

&quot;Legal Issues Surrounding the Digital Library&quot;
<br>
              December 4, 1995<P>

<HR ALIGN=CENTER WIDTH=30%>

     To express any thoughtful opinions on the topic 
of this panel -- 
&quot;freedom of expression in an electronic environment&quot; 
-- within the 
context of the general theme of this meeting -- &quot;how 
will first 
amendment rights and responsibilities be ensured in 
an era of digital 
libraries?&quot; -- in fifteen or twenty minutes is 
a daunting task.  I want to 
focus my contribution on two areas in which the values 
of free 
expression and copyright are colliding.
<P>
   The first issue concerns what might be called the 
&quot;death of fair 
use.&quot;  That is an exaggeration; fair use is not 
yet at the hospital door, 
but it might be feeling some dizziness, the prelude 
to a more extended 
stay in the E.R, and I think aggressive intervention 
may be required for 
it to survive.  
<P>
   The notion of &quot;digital libraries&quot; has 
a somewhat different 
meaning depending upon the speaker.  We already have, 
of course, a 
digital library developing under our noses -- the World 
Wide Web.  It 
is widely agreed, however, that the availability of 
large amounts of 
pre-existing (and presumptively copyrighted) information 
in digital 
form has been impeded by the unavailability of mechanisms 
to assure 
rightsholders that their exclusive reproduction rights 
will be 
enforceable.  
<P>
   Some form of &quot;rights management&quot; for 
copyright purposes, in 
other words, will be a precondition to full development 
of the potential 
of the digital library.  It is not difficult to imagine 
scenarios, using 
some combination of encryption, digital signature, and 
what the White 
Paper refers to as &quot;steganographic&quot; techniques, 
in which rights 
management schemes are sufficiently sophisticated, efficient, 
and 
transparent to the user, that all access to (and reproduction 
of) digital 
works becomes the subject of essentially costless individualized 
bargaining -- schemes, that is, under which some as 
yet-undeveloped 
or unperfected technology allows copyright holders to 
track all 
distribution and usage of their digitized works on the 
global network 
and under which user access to those works -- even access 
that might 
be considered &quot;fair use&quot; under current law 
-- may be conditioned upon 
e.g., payment of a transaction-specific fee (one that, 
to be sure, may be 
measured in tenths, or hundredths, of a penny).
<P>
   There are many attractive features in this scenario, 
particularly 
if you believe that individuals are generally better 
able to reach the 
right allocation of goods and services by contract than 
the state is by 
fiat.  But once tracking and payment mechanisms of this 
kind are in 
place, what happens to &quot;fair use&quot;?  Fair use 
has often been justified (or 
rationalized) on transaction cost grounds -- either 
as a default bargain, 
the transaction that the copyright owner and the user 
would have 
entered into had not transactions costs been so high 
as to make 
individualized bargaining impossible, or as those uses 
that users are 
permitted to engage in largely because they are too 
costly to police 
and enforce.  [Indeed, I think it fair to say that most 
fair use of 
copyrighted works occurs simply because copyright holders 
are 
unaware of those uses and/or because it is not economically 
viable to 
enforce their rights.]  
<P>
   But in a world without transaction costs, do we 
need the 
notion of fair use any more?  The Second Circuit has 
recently 
suggested that we may not; the court, in the case of 
Texaco v. 
American Geophysical Union (60 F.3d 913)), held that 
the copying of 
journal articles by Texaco researchers was not fair 
use, in part because 
there were convenient payment and licensing schemes 
in place that 
Texaco could have, but chose not to, use. What once 
might have been 
considered fair use (when transactions costs were prohibitively 
high) is 
no longer in that category (when those costs have declined 
significantly). 
<P>
   And the White Paper, indirectly, takes a similar 
position.  
Under the White Paper's legislative proposals, the Copyright 
Act 
would be amended to prohibit any person from (1) &quot;knowingly 
remov[ing] or alter[ing] any copyright management information&quot; 
<A HREF="#n1">[NOTE 1]</A> from any copyrighted work, and from (2) &quot;import[ing], 
manufactur[ing], or distribut[ing] any device, product, 
. . . or 
offer[ing] to perform any service, the primary purpose 
or effect of 
which is to avoid, bypass, remove, deactivate, or otherwise 
circumvent, . . . any process, treatment, mechanism 
or system which 
prevents or inhibits the violation of any of the exclusive 
rights of the 
copyright owner . . .&quot;  In other words, if rightsholders 
choose to utilize 
these technological means to control access to their 
works, it will be a 
federal crime to attempt to defeat those technologies 
-- even, one must 
assume, if that is the only way to make what might otherwise 
be 
considered &quot;fair use&quot; of that material.  
<P>
   I do not mean to suggest that there is a simple 
answer to this 
question.  I do think that it may be unwise for Congress 
to throw its 
weight behind any one position in this debate before 
these implications 
have been fully considered. 
<P>

            <P>
            The second issue 
concerns the infringement liability of 
intermedaries under some theory of contributory or vicarious 
liability -- a question that may seem unrelated to 
the first but which I would 
suggest is in fact closely connected, because here, 
too, the law seems 
to be moving in a direction inimical to free expression 
values.
<P>
   One could hardly ask for a better example of the 
potential 
conflict between seemingly narrow questions of copyright 
law and 
broader First Amendment questions than that provided 
by the 
numerous recent lawsuits filed by the Church of Scientology 
and its 
affiliated organizations against individuals who, it 
is alleged, have 
made available, over the Internet and on individual 
bulletin board 
systems, documents &quot;belonging to&quot; the Church 
(in the sense that they 
contain copyrighted and trade secret material).  To 
the Church, these 
are simple claims: certain individuals have taken advantage 
of the 
electronic network's extraordinary distribution capabilities 
to violate 
their exclusive rights to this material under US copyright 
and trade 
secret laws.  To those on the other side, the issue 
is a bit more 
complicated; the Scientologists, they claim, are using 
these laws as 
swords, not to protect whatever their legitimate interests 
may be, but 
to stifle vigorous (and oftentimes highly critical) 
public debate over 
their methods of operation.
<P>
   I want to mention one aspect of these disputes 
that is gaining 
prominence.  Whatever one may believe about the &quot;correct&quot; 
outcome 
of these cases -- indeed, whatever one thinks the &quot;correct&quot; 
rule 
regarding copyright protection or fair use might be 
in cyberspace, one 
necessarily confronts an enforcement issue: how will 
any rule be 
implemented and enforced against violators in a global 
environment 
where the location and the identity of &quot;wrongdoers&quot; 
is often 
impossible to determine?
<P>
   The &quot;litigation market&quot; is supplying 
us with one answer to this 
enforcement conundrum: parties believing themselves 
to be injured will 
look to the  intermediaries -- the individual system 
operators through 
whose facilities access to the Internet and other electronic 
communities is provided -- to make them whole, either 
because they 
have the deepest pockets, or because they are the only 
pockets in 
sight.  
<P>
   The Scientologists have indeed taken on the network 
service 
providers in their attempt to have this allegedly infringing 
material 
removed from the Net, and last week, in the case of 
Religious 
Technology v. Netcom, Judge Whyte of the Northern District 
of 
California refused to dismiss charges of contributory 
copyright 
infringement against Netcom, holding that the service 
provider may be 
liable if it &quot;knew or should have known&quot; about 
the infringements.  The 
Scientologists had, in fact, notified Netcom that, at 
least in their view, 
infringing material had been transmitted over Netcom's 
system; this, 
the judge held, creates a factual question 
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>
   &quot;as to whether Netcom knew or should have 
known that Erlich [the defendant who originated the postings]  had infringed plaintiffs' copyrights . . . .Because Netcom was arguably participating in Erlich's public  distribution of plaintiffs' works, there is a genuine 
issue  as to whether Netcom knew of any infringement by Erlich before it was too late to do anything about it.  If plaintiffs can prove the knowledge element, Netcom will be liable for contributory infringement since 
its failure to simply cancel Erlich's infringing message 
and thereby stop an infringing copy from being distributed  worldwide constitutes substantial participation in  Erlich's public distribution of the message.&quot;
<P></BLOCKQUOTE>
   System operators, I am told, routinely receive 
complaints of 
the kind that Netcom received in this case.  What is 
a reasonable 
system operator to do?  On the one hand, they face a 
risk of liability if 
they leave these postings online and the claim turns 
out to be a valid 
one.  On the other hand, if they remove the offending 
posting, they are 
probably immune from liability, because they [probably] 
have a 
contractual right to remove postings and because users 
have no 
enforceable first amendment rights against private entities 
like these.  
<P>
   Needless to say, faced with this risk calculus, 
the offending 
messages will be removed -- pending, perhaps, further 
investigation 
and litigation, but unavailable to the public in the 
interim.  This is the 
wrong result -- the law is biased in favor of copyright 
claimants 
(including those claimants whose claims may be spurious) 
and against 
those whose expression is curtailed by the sysop's actions. 

<P>
   We may wait for the law to respond -- either by 
rules that alter 
the sysop's liability, or by declaring these networks 
to be public fora in 
which the 1st Amendment does apply, or perhaps in other 
ways.  We 
have taken another tack, and are about to embark upon 
a pilot 
arbitration project for rapid, interim resolution of 
disputes involving 
claims of tortious conduct of this kind that are brought 
to the attention 
of sysops by users of on-line systems or by those who 
claim to be 
harmed by wrongful messages or postings.  a means to 
provide system 
operators with real-time guidance as to the validity 
of individual claims 
and as to the reasonableness of taking action (or, importantly, 
of not 
taking action) in the face of such claims.  This is 
no panacea, to be 
sure; but it is an attempt to develop a more balanced 
approach to these 
difficult issues.  I would be happy to talk more about 
this &quot;Virtual 
Magistrate&quot; program if anyone would like more information.<P>

Draft December 12, 1995<P>
Plugging In, January 1996</B><P>

In 1957, I was taken to see the Moiseyev Dance Company 
-- a Russian circus/folk dance troupe -- at Madison 
Square Garden in New York.  The only thing I recall 
about the performance (other than the picketing going 
on outside the hall, in protest of the-recent Soviet 
invasion of Hungary) was one act where two midgets, 
dressed in what we would now call body suits, were 
wrestling on stage, locked in a tight embrace and furiously 
tossing each other around (though, mysteriously, never 
losing their grip on one another).  This went on for 
several minutes until, finally, the body suits were 
removed -- only to reveal, to general astonishment, 
a single person underneath.<P>

To this day I have no comprehension of how this illusion 
was sustained, but it came to mind when I was recently 
asked to speak on the relationship between copyright 
law and the First Amendment in cyberspace.  Like the 
two wrestlers, copyright and free expression are starting 
to push each other around in cyberspace, each looking 
for a foothold to gain the advantage; and we are left 
to wonder whether there is, indeed, a single fundamental 
principle or value underlying the two combatants. <BR>
Consider, for example, the likely fate of &quot;fair 
use&quot; -- the principle, embodied in section 107 
of the Copyright Act, allowing individuals to make 
copies of copyrighted works &quot;for purposes such 
as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, . 
. . , scholarship, or research.&quot; 
<P>
 Fair use fosters 
public discussion and debate of the new ideas contained 
in copyrighted works (and, to an extent, allows copying 
of the expression contained in those works so as to 
permit that discussion to proceed); it thus functions 
as a kind of safety valve, resolving the inherent tension 
between the need simultaneously to protect copyrighted 
material and to allow others to build upon it, insuring 
that the property right granted to copyright holders 
is used to invigorate, rather than stifle, expressive 
activity.  In cyberspace, while fair use is not yet 
at the hospital door, it might be feeling some dizziness, 
the prelude to a more extended stay in the E.R; aggressive 
intervention may be required for it to survive.<P>

Most -- probably the vast majority -- of instances of 
fair use are justified (or rationalized) on the grounds 
that individualized bargaining between the user and 
the copyright holder is (virtually) impossible; the 
copy of the New Yorker cartoon that I put on my refrigerator, 
the copy of a magazine article that I send to a friend, 
the copy of a story from the New York Times that I 
hand out in class -- all may involve an infringement 
of the copyright holder's rights, but we tolerate these 
activities largely because it is absurd and impractical 
to obtain the copyright holder's permission, and because 
the harm to the copyright holder's interests is minuscule. 
 <P>
But in cyberspace, those &quot;transactions costs&quot; 
-- of negotiating a license fee for each use of a copyrighted 
work, however trivial and insignificant -- are rapidly 
disappearing.  Imagine a world in which documents distributed 
electronically are not only encrypted but contain small 
embedded programs that can generate a complete record 
of every time the document is used (i.e., called up 
onto the screen, printed out, etc.).  These so-called 
&quot;steganographic&quot; techniques are not yet fully 
developed (although the meeting I referred to in the 
first paragraph, at the Library of Congress, was called 
to discuss just such new technologies), but when they 
are widely available they will allow copyright holders 
to track all distribution and usage of their digitized 
works on the global network; user access to those works 
-- even access that might be considered &quot;fair 
use&quot; under current law -- may then be conditioned 
upon, payment of a transaction-specific fees (fees 
that, to be sure, may be measured in tenths, or hundredths, 
of a penny).<P>

And once tracking and payment mechanisms of this kind 
are in place, is there still a place for fair use? 
 The Second Circuit has recently suggested that there 
may not be.  In <I>Texaco v. American Geophysical Union</I> 
(60 F.3d 913)), the court held that Texaco researchers 
who routinely made copies of articles from scientific 
research journals were <I>not</I> making fair use of that 
material, basing its holding, in substantial part, 
on the recent introduction of convenient schemes (offered 
by the Copyright Clearance Center) under which Texaco 
could have obtained blanket copying rights upon payment 
of blanket licence fees. In short, uses that might 
once have been considered fair (when the transactions 
costs of bargaining were prohibitively high) are no 
longer in that category (when those costs have declined 
significantly). <p>

And the Administration's recently-issued White Paper 
on Intellectual Property and the National Information 
Infrastructure, indirectly, takes a position that may 
have equally dire consequences for our notions of fair 
use.  The White Paper recommends adding a provision 
to the Copyright Act to prohibit any person from &quot;import[ing], 
manufactur[ing], or distribut[ing] any device, product, 
. . . the primary purpose or effect of which is to 
. . . deactivate, or otherwise circumvent, . . . any 
process, treatment, mechanism or system which prevents 
or inhibits the violation of any of the exclusive rights 
of the copyright owner . . .&quot;  In other words, 
if rightsholders choose to utilize new technological 
means to control access to, and prevent unauthorized 
copying of, their works, it will be a federal crime 
to attempt to defeat those technologies -- even if 
that is the only way to make what might otherwise be 
considered &quot;fair use&quot; of that material.  
<p>
And the conflict between seemingly narrow questions 
of copyright law and broader First Amendment questions 
is also well illustrated by the legal campaign now 
being waged by the Church of Scientology.  One of the 
more active discussion groups on the &quot;Usenet&quot; 
-- a portion of the Internet containing thousands of 
discussion forums on everything from politics to cooking 
to rock climbing -- is the &quot;alt.religion.scientology&quot; 
group, devoted to a discussion of the training methods 
and teachings of the Church of Scientology.  A number 
of sensitive Church documents have been posted to this 
group, as well as to individually-operated bulletin 
board systems, documents that the Church has claimed 
contain copyrighted and trade secret material.  To 
the members of the Church, these are simple and straightforward 
transgressions: certain individuals have taken advantage 
of the electronic network's extraordinary distribution 
capabilities to violate their exclusive rights to this 
material under US copyright and trade secret laws. 
<P>
 To those on the other side, the issue is a bit more 
complicated; the Scientologists, they claim, are using 
intellectual property law as a sword, not to protect 
whatever their legitimate interests may be but to stifle 
vigorous (and oftentimes highly critical) public debate 
over their methods of operation.<p>

Whatever may be the &quot;correct&quot; outcome in these 
cases -- indeed, whatever one thinks the &quot;correct&quot; 
rule regarding copyright protection or fair use might 
be in cyberspace, one necessarily confronts a difficult 
enforcement issue: how will <I>any </I>rule be implemented 
and enforced against violators in a global environment 
where the location and the identity of &quot;wrongdoers&quot; 
is often impossible to determine?  The &quot;litigation 
market&quot; is already supplying us with one answer 
to this enforcement conundrum: parties believing themselves 
to be injured will look to the intermediaries -- the 
individual system operators through whose facilities 
access to the Internet and other electronic communities 
is provided -- to make them whole, either because they 
have the deepest pockets, or because they are the <I>only 
</I>pockets in sight.<p>

The Scientologists have indeed taken on the network 
service providers in their attempt to have this allegedly 
infringing material removed from the Net, and several 
weeks ago, in the case of <I>Religious Technology v. Netcom</I> 
(N.D. Cal., Nov. 21, 1995), Judge Whyte refused to 
dismiss charges of contributory copyright infringement 
against one such service provider, Netcom, holding 
that Netcom may be liable for contributory infringement 
if it &quot;knew or should have known&quot; about the 
infringing postings.  The Scientologists had, in fact, 
notified Netcom by letter that, at least in their view, 
infringing material had been transmitted over Netcom's 
system; this, the judge held, creates a factual question
<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>&quot;as to whether Netcom knew or should have known 
that Erlich [the defendant who originated the postings] 
had infringed plaintiffs' copyrights . . . .Because 
Netcom was arguably participating in Erlich's public

distributed worldwide constitutes substantial participation 
in Erlich's public distribution of the message.&quot;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BR>
Service providers and system operators (&quot;sysops&quot;) 
like Netcom, I am told, routinely receive complaints 
of the kind that Netcom received in this case.  What 
is a reasonable sysop to do?  On the one hand, it faces 
a risk of liability if they leave these postings online 
and the claim turns out to be a valid one.  On the 
other hand, if it removes the offending posting, it 
is probably immune from liability, because it [probably] 
has a contractual right to remove postings and because 
users have no enforceable rights under the First Amendment 
against private entities like these.  <p>

that alter the scope of the sysop's liability, or by 
a declaration that these networks are public fora to 
which the First Amendment rules do apply, or perhaps 
in other ways.  In my next column I will describe a 
different approach that we have begun to implement, 
a pilot online arbitration project for rapid, <I>interim</I> 
resolution of claims of this kind that are brought 
to the attention of sysops, which may provide sysops 
with real-time guidance as to the validity of individual 
claims and as to the reasonableness of taking action

<P>



	You have probably heard your fill of grandiose predictions about the Coming

of the Internet ("the

'Net" to aficionados, the "National Information Infrastructure" to the

bureaucrats):  absolutely nothing

-- not the way you work, the way you play, the way you educate your children,

the way you interact

with your friends, the very Meaning of Life -- will ever be the same now that

it has arrived in full

glory.  Well, whatever may be the consequences for the Meaning of Life, it is

difficult to believe that

emergence of the Internet is <u>not</u> going to have a real, and possibly even

a profound, effect on the

work that we lawyers do and the context in which we do it is -- on the practice

of law, the business

of law, and perhaps even the nature of Law. <p>



	What is the Internet?  First and foremost, it is nothing more than a

computer network, conceptually

similar to the Local Area Network (LAN) that you may have at your office.  Like

any network, it is

simply a system linking individual free-standing computers by means of (a)

physical connections (in

the case of your LAN, cables running inside your office walls) and (b) a

language that each of the

computers is programmed to understand, the electronic "rules of the road" that

allow each computer

on the network to transmit information to any other computer and to act on the

messages it receives

-- to forward some messages to a third machine, to transfer a particular file

to the computer from

which the message originated, etc. -- in the manner specified.<p>



	The Internet differs from your LAN, however, in three important ways. 

First, no special cables are

required; ordinary telephone lines can be used for the physical links among

Internet computers. 

Second, the Internet's common language -- the "Internet Protocol" -- is

non-proprietary and publicly

available (unlike the proprietary software that controls operations on your

LAN).  And third, the

Internet language is built upon the principle of decentralization; unlike your

LAN, where a central

computer -- the network "server" -- stores all of the files and routes all

electronic mail messages, files

can be stored anywhere on the Internet and messages can travel from machine to

machine without

ever passing through a central point.<p>



	Because ordinary telephone lines can be used for the physical links among

Internet computers (see

Box), any computer with access to a dedicated telephone line can join the

Internet -- and at latest

count, 3.2 <u>million</u> computers have done so (1 million in the last 6

months).  Immense as this is, it

vastly understates the Internet's reach; because telephone lines are the medium

of Internet

communication, anyone with a computer and a modem can dial in to one of these

"backbone"

computers, and, while the telephone connection is active, be "on" the Internet. 

Estimates of the

number of dial-in Internet participants runs as high as 20 million (with 20%

<u>monthly</u> growth).<p>



<center>* * * * * * * * * * * <p>



BOX:  THE INTERNET'S CENTRAL FEATURES<p>



</center>

	The Internet's phenomenal growth may be due in large measure to certain of

its rather unusual

features.  First, unlike your office network (which requires the installation

of special cables), ordinary

telephone lines can be used for the links among Internet computers.  Second,

the Internet's common

language -- the "Internet Protocol" that allows each computer on the network to

transmit information

to any other computer and to act on the messages it receives -- is

non-proprietary and publicly

available (again, in contrast to the proprietary software that controls

operations on your LAN).<p>

	That is, basically, what it is.  As Gertrude Stein said of Oakland, there

is no "there" there; no one

owns the Internet, no one operates it, no one can point to it or say exactly

where it is, how big it is,

or how much traffic it bears.  It is less illuminating to think of it as a

tangible "thing" than as a system

connecting previously free-standing "things," transforming, if you will,

millions of small digital ponds

into a single digital ocean.  With the Internet in place, virtually any

information stored in digital form

-- and think, just for starters, of every musical composition now recorded on

CD, virtually every

opinion ever issued by virtually any court in this country, the output of

virtually every newspaper and

magazine in the developed world, and indeed most of what each of the readers of

this magazine put

down in writing each day -- can be transferred, almost instantaneously and for

little more than the

price of a local phone call, to any, or all, of those 20 million or so

computers now connected to the

global network.<p>



	What difference will all this make to the practice of law?  Predicting the

impact of new technologies

is a tricky business -- many people were convinced that the telephone would be

used for listening to

opera, after all.  I will not try to persuade you here that this is the most

fundamental transformation

in the way that information is organized and communicated since Gutenberg

invented the printing

press, and that no one in the business of organizing and communicating

information will remain

untouched by its emergence (though I believe both statements to be true).  I

will instead look at just

one small corner of this vast canvas, and suggest that the Internet, by giving

your clients new

capabilities to search for information, will transform lawyers' (and law

firms') relationship to their own

work product.  Let's see why this might be so.<p>



	To begin with, consider that even with the rather primitive search tools

now available over the

Internet, you can perform a kind of search that was not possible a few years

ago (and that was

virtually unimaginable a few decades ago):  you can now find information --

texts, documents,

memoranda, papers, etc. -- pertinent to a particular question <u>without

knowing beforehand where to

look, since your search can be performed everywhere on the network at once.</u> 

That is, you can post

a query on the Internet -- looking, say, for documents explaining the elements

of copyright

infringement -- and the search will comb through databases and other

collections of whose

whereabouts, and very existence, you are completely unaware -- statutory

summaries and annotations

compiled by the Copyright Office of the Library of Congress, the speeches of

Learned Hand posted

on the Net by some enterprising law student, the legal memoranda, perhaps,

prepared by the law firm

right down the street from you.  In a real sense, information, once placed on

the Internet, can find the

question(s) to which it is relevant, rather than the questioner having to find

the relevant information.<p>



	These searches are, to be sure, cumbersome and unreliable; searching the

Internet feels, in fact, more

like using a 10-year old version of Lexis or Westlaw on a computer whose

battery keeps running low

than your ticket to the 21st century.  But because the Internet has only

recently emerged as a mass-market phenomenon, comparatively few resources have

yet been devoted to making it easily usable

by ordinary mortals; the race to make more sophisticated search tools available

is now under a full

head of steam, for whomever finds the way -- or just any way -- to make these

searches easier is

going to make a great deal of money.  The same "natural language" search

capabilities that have now

made their way onto Lexis and Westlaw will, for example, surely soon be

available for Internet-wide

searches, allowing anyone to point a question in English towards the digital

ocean -- "I own a

bookstore; what should I do if I am informed by a publisher's representative

that the author of a book

published by a competitor contains material that constitutes copyright

infringement?" -- from which

it will return, like an obedient terrier, relevant documents dangling from its

mouth.<p>



	Those of you still using the West bound digests for your primary legal

research may doubt that people

will actually find useful information this way.  The rest of you are presumably

less reluctant to

embrace the notion that online searching can become more efficient than

alternative means, having

watched this happen close to home over the past several years.  <p>



	What will people be looking for, and what kinds of information will be made

available, on the

Internet?  <u>First as a trickle, then in a torrent, lawyers' work product will

inevitably be recycled onto

the Internet</u> -- some of it perhaps for sale, some of it for free, but it

will be there.  There is, after all,

substantial demand for this information on the part of clients and potential

clients (which covers just

about everybody).  Because legal problems, while enormously diverse, do tend to

recur with some

frequency, lawyers are not infrequently in the position of "reinventing the

wheel" -- charging clients

for the research and other information-processing activities that others have

previously engaged in. 

Consumers of legal services are understandably unhappy with this state of

affairs, but the market

currently provides them with few options; it is costly, and at times

impossible, to obtain information

about lawyers (other than those with whom they ordinarily deal) who may have

faced and already

solved problems similar to those now being addressed, and thus it is usually

less expensive to re-invent the wheel than to determine whether there are

alternative (and less expensive) sources of

supply for the advice or other services they seek.<p>



	Courtesy of the Internet, the cost of obtaining that information is in free

fall.  But lawyers will not

make that information available, you say?  Lawyers will not take a product for

which there is

substantial market demand, a product that costs virtually nothing to produce --

memos and briefs that

are already written -- and place it where it can actually be found by the very

people who indicate that

they need it?  Perhaps not.  But while you're summarizing your recent work in

trademark infringement

litigation and recycling it into an "all client memo" -- most copies of which,

being irrelevant to any

<u>immediate</u> problem facing any of your current clients, end up in the

trash -- your not-so-friendly

competition is going to put its memo where somebody who actually needs help

with a trademark

infringement matter can find it.  And don't say I didn't warn you when a

long-standing client of yours

comes in to ask you to handle defense of her trademark infringement action --

and tells you to use

the brief written by one of your competitors, which she plucked off the Net and

now plunks down

on your desk, as the starting point for your own work. <p>



	Predictions, as I said, are tricky, and I am sure that many of you think

there is much more, or much

less, going on here than I have suggested.  In the spirit of the new

technological age, I welcome your

comments or thoughts on the above, or on any of the topics I treat in future

columns (or those I

should be paying more attention to), which can be sent to me by email at Lexis

<H3>American Lawyer, February 1995<BR>
David G. Post</H3><P>

With some twenty or thirty million individual users, 
and twenty thousand businesses, already linked electronically 
to one another, and thousands more arriving on the 
scene each day, the Internet's potential as a marketplace--a 
place where buyers and sellers can come together to 
exchange goods or services for value--is vast. It is 
thus no surprise that businesses are rushing headlong 
onto the Internet (even if most of them have not quite 
figured out what they will do when they are there).<P>

But the thousands of willing sellers (of everything 
from books, magazines, computer programs, and other 
information-based products to more tangible items) 
hawking their wares online face a problem:  how will 
buyers pay for these goods and services?  What is the 
currency that will serve as the medium of exchange 
in this new marketplace?  At present, there is no secure 
way to effect payment of the public Internet, and so 
users are forced to go off the 'Net to make the purchase--mailing 
the seller a check or phoning in a credit card number.<P>

Eight hundred years ago, give or take a few, the merchants 
of medieval Europe faced a similar problem when trying 
to unlock the commercial potential of the continent-wide 
marketplace. After the fall of Rome, with Europe divided 
up into dozens of competing sovereignties, long-distance 
commerce came to a virtual standstill for hundreds 
of years. Merchants and traders seeking to exploit 
this new territory faced any number of seemingly insurmountable 
obstacles--e.g., the difficulty of obtaining protection 
against armed and organized marauders, conflicting 
local laws and customs regarding commercial practices, 
and incompatible and inconvertible currencies.<P>

To circumvent some of these problems, these medieval 
merchants invented, in effect, a form of private money: 
 negotiable instruments (promissory notes, bills of 
exchange, and the like). The merchant-developed commercial 
law surrounding use of these instruments, incorporated 
into the <I>lex mercatoria in</I> the early middle ages, stands 
as one of the truly remarkable achievements of the 
western legal tradition and one of the critical turning-points 
in the history of the expansion of trade and commerce. 
<P>

We may be on the verge of a similar sort of development 
today, but one that, in keeping with the general acceleration 
of all things technological, is likely to take far 
less time to conclude than the centuries it took for 
the commercial payment system to evolve. Although I 
am generally loathe to make predictions about future 
developments on the Internet (other than a forecast 
of continued rapid growth and activity), one prediction 
may stand as an exception to this general rule:  I 
am virtually certain that we will soon find true electronic 
cash (&quot;e-cash&quot;) -- digital tokens accepted 
as the equivalent of legal tender (see sidebar) -- 
circulating over the Internet's wires.<P>

******************************<BR>
<H3>SIDEBAR:  WHAT IS E-CASH?</H3>
Although there are any number of <br>
schemes currently under development, <BR>
the basic e-cash system is likely to <BR>
work roughly as follows:
<P>
 Alice establishes an account at her <BR>
 bank, First Digital, in the ordinary <BR>
 manner.
<P>
 When she wants cash, she sends an <BR>
 electronic mail message to First <BR>
 Digital requesting, say, $100. <BR>
 Using one of the available <BR>
 &quot;public key encryption&quot; <BR>
 programs I described in last <BR>
 month's column, she encrypts her <BR>
 message -- scrambles it using First <BR>
 Digital's public encryption code, <BR>
 which means that only First Digital <BR>
 can make any sense of it whatever. <BR>
 She also electronically &quot;signs&quot; <BR>
 the message -- encrypts it again, <BR>
 but this time using her own private <BR>
 encryption code -- which allows <BR>
 First Digital to verify that the <BR>
 message indeed came from Alice.
<P>
 First Digital debits her account <BR>
 by $100 and sends off her cyber-<BR>
 currency, which consists simply <BR>
 of a digital file, a string of 1s <BR>
 and 0s, that the bank's computers <BR>
 will recognize as the equivalent of <BR>
 a $100 bill. This file, too, is <BR>
 encrypted by First Digital (so that <BR>
only Alice can make use of it) and <BR>
signed by First Digital (uniquely <BR>
identifying First Digital as the <BR>
issuer).
<P>
 When Alice finds Bob offering <BR>
 something on the Internet that <BR>
 she wants to buy, she transfers this <BR>
file to him -- encrypting it again <BR>
(for Bob's eyes only) and signing <BR>
it. Bob decrypts the file and, <BR>
verifying that First Digital is <BR>
the issuer, transmits it back to <BR>
First Digital, which confirms that <BR>
it issued the file and credits <BR>
Bob's account accordingly.
<p>
All of these manipulations, needless <BR>
to say, are handled automatically <BR>
in the parties' computers. What Alice <BR>
really does, sitting at her PC, is <BR>
choose &quot;get $100&quot; and <BR>
&quot;send $100&quot; from the menu <BR>
of her Internet navigation program.<BR>

</TD></TR></TABLE>

Don't take my word for it. Microsoft's Bill Gates, a 
man with a fairly good track record at predicting future 
technological developments (if only, perhaps, because 
he has the resources to will them into existence) calls 
the &quot;electronic wallet&quot; -- a microchip storing 
e-cash, credit card information, and various other 
tidbits of information one might like to carry around 
in one's pocket -- his &quot;favorite idea,&quot; and 
everyone from Microsoft to financial services giants 
such as Citibank and Visa International -- and dozens 
of smaller and (currently) less well-known operations 
-- is hard at work developing its version of the currency 
of the future.<P>

It is not hard to see why. Existing paper money, to 
be sure, is inconvenient (physically cumbersome, difficult 
to transport and process, easy to steal) and it has 
been steadily losing &quot;market share&quot; to other 
payment systems (checks, credit cards, electronic funds 
transfer) that seem better suited to the needs of the 
modern world of electronic commerce. <P>

But shorn of these disadvantages, cash is pretty wonderful 
stuff: portable, instantly recognizable, instantly 
accepted by everyone without any of the overhead associated 
with the other payment systems, and entirely anonymous. 
And any form of cash that can retain these features 
and be utilized in the world of electronic commerce 
is going to prove extremely attractive.  It also will 
likely earn its developers significant amounts of money, 
digital or otherwise.<P>

So what, you ask?  So Microsoft (or others) finds some 
way to issue e-bills, earns billions of dollars in 
transactions fees, and helps transform the Internet 
into a kind of Home Shopping Network in overdrive -- 
why should the law or lawyers pay this any mind?  <P>

Because e-cash poses, appropriately enough, a binary 
choice for regulators and other law-enforcement types 
that will do much to determine the ultimate fate of 
lawful activity on the global network. <P>

As a result of the very features that make it so attractive, 
cash has always occupied a somewhat unstable and uncomfortable 
place within the existing legal regime. Anonymous and 
virtually untraceable, cash transactions today occupy 
a place in a kind of legal netherworld, an underground 
domain where the law is an uncertain presence. <P>

Because paper money in large quantities is indeed so 
cumbersome to use and manipulate, this underground 
economy is generally confined to relatively small-scale 
transactions.  (Some large-scale drug operations and 
other organized crime are the obvious exceptions). 
 So long as the transactions are mostly small, they 
can, perhaps, be tolerated by the state as an unfortunate, 
but largely insignificant, by-product of the modern 
commercial state. As transactions get larger, the state 
becomes more suspicious, and enlists the aid of the 
banks, through the currency reporting and anti-structuring 
laws, in reporting large disbursements of cash so that 
additional oversight can be ordered. <BR>
 <BR>
Anything that makes cash substantially easier to use 
in a substantially broader range of transactions holds 
the potential to expand this extra-legal netherworld 
to proportions posing ever more serious threats to 
the existing legal order.  Under the most ambitious 
visions of e-cash, we would see a new form of a currency--units 
of money in the form of digital files instead of engraved 
notes that could be freely passed off from one computer 
to another with no record, yet incapable of being forged. 
 A consumer could draw such e-cash electronically from 
his or her bank.  The bank would have a record of that 
transaction, just as a withdrawal or check is recorded 
now.  But after that, the encrypted e-cash file could 
be handed off without the knowledge of anyone but the 
parties to the transaction (see sidebar).<P>

Consider the impact of this on taxation. Transaction-based 
taxes (e.g., sales and use taxes) account for a significant 
fraction of state and local government revenue, and 
Congress itself is considering implementing a transaction-based 
national sales or valued added tax.  But if electronic 
money really is made to function like paper money does, 
payments we would never think of making in cash--to 
buy a new car, say, or the down payment on a house--could 
be made in this new form of currency because there 
would be no problem of bulk and no risk of robbery.<P>

From the government's standpoint, if much larger and 
more significant transactions could be effected safely 
and securely by an electronic means that leaves no 
more of a paper trail than cash does today, that could 
eliminate records of many taxable transactions.  The 
threat to the government's revenue flow should such 
schemes be implemented is a very real one (and officials 
at the US Treasury Department, at least, are starting 
to take cognizance of this development and to prepare 
their responses).<P>

Perhaps the banks and the public will never have enough 
confidence that the most powerful, untraceable, forms 
of e-cash can be safe from forgery.  But e-cash's proponents 
think the technology will prove trustworthy.  If it 
does, the government may move to prevent any truly 
anonymous and untraceable e-cash system from developing. 
 But that raises its own problems because, as we escape 
the Scylla of the Underground Economy, the Charybdis 
of Big Brother rears its ugly head. Just as powerful 
encryption schemes permit the design of radically <I>un</I>traceable 
e-cash systems, so, too, do powerful electronic record-keeping 
tools permit the design of equally <I>traceable </I>systems 
-- systems where all of your financial transactions 
are duly recorded in the Great Database, allowing those 
with access to know more about you than anyone could 
know today.<P>

However the politics and business of e-cash play out, 
the technology is far enough along that the legal issues 
can't be avoided.  The question e-cash poses is not, 
&quot;Should the law take cognizance of this development?&quot; 
but rather, &quot;How can it not?&quot;  By pointing 
an arrow at the heart of the state's revenue-raising 
capabilities, e-cash cannot escape scrutiny and regulation; 
but it is going to take some serious thinking to design 
a regulatory scheme that does not fulfill our worst 
fears about the personal privacy implications of the 
new digital world.<P>

     Computer programmer Phil Zimmerman has probably 
done more to
open up the Internet than all of Al Gore's minions combined 
-- and
the government has rewarded him by initiating a criminal
investigation.<P>

     Zimmerman is the developer of a computer program 
known as PGP
-- for &quot;Pretty Good Privacy.&quot;  PGP is an encryption 
program --
software that lets you scramble any digital file (that 
these days
can be a legal memorandum, a computer program, the Jurassic 
Park
video, or Dylan's latest CD) in such a way that it can 
be
reconstituted only by those possessing the digital equivalent 
of
the decoder ring [see <A HREF="#side">sidebar</A>].<P>

<H3>SIDEBAR:  <BR>
HOW ENCRYPTION SYSTEMS WORK</H3><BR>
The code you may have used to <BR>
encode messages to your friends<BR>
in elementary school -- A=1, B=2, <BR>
C=3, D=4, etc. -- is an example<BR>
of a single-key encryption system: <BR>
the same &quot;algorithm&quot; is used by<BR>
the sender to encrypt the message <BR>
and by the recipient to decrypt<BR>
it. Many of enormously powerful <BR>
encryption programs are single-key<BR>
systems (with far, far more <BR>
complicated coding algorithms, needless<BR>
to say).
<p>
     Single-key systems, however, <BR>
     have one large drawback: because<BR>
 the sender and the recipient have <BR>
 to first agree on what code they<BR>
are using -- i.e., they have to <BR>
have an uncoded conversation during<BR>
which the code is exchanged -- <BR>
the system is only as secure as the<BR>
medium in which that prior <BR>
communication takes place. That is, if<BR>
you and your friend want to <BR>
exchange coded notes in class, you'll<BR>
have to meet in a corner of the <BR>
playground to get the system<BR>
rolling. You certainly can't send <BR>
your friend a note in class<BR>
explaining the code you want to <BR>
use, because then all your<BR>
classmates will be able to <BR>
decrypt your messages; if that channel<BR>
of communication were secure enough <BR>
for you to use for transmitting<BR>
the code, why do you need a code <BR>
at all (other than to have a<BR>
little fun)?
<P>
     PGP, on the other hand, is a <BR>
     public key system. The program<BR>
generates two codes, code A and <BR>
code B, for each user. A file<BR>
encrypted in code A can only be <BR>
decrypted with code B (and vice<BR>
versa), and it is impossible to <BR>
derive code A from code B or vice<BR>
versa -- trust me on this (though <BR>
readers wanting more information<BR>
can send me an e-mail). Code B <BR>
becomes your public key; think of it<BR>
like your telephone number -- <BR>
you give it away, publicize it<BR>
widely, allow people to put it <BR>
in publicly-available directories,<BR>
etc. Then, if I want to send you a <BR>
file that only you can decrypt,<BR>
all I need do is look up your <BR>
telephone number (i.e., public key)<BR>
and use that to encrypt the file; <BR>
that file can then be de-crypted<BR>
only by the person possessing code <BR>
A (which you have kept secret<BR>
from the world and which I, <BR>
therefore, need not ever have seen).<BR>
Unlike single-key systems, you and <BR>
I need never have previously<BR>
communicated for the system <BR>
to provide complete security, and<BR>
therefore there is no need for any <BR>
secure channel over which codes<BR>
can be exchanged.<BR>

     You would be forgiven for thinking that encryption 
technology 
is of interest only to spies and counter-spies. Forgiven, 
but 
incorrect; in fact, encryption technology is about to 
make its way 
to your desktop.<P>

     The Internet has, as I noted in an earlier column, 
enormous 
potential as an electronic marketplace, a place where 
buyers and 
sellers of information in digital form can interact 
and consummate 
transactions. But that potential remains largely unrealized; 
the 
Internet has not yet become a major factor in the commercial 
world, 
a major venue for trade of any kind.<P>

     There are many reasons for that; transmission rates, 
for 
example, are still slow enough so that I can run down 
to my local 
video store to pick up Jurassic Park in less time than 
it would 
take to download it from the Net.<P>

     But even when the transmission rate problem is 
solved, 
commerce faces a perhaps more fundamental obstacle. 
The Internet 
today looks a lot like the Wild West:  dazzling, thrilling 
to ride 
through, unlimited in potential -- but fundamentally 
lawless, a 
small pocket of anarchy in an otherwise regimented world. 
For many 
people -- myself included -- that is one of the Internet's 
peculiar 
charms. But lawlessness does have its drawbacks. Travelers 
on the 
Internet are a bit like travelers on a stagecoach through 
the 
Dakota territory; their property may be subject to appropriation 
at 
any time without their consent.<P>

     The technology required to intercept anything transmitted 
over 
the Net, or to gain access to any file residing on any 
computer 
with a direct hook-up to the Internet, is widely available. 
And to 
make matters worse, while interception may in some circumstances 
be 
illegal -- subject, for example, to the Electronic Communication 
Protection Act's prohibition against opening electronic 
mail 
directed to others -- legal remedies against wrongdoers 
are 
uncertain at best. It can be prodigiously difficult 
to associate a 
stream of 1's and 0's -- and remember, the only thing 
actually 
travelling on the Internet is a stream of 1's and 0's 
-- with any 
particular individual. With impersonation and anonymity 
this easy 
to achieve, you may often be unable to determine who 
was 
responsible for any particular wrongful action or to 
bring any 
remedy to bear against them.<P>

     As a place to carry on commerce, this resembles 
a flea market 
in the early days of Dodge City:  there are few laws 
to appeal to 
if someone walks over and grabs something off your table, 
and even 
if there were, everybody here -- not just the bad guys 
-- wears a 
mask. If you want people to buy your products, this 
is hardly the 
environment you would choose to display your wares. 
If the Net is 
going to become a place where commerce can flourish 
-- where money 
and other (intellectual) property can actually change 
hands, where 
confidential information and documents can be exchanged 
-- users 
need to have more assurance that some degree of security 
for their 
property, and authentication of individual identity, 
has been 
achieved.<P>

     In previous epochs of human history, people looked 
to the law 
to solve this problem -- Wyatt Earp cleaning up Dodge 
City or, more 
generally, some institutional structure emerging to 
define and 
enforce property, contract, and personal rights in the 
new 
jurisdiction. But the Net may be a good deal harder 
for Marshal 
Earp to get control over than Dodge City was. Whose 
law, for 
example, is the Marshall going to apply when an unauthorized 
copy 
of a file stored on a computer in California is posted 
on a 
bulletin board in Finland, as a result of instructions 
received 
from a computer in Japan, from which the file is downloaded 
to a 
Brazilian computer for distribution by e-mail to a variety 
of Net 
addresses worldwide?  And, assuming that the Marshall 
is persuaded 
that this is indeed &quot;unlawful&quot; activity, how 
will the perpetrators 
be identified?  And even if this chain of events can 
be traced to 
individual machines -- a task that even unsophisticated 
&quot;hackers&quot; 
can make exceedingly difficult -- how will the Marshall 
identify 
the people standing behind those machines (let alone 
assert 
personal jurisdiction over them)?<P>

     Enter Phil Zimmerman and his Pretty Good Privacy. 
We, as 
lawyers, may at times forget that legal protection is 
not the only 
form of protection on which people can rely. Think of 
encryption as 
the ultimate form of self-help, a way both to keep your 
property 
secure and to verify the identity of the person at the 
other end of 
your transaction without the need for the intervention 
of the 
lawman.<P>

     Using a program like PGP, I can send you a file 
with complete 
security that you, and only you, will be able to make 
any use of it 
whatsoever; even if it is intercepted, it is of absolutely 
no value 
to the interceptor. Even better, I can simply make the 
file 
available somewhere on the Internet (for a price, if 
I choose) in 
encrypted form, secure in the knowledge that anyone 
who comes along 
and downloads it cannot use it without my authorization. 
And 
keeping in mind that these files can be video or audio 
performances, books, videogames -- anything that can 
exist in 
digital form and therefore can be transmitted over the 
Net -- the 
commercial significance of encryption -- perhaps even 
the 
commercial necessity of encryption -- starts to come 
into focus.<P>

     This security function might be enough to make 
encryption an 
important commercial force over the next few years. 
But there's 
more. Encryption also allows me to verify the identity 
of 
individuals with whom I am communicating over the Net.<P>

     How?  Here's the true beauty of public-key encryption 
systems 
(see <A href="#side">sidebar</A>): there is only one person who can encrypt 
a file that 
is decrypt-able with Al Gore's &quot;public key,&quot; 
and that is the 
possessor of Al Gore's private key. So, if I receive 
an encrypted 
email message that I can decrypt with Gore's public 
key, I can 
relatively safely presume that it came from Gore himself; 
because 
Gore need never reveal his private key to anyone at 
any time, the 
risk that someone has appropriated his private key is 
manageably 
small -- about the same risk I run if I were to hear 
the Vice 
President's voice over the telephone and presume that 
he is 
speaking of his own free will, notwithstanding the fact 
that 
someone may be holding a gun to his head to make him 
say the words 
that I'm hearing.<P>

     Taken together, these two features -- security 
and 
authentication -- may well make encryption technology 
a critical 
tool for commercial interactions over the Internet. 
All aspects of 
the interaction -- the confidential messages regarding 
negotiation 
positions, the relevant purchase and sale documents, 
and the goods 
themselves -- can avail themselves of this new medium 
without 
compromising basic security.<P>

     So if encryption is this wonderful, why is the 
government, as 
I noted at the beginning of this column, investigating 
whether 
PGP's developer should be thrown in jail?  Could it 
be because the 
regulators cannot abide the idea that people can get 
along just 
fine without them?  Perhaps -- but to give this question 
its due 
will require a more careful look at the threat that 
encryption may 
pose for traditional government functions -- a topic 
I will address 
in <A HREF="./X0010_ENCRYPT2.html">next month's column</A>.<P>

<H3>American Lawyer, January 1995<BR>
David G. Post</H3><P>

Remember John Gotti? No longer merely a &quot;reputed&quot; 
mob kingpin, Gotti was sentenced to life imprisonment 
after his conviction on racketeering and murder charges. 
It may be too much to suggest that Gotti was brought 
down by an FBI alligator clip, but it is true that 
the case against Gotti was bolstered, perhaps decisively, 
by recordings of conversations between Gotti and his 
compatriots obtained by tapping the telephones at a 
downtown Manhattan social club.
<p>

Keep in your mind for the moment the image of John Gotti, 
plotting some evil deed with an FBI agent listening 
in and taking down every word. 
<p>

<A HREF="./X0009_ENCRYPT1.html">Last month</A> I noted that &quot;public key encryption&quot; 
programs&oacute;software that enables you to scramble 
a digital file so that the file cannot be read by anyone 
but the intended recipient, even if you and the recipient 
had not had any prior contact with one another&oacute;have 
recently become widely available. 
<p>

Because encryption may be the only way to provide true 
security for property (intellectual property, credit 
card numbers, or more sophisticated versions of &quot;electronic 
cash,&quot; and the like) placed in the stream of electronic 
commerce on the Internet, I suggested that encryption 
may turn out to be the philosopher's stone for the 
twenty-first century. I suggested that it may be the 
key to unlocking the Internet's vast commercial prospects, 
and that encryption technology may spread quickly beyond 
the banking sector, where it is already widely used, 
to help create a broader electronic marketplace for 
a wide variety of goods and services.
<p>

That is all good news. In addition, encryption has the 
power to keep Big Brother at bay; to allow political 
dissidents in, say, China, a new and more secure means 
to disseminate information freely to the outside world.
<p>

But there is bad news as well. Now that ordinary everyday 
communication can easily be placed in digital form 
(such as an electronic mail message or a conversation 
on a digital telephone) and then converted into an 
unreadable scrambled mess with a few clicks of the 
mouse on a home computer, what happens to the Alligator 
Clip that Felled John Gotti ? What is the point of 
tapping a wire when the information coming through 
the wire is irretrievably garbled?
<p>

The FBI and others have raised the specter of a world 
where not only political dissidents but terrorists, 
assassins, drug kingpins, and the like are all communicating 
freely over the Information Superhighway without fear 
of being overheard; a world where wiretapping is no 
longer a useful weapon in the law enforcement arsenal, 
and where crime suddenly becomes more difficult to 
uncover and punish. &quot;If you think crime is bad 
now,&quot; FBI Director Louis Freeh has warned, &quot;just 
wait and see what happens if the FBI one day soon is 
no longer able to conduct court-approved electronic 
surveillance.&quot;
<p>

The government does not take this threat to its law 
enforcement powers lightly, and has, not surprisingly, 
been trying to devise ways to restrain the use of encryption 
software. Indeed, encryption has been the focus of 
the government's first real efforts to exercise control 
over activities on the Internet, and represents the 
first battleground in what may become a fascinating, 
and possibly quite nasty, war to assert jurisdiction 
over this new territory.
<p>

First, the federal government classifies encryption 
software as a &quot;munition&quot; under the International 
Traffic in Arms Regulation Act (ITAR). Like an F-15 
attack plane, encryption software cannot be exported 
from the United States without a special state department 
license, which is next_to_impossible to obtain for 
the more powerful encryption systems.
<p>

Second, and more notoriously, the government is trying 
to promote adoption of an encryption system that, conveniently 
enough, has a &quot;back door&quot; through which the 
government can continue to monitor otherwise &quot;secure&quot; 
conversations. 
<p>

With its infamous &quot;Clipper Chip&quot; initiative, 
the Clinton administration licensed the manufacture 
of a special chip, incorporating the government's own 
(classified) encryption system, that could be placed 
into telephones, computers, and other communication 
devices. This system differs fundamentally from &quot;public 
key&quot; systems. It is an &quot;escrowed encryption 
system&quot; under which the government retains, in 
escrow, the &quot;keys&quot; that can unscramble encrypted 
files, keys that can to be released to law enforcement 
officials upon an appropriate showing of need.
<p>

Faced with a choice between an escrowed encryption system, 
with agencies of the United States government as key-holding 
escrow agents, and an equally powerful public key system 
that is secure from <I>all </I>eavesdroppers, most American 
consumers--let alone foreign consumers, or, for that 
matter, terrorists--would probably opt for the latter. 
Do we really expect, as Senator Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) 
has asked, to be able to &quot;sell our phones and 
computers abroad with a note saying, 'All encrypted 
communications sent on this equipment are guaranteed 
to be available to the U.S. government upon its secret 
request'&quot;? 
<p>

Skipjack/Clipper, in other words, would appear to be 
a nonstarter in a truly competitive encryption market. 
How, then, to foster widespread use of the Clipper 
chip (or other devices implementing an escrowed system)?
<p>

The government has not--yet--tried to mandate use of 
the Skipjack/Clipper system or outlaw use of competing 
encryption systems. Instead, the original Clipper proposal 
attempted to establish Clipper as a de facto standard 
in the marketplace, without, quite, going so far as 
to mandate its use, by providing that exporters of 
machines incorporating the Clipper Chip will receive 
automatic export authorization, and by requiring the 
government to buy only machines that use the chip.
<p>

In this battle over the future of encryption, however, 
the state is in retreat. Export control has perhaps 
slowed, but hardly stopped, the spread of public key 
encryption. Several months ago a copy of PGP, a powerful 
public key encryption program I discussed in last month's 
column, was placed on an Internet-accessible computer, 
from where it could be copied by anyone in the world 
with a modem and access to the global network. It is 
estimated--nobody knows for sure--that several hundred 
thousand copies are now in circulation around the world.
<p>

And Clipper, under relentless attack from an alliance 
of civil libertarians fearful of giving the government 
Orwellian eavesdropping powers and the software industry 
looking to exploit a multi-billion dollar market for 
encryption products, has hardly fared much better. 
The federal government has apparently abandoned the 
Clipper initiative, at least with respect to computer 
(though not voice) communications, and is &quot;re-evaluating&quot; 
the need for an encryption system requiring government 
escrow agents.
<p>

This all has the flavor of locking the barn door after 
the horses have left. Although the government initiated 
a criminal investigation of Phil Zimmerman, PGP's author, 
over his part in the illegal export of PGP, nothing 
the government can now do will put the genie back in 
the bottle. Not in a world where a single copy of a 
program can generate thousands, or hundreds of thousands, 
of additional copies in a matter of minutes. It is 
probably not even too much to suggest that the very 
notion of &quot;export control&quot; on the Internet, 
where geographical boundaries have absolutely no significance, 
and where one computer looks exactly like another regardless 
of geographical location, has a faintly ludicrous tinge 
to it.
<p>

This is not to say that the encryption battle is over. 
Far from it; the government has many, many other weapons 
in its arsenal. For example, talk of outlawing unescrowed 
encryption systems&oacute;a move that would raise rather 
profound constitutional and ethical questions&oacute;has 
been heard in the land. We shall see. It is on the 
one hand hard to see how anything short of that will 
give the government what it apparently seeks: assured 
access to all electronic communications. But it is 
just as hard to see how even that drastic step will 
provide such assurance, given the already widespread 
availability of unescrowed encryption programs. A difficult 
dilemma, to be sure, but one that perhaps raises the 
possibility that the government, whatever its wishes 
may be, may have to content itself with a less vigorous 
role in policing cyberspace.<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Hereby it is manifest, that during the time men live 
without a common Power to keep them all in awe, they 
are in that condition which is called Warre; and such 
a warre, as is of every man, against every man. . . 
. It may peradventure be thought there was never such 
a time nor condition of warre as this; and I believe 
it was never generally so, over all the world; but 
there are many places where they live so now.  For 
the savage people in many places of America . . . have 
no government at all, and live at this day in the brutish 
manner, as I said before.  Howsoever, it may be perceived 
what manner of life there would be, where there were 
no common Power to feare . . . .
</I><BR>
Hobbes, Leviathan, chap. 13 (1651)</BLOCKQUOTE><P>

It all sounds like the plot of a (mediocre) science 
fiction novel:  strange beings with names like the 
Cancelbunny, an144108, XS4ALL, and Scamizdat, fighting 
on a battleground with no fixed location anywhere on 
earth, using strings of binary digits as their weapons. 
 But science fiction it is not; it is the ongoing battle 
in cyberspace between the Church of Scientology (&quot;CoS&quot;) 
and its critics, the first War -- or Warre -- in the 
Age of the Internet.  If you want evidence that the 
Internet may indeed be a place like no other, please 
read on. And even if you have no interest in anything 
having to do with &quot;cyberspace,&quot; you might 
wish to hear more of these bizarre doings if you care 
about the way that politics and law shape (or fail 
to shape) the way we live.  For just as contact with 
radical new forms of civil society -- places with &quot;no 
government at all&quot; --  focused the minds of Hobbes 
and the other Enlightenment philosophers on the nature 
of government and political power, so too may contact 
with this curious new electronic world and its odd 
new rules of conduct lead us to think anew about what 
life &quot;without a common Power to keep us in awe&quot; 
might be like.<P>

Depending on whom you ask, Scientology is either a legitimate 
religion offering followers a route to spiritual enlightenment 
and salvation, or a fraudulent scam -- and, let me 
say at the outset, I have no opinion as to which characterization 
is the correct one.  What is clear, however, is that 
relations between adherents and critics have never 
been pleasant; passions run feverishly high on both 
sides, and the Scientologists have often been accused 
of dealing, shall we say, rather harshly with their 
critics. <P>

But at least until July 17, 1991, there was no truly 
organized opposition to the Scientologists's teachings 
and tactics, no true community of the disaffected. 
 How could there be?  Building an anti-church, after 
all, takes just about as much administrative and operational 
savvy, not to mention money, as does building a church. 
 But that feature of the landscape changed dramatically 
on the date mentioned, when a Scientology critic, Scott 
Goehring, formed a discussion group -- &quot;alt.religion.scientology&quot; 
-- on what is called the &quot;Usenet&quot; network 
portion of the Internet.(As a harbinger of complications 
to come, Goehring forged the return address of the 
message used to create alt.religion.scientology, using 
the address &quot;miscaviage@flag.sea.org&quot; in 
an apparent reference to Scientology head David Miscavige.)) 
 Suddenly, in the 30 seconds or so that it took Goehring 
to type out his request, and the $0.05 or so it cost 
him to transmit that message to the computers responsible 
for Usenet network configuration, there is a place 
where the disgruntled can meet to exchange ideas and 
information -- a new community, one of the literally 
hundreds of thousands of such communities that have 
sprung into being on the Internet over the past few 
years.<P>

<A HREF="news:Alt.religion.scientology">Alt.religion.scientology</A> indeed became a hotbed of critical 
commentary on Scientology's teachings and tactics (as 
well as one of the Internet's most actively utilized 
discussion forums, with over 2,700 postings per week). 
 But things began to get really interesting when some 
participants in the discussions began appending to 
their messages long excerpts -- and, on occasion, the 
full text -- of some of Scientology's secret scriptures, 
known as &quot;the Advanced Technology.&quot;  CoS 
followers hold fiercely to the notion that their revered, 
secret texts must never be disseminated except to the 
rigorously initiated -- that it is, in fact, dangerous 
to allow people who have not reached a certain stage 
in their training to view these materials.  CoS critics, 
on the other hand, claim that these documents are a 
critical part of the public debate about Scientology, 
and that exposing these documents to public view, with 
their seemingly bizarre descriptions of alien beings 
and pre-historic thermonuclear war, will help keep 
potential adherents out of the Scientologists' clutches.<P>

Upon discovery that the Advanced Technology was being 
freely disseminated across the globe, the CoS's legal 
staff sprang into action.  These texts, they asserted, 
contain copyrighted materials as well as &quot;trade 
secrets.&quot;  Distribution -- electronic or otherwise 
-- thus constitutes bald-faced copyright infringement 
and unlawful misappropriation of confidential information. 
 A number of lawsuits were filed -- in Denver, San 
Jose, Alexandria Virginia, and Amsterdam -- against 
the individuals allegedly responsible for these postings, 
against the entities that provide those individuals 
with connectivity to the Internet, and even, in one 
case, against a newspaper (the Washington Post) that 
published excerpts from one of the sacred texts in 
its story about the cases.<P>

These cases, to be sure, raise some difficult and important 
legal issues.  For example, trade secrets are generally 
defined under US law as any information that gives 
one a commercial advantage over competitors and as 
to which reasonable precautions against disclosure 
have been taken -- customer lists, industrial processes, 
and the like.  Can a church even hold trade secrets? 
 Are we prepared to recognize a religion market in 
which competitors are battling for commercial advantage? 
 <P>

Or, to take another example, assume that the CoS holds 
the copyright to these texts.  US copyright law allows 
the &quot;fair use&quot; of a copyrighted work, including 
copying and distribution &quot;for purposes such as 
criticism, comment, news reporting, [and] teaching.&quot; 
You may, for example, quote portions of a book in a 
review without fearing a copyright infringement lawsuit. 
 Can posting these texts to the Internet, in the context 
of an attempt to generate greater public discussion 
and awareness of the Scientologists' teachings, be 
excused on these grounds?  The fair use inquiry is 
a notoriously slippery one, decided by courts on the 
basis of an ad hoc balancing of various factors, including 
whether or not the work is being distributed for commercial 
gain (a factor favoring the Net distributors, who are 
making copies available at no charge) as well as &quot;the 
amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation 
to the copyrighted work as a whole&quot; (a factor 
strongly favoring the Scientologists).  <P>

And finally, should the Internet service providers, 
who function as the &quot;pipeline&quot; connecting 
the individual posters to the Internet, be liable for 
any harm caused by these distributions?  On the one 
hand, they can hardly be asked to monitor all of the 
thousands or hundreds of thousands of messages that 
flow through their systems each day to determine whether 
there is infringing material in any of them.  On the 
other hand, liability under US copyright law has in 
the past been broadly applied to intermediaries -- 
bookstores, for example, are liable for infringing 
material contained in the books they sell, nightclub 
owners for infringing performances by musicians they 
have hired, etc. -- on the ground that those who profit, 
however indirectly, from the infringing activities 
of others should be made to compensate the injured 
copyright holder; why should those well-established 
principles not be applied here? <P>

These are questions that courts are likely to be struggling 
with for some time.  The CoS has been largely successful 
in obtaining favorable preliminary rulings -- that 
the documents do contain trade secrets, that fair use 
does not permit their posting to the Net, and that 
the service providers may indeed be liable for these 
postings -- that strike many observers (including this 
one) as attempts to unthinkingly jam the square peg 
of existing law into the round hole of the Internet. 
But this entire episode has significance far beyond 
the boundaries of these important legal questions. 
 In many ways it is a primer on the way that disputes 
will be handled in a networked world, on the nature 
of the anarchy that, in the eyes of many, rules (and 
may continue to rule) on the Internet, and on just 
how difficult it will be to exercise any degree of 
control over this environment using traditional legal 
tools.  Whatever a &quot;law of the Internet&quot; 
ultimately looks like, it will somehow have to incorporate 
(at least) four principles that emerge from these battles:<P>

<H3>1.  There's no There There.</H3>
Assume that all of the 
Scientologists' claims are true, that these documents 
really are protected under copyright and trade secret 
law and have been unlawfully posted to alt.religion.scientology. 
 Assume further that some court, in this country or 
elsewhere, were persuaded that alt.religion.scientology 
is nothing more than a haven for unlawful activity 
and that it should be closed down.  What then?  Alt.religion.scientology 
is not like, say, a bookstore or some similar physical 
&quot;place&quot; that can be located, boarded up, 
and its operators hauled into court; like the Internet 
itself, it has no owner, no operator, no central computer 
on which it &quot;lives.&quot;  Usenet groups like 
alt.religion.scientology come into existence when someone 
(like Scott Goehring) sends a proposal to establish 
the group to the specific newsgroup (named &quot;alt.config&quot;) 
set up for receiving such proposals.  The operators 
of each of the thousands of computer networks hooked 
up to the Internet are then free to carry, or to ignore, 
the proposed group.  If a network chooses to carry 
the newsgroup, its computers will be instructed to 
make the alt.religion.scientology &quot;feed,&quot; 
i.e., the stream of messages posted to alt.religion.scientology 
arriving from other participating networks, accessible 
to its users, who can read -- and, if they wish, add 
to -- this stream before it is passed along to the 
next network in the worldwide chain.  It's a completely 
decentralized organism -- in technical terms, a &quot;distributed 
database&quot; -- whose content is constantly changing 
as it moves silently around the globe from network 
to network and machine to machine, never settling down 
in any one legal jurisdiction, or on any one computer. 
 <P>

Not only is alt.religion.scientology immune from being 
boarded up in this fashion, but what the technology 
giveth, sometimes not even the technology can taketh 
away.  The Scientologists learned this early on, when 
Helena Kobrin, an attorney for the CoS, issued a &quot;Remove 
Group&quot; message to alt.config, asserting that alt.religion.scientology 
should be deleted from the network because (a) it had 
been started by a forged message, (b) it misleadingly 
used the trademarked name &quot;Scientology&quot; in 
its title, thus implying some official connection to 
the CoS, and (c) it &quot;has been and continues to 
be heavily abused with copyright and trade secret violations 
and serves no purpose other than condoning these illegal 
practices.&quot;  But it's like punching a paper bag; 
there's no forum in which to make these arguments other 
than Usenet itself, no central decision-maker that 
can evaluate the validity of those claims and decide 
whether or not alt.religion.scientology should survive. 
 That decision is entirely in the hands of the owners 
of each of those thousands of computers, most of whom, 
in this case, simply chose to ignore the request to 
delete the alt.religion.scientology group. <P>

<H3>2. Anonymity changes everything. </H3>
 Many of the documents 
in question were posted to alt.religion.scientology 
attached to signed messages from identifiable individuals. 
 Many, on the other hand, arrived in the Usenet feed 
bearing addresses like &quot;an144108@anon.penet.fi,&quot; 
identifying them as having been transmitted through 
a well-known Finnish &quot;anonymous remailer.&quot; 
 Anonymous remailers like anon.penet.fi operate very 
simply:  if Alice wants to send an anonymous message 
to Bob (or to alt.religion.scientology), she prepares 
the message and sends it not to the intended recipient 
but to the anon.penet.fi address (along with forwarding 
instructions); the remailer simply strips off  all 
of the information from this message related to Alice 
(and the machines that Alice utilized to transmit the 
message), and it then forwards the message -- now containing 
a &quot;return address&quot; indicating only the remailer 
from which it came -- as instructed.<P>

What kind of rules -- copyright, trade secret, or any 
other -- can be enforced in a world where individuals 
can so easily hide their identities?  The significance 
of this question was not lost on CoS officials; in 
a move that sent shock waves across the Net, many of 
whose denizens believed that anonymous remailer technology 
was somehow foolproof, CoS representatives in early 
1995 marched in to the offices of the Finnish police 
and managed to obtain a warrant authorizing the police 
to search the anon.penet.fi mail logs for the identification 
information pertaining to an144108.<P>

And while the Finnish police were indeed able to obtain 
the information they sought from the remailer operator, 
the Scientologists' tactics here may, inadvertently, 
simply have speeded up the development of more sophisticated 
techniques to ensure the security of anonymous messages. 
 By these actions, all Internet users have been made 
aware that they might want to avoid remailers like 
anon.penet.fi that retain copies of incoming identification 
information if they want more protection from the forces 
of the &quot;real world&quot; in Finland or elsewhere. 
 More importantly, many of the documents arriving on 
alt.religion.scientology's doorstep these days -- including 
those coming from the as-yet unidentified &quot;Scamizdat,&quot; 
an individual (or is it a group of individuals?  an 
arm of some multi-national organization?) responsible 
for a number of postings containing large chunks of 
the Scientology secret materials -- have begun to arrive 
through a<I> chain</I> of multiple anonymous remailers.   
This makes it far more difficult to secure the necessary 
cooperation from local authorities that would be required 
to trace the messages back to their source(s). And 
by combining the use of multiple anonymous remailers 
with use of widely-available cryptographic techniques 
for &quot;scrambling&quot; messages, obtaining identification 
information becomes even more difficult -- approaching, 
many suggest, complete impossibility.  <P>

So now those possessing secret Scientology texts they 
wish to disseminate can, if they wish, avoid the unpleasant 
prospect of being hauled into court to be made answerable 
for their actions, while still accomplishing their 
goal. As Scamizdat him/her/itself was quoted as saying: 
&quot;While the Net has its own perpetual struggles 
among its orthodoxy and revisionists, it strobes into 
immobility lawyers and money that darken the battles 
in the ordinary world.&quot;  Whether or not lawyers 
are &quot;strobed into immobility&quot; (?), the day 
of the traditional lawsuit as a means to settle disputes 
of this kind may indeed be numbered.<P>

<H3>3. Information can't be controlled.</H3>
 To be sure, even 
in the non-virtual world -- what Nicholas Negroponte 
has dubbed &quot;the world of atoms&quot; -- information 
is a pretty slippery quantity.  But at least there 
is a measure of possible control over its dissemination 
and distribution in a world where newsletters can be 
seized, printing presses impounded, and bookstores 
boarded up.  Perhaps the most obvious implication of 
the Scientology War is that on the new global network 
that measure of control has all but vanished.  <P>

For example, the Scientologists have been able, on a 
number of occasions, to obtain court orders allowing 
them to seize and impound computers on which their 
allegedly proprietary material was stored.  But whatever 
hardship such actions may impose on the individuals 
whose machines are taken, the information itself is 
blissfully unconcerned by assertions of control over 
physical hard drives and the like, as it continues 
to speed around the globe unimpeded.  Indeed, shortly 
after the Scientologists were successfully able to 
impound a number of documents posted through a Dutch 
Internet Service Provider (known as XS4ALL), those 
documents -- now dubbed the &quot;Anti-Scientology 
Fact Kit&quot; -- appeared on several dozen sites on 
the World Wide Web, available to all for easy downloading. 
 And if those machines could somehow be made to disappear, 
new ones would surely take their place.  Once information 
crosses the border into cyberspace, it is uncontrolled 
and, at least with current technology, uncontrollable; 
if nothing else, our notion of what constitutes a &quot;secret,&quot; 
trade or otherwise, in this kind of universe is likely 
to require substantial modification.<P>

<H3>4. The new weapons. </H3>
If the weapons that have worked 
in the past in the ongoing battle to control information 
flow prove ultimately toothless, the Scientology War 
has already given us a glimpse of what some of the 
new weapons might look like. Most primitive is the 
technique known on the Net as &quot;spamming&quot; 
-- bombarding an area of the Net with an inordinately 
high number of messages.  In the early days of the 
Scientology War, CoS staffer Elaine Siegel suggested 
in a memo flooding the Net with positive messages about 
Scientology as a counter to posted criticism.  &quot;Imagine 
40 to 50 Scientologists posting on the Internet every 
few days; we'll just run the SPs&quot; [&quot;suppressive 
persons,&quot; in Scientology lingo] right off the 
system. It will be quite simple . . . to make the Internet 
a safe space for Scientology to expand into.&quot; 
 The CoS has denied that this was ever official CoS 
policy, but in any event the Church's critics quickly 
deployed counter-measures:  software programs known 
as &quot;kill files&quot; that instruct their computers 
not to display any messages from particular e-mail 
addresses that may appear in the Usenet feeds, thus 
making it far more difficult for anyone to enlist an 
army of spammers trying to disrupt ongoing conversations.<P>

Subsequently a more sophisticated series of weapons 
made its way onto this battleground.  The software 
that allows the Usenet discussions to proceed has a 
built_in cancellation function, which allows any person 
posting a message to a Usenet discussion group to send 
out a subsequent cancel command that propagates around 
the Usenet network from machine to machine and instructs 
each participating machine to ignore the user's previously 
posted message.  Designed to allow users to cancel 
their own postings, this command can be manipulated, 
by widely-available procedures, to allow you to cancel 
someone else's message, i.e., to forge a cancel command 
to make it look as though it came from the original 
poster. And thus it was that in late 1994, postings 
began to vanish from alt.religion.scientology, occasionally 
with an explanation that the postings had been &quot;canceled 
because of copyright infringement.&quot;  To this day, 
it is not known who was behind the deployment of these 
&quot;cancelbots,&quot; as they are known.  Again, 
the CoS disclaimed responsibility, and the anti-Scientology 
crowd began to refer to this anonymous participant 
simply as the &quot;Cancelbunny,&quot; a tongue-in-cheek 
reference to both the Energizer bunny and to a well-known 
Net inhabitant, the Cancelmoose, who has taken it upon 
himself (itself? themselves?) to set up a cancelbot-issuing 
process to deal with other kinds of spamming incidents. 
 But whoever or whatever the Cancelbunny may be, its 
efforts were quickly met by the development of yet 
another software weapon, appropriately dubbed &quot;Lazarus,&quot; 
that resurrects canceled messages (or, more accurately, 
simply alerts the original poster, and all other participants 
in the newsgroup, that a specific message has been 
canceled, leaving it up to the original poster to reinstate 
the message if he or she were not the party that issued 
the cancel command).<P>

What is happening here?  Surely the center of gravity 
of our law-making and law-enforcement apparatus is 
shifting away from the familiar rules and instruments 
that have served us, whether for good or ill, in the 
world of atoms.  That's the polite version.  Less politely, 
cyberspace looks a lot like Hobbes' quasi-mythical 
construct, the state of nature, where the inhabitants 
have &quot;no common Power to feare&quot; and where 
there is &quot;no government at all.&quot;  Of course, 
law and an ordered society will emerge from out of 
the state of nature --or at least so Hobbes (and Locke, 
and most of the other Enlightenment philosophers) believed 
-- by means of a &quot;social contract&quot; voluntarily 
entered into by the inhabitants. Indeed, only law that 
emerges from something resembling this process -- only 
law as to which the &quot;consent of the governed&quot; 
has been obtained, in Jefferson's phrase -- is a truly 
legitimate exercise of State power.  <P>

There has always been a strong fictional element to 
using this notion of a social contract as a rationale 
for a sovereign's legitimacy.  When exactly did you 
or I consent to be bound by the US Constitution?  At 
best, that consent can only be inferred indirectly, 
from our continued presence within the US borders -- 
the love-it-or-leave-it, vote-with-your-feet theory 
of political legitimacy.  But by that token, is Saddam 
Hussein's rule legitimate, as least as to those Iraqis 
who have &quot;consented&quot; in this fashion?  Have 
the Zairois consented to Mobutu's rule?  In the world 
of atoms, we simply cannot ignore the fact that real 
movement of real people is not always so easy, and 
that most people can hardly be charged with having 
chosen the jurisdiction in which they live or the laws 
that they are made to obey.  But in cyberspace, there 
is an infinite amount of space, and movement between 
online communities is entirely frictionless.  Here, 
there really is the opportunity to obtain consent to 
a social contract; virtual communities can be established 
with their own particular rule-sets, power to maintain 
a degree of order and to banish wrongdoers can be lodged, 
or not, in particular individuals or groups, and those 
who find the rules oppressive or unfair may simply 
leave and join another community (or start their own).<P>

That potential -- not the availability of video on demand, 
or interactive games, or any of the other technological 
wonders -- is what makes the emergence of cyberspace 
a truly extraordinary political event.  The consentof 
the governed can move from beng a theoretical construct 
to a real principle of governance.  No longer will 
we need to theorize about the content of the laws that 
people would choose if they were free to do so; the 
Net will reveal those preferences for us by means of 
the invisible hand of a worldwide open market for laws, 
with communities competing for our adherence.  So if 
the inhabitants of alt.religion.scientology want to 
have a community where copyright is ignored, why should 
we interfere, since anyone who finds that notion unattractive 
can simply remain outside its borders and move to other 
communities -- the Microsoft Network, say -- where 
other, more protective rules are in place? <P>

The answer, of course, is well illustrated by the Scientology 
War itself.  After all, the Scientologists were not 
willing participants in this community, they did not 
choose to post their documents to alt.religion.scientology 
subject to this community's rules. In other words, 
each community's rules will have some spillover effects 
on the inhabitants of other communities, both within 
and without the boundary between cyberspace and the 
world of atoms.  Sovereigns wielding power in the real 
world do not and cannot permit individuals from within 
other jurisdictions to lob explosives over their borders, 
and it is too facile to believe that they will permit 
these virtual communities to do so either.  Cyberspace 
may indeed be difficult for territorially-based authorities 
to control, but we court danger, and put this remarkable 
experiment in political life at risk, if we assume 
that it is <EM>impossible </EM>to control from within the non-virtual 
world; we have managed to stave off the Orwellian nightmare 
up to this point, but it is by no means foreordained 
that we can continue to do so.  Cyberspace must, in 
short, take its place among the community of nations. 
This will require the development of a degree of mutual 
recognition and respect on both sides of the border 
between the world of atoms and the world of bits.  
Existing sovereigns must defer to the inhabitants of 
this new place regarding those matters in which the 
legitimate and unique interests of those inhabitants 
are paramount; it is the inhabitants of cyberspace, 
after all, who are in the best position to determine 
the varying shapes of a copyright law that can truly 
take account of the strange features of this new informational 
landscape, and any attempt to require slavish adherence 
to a copyright law designed for physical objects in 
an atom-bound world should be fiercely resisted.  But 
the inhabitants of cyberspace, too, must develop mechanisms 
to recognize and respect the legitimate interests of 
individuals outside their borders. The challenge is 
clear and almost overwhelmingly complex, but we cannot 
fail to meet it lest we lose this opportunity, which 
may be unique in human history, to design a world in 
which people are finally free to live their lives as 
they see fit. <P>

When Newt Gingrich's House of Representatives recently 
set up its first outpost on the Internet, it chose 
to name it &quot;Thomas&quot; in honor of Mr. Jefferson 
-- a small but telling symbol of the ascendancy of 
the &quot;Jeffersonian vision&quot; not only in the 
realm of politics, but in the realm of high technology 
as well.
<p>

Jefferson and Hamilton remain the two great pole stars 
in American politics, their feud surely the longest_running 
in American political history.   The two men staked 
out opposing positions and battled over most of the 
great issues on which the fate of the infant Republic 
was seen to depend __ states' rights versus a strong 
national authority, agriculture versus manufacturing, 
legislative power versus executive power, free trade 
versus mercantilism, yeomanry versus the elite.  Their 
intellectual descendants continue to do battle to this 
day.
<p>

To be sure, theirs was a debate about means, not ends: 
both men were deeply committed to the republican ideal, 
to the legitimacy of only those governments grounded 
upon the consent of the governed, and to the primacy 
of individual liberty in the constellation of natural 
rights.  But they held fundamentally different views 
about the nature and the proper exercise of governmental 
power and the manner in which governmental power could 
best be brought to bear so as to secure that liberty.
<p>

For Jefferson, power was always a corrupting force, 
and concentrations of power were always to be avoided 
lest the Republic founder:
<p>

&quot;What has destroyed liberty and the rights of man 
in every government which has ever existed under the 
sun?  The generalizing and concentrating all cares 
and powers into one body, no matter whether of the 
autocrats of Russia or France, or of the aristocrats 
of a Venetian Senate.&quot;
<p>

Diffusion and decentralization of power were the touchstones 
of the Jeffersonian philosophy.  Jefferson was, in 
his own words, &quot;not a friend to a very energetic 
government,&quot; finding it &quot;always oppressive&quot; 
in that it &quot;places the governors indeed more at 
their ease, at the expense of the people.&quot;  The 
government he sought, as he declared in his First Inaugural 
Address, was one &quot;which shall restrain men from 
injuring one another [but] which shall leave them otherwise 
free to regulate their own pursuits of industry and 
improvement, and shall not take from the mouth of labor 
the bread it has earned.&quot;  Because &quot;men are 
disposed to live honestly, if the means of doing so 
are open to them,&quot; they required little direction 
from central authority to manage their affairs:  &quot;Were 
we directed from Washington when to sow, and when to 
reap, we should soon want bread,&quot; he observed, 
later adding, in a letter to his friend Gideon Granger, 
that &quot;when all government, domestic and foreign, 
in little as in great things, shall be drawn to Washington 
as the center of all power, it will render powerless 
the checks provided of one government on another, and 
we will become as venal and oppressive as the government 
from which we separated.&quot;
<p>

To Hamilton, this was all anarchy and riot, a &quot;dance 
to the tune of liberty without law,&quot; put forth 
by &quot;never to be satiated lovers of innovation 
and change.&quot;  Power tends to corrupt, to be sure; 
but &quot;the possibility of abuse is no argument against 
the thing,&quot;and &quot;too little power is as dangerous 
as too much.&quot;
<p>

&quot;History is full of examples, where in contests 
for liberty, a jealousy of power has either defeated 
the attempts to recover or preserve it in the first 
instance, or has afterwards subverted it by clogging 
government with too great precautions for its felicity, 
or by leaving too wide a door for sedition and popular 
licentiousness.  In a government framed for durable 
liberty, not less regard must be paid to giving the 
magistrate a proper degree of authority, to make and 
execute the laws with rigor, than to guarding against 
encroachments upon the rights of the community.  As 
too much power leads to despotism, too little leads 
to anarchy, and both eventually to the ruin of the 
people. . . . &quot;
<p>

Against the Jeffersonian position that the best government 
was the least government, Hamilton counterpoised a 
strong central government controlled by an executive 
officer commanding broad powers, an efficient government 
which &quot;through the medium of stable laws, shelters 
and protects, the life, the reputation, the prosperity, 
the civil and religious rights of every member of the 
community.&quot;
<p>

It is hardly surprising that Jefferson has been adopted 
as the patron saint of the new Republican congressional 
majority, which invokes his spirit at every turn, but 
it might come as something of a shock to Jefferson 
himself, the great defender of the agrarian way of 
life, that his vision has taken root in the new technological 
wonderland of &quot;cyberspace.&quot;  
<p>

The decentralizing effect of information technology 
is one of the truly startling developments of the late 
20th century.  As Peter Huber observes in his book 
&quot;Orwell's Revenge,&quot; Orwell got all the details 
right in <I>1984</I> but erred with the fundamental premise: 
that technology would inevitably concentrate power 
in the hands of the few and lead to an expansion of 
mechanisms of centralized, totalitarian control.  Circumstances 
surrounding the downfall of the Soviet Union alerted 
us all to the alternative possibility that the widespread 
availability of everything from telephones, fax machines, 
and CNN broadcasts might make it more, not less, difficult 
for the State to maintain its control over information 
and the levers of centralized control.
<p>

And the emergence of the global Internet further illustrates, 
and will accelerate, this trend.  On the Internet there 
is no centralized control of any kind, no governing 
authority that can impose its own vision of the good 
on the colonists of the new territory.  Information 
roams freely, literally at the speed of light; because 
no one owns or operates this network, which anyone 
with a computer and access to a telephone line can 
hook into, no one has the power to set uniform rules 
of conduct.
<p>

Washington is only now discovering just how difficult 
imposition of its rules on a decentralized network 
can be.  The federal government's ill-fated &quot;Clipper 
Chip&quot; initiative is symptomatic.  Concerned about 
the possibility that powerful encryption software would 
fall into the hands of terrorists or other malfeasants, 
allowing them to shield their communication from governmental 
eavesdroppers, the federal government proposed a requirement 
that all encryption software had to use a government-approved 
algorithm that would allow back-door law-enforcement 
entry.  They were persuaded to withdraw the proposal 
by the outcry from the Internet community itself, and 
from businesses hoping to serve a growing international 
market, and, finally, by a recognition of the futility 
of trying to legislate in the usual heavy-handed fashion 
when thousands, and possibly hundreds of thousands, 
of copies of the offending programs have been distributed 
(and continue to be available) over the Internet.
<p>

And if, as many have suggested, cyberspace metaphorically 
resembles the Wild West -- a place where the inhabitants 
set (and enforce) their own rules in the face of an 
inefficacious central government __ well, we have a 
good idea how the Jeffersonians and Hamiltonians among 
us are likely to react, inasmuch as their two forebears 
already squared off on the question of settlement of 
the non_metaphorical Wild West, i.e. on expansion into 
the &quot;Western&quot; territories (of Kentucky, Ohio, 
etc.).  
<p>

For his part, Hamilton despaired of the central government's 
ability to maintain control over settlements in the 
western territories
<p>

&quot;The western region [is] not valuable to the United 
States for settlement. . . . Should our own citizens, 
more enterprising than wise [!], become desirous of 
settling this country, and emigrate thither, it must 
not only be attended with all the injuries of a too 
widely dispersed population, but by adding to the great 
weight of the western part of our territory, must hasten 
the dismemberment of a large portion of our country, 
or a dissolution of the Government.&quot;
<p>

Hamilton spoke from bitter personal experience; one 
of the great crises faced during his tenure as Secretary 
of the Treasury was the Whisky Rebellion, the refusal 
of settlers in the &quot;western region&quot; to pay 
the newly-imposed federal levy on distilled spirits, 
and Hamilton himself was forced to lead the militia 
into battle to ensure efficient projection of federal 
power as the westward expansion proceeded. 
<p>

Jefferson, on the other hand, foresaw a flourishing 
&quot;empire of liberty&quot; on the western frontier, 
a place where the &quot;utmost diffusion of power&quot; 
could take root and where &quot;new sources of renovation&quot; 
would serve as a safety valve against the despotic 
tendencies of the national government, renewing the 
spirit of liberty &quot;should its principles, at any 
time, degenerate in those portions of our country which 
gave them birth.&quot;
<p>

Surely, were Hamilton to log on today, he would indeed 
find the anarchy and &quot;public licentiousness&quot; 
he railed so frequently against -- a cacophonous international 
debate with a million voices on everything from copyright 
policy to scientology to the best ways to play Doom 
II, an unregulated and largely unregulatable collection 
of everything from the Federalist Papers to video clips 
of people having sex with animals.  But the millions 
who continue to flock there are finding something that 
looks more like a place where Jefferson's fundamental 
democratic value -- &quot;free communication among 
the people, which has ever been justly deemed the only 
effectual guardian of every other right&quot; -- reigns 
without interference.  The sage of Monticello, one 
suspects, is smiling broadly.<P>

Draft, November 6, 1995<br>
Plugging In, December 1995</H3>
<P>

At last May's hearings of the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee 
on Terrorism, held in the wake of the Oklahoma City 
bombing, panelists pointed to the following anonymous 
message that was posted on an Internet electronic bulletin 
board:<P>

&quot;Are you interested in receiving information detailing 
the components and materials needed to construct a 
bomb identical to the one used in Oklahoma?  The information 
specifically details the construction, deployment, 
and detonation of high_powered explosives. It also 
includes complete details of the bomb used in Oklahoma 
City, and how it was used, and how it could have been 
better.&quot;<P>

Should the government -- <I>can</I> the government -- control 
anonymity in cyberspace?  Anonymity is pervasive in 
the &quot;real world,&quot; to be sure; most of the 
encounters we have each day -- on the bus, in the coffee 
shop, while shopping, etc. -- are probably anonymous 
ones.  But anonymity has perhaps never been quite so 
easy to achieve, and we have probably never been able 
to undertake so wide a range of anonymous transactions, 
as in cyberspace.  For example, there are a number 
of &quot;anonymous remailer&quot; services now available 
on the Internet, computer systems where one can send 
an electronic mail message (addressed, say, to a friend 
across the country, to a list of individual addressees, 
or to an electronic bulletin board for public posting) 
in order to have the information identifying the computer 
from which the message was sent entirely stripped off 
and destroyed; the message, when it arrives at its 
destination, only contains information regarding the 
remailer from which it was sent, not the originator 
of the message.  (Most of these remailers are off-shore 
-- Finland seems to be a popular location -- which 
may complicate any regulatory effort).  Many of the 
other technologies I have discussed in this column 
-- e.g., electronic cash, which may vastly expand the 
scope for anonymous purchase and sale transactions 
(see <A HREF="./X0008_ECASH.html">&quot;E-Cash: Can't Live With It, Can't Live Without 
It,&quot; February 1995</A>), and encryption software, 
which allows all information contained in messages, 
including information about the electronic address 
of the sender, to be scrambled in virtually unbreakable 
fashion (see <A HREF="./X0009_ENCRYPT1.html">&quot;Encryption: It's Not Just for Spies 
Anymore,&quot; December 1994</A>) -- further enlarge the 
scope for real, untraceable anonymity.<P>

And anonymity is not without its costs.  Most obviously, 
a truly anonymous regime makes it impossible for &quot;law 
enforcement&quot; --- broadly defined to include both 
public and private enforcement of legal rules --  to 
obtain information about the persons responsible for 
harmful behavior so as to punish wrongdoers or compensate 
the victims of that harm.  Indeed, the wider availability 
of anonymous message capabilities may actually increase 
the amount of harmful activity; if, as the economists 
might say, individuals need not &quot;internalize&quot; 
the costs of the harm imposed on others by their actions 
because they will not be called to account, we might 
expect more such behavior to emerge. <P>

But there are benefits -- possibly profound benefits 
-- as well.  There are, of course, perfectly legitimate, 
indeed laudable, reasons why individuals might want 
to engage in communicative activity without putting 
any aspects of their identity at risk; think, for instance, 
of a discussion group among HIV-positive individuals, 
or battered spouses.  And think, in the example most 
likely to prove persuasive when this question arises 
in the constitutional context, of the Federalist Papers, 
arguably the greatest single work of political theory 
in history that may well never have seen the light 
of day had its authors had to reveal their true identities. 
 <P>

Balancing these costs and benefits would be hard enough 
for any would-be law-maker; unfortunately, perhaps, 
the situation is even more complicated that the above 
might suggest.  If you think about it, anonymity (and 
its close cousin, pseudonymity, the ability to act 
not only under the name &quot;Anon.&quot; or &quot;John 
Doe&quot; but fictitious names (like Mark Twain) that 
can build up identities and reputations of their own) 
are forms of limited liability, allowing individuals 
to act without putting any of their assets (including 
any characteristics of their &quot;true&quot; identity) 
at risk.  Limited liability is a familiar concept from 
the corporate context, of course; limited liability 
is the carrot that we use to encourage the pooling 
of capital into collaborative enterprises known as 
corporations.  Perhaps the availability of anonymous 
and pseudonymous communication should likewise be encouraged 
as a means to encourage the pooling of <I>intellectual</I> 
capital into new forms of collaborative entities, existing 
and acting only in the virtual realm of cyberspace? 
 That is, just as limited liability in the corporate 
context was designed to encourage the pooling of physical 
and financial assets into corporate entities, assuring 
investors that those assets would not be placed at 
risk, so, too, might protection against revelation 
of individual identity in cyberspace encourage &quot;investors&quot; 
to pool their intellectual capital into pseudonymous 
entities, assuring those investors that only the reputation 
of the pseudonymous actor, and not their own personal 
assets, are at risk when the entity acts.<P>

This is not as far-fetched as it may sound.  Pseudonymity, 
after all, is the norm in cyberspace, not some aberration. 
 Because all communication in cyberspace is entirely 
machine-mediated -- i.e., because all communication 
in cyberspace consists entirely of a string of bits 
-- the &quot;identity&quot; of the relevant actors 
as real biological persons is necessarily at one remove 
from the communication itself; everyone thus acts &quot;pseudonymously&quot; 
in a sense when communicating in cyberspace.  To be 
sure, this stream of bits may appear to be traceable 
to a real individual -- if, for example, you receive 
an electronic mail message identified as coming from 
&quot;David Post&quot; at &quot;Georgetown University 
Law Center.&quot;  Or it may not -- as with the &quot;screen 
names&quot; used on many of the commercial online services 
(&quot;Weirdsarah,&quot; &quot;BigFish,&quot; &quot;Perry 
the Cynic,&quot; and the like).<P>

And when you get that message from one of those pseudonymous 
actors, how, indeed, do you know that a single person, 
rather than a collaborating group, stands behind the 
message?  The ease with which people can join together 
on the global network is one of its hallmarks; perhaps 
&quot;Perry the Cynic&quot; -- some one, or some thing, 
with whom I actually had a lengthy online discussion 
several months ago about these very issues -- is in 
reality a group of people all acting through a single 
voice (and a single electronic mail address)?  To take 
another example, several colleagues and I have recently 
formed something we are calling the &quot;Cyberspace 
Law Institute&quot; to ponder questions about the shape 
of the law in this new cyber-world; for various reasons, 
the individuals constituting this entity may be less 
willing to participate if their real identities are 
known to the world.<P>

My point is simply that any attempt to control anonymity 
in cyberspace, e.g., by requiring that individuals 
be readily identifiable, necessarily will have an impact 
not merely on the availability of anonymous communication, 
but on the availability of pseudonymous communication 
as well; requiring all authors to provide information 
about their &quot;real&quot; identity makes it impossible 
for them not only to communicate anonymously but through 
a pseudonym as well. Analyzing the consequences of 
a &quot;ban on anonymity&quot; in cyberspace thus needs 
to take more than the benefits and costs of anonymous 
messaging into account; it needs to be evaluated in 
light of the benefits and costs of pseudonymous communication 
as well.<P>

This approach probably <I>answers </I>none of the hard questions 
about the proper scope of regulation of this communication, 
but it may lead to a consideration of those questions 
that need to be answered before any regulatory actions 
are undertaken.  If there are benefits to be gained 
from the actions of these entities -- if the pooling 
of intellectual capital into entities leads to new 
and valuable forms of intellectual undertakings -- 
shouldn't we seek to design our new rules of &quot;limited 
liability&quot; to simultaneously induce &quot;investors&quot; 
to form these new entities while minimizing the costs 
that may be associated with their formation?  Analyses 
of corporate limited liability are useful analogues 
for this inquiry; when should &quot;piercing the veil&quot; 
of pseudonymity be permitted or required? Can we disaggregate 
the various aspects of personal identity that should 
receive more, or less, protection from disclosure -- 
for example, imposing bonding or insurance requirements 
to insure that redress can be achieved by exposing 
individuals' financial assets, though not necessarily 
their personal identities, to risk when the pseudonymous 
entity acts?<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>&quot;Mastering the lawless science of our law,<BR>
That codeless myriad of precedent,<BR>
That wilderness of single instances,<BR>
Through which a few, by wit or fortune led,<BR>
May beat a pathway out to wealth and fame.&quot;<BR>
Alfred, Lord Tennyson, <I>Aylmer's Field</I> (1793)<P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><HR ALIGN=CENTER WIDTH=30>
 With the single exception of word processing, no technological 
development of the last few decades has had greater 
effect on the practice of law than online searching. 
 We sometimes forget how rapid and profound the changes 
wrought by these seemingly mundane capabilities have 
been.  Ten years ago, when I began practicing law, 
the hot issue in legal technology circles was whether 
online research could, or should, supplant traditional 
searching methods.  In law school in the early 1980s, 
we were not permitted to use online searching for our 
legal research projects, for fear that somehow this 
would interfere with our ability to learn &quot;real&quot; 
legal research.  The trade journals were filled with 
comparisons of the cost-effectiveness of traditional 
and online search methods, and there was a widespread 
feeling that the material in the Lexis or Westlaw online 
databases somehow wasn't as authoritative as the cases 
printed in hard copy and stored on the library shelves.
<p>
Today these questions have a truly antiquated ring, 
which is probably as good a measure as any of just 
how far the technology has taken us in a breathtakingly 
short period of time.  There may be lawyers who rely 
on traditional hard-copy tools for finding the law 
relevant to any particular question, but there are 
surely fewer and fewer of them every day.  But these 
systems have not merely altered the shape of the lawyer's 
toolkit; because information retrieval is at the very 
core of what the law is, the rapid expansion of fundamentally 
new ways of finding legal information may be changing 
the very substance of the law, and perhaps even the 
notion of &quot;the Law.&quot;
<p>
Tennyson was correct; in 1793, law was indeed a &quot;lawless 
science&quot; because the information that constituted 
&quot;the law&quot; was, in his day, largely inaccessible. 
 In a decentralized common-law system, which relies 
upon precedent for its decisions, if information about 
what the decision-makers have done in particular cases 
is not available to others, it doesn't really exist 
-- it's the tree that falls in the forest when no one 
is around to see it.  And that was precisely the situation 
prior to the advent of a system for distributing reported 
decisions -- an institution that really takes shape, 
in this country, during the middle and latter parts 
of the 19th century with the development of the West 
National Reporter System, the first comprehensive collection 
in standardized format of all of the decisions of all 
of the nation's courts.  As that database grew (and 
it grew rapidly during the late 1800s), no one could 
possibly keep track of the information that was growing 
there; some way to locate information within the database 
was required, a need soon filled, of course, by the 
West Digest system.
<p>
When I describe the West Digest System to some of my 
current students, I am met with puzzled and bemused 
looks.  For those of you who, like them, have never 
had the exquisite pleasure of doing legal research 
with the Digests, a brief description is in order. 
 The Digests were nothing less than a comprehensive 
index of every proposition of law in every reported 
case.  The original classification scheme grew from 
what West called the seven &quot;grand divisions&quot; 
-- persons, property, contracts, torts, crimes, remedies, 
and government -- and encompassed over four hundred 
main topics (&quot;criminal law,&quot; &quot;copyright 
law,&quot; and the like) and thousands of subdivisions 
(often layered three or four layers deep).  Each case 
from the National Reporter System was divided into 
individual propositions of law (the &quot;Headnotes), 
and each proposition of law in every case decided by 
each tribunal was then assigned to one, or more, of 
these subdivisions.  The Digests then collected all 
propositions from all cases under each of the subdivisions, 
so that, in theory, one could find what every court 
had ever said about the subject at hand..  
<p>
The development of the West Digests was largely the 
work of a small number of men (Benjamin Abbott, John 
Hudson, G. Fred Williams, and John Mallory) prior to 
the turn of the century, and it was surely a grand 
scheme, as grand in its way as the Linnaean system 
for classifying the animal and plant kingdoms (and 
the result of much the same intellectual impulse). 
 Without this remarkable information retrieval system, 
the Reporter system itself -- the comprehensive database 
of cases -- would have been almost unusable, and its 
influence on the structure of the law was profound. 
But it was far more than just a convenient way to find 
the law; in many ways it <EM>was</EM> the law.  West referred 
to it, and many of us thought of it, as a kind of map 
of the landscape of the reported decisions, but if 
it was a map it was a very curious map indeed, for 
unlike most maps it actually helped to shape the very 
features of the landscape that it was supposedly mapping. 
 An ordinary map can be &quot;wrong&quot; -- it can 
incorrectly describe the features of this physical 
landscape by putting, say,  something in the east quadrant 
when it is &quot;really&quot; in the west.  But the 
West Digest had a kind of self-perpetuating quality; 
if it put something in the east it pretty much stayed 
there forever.  As Robert Berring, Professor of Law 
and Law Librarian at Boalt Hall, has written:
<p>
It is commonplace among information scientist that an 
unindexed or misindexed piece of information is forever 
altered or lost . . . [I]f cases are only available 
through the West Digest system, then only that intellectual 
structure for understanding the interrelationships 
of law can prevail. Like it or not, practitioners and 
researchers internalized he West structure, and it 
became the skeleton upon which the rest of the system 
was built.
<P>
To illustrate, in 1986 I clerked for then-Judge Ruth 
Bader Ginsburg on the DC Circuit Court of Appeals, 
and worked with her on a case, <I>Martin v. DC Metropolitan 
Police Department, </I>812 F.2d 1425, over which we struggled 
mightily.  The case involved a &quot;Bivens claim&quot; 
of unconstitutional conduct lodged against a member 
of the DC police force, and raised difficult questions 
about the way that courts would evaluate such claims 
on the pleadings.  About a year after the decision 
was handed down, I had occasion to look for the decision 
in the Digests, and found, to my surprise, that the 
key propositions of law for which the case stood did 
not concern &quot;Civil Rights/Federal Remedies,&quot; 
or &quot;Constitutional Law/Remedies for Injuries,&quot; 
or &quot;Constitutional Law/Personal, Civil, and Political 
Rights/Personal Liberty and Security&quot; -- all perfectly 
plausible categories for this case -- but rather &quot;United 
States/Government in General/Liability of Officers 
and Agents.&quot; If that was the only way you could 
find the case, then others would find it (and cite 
to it) only if they were looking for the law of the 
liability of US government officers and agents, not 
civil rights law or constitutional law, and it would 
over time come to mean something about law of the liability 
of US government officers and agents, not civil rights 
law or constitutional law. 
 <p>
The advent of online searching has, of course, changed 
all of that.  Now, of course, you enter &quot;Bivens 
claim&quot; and &quot;summary judgement&quot; and &quot;immunity&quot; 
and &quot;government official&quot; -- or, even more 
powerfully, you enter a simple question: &quot;What 
standards of specificity should a court apply to a 
Bivens claim when evaluating a motion for summary judgment 
based on absolute or qualified immunity&quot; -- and 
you'll find <I>Martin</I>, even if you have no idea what category 
your question falls into.  No longer, in short, does 
an indexer stand between you and the proposition of 
law for which you may be searching.  No longer does 
any single entity -- West Publishing or anyone else 
-- decide what is or is not &quot;constitutional law&quot; 
or &quot;civil rights law&quot; or &quot;governmental 
immunity&quot; law.  Where once the legions of indexers 
compiling the West digests determined the meaning of 
individual cases, now we have literally an infinite 
number of ways to find any particular case and make 
of it what we will.
<p>
This is likely to have a profound impact on the very 
existence of legal categories like &quot;constitutional 
law&quot; or &quot;civil rights law&quot; or &quot;law 
of government official immunity.&quot;.  We have in 
this country, for instance, no coherent body of &quot;information 
law,&quot; and we are only now beginning to see people 
describe themselves as &quot;information lawyers.&quot; 
 We have, to be sure, courses at law schools on information 
law, but such courses will usually cover a little bit 
of &quot;privacy law,&quot; some &quot;intellectual 
property law,&quot; some &quot;communications law,&quot; 
and the like.  Information law is seen, in other words, 
as a kind of cross-disciplinary study, cutting across 
the &quot;ordinary&quot; categories within which legal 
information is organized.  But where did those categories 
come from?  It is something of a stretch, I admit, 
to claim that we don't have a coherent body of information 
law because Messrs. Abbott, Hudson, Williams, and Mallory 
did not include such a category in their grand indexing 
scheme -- but it is, I would suggest, not too much 
of a stretch.  There was, in effect, no place within 
the Digest structure for information law to live and 
grow; while it was not impossible to bring together 
legal propositions from these disparate categories 
to see if common principles bound them together, it 
was awfully difficult.  But those categories are crumbling, 
because they are in large part a product of an information 
retrieval system whose day is past.
<p>
Finally, consider the odd place of &quot;facts&quot; 
in the law.  It is the deep dark secret of the law: 
facts matter, and matter profoundly.  My students don't 
believe it -- and resist believing it with all the 
power in their being.  But we know that our clients 
do not come to us with &quot;legal problems,&quot; 
they come to us with facts, and it is our job as lawyers 
to determine how the legal system will deal with those 
facts.  Our clients do not come to us and say &quot; 
under the Lanham Act, what is the role of geographical 
proximity in determining the nature of the &euml;consumer 
confusion' that must be demonstrated to state a claim?&quot; 
 They ask:  &quot;Some guy in Chicago is marketing 
something under the same name as my product; is there 
anything we can do about that?&quot;  Accordingly, 
we all now that the most useful piece of information 
we can find is information on how the legal system 
has dealt with analogous constellations of facts in 
the past.  That's the golden nugget, the case &quot;on 
all fours&quot; with the facts of our client's current 
situation from which we can make reasonably reliable 
predictions about what a court will do when faced with 
those facts.  <I>But, of course, that's precisely the 
kind of information that was virtually inaccessible 
under previously-existing retrieval systems.</I> The indexers 
didn't index facts, they indexed propositions of law. 
 Facts were, therefore, far more difficult to find 
than propositions of law, and finding the case on all 
fours was an arduous and difficult task, not because 
the law of nature dictated that it be so but because 
we had no retrieval tools that would facilitate that 
task.
<p>
But facts and propositions or law are now equally accessible, 
because there is no indexer to decide what is a &quot;fact&quot; 
and what is a &quot;proposition of law.&quot;  The 
law is likely to be increasingly organized along factual 
lines -- replacing our category of, say, &quot;intellectual 
property law&quot; with, perhaps, &quot;music law,&quot; 
or &quot;Web page law,&quot; or the like.  Factual 
information is likely to assume new prominence in the 
law, because the new technologies allow such information 
to be more easily retrieved and more easily packaged 
for the judicial decision-makers.  Surely the  lawyer 
of 2000 or 2010 will be amazed to learn that when the 
Supreme Court issued its opinion in the music parody 
case of <I>Campbell v. Acuff-Rose</I>, there was no sound 
file attached to the written opinion that would allow 
readers to hear the two songs the Court was talking 
about.  Or that the decision upholding the trademarkability 
of color -- Qualitex v. xxx -- was issued in black 
and white!  The dispositive factual information in 
these cases was completely obscured, simply as a function 
of the inability of our technology to handle such information. 
As that changes -- and it will look as peculiar to 
lawyers in 10 years as the West Digests do to my students 
today -- the structure of the law that we have come 
to know (if not love) is likely to be fundamentally 
re-shaped.<P>

To many, the explosion of electronic communications 
on private bulletin boards, electronic mail systems, 
and across the vast Internet, is the greatest thing 
to happen to the First Amendment since -- well, since 
the First Amendment.  The new communications media 
are ushering in the age of &quot;cheap speech,&quot; 
in the words of UCLA Law Professor Eugene Volokh: as 
the cost of true mass communication tumbles and the 
tools for reaching vast numbers of readers are wrested 
from institutional control -- the publishing houses, 
record companies, newspapers, and the like -- the core 
values underlying the First Amendment -- an individual's 
right to speak his or her mind and to disseminate his 
or her views to others without interference, to assemble 
peaceably (if only &quot;virtually&quot;) with other 
like-minded souls, to petition the government -- can 
flourish in a way that may have no historical precedent. 
 <P>

And flourish they have.  The diversity and vigor of 
expression in these electronic communities, measured 
by any standard, has been extraordinary.  While many 
descriptions of the Internet focus on the amazing array 
of (static) information resources that are now available 
online -- repositories of government documents, encyclopedic 
collections of otherwise inaccessible information -- 
the true Netizen knows that the heart and soul of cyberspace 
lies in the discussion groups.  Thousands upon thousands 
of newsgroups, public bulletin boards, and public mailing 
lists, covering everything from libertarian politics 
to Renaissance poetry, computer programming to rock 
climbing, child-rearing practices to the latest news 
from Bosnia, copyright law to musings on the life and 
times of Bob Dylan -- have sprung up seemingly overnight, 
and a cacophonous international debate on all fronts 
has ensued.  My electronic mailbox fills up daily with 
newsletters published by every conceivable type of 
organization pushing its view of public policy, individuals 
and organizations of all stripes are rushing to establish 
&quot;home pages&quot; on the World Wide Web, electronic 
activists circulate countless petitions urging legislators 
to take, or not to take, action on any number of issues. 
 Never before, one might argue, has speech been so 
uninhibited, the &quot;press&quot; so free, or the 
ability to petition the government for redress so robust.<P>

But all is not well; the Internet's Jeffersonian beginnings 
are already spawning a Hamiltonian backlash. Though 
many relish this eruption of what Jefferson called 
&quot;free communication among the people, which has 
ever been justly deemed the only effectual guardian 
of every other right,&quot; others stand with Hamilton 
who railed (in one of his &quot;Catullus&quot; letters) 
against what they see as &quot;sedition and public 
licentiousness,&quot; an anarchic &quot;dance to the 
tune of liberty without law.&quot; Reports of the easy 
availability of pornographic material on the Internet 
has led Senators Exon and Gorton to introduce the Communications 
Decency Act of 1994, which would expand existing prohibitions 
against harassing or &quot;obscene, lewd, lascivious, 
filthy, or indecent&quot; telephone communications 
to cover all electronic communications.  Similarly, 
the Christian Coalition's Contract With the American 
Family urges Congress &quot;to enact legislation to 
protect children  from being exposed to pornography 
on the Internet. Criminal law should be amended to 
prohibit distribution of, or making available, any 
pornography, soft core or hard, to children, and to 
prohibit distribution of obscene hard-core pornography 
to adults.&quot; 
<P>
This backlash is coming from all points on the political 
spectrum; do not think that the anti-obscenity crusaders 
are the only ones appalled by what they see (or, rather, 
what they hear about what others may see) on the Internet.
<P>
 After the Oklahoma City bombing, the Senate terrorism 
subcommittee immediately convened hearings on &quot;The 
Availability of Bomb-Making Information on the Internet,&quot; 
at which Senator Feinstein expressed shock that racist 
militia organizations apparently use the Internet to 
distribute &quot;mayhem manuals&quot; and other bomb-making 
instructional material and to spread their doctrines 
on the &quot;Cyberhate&quot; World Wide Web site and 
similar outposts on the Net.  Commenting on the &quot;difference 
between free speech and teaching someone how to kill,&quot; 
she observed that &quot;the doctrine of prior restraint 
is something we should look to&quot; in dealing with 
this material, and she is considering introducing an 
amendment to the anti-terrorism bill that would make 
a criminal the dissemination of information about manufacturing 
explosives.  <P>

And even our own American Bar Association has jumped 
into the act.  The mission statement for the ABA Science 
&amp; Technology Section's &quot;Project LEON&quot; 
(Law and Ethics on the Nets) includes the following: 
<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Almost on a daily basis, news items announce electronic 
network transmissions constituting hate mail, profanity, 
vulgarity, obscenity, child pornography, sexual harassment, 
defamation and invasion of privacy.  The violation 
of intellectual property rights and information system 
security are also frequent occurrences.  . . . It is 
argued that at present the lawless, the intolerant 
and the disrespectful seem able to pollute the worldwide 
information stream with little constraint.  Certainly, 
the current state of anarchy in national and global 
electronic networks cannot continue if the technology 
is to achieve the remarkable benefits that have been 
predicted in terms of communications among institutions 
and individuals, whether government, business or society 
at large.</BLOCKQUOTE> <P>

Other threats to the unhindered dissemination of information 
on the Net have emerged recently as well.  Owners of 
a California bulletin board are convicted of distributing 
obscene material when computer files are downloaded 
from their system to a computer in Tennessee (and deemed 
by a Tennessee jury to be obscene under prevailing 
Tennessee &quot;community standards&quot;).  Carnegie 
Mellon University responds to cries of pornography 
by refusing to allow its computers to be used for the 
distribution of certain newsgroups, only then to face 
charges of unlawful &quot;censorship.&quot;  And in 
what might be the gravest practical threat to the continued 
vigor of expression in cyberspace, a New York court 
held this past month that Prodigy, the large commercial 
online services provider, is a &quot;publisher&quot; 
of information that one of its subscribers posted on 
an online discussion forum (and can, therefore, be 
held liable for the allegedly defamatory content of 
those postings).<P>

This battle between competing visions of free expression, 
of course, is not unique to electronic media.  As every 
first year law student knows, even pure speech -- and 
one can hardly imagine an environment where speech 
is more &quot;pure&quot; than here -- can cause harm 
to third parties, and the government can, notwithstanding 
the First Amendment, condemn the shout of &quot;fire&quot; 
in the crowded theater, the defamatory remark, or the 
conspiracy to commit murder.  There is no magic formula 
that will keep the &quot;lawless, the intolerant, and 
the disrespectful&quot; from appearing, like uninvited 
dinner guests, to the free speech party, and thus we 
should expect to find in cyberspace the same knotty 
problems that we have confronted elsewhere in regard 
to the optimum balance between order and anarchy, content 
control and uninhibited free expression.<P>

But precisely because they are not new issues, we may 
be tempted to treat them within old frameworks that 
are inappropriate for the new context.  As I suggested 
here several months ago in regard to copyright law, 
the old bottles need to be carefully examined to be 
sure that the new wine can be safely held.  Might we 
need a &quot;First Amendment for cyberspace&quot;? 
 In one sense, of course, we do: the First Amendment 
is, as many have noted, merely a local ordinance in 
cyberspace, and in a truly global environment, where 
information is speeding from individual to individual 
without the least regard for national boundaries, it 
is hubris to imagine that the particular balance that 
we in the United States have struck in regard to matters 
concerning free expression will, can, or should control. 
 <P>

But even placing that most difficult jurisdictional 
problem to one side, cyber-communication may have special 
features that need to be taken into account if we want 
to fashion the most appropriate balance of these competing 
interests in the new environment.  Notions of physical 
space, of scarcity of tangible resources, of barriers 
to effective communication, have all had a rather profound 
impact on our definition of the contours of free speech 
-- and yet may have little or no meaning in cyberspace. 
 We implicitly accept the idea that the physical distance 
between geographical communities correlates with the 
harm that the presence of &quot;obscene&quot; material 
causes in those communities when we allow the citizens 
of Tennessee to craft a definition of &quot;obscenity&quot; 
that will be applicable to material making its way 
into the jurisdiction (but only to such material); 
the citizens in Tennessee are not harmed by the presence 
of what they may consider obscene material in California 
and cannot impose their definition on Californians. 
 But in a world where, in a very real sense, everything 
that is available in one community is simultaneously 
available in all others, of what relevance are the 
&quot;prevailing community standards&quot; in any single 
geographical community?  <P>

And while the regulation of &quot;lewd, lascivious, 
filthy, or indecent&quot; communication may pass constitutional 
muster where the listener is unable to physically avoid 
the unwelcome message (as in the case of the harassing 
telephone call), what is the state's interest in protecting 
its citizens from such communication when it is posted 
to a discussion group or bulletin board to which only 
those who voluntarily choose to do so will be exposed 
to the message?  Perhaps we should allow -- encourage, 
even -- people to yell fire in the crowded theater, 
given that we now have a medium that allows thousands 
of onlookers to instantly chime in with their opinions 
as to whether there really is a fire, how serious it 
is, where the exit routes might be, before (not just 
after) the rush for the exits begins?<P>

It is surely going to take time and reflection to adjust 
to a mode of communication that we have never quite 
seen before.  What should concern us all is not that 
we may have difficulty applying industrial age doctrine 
to information age realities, or that there will certainly 
be missteps along the way, but that we may discover 
that many among us are in fact less interested in speech 
that is truly free than we might have previously believed.<P>

American Lawyer, May 1995<p>

<p>



	There may be no more significant legal question surrounding the

emerging computer and communication technologies than this: 

how do copyright and other intellectual property rules apply in the

age of the Internet -- where unimaginably vast amounts of

information are stored in digital form and can be copied and

transmitted, instantaneously and for little more than the price of a

local phone call, to virtually any other computer on the globe?<p>



	<p>



	Shortly after the Betamax case (Sony v. Universal Studios), where

the Supreme Court held that the use of VCRs for home taping of

television broadcasts does not constitute copyright infringement,

representatives of the Motion Picture Association of America met

with a number of Congressmen to discuss possible legislative

responses to what the industry saw as a serious threat to its

continued profitability.  According to James Lardner (in "Fast

Forward:  Hollywood, the Japanese, and the Onslaught of the

VCR"), one of the participants at that meeting, Senator Charles

Mathias, scribbled the following on a piece of paper as the

discussion proceeded: <p>



<CENTER>



<TABLE BORDER="8" CELLPADDING="5" CELLSPACING="2">

	Era of Monastic Manuscript

</TR>

</TABLE>



</CENTER>



<p>



	This is the law's version of the Laffer Curve:  just as tax revenues

increase and then drop off as tax rates rise, so too, as copying

becomes easier and easier, laws to protect an author's right to

prevent unauthorized copying become more and more valuable --

until, perhaps, a point is reached at which copying has become so

simple, so costless, that regulation becomes virtually impossible.<p>



<p>



	Not surprisingly, this issue is currently the subject of vigorous

debate.  In one corner are the Incrementalists:  in their eyes, the

basic foundations of copyright law will survive intact because the

fundamental need to which it responds -- the need to provide

protection to authors so as to give them an incentive to invest the

time and effort required to produce creative works -- is still with us,

perhaps more than ever.  With appropriate fine-tuning, copyright

will accommodate these new technological developments as it has

accommodated earlier innovations, ranging from the invention of

the pianola (the subject of much copyright-related wrangling at the

turn of the century) to the VCR and the digital tape machine.  Thus,

the federal government's National Information Infrastructure

Working Group on Intellectual Property, considering possible

revisions to the Copyright Act, concluded:<p>



	<p>



	"The [copyright] coat is getting a little tight. There is no need for a

new one, but the old one needs a few alterations."<p>



<p>



	In the other corner are the Radical Revisionists:  copyright law,

based as it is on the notion that the creator of an original work

should be allowed to exercise exclusive control over the

reproduction of his or her creative output, is an anachronism in the

face of technologies that make the act of copying so easy --

technologies whose very essence, one might say, is to copy

information and move it from one place to another.  Canonical texts

for the Revisionists are Ithiel de la Sola Pool's "Technologies of

Freedom" ("Established notions about copyright become obsolete,

rooted as they are in the technology of print . . . with the arrival of

electronic reproduction, the recognition of a copyright and the

practice of paying royalties become unworkable.") and John Perry

Barlow's "The Economy of Ideas: Why Everything You Know

About Intellectual Property is Wrong" (Wired, March 1994)

("Intellectual property law cannot be patched, retrofitted, or

expanded to contain the gasses of digitized expression any more

than real estate law might be revised to cover the allocation of

broadcasting spectrum.")<p>



<p>



	 Who will prevail in this contest?  That's the multibillion-dollar

question for those who own valuable intellectual property and rely

on copyright protection to realize a return on that property, a

category that increasingly includes some very large and powerful

entities in the "information economy."  But whatever the outcome,

the copyright battle well illustrates some of the difficult issues that

arise when we try to apply venerable legal doctrine to new

technologies. <p>



<p>



	Senator Mathias was surely at least partially right; copyright

enforcement is going to prove difficult and costly in this new

environment.  But it is not simply the fact that copyrights can be so

easily violated in cyberspace that is putting increasing strain on our

current copyright regime.  After all, the photocopier constituted an

enormous assault on the notion of copyright, making it easy and

cheap for anyone to duplicate copyrighted works on paper.  The

Internet and other electronic means of publishing and

communication not only surpass the photocopier as vehicles for

copying and distributing information, they threaten more

fundamental concepts, integral to the very notion of copyright. <p>



<p>



	Consider, for instance, the basic building block of any copyright

system:  the concept of copying itself.  Copyright law is,

fundamentally, about granting authors exclusive control over the

production of copies of their works; the basic principle is that John

Grisham, and only John Grisham, can make (or authorize the

making of) copies of The Firm, and I infringe his copyright if I

make copies without his permission.  <p>



<p>



	Copyright law must therefore delineate with at least some degree of

clarity the activities that do, or do not, constitute the "making of a

copy."  There are plenty of nice questions cropping up here, of

course, to keep copyright lawyers busy.  But a relatively easy line

can, and has, been drawn, requiring that a reproduction of a

copyrighted work be tangible before the law will recognize it as a

potentially infringing copy; the U.S. copyright statute, for example,

defines a copy as a "material object . . . in which a work is fixed  . .

. and from which the work can be perceived . . . ."  <p>



<p>



	This means that I do not need Mr. Grisham's authorization to enter

my local bookstore and flip through the pages of his novel, or to

memorize a passage or two, or to imagine alternative endings to his

book; the law, wisely, does not consider reading, and whatever that

entails in the left temporal lobe of my brain, to constitute the

activity -- the making of a tangible copy of the work -- over which

Grisham is permitted to exercise control.  Phrased differently, the

right to produce tangible copies of The Firm belongs to Grisham;

the right to read it, to use and manipulate the information that he

has placed into the stream of commerce for the production of new

creative works, belongs to the public.  By this allocation will

copyright, in the Constitution's words, "promote the Progress of

Science and useful Arts."<p>



<p>



	This simple but fundamental concept is, however, proving

troublesome when translated into cyberspace because the

fundamental notion of "making a copy" slides too easily in and out

of focus.  When you log into your firm's e-mail system, or onto

Lexis Counsel Connect or Prodigy or any other commercial online

service provider, or -- watch those metaphors! -- when you "move"

around the Internet to "visit" different sites in order to view the

material there on display, what really happens is that you are

sending a message to a remote computer requesting the transfer of

a file -- a file containing the list of all messages in your inbox, or a

recent comment posted on some discussion forum, or the latest

Supreme Court opinion or Microsoft's price list.  The file is them

transmitted back to your computer, loaded into memory, and

displayed.<p>



<p>



	Have you for legal purposes made a "copy" of the file that was sent

back to you?  From the average user's perspective, it may seem

most analogous to browsing through a hardcopy version of The

Firm.  The only difference, you might think, is that you are reading

on a computer screen instead of on paper.  But two courts -- the

Ninth Circuit in <i>MAI Sys. Corp., </i>991 F.2d 511 and the Eastern

District of Virginia in <i>Advanced Computer Services,</i> 845 F.Supp.

356 -- have in fact concluded that this transitory "fixation" of a

computer file in memory constitutes copying within the meaning of

the Copyright Act, and this view has been adopted by the

government's intellectual property working group.<p>



<p>



	If the very act of getting a document to your screen is considered

the "making of a copy" within the meaning of the Copyright Act,

then a high proportion of the millions of messages travelling over

the Internet each day potentially infringes on the right of some file

creator -- an "author" in copyright terms -- to control the making of

copies.  And, if the very act reading such documents on line

involves copying, then some form of a license -- permission from

the copyright holder -- would, in this view, be required for virtually

every one of those message transmissions.  <p>



<p>



	Of course, if I send an e-mail message that I have authored to a

friend, I have impliedly authorized my friend to copy the file into his

computer.  Likewise, if I pay whatever subscription fee is required

to view an online version of today's <i>Wall Street Journal, </i>Dow

Jones won't call me an infringer for readig its dispatches. But a legal

regime that requires you to prove that you have received specific

authorization for each of these commonplace acts lest you be

deemed an infringer is surely going to bog down in uncertainty (and

therefore endless litigation).  <p>



<p>



	What happens when I find an article in the <i>Journal </i>that is

particularly interesting, and post it to a Usenet discussion group on

the Internet?  In this view, not only am I infringing by re-transmitting this

material, but so too are all of the discussion group

participants, none of whom, after all, have received a license from

Dow Jones authorizing their "copying."  Are these people really

subject to the Copyright Act's statutory damage provisions?  Can

we possibly keep track of this endlessly complex trail of

"authorizations"?  <p>



<p>



	Under these decisions, cyberspace is not merely an environment

where widespread copyright infringement is possible: the medium

itself looks like little more than a colossal worldwide copying

engine.  These decisions cannot merely be dismissed as

idiosyncracies, however, because -- and herein lies our problem --

this file transfer does look a great deal like the kind of activity that

falls squarely within the copyright law's sights.  After all, once the

transfer is completed, where there was once one file, now there are

two, each indistinguishable from the other.  How different is that

from making a photocopy? <p>



<p>



	The question copyright law will have to settle is whether browsing

on the Internet is more akin to browsing at your local bookstore, or

is more analogous to surreptitiously placing a copy of Grisham's

novel on my Xerox machine or scanning its pages into my

computer's memory.<p>



<p>



	These two views of this most rudimentary question are

incompatible with one another, though each is perfectly logical, a

sure sign that a paradigm shift may be in order.  Copying remains a

means by which free-riders can appropriate the creative output of

others, and to that extent the law will seek to discourage it; but it is

also an indispensable component of a new form of communication

in a digital world, communication that can be smothered under a

mountain of ruinous and wasteful litigation if we are unable to

redesign our old bottles to fit the challenges of Senator Mathias'

"Era of Promiscuous Publication."

	Most people imagine the Supreme Court as an institution 
of robes, velvet curtains, and ceiling-high bookcases--a institution 
that sometimes seems bent on preserving vestiges of the Nineteenth Century.<P>

But within the court's walls, the electronic age is 
altering the way the court's work is done.  I'm not talking about Lexis or 
Westlaw, but something that sounds more mundane on the surface but which is 
probably more revolutionary over the long term: electronic mail.<P>

I got a glimpse of this last  year, when I clerked for 
Justice Ruth Bader Ginsberg. Several times each day a message would arrive 
from one of the other clerks over the court's internal e-mail system, of the 
&quot;Has anyone worked on a cert petition raising a Penry claim arising out of voluntary 
intoxication?&quot; variety. Usually, I had nothing to say in response to 
such queries, although sometimes I could pass along a purely &quot;informational&quot; 
reply (&quot;see Smith v. Texas, No. 93-1234, January 17th conference&quot;). 
If I was feeling more expansive, or if the subject were one in which I was particularly 
interested, or if I simply felt that I needed a break from my work, I might 
take a few minutes to compose a more thoughtful response (&quot;Forget voluntary 
intoxication as a basis for a Penry claim; take a look at the majority opinion 
in Johnson v. Texas, where the Court discussed the scope of Penry and . . 
.&quot;). And if I were interested in the question raised but couldn't then 
take the time away from whatever it was that I was then working on, I could 
always wait until I had a few minutes to spare, take a quick look at what had 
crossed the network, and add a few words if I felt that I had anything interesting 
to say.<P>

	Multiply by 40 people my experience there, and you 
have a pretty rich conversation going on, and one that is impossible to 
imagine in any other medium. The e-mail system became an indispensable part 
of day-to-day work at the court--one that, for me, and for many of the clerks, 
added immeasurably to the richness of the experience of working at the court. 
<P>

	What is it about electronic mail that arouses so much 
passion? Few people can work up much excitement about, say, their fax machines, 
or word processing software, or on-line legal research--even those who 
use them on a daily basis and could not imagine working without them. These are 
all handy tools to get the job done, sure, but not a whole lot more than that.<P>

	But electronic mail? Randomly select 50 acquaintances 
or colleagues of yours, put them in a room together, and start talking 
about e-mail. I can almost guarantee you that one of them, at least, will 
turn out to be not only a committed user but a true devotee, a convert to a new 
medium, someone who has &quot;gotten the bug.&quot;<P>

	Why this enthusiasm--exhilaration, even--about what 
is, after all, nothing more than a means of sending a message (or computer 
file) from one computer to another across a network? <P>

	Having used e-mail in three very different institutional 
contexts over the past couple of years--as an associate at a large law 
firm (Wilmer, Cutler &amp;amp; Pickering in Washington, D.C.), as a clerk at the Supreme 
Court, and as a member of the faculty at Georgetown University--I have 
seen that certain tasks can be accomplished more quickly and more efficiently 
using e-mail than with its main competitors in the workplace: handwritten or 
typed communication delivered by hand, mail, or fax machine, or verbal communication 
by telephone. Telephone tag, for example, which can be anything from a minor annoyance to a major headache, 
is virtually eliminated by the use of e-mail, as anyone who has ever tried to schedule 
a meeting among a dozen or so people can readily testify.<P>

	But while these efficiency gains are real and important, 
e-mail is much more than just a better and faster way to do the things 
(like scheduling meetings) that we've always done. Something deeper is 
at work here: a qualitative change in the way that information is shared 
within institutions and the way that collaborative work proceeds. It is 
these more fundamental effects that I believe are responsible for the intensity 
of the reaction of e-mail's adherents.<P>

	Take the experience at the Supreme Court, which illustrates 
how e-mail's special characteristics (SEE <A HREF="#sb">SIDEBAR</A>) can fundamentally 
alter the character of communication and work within institutions.<P>

telephone, at a meeting out of the <BR>
office, or home sick at the moment X <BR>
sends the message; Y can read the <BR>
message whenever he is ready. At the <BR>
moment Y reads the message, in most <BR>
e-mail systems an electronic &quot;receipt&quot; <BR>
can be returned to X, letting her <BR>
know when the message was opened --<BR>
and, perhaps more importantly, that <BR>
it had not been opened prior to that <BR>
time (a crucial feature for time-<BR>
sensitive information).<P>

	2. E-mail is a &quot;broadcast&quot; <BR>
	medium, allowing you to take a <BR>
	single message and send it to any <BR>
	number of recipients, e.g., the <BR>
	specific colleagues with whom you <BR>
	are working on a project, or all <BR>
	members of a pre-existing group, <BR>
	such as all law clerks, all <BR>
	members of the banking group, or <BR>
	all partners. <P>

	3. E-mail uniquely combines the <BR>
	immediacy of instantaneous <BR>
	transmission with a kind of <BR>
	nonintrusiveness, by giving the <BR>
	recipient of a message control <BR>
	over both the timing of the <BR>
	response and the duration of the <BR>
	interaction. A telephone call <BR>
	catches the recipient unawares, <BR>
	and implicitly announces &quot;I'm <BR>
	ready to talk to you about <BR>
	something, here's what it is, tell <BR>
	me -- right now -- --right now--<BR>
	what you think of what I am <BR>
	saying.&quot; E-mail, by contrast, <BR>
	allows recipients to spend as <BR>
	little, or as much, time thinking <BR>
	about and composing a response as <BR>
	they see fit.<P>

	4. Unlike most written <BR>
	communication, e-mail is <BR>
	perceived as an informal medium. <BR>
	Many people who labor mightily <BR>
	over their own written <BR>
	communications to strike just the <BR>
	&quot;right&quot; tone and to eliminate <BR>
all errors and possible ambiguities <BR>
-- --and who therefore often avoid <BR>
written communication unless it <BR>
is absolutely required -- think--<BR>
think nothing of dashing off an <BR>
e-mail with typographical mistakes, <BR>
sentence fragments, and the like <BR>
in response to a colleagues' <BR>
question or comment.<P>

<P>

	The process of scanning queries and posting one's thoughts 
undoubtedly saved prodigious amounts of time by allowing you to 
tap into the knowledge and experience that your colleagues carry around in their 
heads (the &quot;wetware&quot; database), which greatly enriches the information you 
can bring to bear on any particular problem. And in my experience, the value 
of the information obtained always outweighed the relatively trivial costs incurred 
to obtain it. <P>

	But there was great value in this process that had 
nothing to do with the amount of time saved. Instead of seeing &quot;nine little 
law firms&quot; at the court, everyone--even non-participants watching the discussions 
flow across the network--begins to perceive the outlines of a single 
collegial institution. Each reply that circulated--especially the many that 
began with the equivalent of &quot;Funny you should ask; I've been thinking about 
this question too, and . . .&quot;--subtly and even subconsciously reinforced a 
notion that is easy to lose sight of in any large institution: that we're all in 
this thing together, participating in a single organizational endeavor with 
at least some common goals and purposes.<P>

	People have many reasons for participating in this 
kind of electronic dialogue (or multi-logue?): a sincere desire to be helpful 
to others, a little egotism, perhaps, or the knowledge that you will need 
a reciprocal helping hand yourself at some point in the future. Most important 
is something simpler, I think: Many of us simply enjoy this kind of informal 
conversation with our colleagues. It is the &quot;virtual water cooler,&quot; 
an electronic gathering of your coworkers conversing about questions of mutual interest. 
Indeed, this kind of contact helps to define our coworkers as colleagues, 
helping to set a tone of collegiality that can be difficult to achieve in any 
other way, given the stresses and often overwhelming time constraints in 
the modern workplace.<P>

	At Wilmer, Cutler, too, a similar kind of firmwide 
query was common, with questions such as: &quot;Has anyone had any experience 
arguing before Judge X?&quot;; &quot;Does anybody know anything about Virginia's new 
limited liability company statute?&quot;; &quot;Does anyone have a good model 
escrow agreement I can look at?&quot; As at the court, a wealth of useful information was uncovered 
in this way.<P>

	But here too, much more than efficient information-gathering 
was taking place. For example, in connection with a negotiation 
training session a colleague and I were planning, we broadcast a message 
outlining a &quot;prisoner's dilemma&quot; situation and asking anyone interested 
to give us their views on the &quot;correct&quot; strategy. We were inundated with 
dozens of replies, all from extremely busy people who nonetheless were interested 
enough in the problem to spend a few minutes thinking about it and putting a 
paragraph together. In fact, a spirited debate ensued for several days -- --so 
much so that we ended up scheduling a lunch where people could discuss the 
issues raised face-to-face and in &quot;real time.&quot;<P>

	This may seem like a small, even trivial, incident 
-- --but given the paucity of opportunities to engage intellectually with 
most of your coworkers at a large law firm, it was anything but. Opportunities 
to make this kind of contact with colleagues are becoming scarcer as institutions 
become larger and more dispersed and the pressures of the profession intensify, 
but it is through these contacts that an institution becomes more than 
simply a collection of individuals who happen to be sitting in the same building 
or getting their paycheck from the same source. E-mail has a unique power 
to connect people together by allowing a running dialogue in which all 
can participate when and only when they choose, at their own pace, in their own 
fashion--all without taking more than a couple of minutes from the more &quot;serious&quot; 
tasks in which they are engaged.  It's a lot of bang for a relatively 
small buck.<P>

	Several years ago, a woman who worked in the accounting 
department at Wilmer, Cutler, having heard that I was something of 
an opera fanatic, came into my office to talk about music. She had just heard 
her first opera, and was bursting with excitement. After we talked for a while, 
I became almost envious--that she had all of this wonderful music to 
look forward to, that she had yet to experience the exquisite thrill of hearing 
La Boheme, and Rosenkavalier, and Otello, etc. for the first time. 
As one who has gotten the e-mail bug, I feel much the same way when I meet people 
who have not yet been &quot;e-mail enabled&quot;--you've got something very 
interesting indeed to look forward to.<P>

Plugging In - September 1995</H3><P>

&quot;Vicarious liability.&quot;  Few phrases -- &quot;disgruntled 
former employee,&quot; perhaps, or &quot;leaking underground 
storage tank&quot; -- are as frightening to business 
owners and operators.  The notion that one may be responsible 
for the wrongful action of others, of course, is almost 
as old as the common law itself, embodied in such time-honored 
concepts as <I>respondeat superior</I> and the doctrine of 
criminal conspiracy.  But in cyberspace, at least, 
it hardly resides in a legal backwater; the question 
of vicarious liability has emerged as one of the most 
contentious of all issues facing those responsible 
for formulating the new rules that will govern in this 
new environment.<p>
 <BLOCKQUOTE>
&quot;The end of [the stock brokerage firm] Stratton 
Oakmont will finally come this week.  This brokerage 
firm headed by president and soon to be proven criminal 
-- Daniel Porrush-- will close this week . . . [Stratton 
is] a cult of brokers who either lie for a living or 
get fired. [Stratton's handling of a recent initial 
public offering] was fraud, fraud, fraud and criminal!!!!!!!&quot; 
         </BLOCKQUOTE><P>

When this message appeared last October on &quot;Money 
Talk,&quot; an online discussion forum on the Prodigy 
electronic network, it ignited the latest battle in 
this ongoing war over the proper scope of liability 
rules in cyberspace.  Stratton Oakmont, understandably 
displeased by the above posting, has filed a libel 
action in New York state court, seeking $200 million 
in damages, naming Prodigy itself as a defendant.  
Should Prodigy, as the owner of the network on which 
this comment appeared, be held legally responsible 
for the content of this posting?<P>

It is not difficult to see why the issue of vicarious 
liability will be a central bone of contention in the 
law of cyberspace.  As I have noted in earlier columns, 
the nature of electronic communications--the ease, 
for example, with which individuals can disguise their 
identity and act pseudonymously or anonymously, or 
the difficulty (or virtual impossibility, in many cases) 
of tracing individual messages to their source because 
of the decentralized nature of the global Internet--will 
make it difficult to rely on actions against individual 
wrongdoers--whether such actions are initiated by law 
enforcement officials or by private civil litigants--for 
the enforcement of legal norms.  It is inevitable that 
those seeking to enforce laws regarding, say, copyright 
infringement, libel, obscenity, or virtually anything 
else online will, given the difficulty of identifying 
and tracking down individual malfeasants, find it far 
easier to target the entities that provide access to 
the medium itself; in many cases, it may be vicarious 
liability or no liability at all. <P>

Indeed, the Prodigy case illustrates this point well. 
 The plaintiffs have been unable to identify the individual 
who authored the offending posting; the owner of the 
account that was used to place the message into the 
discussion forum has denied any knowledge of the message 
reproduced above, and has claimed that someone was 
using his account without authorization.  Stratton 
Oakmont is unlikely to get redress from the John Doe 
defendants it has named in its lawsuit.<P>

The general rule regarding vicarious liability for the 
publication of defamatory material is that &quot;publishers&quot; 
are strictly liable for defamatory content in material 
they publish; mere &quot;distributors,&quot; on the 
other hand, cannot be liable for defamatory content 
unless they &quot;knew or had reason to know&quot; 
of that content.  Thus, if defamatory material appears 
in one of my columns, for example, the American Lawyer 
will be held liable, on the grounds that its exercise 
of editorial control gives it both the opportunity 
to screen material prior to distribution and leads 
readers to conclude that it stands behind whatever 
it does choose to publish.  No such liability will, 
however, be imposed on the newsstand vendor or bookseller 
from whom a reader may have bought his or her copy 
of the magazine; they are not expected to exercise 
the same degree of editorial control and judgment over 
the material in all of the magazines they distribute.<P>

So when Stratton moved for summary judgment on the question 
of Prodigy's liability, the question before Judge Stuart 
Ain of the New York State Supreme Court was: does Prodigy 
more closely resemble a bookseller, in which case Stratton's 
claim against it must be dismissed, or a newspaper?
<P> 
 The latter, Judge Ain declared: Prodigy &quot;exercise[d] 
sufficient editorial control over its computer bulletin 
boards to render it a publisher with the same responsibilities 
as a newspaper.&quot;  

<!--could insert a link to nY State opinions dadtabase on www-->
(Judge Ain's opinion is available, 
for those interested, at  1995 N.Y. Misc. LEXIS 229). 
<!---->

 As evidence of the kind of editorial control he had 
in mind, Judge Ain noted that Prodigy held itself out 
as a &quot;family  oriented computer network,&quot; 
and had promulgated &quot;content guidelines&quot; 
in which users were advised that &quot;notes that harass 
other members or are deemed to be in bad taste or grossly 
repugnant to community standards, or are deemed harmful 
to maintaining a  harmonious online community, will 
be removed when brought to Prodigy's attention.&quot; 
<P>
 Prodigy also used a special software screening program 
that automatically prescreened all bulletin board postings 
for offensive language (e.g., the well-known <A HREF="http://www.dcez.com/%7Ealewine/cda96/fcctop.html">&quot;Seven 
Dirty Words&quot; of FCC v. Pacifica</A> fame), and hired 
forum moderators whose duties included enforcement 
of the content guidelines and who were empowered to 
delete offending messages after they appeared.<P>

Prodigy, it should be noted, vigorously challenges not 
only the legal conclusion that Judge Ain drew but the 
facts on which it was based; in particular, it claims 
that it had ceased pre-screening messages months before 
the offending posting appeared.  But suppose Prodigy 
did take the steps attributed to it; should vicarious 
liability follow? One can certainly argue that the 
general rule was misapplied in this instance; it cannot 
possibly be the law that a bookstore that decides to 
be &quot;family&quot; oriented and to sell only books 
that contain no pornographic or indecent material (and 
boasts of that policy in its ads) suddenly becomes 
a &quot;publisher&quot; under this rule, liable for 
any defamatory statements contained in the books that 
it does sell.<P>

But more interesting, from my perspective, than the 
application of these concepts to the facts of this 
particular case is the use of these legal principles, 
principles that may make little sense when applied 
to the new medium of online bulletin boards, in the 
first place.  Common law adjudication is inherently 
conservative because it must analyze new phenomena 
using existing metaphors and pigeonholes-- such as 
&quot;booksellers&quot; and &quot;newspapers.&quot;
<P> 
 Most of the time this imperfect system works reasonably, 
perhaps even remarkably, well, because new phenomena 
are usually not really so new at all.  But in the face 
of real qualitative change the system's flaws are magnified.
<P> 
 Prodigy is neither a bookseller nor a newspaper, because 
online discussion forums are unlike any communication 
medium we've seen before; never before have hundreds 
of thousands of individuals been able, instantaneously 
and in &quot;real-time,&quot; to distribute their message 
to hundreds of thousands of other individuals, never 
before have individuals been both consumers and suppliers 
of information content to a mass market in quite this 
way.  Notions of  &quot;control&quot; and &quot;editorial 
judgment,&quot; developed and previously applied only 
in a non-interactive &quot;one-to-many&quot; context 
of newspapers and books, will not translate easily 
to this &quot;many-to-many&quot; real-time medium. 
 <P>
In the one-to-many context of newspaper, magazine, or 
book publishing, there is a moment--when the press 
run begins--when the work is fixed and declared ready 
to be sent out into the world; it is neither unreasonable 
nor impractical to require that those who make the 
decision to turn the presses on verify the accuracy 
of what they are printing prior to taking this final 
step.  There is no equivalent moment in the world of 
the online discussion.  It is preposterous to require 
Prodigy to verify the accuracy of the comments that 
appear on its bulletin boards, not only because the 
enormous volume of material that appears there makes 
it impossible to assert the kind of &quot;editorial 
control&quot; that would be necessary to prevent even 
a fraction of the possible libelous statements that 
could be made over any given period of time, but also 
because the assertion of such control would render 
these forums useless for the purposes for which they 
are designed and because of which people find them 
so attractive -- spontaneous, real-time communication. 
Perhaps if Judge Ain had spent more time online this 
point would have been clearer to him, for I am willing 
to wager a year's salary that <I>nobody participating 
on Prodigy's Money Talk forum believed that Prodigy 
had endorsed, adopted, or was otherwise associated 
in any way with any of the comments appearing there.</I><P>

One needs no crystal ball to predict the consequences 
of the rule of this case (if it is sustained on appeal); 
online service providers, facing potentially crushing 
liability if they exercise any supervisory role at 
all, will abandon attempts to do so, and their discussion 
groups will all look like the unmoderated, free-for-all 
sessions of the Internet newsgroups.  There's nothing 
inherently wrong with those discussions--but why deny 
people the option of participating in groups where 
other rules apply?  The beauty of cyberspace is that 
space is unlimited; those that seek no-holds-barred 
discussions can find them, while those looking for 
a tamer, and perhaps more civilized, form of discourse 
can find that, too.  The law does us no favors when 
it strips that option away from us in the name of vicarious 
liability.<P>

<P>
Plugging In, October 1995<BR>
Draft September 6, 1995<P>

Consider the following fairly random observations from 
the information frontier:<P>

  Nowadays, when my call to the local pizza delivery 
service is answered, before I say anything more than 
&quot;Hello&quot; the dispatcher at the other end indicates 
that he knows not only my name and address and the 
short-cut route to my house, but my family's preference 
for deep dish pepperoni as well.  <P>

 Microsoft's new Windows '95 operating system contains 
an online registration procedure -- no more postcards 
to fill out -- that will initiate a scan of your hard 
disk and communicate information regarding the programs 
you currently have installed to Microsoft. <P>

 The New York Times recently reported on Europe's fastest-growing 
bank, the UK's First Direct, that has no physical branch 
offices at all, and whose sophisticated information 
processing technology allows &quot;tellers&quot; to 
pull up a vast array of information about customers 
at the touch of a button when the customer phones in; 
&quot;I see you've paid off your balance on our competitor's 
credit card; did you know that First Direct charges 
a lower percentage rate on its card, Mr. Jones?&quot;<P>

It is all a bit unnerving, to say the least.  We already 
live in a world where people are deeply concerned about 
intrusions into what they regard as their &quot;private&quot; 
sphere of information. A 1994 Harris poll revealed 
that 78% of Americans believe that &quot;consumers 
have lost all control over how companies use their 
personal information, and 70% have refused to reveal 
personal information on request because they felt it 
was not needed or was too personal (up from 42% in 
a comparable 1990 survey). <P>

And, it is safe to say, you ain't seen nothin' yet. 
 Our notions of information privacy -- an individual's 
claim to control the terms under which personal information 
is acquired, disclosed, and used -- are in the process 
of being stretched out of all recognizable shape as 
we confront new and previously unimagined ways to acquire 
and use personal information.<P>

For one thing, vast (and increasing) amounts of personal 
information are available in electronic form, and the 
existence of high speed network connections and sophisticated 
database software allow this information to be pulled 
together and processed in ways that could not have 
been accomplished a short time ago. In the words of 
the final report issued by the Privacy Working Group 
of the federal government's Information Infrastructure 
Task Force, in the &quot;old days,&quot; before these 
information processing capabilities had developed, 
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
&quot;in order to build a profile of an individual who 
had lived in various states, one would have to travel 
from state to state and search public records for information 
about the individual. This process would have required 
filling out forms, paying fees, and waiting in line 
for record searches at local, state, and federal agencies, 
such as the departments of motor vehicles, deed record 
offices, electoral commissions, and county record offices. 
Although one could manually compile a personal profile 
in this manner, it would be a time-consuming and costly 
exercise, one that would not be undertaken unless the 
offsetting rewards were considerable. In sharp contrast, 
today, as more and more personal information appears 
on-line, such a profile can be built in a matter of 
minutes, at minimal cost.&quot;</BLOCKQUOTE><P>

And as troubling as the ease with which personal dossiers 
of existing information can be compiled may be, the 
examples above illustrate a different kind of threat 
to personal privacy: whole new categories of information 
can be created by collecting and analyzing what might 
be called the &quot;transactional breadcrumbs&quot; 
that mark our trail through cyberspace, the electronic 
records of where we've been, what we did, what we bought 
(or didn't buy), and who we communicated with.  In 
theory, such information could have been collected 
in the past, but only at enormous cost: hiring a private 
detective, say, to follow me around and record the 
transactions I entered into, the encounters I had with 
others, the purchases I made, etc.  But as we conduct 
more and more of our business and personal activities 
via electronic media -- purchasing goods and services 
through the World Wide Web, communicating with business 
associates, friends, and colleagues via electronic 
mail, etc. -- every move we make leaves an electronic 
trail.  As a result, those transitory (and, individually, 
rather insignificant) breadcrumbs can be converted 
into permanent records that, when combined with innumerable 
other such records, can form a detailed profile of 
who we are -- the persons or organizations to whom 
we send messages, the discussion groups in which we 
participate, the sites on the Internet that we have 
visited (and the amount of time we spent at each), 
the goods we have ordered (and those we have looked 
at and chosen not to order), and the like.<P>

Unlike other areas of the law--for example, intellectual 
property law, or defamation and libel law-- there appears 
to be widespread agreement that these potential impacts 
on personal privacy are so serious, and so unlike anything 
we have seen before, that some substantial re-conceptualization 
of the relevant legal principles will be required. 
 Currently, American law, responding to perceived threats 
to personal privacy posed by government record keeping, 
has erected an array of protections against unreasonable 
government action in this area: the Privacy Act of 
1974, and the Computer Matching and Privacy Protection 
Act of 1988, restricting (at least somewhat) the federal 
government's ability to collect unnecessary personal 
information, to combine individual pieces of personal 
information into more inclusive dossiers, or to disclose 
such information to third parties, being the most noteworthy 
examples.  <P>

But Big Brother, should he or it arrive, may not be 
wearing a government uniform; <I>private </I>action in regard 
to the compilation and use of transactional records 
may well prove an equal or more powerful threat to 
personal privacy than government action, and is (in 
this country at least) largely unregulated. At least 
as far as federal law is concerned, we have followed 
a piecemeal approach to these issues, tackling one 
individual category of information at a time (in statutes 
such as the Fair Credit Reporting Act of 1970 (credit 
records), the Video Privacy Protection Act of 1988 
(the &quot;Bork&quot; bill dealing with video rental 
records), the Family Education Rights and Privacy Act 
of 1974 (educational records), the Employee Polygraph 
Protection Act of 1988 (employee polygraph records), 
and similar statutory schemes) without an overarching 
framework for the treatment of personal transactional 
records more generally.  <P>

Interestingly, the Europeans are proceeding far more 
aggressively in this area. Many EC countries (including 
France, Germany, and the UK) already have broad statutes 
providing general privacy rights applicable to both 
public and private sectors, and European Parliament 
now has before it a proposed &quot;Directive on the 
Protection of Individuals with Regard to the Processing 
of Personal Data and on the Free Movement of Such Data&quot; 
under which EC member states will be required to enact 
laws providing that &quot;personal data&quot; -- &quot;any 
information relating to an identified or identifiable 
natural person&quot; -- can only be collected &quot;for 
specified, explicit and legitimate purposes&quot; and 
only processed with the &quot;unambiguous&quot; consent 
of the subject.  And the Directive also contains a 
provision, regarded with admiration by privacy advocates 
and horror by those in the data processing industry, 
requiring EC member states to prohibit the transfer 
of personal data to any country that does not &quot;ensure 
an adequate level of protection for the data&quot; 
(a category that may, at present, include the United 
States).<P>

It is far too early in the process to tell whether the 
US is likely to follow the Europeans' lead here.  The 
aforementioned report by the federal government's Privacy 
Working Group (available, for those of you with World 
Wide Web access, at http:\\ntia.doc.gov) takes a cautious 
and measured approach, recommending no new legislative 
initiatives but instead seeking to define a series 
of &quot;Principles for Providing and Using Personal 
Information&quot; to guide the development of private 
sector and government programs that use personal information, 
a kind of code of fair information practices for private 
and governmental actors alike.  It may indeed, as the 
Report suggests, be too early to venture in any more 
ambitious direction, for while the Report's fundamental 
principle of information privacy -- that&quot;personal 
information should be acquired, disclosed, and used 
only in ways that respect an individual's reasonable 
expectation of privacy&quot; -- is surely an appropriate 
starting point, until we have all spent more time in 
this new electronic environment, who can say what our 
expectations really are (let alone whether they are 
reasonable)?<P>

Draft October 5, 1995<br>
Plugging In - November 1995</H3>
<P>

I assume that even the technophobes among my readers 
are familiar with online full-text searching for legal 
precedent, and would admit, however grudgingly, that 
this system represents at least something of an advance 
over previously-available methods, and that it has 
transformed legal practice (just as the development 
of the previously dominant method, the West Digest 
system, represented a profound advance over prior solutions 
to this information gathering problem and itself helped 
to transform American law).<P>

If you do not actively partake of the pleasures on online 
searching, however, you may not be aware of the availability 
of a rather remarkable tool: &quot;natural language&quot; 
search engines which the commercial database providers 
(e.g., Lexis and Westlaw) have implemented in recent 
years.  Natural language searching allows you to use, 
as your search query, an English sentence describing 
your problem, to which the search program applies a 
kind of &quot;fuzzy logic&quot; to determine the cases 
or other documents most likely to be relevant to your 
question (which are then presented to you in order 
of decreasing assumed relevance).  For example, if 
you want to know &quot;Does the Interstate Commerce 
Clause prohibit a State from imposing a &euml;Use Tax' 
on Out-of-State Purchases,&quot; you simply type the 
phrase in as written, and your search retrieves a set 
of cases that the search algorithms has determined 
are most relevant to the question -- in this example, 
cases such as <I>Minneapolis Star &amp; Tribune Co. v. 
Minnesota Commissioner of Revenue,</I> 460 U.S. 575, <I>Associated 
Industries of Missouri v. Lohman, Director of Revenue 
of Missouri, </I>114 S. Ct. 1815, and the like.<P>

But if this technology is so smart, I wondered, perhaps 
it can really help us plumb the darker, more mysterious, 
more inscrutable questions that have long pre-occupied 
philosophers and poets.  Inspired by the recent fanfare 
surrounding the opening of the Rock and Roll Hall of 
Fame, I decided to put the technology to the ultimate 
test--to see if it could help us glimpse how the US 
Supreme Court has been grappling with the truly profound 
issues of our time. <P>

For example, can we look to the Court for guidance in 
understanding how many roads must a man walk down, 
before you call him a man?  Indeed we can.  Running 
this search on the Supreme Court database using both 
Lexis' &quot;Freestyle&quot; and Westlaw's &quot;Westlaw 
is Natural&quot; features--and, as Dave Barry likes 
to say, I am <I>not</I> making this up--I realized that the 
Court has considered this question on a number of occasions. 
 Lexis pointed me immediately to <I>Dred Scott v. Sandford, 
</I>60 US 393, discerning in over 100 pages of dense legalese 
the true holding of the case: States cannot call certain 
men &quot;men&quot; irrespective of the number of roads 
they may have walked down.  (Lexis also pointed me 
towards the <I>Telephone Cases, </I>126 US 1, apparently interpreting 
my question as one asking whether the monopoly granted 
to AT&amp;T impermissibly interferes with the right 
to actually &quot;call&quot; such a man a man).  Interestingly, 
Westlaw directed me in a different, though equally 
fruitful, direction; the first case presented for my 
consideration was <I>Terry v. Ohio</I>, 392 US 1-- a reference, 
of course, to its holding that the number of roads 
that a man may walk down is subject to limitations 
based upon the reasonable suspicions of law-enforcement 
personnel.  Mr. Dylan, I would assume, will be gratified 
to learn that this question has been put to rest.<P>

Emboldened by the success of this initial attempt, I 
decided to press on.  Who, in fact, wrote the Book 
of Love?  The Court's teachings here are somewhat more 
controversial.  The highest relevancy ranking on this 
query was obtained by <I>A Book Named &euml;John Cleland's 
Memoirs of a Woman of Pleasure' et al. v. Atty. General 
of Massachusetts</I>, 383 US 413, an indication, perhaps, 
of both the Court's rather narrow view of the meaning 
of &quot;love,&quot; and the precarious position of 
the Book of Love within the First Amendment.  Book 
of Love authorship was also addressed in <I>Ginzburg v. 
US</I>, where the editor of Eros magazine was unsuccessful 
in his attempt to persuade the Court that his particular 
publication qualifies for Book of Love status.<P>

But why, then, do fools fall in love?  This question 
has apparently never been squarely presented to the 
Court, although cf. <I>Jenkins v. Georgia, </I>418 US 153 
(&quot;community standards&quot; should be applied 
to this question) and <I>Shearson/American Express et 
al. V. McMahon, </I>482 US 220, 253 (at least as far as 
Securities Act is concerned, &quot;Congress did not 
take away from the citizen 'his inalienable right to 
make a  fool  of himself,'  it simply attempted to 
prevent others from making a fool of him,&quot; quoting 
L. Loss, Fundamentals of Securities Regulation 36 (1983)). 
 Do you wanna dance under the moonlight?  See <I>Barnes 
v. Glen Theatre</I>, Inc., 401 US 560 (holding that should 
you choose to engage in such activity, it will be considered 
expressive conduct &quot;within the outer perimeters 
of the First Amendment&quot;).  <P>

&quot;Is there a song in my heart?&quot; unearthed a 
particularly interesting trove of material, from the 
obvious (<I>Campbell v. Acuff-Rose, 114 S.CT.. 1164, </I>the 
&quot;2 Live Crew&quot; case, holding that the fair 
use privilege may apply if the song in your heart is 
a parody of earlier copyrighted efforts) to the intriguing 
(<I>Wallace v. Jaffree, </I>472 US 38, the &quot;moment of 
silence&quot; case, holding that if the song in your 
heart is of a religious character, the State may not, 
consistent with the Establishment Clause, require you 
to sing it, even to yourself), to the deeply mysterious 
<I>(Hurley v. Irish-American Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual 
Group of Boston</I>, 115 S.CT.. 2338, holding [?] that 
the organizers of the St. Patrick's Day parade may 
choose to prohibit the singing of certain songs but 
may not exclude individuals who hold particular songs 
exclusively in their heart). <P>

And finally -- entering the query  &quot;what is the 
meaning of life?&quot; pulled up, appropriately enough, 
both <I>Furman v. Georgia</I>, 408 US 238 (holding the death 
penalty unconstitutional), and <I>Planned Parenthood of 
Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey</I>, 112 S.CT.. 2791 
(upholding the constitutional right to abortion) -- 
which, when you think about it, may indeed represent 
the closest that the Court has ever come to thinking 
about this question (though whether the Court has answered 
the question, and what that answer might be, I leave 
for others to determine)..<P>

There may actually be serious issues lurking behind 
all of this: new forms of search technology undoubtedly, 
over time, influence the way the law develops and the 
way that it is understood, by bringing certain materials 
to the fore (and making other materials harder to unearth. 
 The West Key Number system, for example, is an almost 
Platonic conception of ideal legal categories, and 
was at least partially self-perpetuating inasmuch as 
the decision to file a case under one category necessarily 
made it more likely that it would be cited as precedent 
for a one set of questions while simultaneously making 
whatever light it might shed on other legal questions 
-- light that the indexers in Minneapolis may not have 
been able to detect -- far harder to uncover.  As natural 
language searching becomes more widespread, might we 
not want to know more about the underlying technologies, 
at least to enable us to assess the ability of these 
tools to find truly &quot;relevant&quot; material?<P>

But let's leave the serious questions for another day. 
 For now, I hope it is enough to have given you ammunition 
the next time your teenager has the temerity to suggest 
that you are not working on anything really interesting 
or, like, really important. <P>

<H3>David Post<br>
&quot;Plugging In&quot; -- April 1995<BR>
Draft Dated March 6, 1995</H3><P>

So, you're all set up in your new technological wonderland: 
you can process words with the best of 'em, your e-mail 
connections with colleagues and clients are in place 
and working smoothly, your calendar and rolodex are 
installed and running on your electronic desktop, your 
new fax board lets you send documents straight from 
your computer anywhere in the world, and all of the 
deposition transcripts in that big case you're working 
on have been loaded onto your hard drive and are searchable 
at the click of your mouse.  Now that your work is 
so streamlined and efficient, isn't it a pleasure to 
think about what you will do with all of your free 
time?<p>
Hardly.  Whatever else the information revolution has 
wrought, shortening the work week, or relieving the 
stress of the workplace, are not among its accomplishments. 
 <p>
Edward Tenner, in a wonderful article in Harvard Magazine 
several years ago, called this the &quot;revenge effect,&quot; 
technology's tendency to turn on its masters and recomplicate 
our lives.  Sure, many tasks are easier than ever before 
-- indeed we now routinely perform tasks that prior 
generations of lawyers would have deemed impossible. 
 But somehow the bar keeps inching upward; with so 
much more that we <EM>can</EM> do in terms of innovative and 
useful information manipulation, our expectations of 
what we <EM>should</EM> do seem always to outpace our expanding 
abilities.<p>
The symptoms of this maddening and perverse syndrome 
are everywhere.  Word processing lets you edit your 
documents more easily?  So now you print 15 drafts 
of every filing, and are always tempted to make just 
one more change as deadlines approach.  Checking your 
incoming messages, once the simplest of tasks, now 
requires logging into and reading your e-mail, checking 
your voicemail box, calling your home answering machine, 
and checking the fax machine down the hall -- all in 
addition to the old-fashioned trip to your secretary's 
station.  SEC filings, Hart-Scott-Rodino papers, Dun 
&amp; Bradstreet reports, all  available at the touch 
of a button?  Terrific -- now your client expects you 
to have them all printed out (with copies, please) 
and summarized for that meeting this afternoon.  Your 
litigation support vendor gushes about its ability 
to search the Jones v. XYZ file and find every scrap 
of paper with Ms. Jones' name anywhere on it in preparation 
for the Jones deposition -- which sounds a lot more 
attractive before you're confronted with the pile of 
documents and realize that now you're expected to have 
read all of this stuff before the questioning begins. 
<p>
This is all just another illustration of the Law of 
Unanticipated Consequences. Technology has, to be sure, 
changed the face of legal practice -- but it has done 
so, and will probably continue to do so, in unexpected 
ways.  (A cautionary warning for anyone writing a column 
about what this all may portend for the future!)
<p>
Most of us probably thought that the impact of technology 
adoption in institutions like law firms would run something 
like this: technological advances will eliminate (or 
at least reduce) the role of &quot;support staff&quot; 
performing the routinized, relatively ministerial chores 
that keep the firms humming along day-to-day -- everything 
from keeping track of accounts receivable to document 
filing to message taking -- leaving those higher up 
the information food chain free(r) to exercise their 
higher-order information-processing skills.  
<p>
This model may well have made some sense during &quot;Phase 
1&quot; of law office automation -- the automation 
of back-office functions such as billing, accounting, 
and payroll.  But now the trend line seems to be pointing 
in the opposite direction.  A number of surveys (by 
the ABA, the Department of Labor, Altman Weil Pensa, 
and others) have indicated, for example, that associates 
and legal assistants are increasingly competing for 
scarce work within firms, and that the former are slowly 
being displaced by the latter.  Client pressure regarding 
fees is, to be sure, probably primarily responsible 
for this development.  But this may also reflect in 
some measure a more fundamental shift to increasing 
dependence on support staff as more firms more to Phase 
2 of the automation process, wherein information-processing 
tools become more deeply integrated into the work that 
their lawyers are doing.
<p>
Take, for instance, the case of the local area networks 
(LANs) springing up in most mid- to large-sized firms 
(and in many smaller firms as well).  If viewed as 
nothing more than glorified filing cabinets for electronic 
documents, LANs should all but eliminate the need for 
armies of file clerks to keep track of firm documents. 
 <p>
But electronic document storage and retrieval is so 
much more powerful than its paper-based analogue that 
we are not -- and should not be -- content merely with 
replicating those tasks that we could perform in an 
earlier era.  A LAN, if properly configured and maintained, 
can be an important strategic resource, allowing work 
product to be shared across the firm and re-used for 
multiple applications.  Maintaining a LAN for that 
purpose, however, is a sophisticated information-management 
task, hardly a job for a file clerk (even a glorified 
one); the many technical decisions required to make 
good use of this investment must be made with an eye 
towards understanding the ways in which information 
is going to be used across the firm.  Should practice 
groups have their own document databases?  Should keyword 
abstracts be prepared for all, or some subset of, documents? 
 Should all drafts be saved, or only final versions 
of documents?  Must intra-firm &quot;Chinese Walls&quot; 
be reflected in the databases?  Should select documents 
be annotated by their authors to increase their usability 
by others?  Should clients or others outside of the 
firm be given access to some subset of the documents? 
 &quot;Database design&quot; becomes too important 
to leave to someone who is not intimately familiar 
with broader questions of firm practice and policy 
regarding its core information-processing functions.
<p>
Or consider the kind of &quot;support&quot; required 
to help manage the thousands, or hundreds of thousands, 
of documents in the context of complex multi-party 
litigation.  A document database need not do more than 
replicate a relatively simple index of the kind that 
one might have prepared 20 years ago. 
 <p>
This traditional model, however, does little to exploit 
the technology's potential for enhancing the way that 
lawyers perform the myriad levels of review required 
in a typical case (e.g., privilege review of client 
files, substantive review for interrogatory responses, 
review for deposition preparation, etc.).  Because 
the new technologies, such as electronic imaging and 
more powerful full-text search programs, are capable 
of so much more, there is, inevitably, pressure to 
effect a more profound transformation of these processes; 
indeed, the enormous upfront investment in equipment 
and expertise required to utilize the new technologies 
at all may hardly be cost-justified if nothing more 
than replication of existing work habits is involved. 
 Should documents be automatically &quot;tagged&quot; 
to record who reviewed them, when, and for what purpose? 
 Should reviewers' annotations be entered into a database 
for later retrieval?  Will handwritten marginalia be 
searchable electronically?  Will &quot;issue coding&quot; 
of the documents be sufficiently flexible to allow 
reorganization of the database as the complexion of 
the case changes over time?  Will lawyers be able to 
search the entire database and pull up relevant documents 
for printing -- all from their own workstations?
<p>
Designing a litigation support system that incorporates 
any or all of these features, and managing operation 
of such a system in the high stakes and high pressure 
litigation context, however, are enormously complex 
undertakings, and the role of managing the document 
flow in this context requires both far more technical 
sophistication than most lawyers possess and a far 
greater understanding of the litigation and lawyering 
process than most systems analysts or database designers 
possess.  
<p>
In this environment, the necessary &quot;support&quot; 
can no longer be provided by a relatively unskilled, 
fungible army of low paid legal assistants whose main 
task is to keep boxes of documents organized and available 
for processing by the lawyers involved, and a role 
for a new kind of &quot;information manager&quot; will 
have to evolve if these tasks are going to be efficiently 
performed.  This in turn may put increasing stress 
on the hierarchical organization of most law firms, 
with their clearly defined lines of authority (not 
to mention status and salary) between attorneys and 
support staff.  Many lawyers are, and will continue 
to be, made uncomfortable -- and may feel downright 
threatened -- by these developments, by the degree 
of control over the litigation process that will now 
be placed in the hands of non-lawyers, and by the demands 
of these non-lawyers to be treated (and, increasingly, 
compensated) as professionals.  But only those the 
firms that can manage to attract and integrate these 
new and highly specialized skills into their mix will 
be the ones who successfully manage the transition 
to the increasingly automated workplace and who manage 
to more effectively utilize the newly available tools 
to supply their clients with higher quality value-added 
services.<P>

<H3>David Post<br>
Plugging In, June 1995
</H3>
<P>
<P>

Several years ago, when I was an associate at Wilmer, 
Cutler &amp; Pickering, I went to the firm's management 
committee with the following proposal:  Look, I said, 
I know that my billable hours are falling into that 
'gray zone' where I'm barely covering my costs; but 
I'm not, to be frank, real interested in working a 
lot harder than I am now. My clients, and the other 
lawyers with whom I'm working, are all very happy about 
the work I do. How about we try to do something on 
the cost side?  I'm just a voice (or a stream of bits) 
at the end of a telephone/fax/modem line to my clients 
as it stands; let's try an experiment, whereby I'll 
work out of my basement (thereby saving the firm all 
sorts of overhead costs) as a &quot;virtual associate&quot;? 
 <P>

Now, it so happens that this proposal was mooted by 
subsequent events and was never acted upon, up or down, 
by the firm. But most interesting, for me, was the 
reaction to this idea of a certain partner -- a good 
colleague and friend -- who came to my office and asked, 
in an exasperated tone, &quot;Once we start to do this 
sort of thing, well, what's the point of this building, 
these secretaries -- what's the point of having a firm 
at all?&quot; <P>

It was meant, I'm certain, as a rhetorical question: 
this can't be a very good idea, because if it were, 
why do we still look around and still see all of these 
(successful) law firms out there?  But it is a question 
that I suspect many others are going to start asking 
-- less and less rhetorically -- as time passes and 
the new communications and computer technologies permeate 
more widely through the profession. Why, indeed, do 
we have law firms?  Why do individual lawyers find 
it in their interest to associate together in (more-or-less) 
stable groups?  And how might these new technologies 
have an impact on the balance between centripetal and 
centrifugal forces that help keep firms together (or 
draw them apart)?<P>

There is, of course, no single, simple explanation for 
why lawyers -- or suppliers in any industry -- band 
together into permanent associations. And it may well 
be that the new technologies will have little more 
than a marginal effect -- more telecommuting, perhaps, 
of the kind that I was proposing, but little of a more 
fundamental transformative nature. <P>

But a more radical impact is possible as well. Consider, 
first, possible impacts on the economies of scale that 
firms may currently derive -- the decline in the cost 
of performing certain tasks (on a per-lawyer basis) 
as the number of lawyers increases. To the extent that 
certain productive investments require relatively large 
up-front costs -- a well-stocked law library, for example 
-- the ability to spread those costs among larger numbers 
of individuals gives larger institutions, all other 
things being equal, a competitive advantage.<P>

Whether investments in technology -- hardware, software, 
and training -- fall into this category is a matter 
of some controversy among those who think about these 
things. Certainly, in the &quot;early days&quot; of 
the computer revolution -- say, 1985 -- when computerization 
meant centralized word processing and accounting systems 
running on mainframes or mini-computers, this was probably 
the case. But as costs of technology continue to plummet, 
and as capital-intensive centralized systems give way 
to open, decentralized systems connecting individual 
PCs linked together over telephone lines, those economies 
of scale are diminishing. Indeed, some now argue that 
the new technologies may actually be introducing some 
<I>diseconomies </I>of scale, as large institutions find it 
increasingly difficult to react quickly enough to a 
very rapidly-changing technological environment. To 
put the matter bluntly, when (or if?) Microsoft finally 
releases the long-awaited Windows '95 operating system, 
I will probably have that up and running and in use 
in my practice while the larger institutions in the 
neighborhood -- law firms included -- are wrestling 
with the myriad problems of managing the transition 
from their current system (and all of the software 
compatibility, support, training, and similar headaches 
that entails). <P>

More significantly, the existence of firms can also 
be explained, in part, as a mechanism to reduce &quot;search 
costs,&quot; to minimize the expense (measured in time 
and money) of finding people with the specific expertise 
required to handle particular problems -- whether that 
means finding 10 litigators to handle a particularly 
complex dispute or bringing together specialists from 
a range of different substantive areas to manage a 
multi-faceted transaction. <P>

But why must those people all be under one roof, or 
participants in a single economic enterprise?  The 
usual answer is several-fold:  it is, first, generally 
too difficult to find and assemble a team from across 
different enterprises without incurring an unacceptably 
high risk of large variations in the quality of the 
participants, and, second, the ongoing collaboration 
on the project will be facilitated if the individuals 
involved are familiar with and in close contact with 
one another.<P>

Here the new technology may have a profound disaggregating 
effect. It is not just that one can now find, by searching 
on the electronic equivalent of a nationwide lawyers' 
Yellow Pages or by posting a query over the Internet, 
the lawyer(s) who hold themselves out as having just 
the expertise you and your clients are looking for 
-- regarding, say, the licensing of agricultural technology 
in Brazil, or the defense of an unjust termination 
lawsuit in Michigan -- though that is intriguing enough 
in its own right. It is that online discussion groups 
-- both those specifically devoted to the legal profession, 
like Lexis Counsel Connect or LJExtra, and the more 
open-ended Internet-wide forums focusing on legal issues 
-- allow you to form trusted working relationships 
with people whom you may never have laid eyes on, effectively 
decoupling physical location from the ability to interact 
professionally with other lawyers on a more-or-less 
continuous basis. The same technologies, of course, 
also make ongoing collaboration at a great distance 
on specific projects technically feasible. <P>

So will we soon be seeing &quot;virtual law firms,&quot; 
individuals and small teams who combine forces with 
other such entities on a matter-by-matter basis and 
then dissolve (to re-combine with others) -- a kind 
of &quot;just-in-time lawyering&quot;?  Before you 
write this off as just another cyber-hallucination, 
consider the following. The virtual law firm -- or, 
rather, The Virtual Law Firm -- is in one sense already 
a reality, a group of lawyers practicing over, and 
linked entirely by, the Internet without any physical 
presence at all; for those of you with access to the 
Internet's World Wide Web, you can find them at <A HREF="http://www.tvlf.com">http://www.tvlf.com</A>. 
<P>

And what about the following request recently posted 
to Lexis Counsel Connect (details changed to protect 
the privacy of the communication): <P>

On Tuesday, April 18th I filed a Petition for Writ of 
Certiorari in the case of [ABC vs. XYZ]. [A description 
of the question presented followed]  Any interested 
party who wishes to file an Amicus Brief within the 
prescribed time period is welcome to contact me. Attached 
is a copy of the Petition, and I will be happy to discuss 
the case with anyone.<P>

Or Dupont's recent undertaking to link several dozen 
of their outside counsel over a wide area network, 
allowing creation of a single, shared database of work 
product and other relevant information and easy collaboration 
across firm boundaries?  Or the efforts of a major 
Midwestern healthcare provider, who recently closed 
several multi-million dollar transactions with assistance 
from counsel recruited (and collaborating) over one 
of the commercial online networks (and who would prefer, 
thank you very much, that their regular outside counsel 
not find out about this by means of this column)?  
Or, for that matter, the emergence of businesses like 
the Legal Research Network [see page ____], which uses 
a network of hundreds (and potentially thousands) of 
subject matter specialists to produce targeted research 
memos for clients (and their law firms), work traditionally 
allocated to whatever associates those law firms might 
have available at any given moment (their lack of specific 
expertise notwithstanding)? <P>

As efforts to detach the provision of legal services 
from constraints imposed by existing geographical and 
institutional boundaries, these examples may only be 
straws in the wind; but it is, I think, an awfully 
interesting wind. There is certainly significant distance 
we still have to travel before these efforts become 
commonplace, and I would be the last to suggest that 
these boundaries have somehow suddenly been rendered 
irrelevant because of the magic of the new technologies. 
But just as the telephone and fax machine have had 
a hand in altering the institutional landscape--the 
proliferation of firm branch offices, for example, 
is hard to imagine without these advances in communications 
--so too will the emergence of ever more powerful communications 
technologies expand the prospects for these and other 
new kinds of collaborative endeavors.<P>

The moral of this tale?  I would think that anyone whose 
career time horizon is more than a few years long would 
want, at the least, to position him/herself to take 
advantage of the opportunities for this kind of virtual 
collaboration when they start coming along--and that 
means nothing more (or less) than spending some time, 
now, online. Not just sending the odd e-mail now and 
then, but participating in some form of interactive 
online exchange (whether on one of the commercial services 
or on the Internet; e-mail me for suggestions). Forging 
working relationships based on mutual trust and confidence 
is no easier online than off; indeed, in many ways 
it is more difficult, because electronic communication 
has its own unusual and unfamiliar features (the absence 
of visual cues can be awfully disorienting), and it 
takes some time to discover ways to communicate expertise, 
trustworthiness, collegiality, and the like via online 
interactions. Interacting with others online, in other 
words, is a skill that, like most, gets better with 
practice. And unless I'm fundamentally misreading the 
economics of this industry, it is a skill that will 
become increasingly important (because increasingly 
rewarded in the marketplace) as electronic networks 
become a more ubiquitous feature of the legal landscape.<P>

<h3>Barbed Wire Fences in Cyberspace: The Threat Posed by
Calls for Ownership of Transactional Information</h3>

<h4>By David R. Johnson</h4>
<hr>

  <P>
      People leave tracks as they move through electronic
networks. Whenever we do business, electronically or otherwise,
the other party knows something about our preferences and
activities. But when we use the new electronic vending machines
and digital cash, the merchants with whom we deal can keep a
detailed record that reveals much more, in aggregate, about our
activities.  Store and forward messaging systems can continue
to store after they forward. As we all conduct more and more of
our lives on the networks, we will necessarily create a much more
detailed digital record of those lives.
<P>

        Concerned about the threat to privacy created by such
electronic dossiers, some have called for new laws granting each
of us "ownership" of all the transactional information generated
as we move around the network. Third parties would have to bargain
with us to obtain the right to use "personal" information. This
may produce a sort of cattle drive vs. sheep herder battle on the
electronic frontier. Either "information wants to be free" or we
can all put barbed wire around the tracks we leave -- but we can't
have both a free information range and a system of information
ownership. The First Amendment implications of any such
privacy regime are staggering.
<P>

        This real contract is, in a sense, internal to every user
of the networks.  You want your own information to be private, at
least to some degree. But you want to be able freely to find out
about everything and everyone else.  You want to get customized
marketing services and eliminate junk mail.  But it's annoying to
think that the marketing companies, not you, profit from knowing
what you want.  You want to be free to investigate and speak your
mind about any subject.  But it can be devastating when someone
else feels free to broadcast a critical comment about you across
the world.
<P>

        Ironically, despite recent calls to create a proprietary
interest in personal information, it may not matter who "owns"
this data.  Economists tell us that the market -- especially a
super-efficient low-transaction-cost online market -- will operate
quickly to create trades that allocate information rights in an
optimal way no matter what the starting point. If consumers "own"
their personal data, critics of the privacy initiatives suggest,
they will trade away this transactional privacy for convenience
every time. Even if we all get to sell our privacy in this way,
the price will be low and the economic benefits will flow
primarily to the rich (whose preferences are worth more to
marketers). So we are faced with the prospect of a range war over
ownership of data that may, in the end, settle nothing of
importance and cost us all something to create the markets in
which we negotiate transactions in these rights.
<P>

        Let's go back to privacy basics.  What we all fear most is
the ability of the government or a personal enemy to put together
a detailed dossier, compiled from easy-to-obtain electronic
sources, that becomes the basis for a damaging publication or
prosecution.  And we want to know the ground rules under which we
transact any given interchange -- are we in a quiet corner,
whispering, or in a public square trading in the open?  The way to
avoid both confusion and undue invasion of property, in light of
these basics, is not to create a new property interest. It is to
allow (and require) system operators to establish and enforce
clear rules -- and then to allow system users to decide where to
conduct their business taking into account the degree of privacy
they want with respect to particular types of transactions. The
operationally efficient way to provide optimal privacy and
openness is to let users decide which sysop's rules are right for
them -- and to select the systems through which they want to
conduct their business.
<P>

        Even if we select a legal regime based on choice among
communication systems -- as opposed to a default "ownership"
principle -- there will be a need for new law regarding detailed
electronic transactional data.  We will need to be sure that users
can find out about the rules of any given system with which they
interact and enforce the rules against both sysop and other
parties they meet online.  We will need direct prohibitions or
warrant conditions applicable to potential abuses of governmental
powers. And we will need to consider whether to ban outright the
publication (or threat of publication) of certain types of
detailed dossiers for tortious reasons -- such as extortion or
coercion.
<P>

        As the electronic frontier matures, there will be
continual conflicts between those who want free access to
information and those who want to participate in the networks
without automatically giving up all rights to control the flow of
the resulting transactional data.  Before we treat these conflicts
as appropriate matters for a new type of "property" law, however,
we should remember that almost everyone will be on both sides of
any new "fence."  If we approach this problem by allowing
a variety of new spaces to develop -- allowing users to reward and
punish optimal sets of rules by sending their business to the
stores of sysops who get the rules right, we'll have saved a lot
of unnecessary transaction costs and we'll all end up owning a
more civilized patch of cyberspace that is appropriately (by our
own lights) accomodating to both privacy and freedom of speech.

<h3>The New Case Law of Cyberspace</h3>

<h4>By: David R. Johnson</h4>
<hr>

<P>
        It seems increasingly clear that the new electronic
networks need a special form of law and some method of
publicizing and enforcing that law. Newbies in Arizona threaten to
distribute advertising widely, despite vigorous objections from
recipients, and claim their acts are "lawful" because there is no
law.  Allegedly harmed parties are beginning to sue in terrestrial
courts for defamation by electronic mail, and may produce
precedents that don't take adequately into account the right of
reply that exists here. No one knows how to find the limits of
copyright claims, or fair use, on the net. And there are many
questions, such as those involving rights of access, for which
existing legal precedents provide very little guidance.
<P>

        So there will likely be a new law for the net. But one key
question yet to be addressed is what form that law should take.
There will be rules articulated by sysops -- the equivalent of
statutory law. And there will be enforcement mechanisms -- the
local sheriff will show up. But how will we apply the law to
determine whether to enforce the rules to any particular alleged
wrongdoer? And how will we use these concrete decisions to inform
later determinations?  Can we use the net itself to perform
adjudication and to create a "common law?"
<P>

        If we want to develop principled consideration
and articulation of widely shared values, rather than mob rule and
lynchings, we need to capture some of the best attributes of the
networks -- conversation leading to consensus -- in reacting to
particular cases and controversies. There may be models for
this. The original jury system was, after all, a means of allowing
discussion and decision among the local affected community,
including witnesses, under the eye of the representative of the
sovereign.  There is already intense discussion on the networks of
any alleged wrongdoing. It would take very little additional
formality to cap that conversation with something in the nature of
a group decision.
<P>

        Some say modern law arose from the ability of printed
casebooks to abstract cases and reduce them to a limited set of
factors and principles. I'm not sure how we would accomplish that
on the net -- or whether we should try. Maybe the best "record" of
a case is simply the transcript of the network-based discussion of
it. (Presumably, the "citation" to the case will take the form
of a "universal resource locator" pointing to the place on the
network from which the transcript can be retrieved.) If we don't
think "neutrality" is essential to adjudication online, we might
take the final decision of the group involved in that discussion
as the "result" in the case. Sysops could agree to honor the
decisions of online limited access discussion forums that achieve
legitimacy by producing thoughtful and well-justified transcripts.
We will have a network law made up of much-retold stories and
discussions, rather than of "cases" codified by catalogers.
<P>

        Will the net become precedent-bound as these stories and
discussions-to-decision proliferate? I doubt it. One essential
feature of any law of cyberspace is the need to take into account
the particular expectations fostered by the custom of the local
area. But maybe we should fear that it will be hard for users to
figure out what the law is.  There won't be treatises, at least
for a while.  No licensed bar, yet, to dispense advice. Perhaps
this uncertainty about groundrules accounts for the typical
behavior of new users, who generally hang around a new discussion
group for a while before beginning to type. But this diversity of
local rules, and uncertainty about them, is what makes travel so
fascinating.
<P>

        Perhaps the first principle of the cyberspace migrant will
be to show a certain respect for local custom. A first principle
of most areas of cyberspace will be to help newcomers learn the
local rules and to show some understanding and compassion when
ruling on a first offense.

<h3>Due Process in Cyberspace</h3>

<h4>David R. Johnson</h4>
<hr>

<P>
Introduction

 <P>
       Online communication has given rise to a new global
commerce in ideas, information and services. Because electronic
messages readily cross territorial borders, and many online
transactions have no necessary relationship to any particular
physical location, existing geographically-based legal systems
have difficulty regulating this new phenomenon.  As users and
system operators encounter conflicts and seek to resolve
disputes, they take action to establish rules and decide
individual cases. This creates a new form of law -- a law of
Cyberspace -- based on private contracting on a global
basis and enforced by a combination of the sysop's ultimate right
to banish unruly users and the users' ultimate right to migrate to
other online service providers.

<P>
        Will this emerging netlaw provide "due process"? Will it,
in other words, respect basic principles of fairness, as embodied
in current legal doctrines in the form of procedural protections
against arbitrary action by governmental authorities and
substantive rights not to have life, liberty and property taken
away to serve the interests of an oppressive majority? There are
some signs that the emerging netlaw will honor basic principles
of procedural fairness and respect for individuals. However, the
goal is to protect users from arbitrary actions of their
information service providers rather than from arbitrary actions
of their governments. Consequently, the methods used to
achieve this goal online must differ from those available in
established national legal systems.

<P>
Is Due Process Necessary in Cyberspace?

 <P>
       At first glance, global online communications might
not seem to be in need of special protections for users or
specific limitations on the prerogatives of system operators.  A
decision to sign up with an online commercial service or an
Internet service provider is clearly voluntary -- unlike
involuntary subjugation to territorial laws imposed by local
sovereigns. The rules of the electronic road are set, for the
most part, by private contracts -- not by legislators enacting
statutes, administrators making regulatory decisions, or
judges interpreting the law. If  a  system operator adopts rules
that seem oppressive, the local "netizenry" can vote with their
modems and go to another, more congenial, jurisdiction. Indeed,
it is possible for some technologically sophisticated users to
transmit messages without dealing through intermediaries who know
who they are or who can enforce compliance with any
established rules.

 <P>
       This primary reliance on action by private parties is
important in establishing the relative freedom of users of the
net from governmental intrusion.  But there remain important
questions raised by the potential of system operators, or
majorities of communities of users, to oppress individuals and
minorities. While those who disagree with local rules are free to
migrate, many users will have invested very substantial amounts of
time and effort in establishing a particular online identity
(building a reputation based on a particular email address or web
page location, for example). And many seek to participate actively
in particular online communities, over long periods of time.  For
them, separation from those communities would impose very
substantial personal loss. Thus, the check on sysop power
provided by the user's right to abandon an online area is
importantly mitigated by the costs imposed on the user who walks
away.  And the sysop's power of banishment can become the
occasion for substantial injustice if it is imposed without
adequate cause or without the use of procedures that give the
user (and, perhaps, the cybercommunity) a chance to be heard.

 <P>
       Some system operators will challenge the relevance of
"due process" in the networld, stressing that the rights assured
apply only to limit powers exercised by sovereign governments.
They will also protest that private commercial and associational
dealings are not generally burdened with prohibitions against
irrationality. What for government is prohibited censorship is,
for a private electronic publisher, editing.  What for government
constitutes discrimination  is, for an online community, the
right of free association.

 <P>
       The arguments for some form of protection in netlaw for
users' right may prove persuasive, however, because traditional
legal authorities have difficulty regulating a global electronic
network, because the entrepreneurs advocate self-regulation, and
because the system providers may become the effective "government"
of the networld.  They collectively do have a monopoly on what
passes for "force" in this environment (the off-on switch).
Especially insofar as they band together to establish standards,
as they have already done, in effect, to create the Internet
protocols and domain name system and associated rules,
collectively they do exercise something akin to sovereignty
within their particular sphere.

<P>
        Sysops may have to admit that the stakes involved in
disputes about the creation or application of online rules can be
high, from the perspective of a user. If they are not constrained
by some basic principles of fairness and respect for individual
rights, evolved within the context of the networld culture, then
external governments may be unwilling to defer to netizen claims
to a right to self-government. Moreover, a failure to protect
online rights to "life, liberty and property" in the networld
would likely deter many potential participants and stifle online
commerce.

<P>
What Due Process is Now Provided to Users?

 <P>
       Rules online may be promulgated either by common
practices developed users or as a result of private contract
between provider and user. Most of these contractual rules are
set by contracts of adhesion, with little or no opportunity for
bargaining. Many commercial service providers' contracts purport
to reserve to the sysop the right to deny service to anyone at
any time for any reason. Sometimes users demand changes to online
rules -- and interactive capability online provides ample
opportunity, as a practical matter, to petition their online
governments and to discuss preferable changes.  But there is no
established procedure or practice of putting proposed changes out
for comment. To the contrary, many contracts for
online services provide that the user agrees in advance to abide
by the system's rules however arbitrary they might be or however
they may change in the future. The user's only recourse, in
extremis, is to quit the system if a new rule change is
objectionable.

 <P>
       Similarly, most cases involving application of online
rules to particular cases and specific users proceed on the basis
of unilateral action by the system operator, who acts as
prosecutor, judge, jury and executioner. There have been
exceptions -- such as the famous case of the multi-user domain
(Lamda Moo) whose users called for the creation of an independent
judiciary after one member was had his ID rendered
nonfunctional by the "wizard" on the basis a public outcry
against anti-social conduct by that user. Now a pilot project has
been initiated to establish a "Virtual Magistrate" to rule on
online disputes, via email, that would give those with claims
regarding the application of online rules a chance to have their
cases heard by a neutral party. At the present justice in
cyberspace is summary justice (or self-help vigilante revenge).

 <P>
       The current lack of meaningful protection in cyberspace
is ironic, given the potential the medium offers to facilitate
rational dispute resolution and public debate. Online conferences
can readily marshall diverse views regarding proposed
regulations. (The Nuclear Regulatory Commission is experimenting
with online rulemaking and Congress has discovered that email is
an effective means for at least some constituents to make their
views known.) Moreover, focused adjudications can be conducted
much more cost effectively online than in the real world. All
parties can attend at their convenience. Experts and neutrals can
be located and consulted quickly online. The entire proceeding can
be archived as part of an electronic record. The net can
thus facilitate thoughtful discussion of new rules, rational
analysis of the facts, and expeditious adjudication of online
controversies.

<P>
How Will Due Process Arise in Cyberspace?

 <P>
       As the number of online services and users  increase, the
number of disputes and the magnitude of the interests affected by
such disputes, will also increase. Formerly what the techie in
the back room called your computer server did not matter. Today
large companies contend aggressively to trademark "domain names"
and to maintain a legally protected space to call their own.
It doesn't matter much that your phone number changes when you
change jobs. But some employees may face serious disruption in
their professional lives if their prior service provider declines
to forward their email. Many intensive users of online
communication would recoil in horror at the thought that a system
operator could unilaterally destroy their online identity without
cause, or that a committee of techies who administer naming
conventions in the networld could eliminate their hard-won web
page addresses based upon engineering concerns. They have come to
expect a legally guaranteed entitlement to present one's case and
to seek to establish individual rights against oppression. They
will likely insist upon proprietary rights in phone numbers, email
addresses, and web page identities as well as entitlement to a
reasonable presentation of their grievances.

 <P>
       The first stage in the development of such online due
process rights will take the form of recognition that important
personal (and corporate) interests are at stake.  This may at
first take the form of appeals to existing legal authorities for
protection. But local authorities cannot easily control a global
net, may not have jurisdiction over all relevant parties, and will
be inclined to defer to the terms of the contracts that users
agreed to as a condition of going online. So these appeals will
ultimately have to be made directly to system operators and,
ultimately, to the group of interconnected systems that,
collectively, control most of the traffic exchanged on the
net.  Collectively, those who control access to the interconnected
systems have the power to discipline or deny interchange of
messages to sites that fail to conform to a Cyberspace norm.

  <P>
      The Internet community, of long term users, has
demonstrated its ability (via the IETF, for example) to come up
with policies and protocols that govern the technical transmission
of messages across the net and make the entire system work. Those
who don't go along with these rules have systems that simply don't
interconnect. Similarly, rules regarding "due process" for users
can be effectively adopted by consensus, so long as this higher
level type of "standard" or "protocol" is a required condition for
connection or for inclusion in the groups collaborating to enhance
the functionality of online communications. Some elements of such
principles may be based, in part, on technical architectures --
such as the location of authority to change a domain name. Some
may simply correspond to accepted practice for dealing with user
complaints or rule violations, failure to follow which might make
an area of the networld suspect or less frequently pointed to by
means of hypertext links supported by responsible providers.


 <P>
    The principles and basic rights that gain general acceptance
-- such as the transportability (or ownership by the user) of a
domain name -- are unlikely be embodied in a written
constitution. The technology of global online communication is
developing so rapidly that it will be difficult to deal with many
potential issues by means of such written rules. The Internet
community has responded to this difficulty in part by developing a
loose doctrine of  "netiquette" that is based on group discussion
and can adapt in a manner similar to the common law.  Accordingly,
there will likely be no definitive "law library" of authoritative
texts from which one can determine the extent of due process
protection accorded in the networld -- and even past cases,
though widely reported, will need to be discussed from time to
time in light of new conditions. There will be only a weak
version of "stare decisis" on the net, because the rational
presumption will be that relevant circumstances (including the
capabilities of technologies and the mix and interests  of online
participants) may well have changed since the last time an issue
was considered. But there will be wisdom derived from discussion
among informed and neutral parties.

  <P>
      For example, when "spamming" (sending multiple, offpoint
messages to news groups) became a problem in the Internet, the
offended users took direct, vigilante action -- flooding
the offending party's mailbox with hate mail. But there turned
out to be a technical means to eliminate inappropriate messages
much more surgically -- a cancellation message appearing to come
from the originating party (a "cancelbot") could be sent. Soon a
discussion group was formed to spread news of new spamming
episodes and also to deliberate on when and whether this
"cancelbot" technology should be used to remove offensive
messages.  Some self-help justice is still present, of course, but
the reaction to spamming has generated a growing sense that severe
actions taken to protect the online public's interests -- whether
canceling messages or eliminating IDs -- ought to be preceded by
thoughtful discussion and implemented by a neutral
decision-maker. This cultural practice has the potential to
become, in effect, a type of "due process" right enjoyed by
all users in the networld.

<P>
How will Due Process on the Net Differ from Due Process in
the Non-Virtual World?         

 <P>
       "Due Process" in Cyberspace may arise in the form of a
general consensus among most users and sysops that the ultimate
enforcement tools available (banishment, cancellation of IDs,
elimination of online addresses) ought not to be wielded
arbitrarily.  Users will avoid systems that reserve to the sysop
the right to terminate a user, or alter valuable identifying
information, or adopt rules prohibiting legitimate and established
activities, arbitrarily. Users accused of wrongdoing will demand
and get a hearing -- and any cavalier treatment of individual
cases will be widely reported and discussed in a manner
detrimental to the callous system operator. Such protection cannot
readily be built directly into the laws of  local sovereigns, who
may not even have jurisdiction over all of the interested
parties. They will, however, become part of what connecting system
operators expect from one another and what users in general
demand.  They will become, in effect, a form of private global
netlaw, probably applied by private arbitration and enforced by
means of all parties' ability to decide with whom they will deal.

 <P>
       Under United States law, due process is guaranteed by
virtue of a written constitution, covering a particular
geographically defined place and its citizens. It is based upon
key conceptions regarding the duty of a "state" to serve the
interests of its citizens in an equitable manner.  In contrast,
the protection of fairness for individual users in the global
networld will rely less upon the law of territorially based
jurisdictions and more upon the actions of online communities.
The efficacy of netlaw will depend more upon sysops who control
the on-off buttons and the reactions of their customers, wherever
they may reside,  than they will upon theories relating to limits
of "sovereign" powers.

 <P>
       Moreover, the nature of the beneficiaries of the online
version of "due process" may differ from that of those who can
invoke the established "real world" doctrines. Users can do
business online without necessarily disclosing the details of
their identity or the other roles they play in the real world.
Thus, those who formulate the doctrine of online due process will
need to decide whether such rights attach to any online
"persona", whether the user claiming rights must disclose
additional personal information as a condition of appearing in
the forum that can vindicate any such right, and whether rights
to "life, liberty and property" online may belong to a group or
"corporate" entity.

  <P>
      Perhaps the most important question regarding "due
process" in cyberspace concerns the online equivalent of the
right to life, a question presented when a sysop desires to
remove an online identity against the wishes of the user.  This
kind of question can arise, for example, when a user violates
rules applicable to a particular online space, or annoys other
users to the point of outrage. Is the user in question entitled
to a decision based on analysis of competent evidence, rather
than the whim of a sysop or the cries of an online "lynching"
crowd? Must the decision maker be "neutral"? Should the penalty
fit the crime?  To the extent that users desire and expect such
restraint by sysops to whom they give their business, limitations
on sysop action may evolve as a natural evolution of the new
netlaw.

 <P>
       There may be specific attributes of US-based "due
process" that will have little or no applicability online. For
example, a right to a six or twelve person jury -- a limitation
based on historical factors and the constraints on summoning
people to a physical, "real time" courthouse -- that has little
application to the capacity of the networld to allow interaction
with neutral evaluators at their own convenience. U.S. "due
process" guarantees a right to "confront" accusers and witnesses
in person. That right may make little sense when the deeds in
question took place entirely online.  U.S. "due process"
guarantees a right to "cross-examine" witnesses in an
elaborate procedural dance. That level of formality may be
unachievable or irrelevant online.

  <P>
      In contrast, certain features of online interaction may
facilitate the growth of new forms of "due process" rights. It
may be judged "fair" to allow an accused party to reply by email
or public posting to any allegations of wrongdoing. It may be
easy, and therefore fairer, to give proactive email notice to any
persons whose actions online are the subject of public
discussion, in order to facilitate such replies. Given the
relative importance of community sentiment and the likely ability
of dispersed contributors to enhance the quality of deliberations
in a particular case, online tribunals may be much more open to
discussion by "friends of the court" -- even to the point of
allowing non-parties to participate in online questioning and
argument.

 <P>
       One important feature of the U.S. doctrine of "due
process" offers protection to corporations and other
organizations that are permitted to act as "legal persons".  In
the networld, the whole idea of legal personhood takes on a new
dimension -- because participants in online interactions cannot
easily tell (and may not care) whether an online identity belongs
to only one individual. The networld offers important
opportunities for online collaboration in the delivery of
services and information by means of group action. Accordingly,
it is only a matter of time before the  networld faces the
question whether any "due process" rights attach to coherent
groups presenting themselves via email or web pages -- conferring
upon them additional rights and duties distinct from those of
the individual participants. We already allow "real" corporations
to register domain names. It's not clear why such groups need to
be "registered" in any particular physical territory. Exactly how
we go about evolving the protections afforded or denied to
collective entities online may influence what kinds of electronic
commerce can evolve.

   <P>
     One ultimate issue for the development of due process
online will be the question whether to evolve a doctrine that
protects individuals against having to bear undue burdens even if
the policy decisions imposing such burdens are taken for the
greater good. Currently system operators enjoy an "eminent domain"
power unconstrained by any need to compensate the victims of a
reassigned email address, a canceled domain name, or the
enactment of a new rule outlawing some activity which the
individual user had counted on continuing as a commercial
operator.   Users maintain some protection against tyranny by
virtue of their ability to move to another system.  But a
doctrine insuring compensation for such "takings" would provide
far greater protection against unreasonable burdens imposed by
collective decisions that cannot readily be remedied by migration
-- an increasingly likely type of decision as the networld
welcomes increasingly valuable "investment backed expectations".
(Of course, to be viable, such a doctrine would likely require
something akin to the "taxing" power.) The assertion of such a
claim to compensation may put to the test the question whether
limitations on the power of those charged with online governance
stem only from the ability of unhappy users to desert -- or,
instead, derive from a joint commitment of online "netizens" to
resolve cases rationally and prevent the imposition of unfair
burdens on individual users who do not deserve their fate.



<P>
Conclusion

    <P>
    Due Process in cyberspace will concern a different set of
persons -- online personae (whether individual, corporate, or
group) rather than the "citizens" of a given nation state. It
will protect a different set of values -- the continuing "life"
of an online identity, the "liberty" to engage in established
activities free from arbitrary new rules, and the "property" of
an established domain name or well known web page address.
Procedural protections will likely take the form of an assured
opportunity for community discussion, as distinct from physical
rights (such as the "confrontation of witnesses") or particular
"real time" dramatic processes (such as "cross examination").
Indeed, the substantive protections of due process in cyberspace
may well differ in content from place to place, with users free
to choose their online  environments  on the basis of whether the
local rules suit their needs. But, despite these differences, the
law of most areas of Cyberspace will very likely embody many of
the same core principles that underlie current due process
doctrine: respect for the interests of individuals in the face of
majority oppression, thoughtful and rational evaluation of
individual cases, and appropriate opportunities to participate in
creating and applying the law of the networld.

<h3>Granularity and the Law of Cyberspace</h3>

<h4>By: David R. Johnson</h4>
<hr>

 <P>
       We all know size is important. It determines how the laws
of nature work. A mosquito can't be the size of an elephant,
because at that size, with the volume of its legs increasing by a
factor of three and the strength increasing by the cross section
factor of two, it would crush itself. A single molecule
of water can't evaporate because it's already separated from all
similar molecules. The size and granularity of information exchange
should have an impact on the application of our own laws as well.

  <P>
      Cyberspace is often said to have no dimensions. But that
doesn't really mean that it doesn't have size. If we take size to
mean the average amount of information contained in a meaningful
object (location) in cyberspace, one major impact of the digital
networks can be seen to be their tendency simultaneously to reduce
the size of things (by encouraging the exchange of short messages
and structured data bits) and increase the size of things (by
allowing the accumulation of and access to massive amounts of
data). Thus, instead of dealing with books -- which were sized to
fit in the saddlebag of a travelling scholar -- we deal with short
e-mail messages and vast distributed databases. How does the
network's tendency to change the size of our information exchange
affect how the law applies to the ownership and exchange of that
information?

<P>
        With regard to intellectual property doctrine, the
simultaneous bigness and smallness of intellectual artifacts in
cyberspace causes serious problems. Should we consider each e-mail
message a "work"?  How can we use the "proportion taken" factor in
a "fair use" analysis when we are dealing with the copying and
forwarding of "whole" e-mail messages?  At the other extreme, the
large size of the accumulations of pieces required to produce some
multimedia works has posed serious transaction costs problems,
with some calling for changes in a legal structure that makes it
just too costly to assemble the amount of proprietary materials
required -- in great quantities of small bits -- for some types of
works.

  <P>
      The same can be said about many other areas of law.  The
large numbers of small bits traversing a network make it nearly
impossible for a sysop to review messages in advance -- and
therefore requires us to rethink the application to sysops of
traditional "publisher" liability for defamation.  The ability to
accumulate and access vast numbers of small electronic records
regarding an individual puts pressure on privacy law -- and makes
us think about revising an otherwise presumed right to republish
information that is "public" but otherwise hard to assemble all in
one place.

 <P>
       When meaningful communications are packaged in medium-
sized bundles (like a book) that take a moderate amount of effort
(a person week or more, but generally not person years), they tend
to be produced by institutions that can bring teams together to
share the effort. This may help with quality control, but it also
dampens creativity. In contrast, an intellectual domain involving
short messages sent to the whole world reduces the role of
institutions, makes everyone into "the press" for First Amendment
purposes, and allows the accomplishment of far larger tasks. It
also creates information overload (as vast quantities of the new
fine-grained sand of e-mail sift through barriers that previously
kept out boulders of unsolicited information). This may create a
need for new law (e.g., prohibiting deliberate "spamming" of the
net by sending messages to everyone on a network) if we cannot
control uninvited intrusions by technological means.

  <P>
      The new granularity also has an impact on the size of the
communities we join. Relatively few people can pursue a shared
interest on a global scale. If we allow these few to solidify
their interactions by allowing the formation of new corporate
entities administered through the net, we will see the emergence
of a new type of intermediate organization -- one not easy to
locate in the real world, whose actions might be said to occur
anywhere or nowhere, and whose influence may be big even though
the numbers of people involved are small.

 <P>
       If it's true that digitizing everything and connecting
everyone with networks makes the objects of the law's attention
simultaneously smaller (harder to trace, easier to start and stop)
and bigger (global in reach, capable of comprehensive collection),
then we should expect to find some discomfort as we apply
traditional doctrines to these new phenomena. Perhaps, like the
water molecule or mosquito, some of our well established laws will
evaporate at small scale or collapse under the pressure of global
mass.

<h3>Local Options in Cyberspace --Protecting Experimentation
In Online Regulatory Regimes</h3>

<h4>By: David R. Johnson</h4>
<hr>

 <P>
       Despite the law's sometime aspirations to
universality, a fundamental characteristic of regulatory law has
been local (territorial) diversity.  We let local communities set
standards that govern education and obscenity. We license lawyers
through local bars. We adopt a wide range of different
rules for the way in which the public interacts with and learns
about the local governmental bodies that grant permits, set
operating hours, and generally regulates the way in which
businesses may interact with the public. Most government and
law (and, it has been noted, politics) is local, in the geographic
sense, and lots of diversity results.
<P>

        This territorial diversity is generally hailed as a Good
Thing. It encourages experimentation. It recognizes a
natural diversity in personal standards -- allowing Iowa to live
by different standards from New York.  And it has worked to keep
the law in touch with the values of the community.
<P>

        But  the new electronic networks are causing this system
of geographic diversity to break down. The net has brought Iowa to
New York and vice versa. Activities that once used to be locally
regulated -- and that used to have only local impact -- are now
moving to the net. Education, smut, law practice, and consumer
fraud are available twenty-four hours a day, without boundaries.
What will this new connectedness do to our system of local
regulation?

 <P>
       There appear, at first, to be only two basic options. The
regulatory function can shift to legal institutions that live on
the net (and remain distant from local constituencies).  Or the
local authorities can move onto the net and seek to retain their
control (waging a doomed effort to regulate activities that
originate far away and to keep electrons from crossing their
borders). The second option is being tried more often, these days.
Local regulators of obscenity and stock fraud are asserting
jurisdiction over those who post offending messages that make
their way into a particular local jurisdiction.  But efforts to
map regional regulation onto cyberspace do seem doomed: An online
college can't comply with hundreds of different rules re
accreditation; an online lawyer won't join fifty different bars;
publishers and electronic merchants can't reasonably be expected
to police the messages they send with reference to inconsistent
standards set by multiple jurisdictions.

  <P>
      We may see a "race to the bottom" of the type that created
Delaware corporate law. Local jurisdictions may compete to provide
a regulatory framework that rewards local placement of a hard
disk. Users won't care where the data is stored, any more than
they care about where the corporate charter is filed, in a world
of cheap bandwidth.

 <P>
       Even if we don't see a rise of "data havens," there will
be a natural selection of local regulatory regimes that favor the
net.  Local governments that seek to keep the net out, or that
disfavor operation of their employees on the net, will be shunned
or ignored.  Jurisdictions that adopt regulations favoring net
traffic will attract traffic and become de facto standards.

 <P>
       We need not lose diversity.  Licensing and accreditation
will remain -- indeed, they may become even more important as
users seek signals of trustworthiness and value in a global
marketplace. But we won't have only one such signal. Multiple
online accreditation bodies will give differing views regarding
what a school should be. We will have multiple bar associations
with differing perspectives.  We won't have one online obscenity
standard -- nor will we be hostage to local standards.  Perhaps
the only universal standard will be strict enforcement of the
labelling that makes it possible for users to determine which
regulatory regimes assert some control over the messages they are
about to access.

  <P>
      Thus, in the long run, a subtle process of natural
selection will transform the nature of "local" regulation on the
net.  Territorial governments will still regulate haircuts and
traffic and public health, of course. But the diverse "localities"
of the net may or may not be governed by those same jurisdictions.

   <P>
     Will it be a Good Thing that, to a greater degree, people
on the net can choose their own law? (It's a lot easier to shift
your virtual location than to move your physical location.) Will
we be happy with paths running through the electronic commons that
have been laid out by the habits of users rather than some central
architect? I suspect so. The Jeffersonian ideal saw the
establishment of local governments as an important way to preserve
the sovereignty of the people. It's happening all over again, only
this time by means of a slightly different form of travel.

<h3>Lawmaking And Law Enforcement in Cyberspace</h3>

<h4>By: David R. Johnson</h4>
<hr>

<P>
        As more people communicate and do business through the
global electronic network, there will be disputes.  Many current
infonauts hope that the new online community can work things out
informally, using social pressures, "netiquette" and discussion
instead of rules to prevent harms and resolve disagreements.  But
as more newbies join the net and as the financial stakes
increase, it seems likely that some rules will be necessary, and
some enforcement of those rules will be required.  Where will
those rules come from and who will enforce them?
<P>

        Some argue that, especially in light of the international
character of the networks, we should not look to existing
territorial governments but should instead create a
self-regulatory regime that is articulated and enforced by system
operators and users who understand the new media and wish it well.
One way to advance exploration of the question whether Cyberspace
should be self-regulating (or, perhaps, even "sovereign" within
its sphere) is to discuss in concrete terms how the law of
Cyberspace can be made and enforced so as to achieve both
effectiveness and fundamental principles of fairness.

  <P>
      The "local" Law of Cyberspace is already made by sysops
and users in the form of contracts and rules applicable to
particular systems.  Sysops decree the terms and conditions of
access to their particular spaces -- and users agree to these as a
condition of being granted entry. These agreements may be
contracts of adhesion -- not truly negotiable.  But they
nonetheless present the user with meaningful choice, because there
is great diversity among the rules established by different areas.
Further, the barriers to creation of a new electronic space, with
rules more agreeable to any given set of users, are low.  This
local law is relatively easily enforced, because a sysop can
banish those who break it.

 <P>
       The complication comes when we consider Cyberspace as a
whole and when systems are set up to exchange mail and discussion
groups and otherwise interconnect in such a way that User A gets
messages from a User B whose access to the network is not
controlled by the same sysop.  Unilateral promulgation of rules
for particular local electronic spaces simply doesn't work to
control Internet listservs or other forms of cross-system
communication.  An obvious next step, then, is to allow the system
operators to agree among themselves on certain minimum principles
that all will accept -- the violation of which all agree will be
met with standard enforcement strategies, including banishment.

  <P>
      For example, all (or most) sysops might agree to provide
some minimum level of privacy protection to e-mail messages. And
they might, in consequence, agree to exclude any user who
deliberately acted to defeat such protections. Or sysops might
agree only to exchange e-mail traffic with other systems that
honor certain minimum standards regarding accurate labelling of
message contents to protect the interests of users in
selecting the types of messages they want to receive.

  <P>
      The net itself can create a new procedure to establish
such global, agreed-upon, rules.  Such a procedure can be modelled
in part on "notice and comment rule making" but would also
involve a vote or agreement -- somewhat like that now used to
establish new Usenet news groups.

 <P>
        A "Cyberspace Law Institute" might provide the mechanism
for such lawmaking as follows:

<P>
(1) Any new proposed rule would be published in an easily
accessible place and distributed by mail to a list of sysops and
others interested in reviewing such proposals;

<P>
(2) All comments and debate would be collected in that same
electronic location and distributed to interested parties;

<P>
(3) Sysops prepared to accept and enforce the rule would register
their agreement at the central location;

<P>
(4) Vigorous opposition to particular rules, coupled with
an indication of unwillingness to connect to systems that adopt
the proposed rule, could also be registered;

<P>
(5) After a suitable interval, the sysops who agree upon the rule
would proceed to implement and enforce it.  Presumably, one first
rule would be that Sysops will not connect with other systems that
do not enforce the rules those systems have agreed upon. Another
first principle might address the amount of "due process" to be
given to a user, perhaps including appeal to a decision maker
other than the local sysop, before invocation of the ultimate
sanction.

  <P>
      Note that this regime provides clear notice regarding the
terms and conditions applicable across systems. (It might be
supplemented by listing the local rules applicable within
various systems, to allow users more fully informed choices.)
Although some may raise antitrust concerns, it seems likely that a
mechanism of this kind should be viewed as a kind of standard
setting designed to enhance competition. And it provides for a
deliberative process, maximizing user choice insofar as
consistent with the need for sysops to define their own systems.

  <P>
      It's hard to evaluate a system of law-making like this
other than in the context of the substantive laws the system
actually makes. Should we worry about collusion among sysops to
stifle user rights? I think not -- sysops have strong
incentives to increase traffic on the system. But the only way
to be sure is to give it a try. The alternative appears to be to
allow current national legislatures to adopt inconsistent and
unenforceable rules based on a failure to understand and embrace the
promise of the new communications technology.  The very first
efforts of sysops to formulate basic rules, designed to protect
users and foster increased use of the new medium, will demonstrate
the advantages of developing the new law of Cyberspace
indigenously.

<h3>Taking Cyberspace Seriously --How to Deal with Obnoxious Messages on the Net</h3>

<h4>By: David R. Johnson</h4>
<hr>

<P>
        Controversy abounds regarding obnoxious messages found on
the Internet  -- obscenity, threats, intrusive advertising. The
cops arrest a college student who writes an appalling story and
bust "sysops" whose hard disks reflect the darker side of human
nature. Vigilante users flame or, with their special command of
the new technology, delete messages from those who "spam the
net" with ads. Senators introduce legislation to outlaw online
"indecency" or e-mail based "stalking".

 <P>
       One key reason why this debate seems unsatisfying, even
as it grows more shrill, is that the proponents of content
regulation are attempting to apply laws and concepts designed
to regulate the sending of messages from one party to another
-- the unilateral imposition of unwelcome content on an
unwilling victim -- whereas those who object to such regulation
are generally trying to defend the right to assemble a
like-minded group -- a phenomenon that simply doesn't fit the
"obscene phone call" paradigm. The parties to the debate are
talking past each other.

<P>
        The defenders of free speech on the net have a point when
they note that most online conversations are not like hard-sell
pitches delivered over the phone at the dinner hour, much less
like unsought hard breathing into the phone at midnight. In
order to be exposed to an obnoxious message uploaded to an
electronic discussion group, an online user must generally go
past a password and a warning label that will effectively keep
away most people who want to avoid such materials. Have you
ever accidentally logged on to a sexually-oriented bulletin
board? Inadvertently accessed the "alt.sex.stories" newsgroup?
(Keeping kids out is a different matter. More on that later.)

 <P>
       Those who favor regulation of unwelcome messages also
have a point when they object to having their e-mail boxes filled
to the brim with irrelevant trivia they did not seek. There is no
question that the net provides those who want to harass or
intimidate a victim with new tools -- and that some combination
of traditional law and new self-regulatory mechanisms on the net
itself must deal with these new crimes.

  <P>
      The controversy over content control on the net grows
intense not only because the parties are mixing inapposite
categories but also because there is no clarity regarding who
is going to set the rules for this new medium.
Territorially-based laws fail us when we confront new phenomena
involving participants whose geographical locations span legal
jurisdictions and have little relationship to the locus of the
harms they might inflict.

   <P>
     I think we can reduce the intensity of the debate, and
find some real solutions to the new quandaries posed by
complaints about obnoxious content on the net, if we take
seriously the idea that Cyberspace is a separate place.  We
should stop thinking about most of these issues as if they
involve the sending of a message from party A to party B (or
parties C through Z), and instead fully absorb the fact that
most communications on the net amount to the joint creation of
a new shared space allowing the assembly of like-minded
individuals.  (Even opening an e-mail message is a consensual entry
into a space created by the author, if the nature of the
message and the identity of the sender, or lack thereof, is fully
disclosed. )  In short, if we think of the reader of electronic
messages as less of a passive "recipient" and more as an active
"traveler," much will immediately become clear.

<P>
        The net is a world scale barn-raising, or really
community-building, involving the efforts of diverse groups to
create new venues to hold the products of their collective
intellectual endeavor. Any effort by geographically-based
authority to regulate access to this new territory can be seen
as an impingement not only on the right to "speech" but also on
the right to assemble -- almost on the right to explore a new
world. At the same time, any failure accurately to label a
discussion group, or any effort to inflict it by surprise on
unwilling participants, can best be understood as the moral
equivalent of kidnapping.

 <P>
       With this new perspective that the "space" in Cyberspace
is to be taken seriously, as a means of deciding how to deal
with the regulation of content of which we disapprove, we
understand at once why the citizens of the net condemned two
lawyers for sending out ads into discussion groups specifically
labeled for other purposes, but don't object to the growing
practice of law firm's listing their expertise on "world wide
web" pages that can be accessed by willing readers.  Claims to
"free speech" rights don't have force when the speaker is
intruding into someone else's dinner party.  But the net is
tolerant of what you do in your own, well-labeled, virtual living
room.

  <P>
      With this perspective, we understand clearly why it was
inappropriate for federal law enforcement officials to charge a
California couple with distribution of obscene materials to
Tennessee solely on the grounds that a law enforcement official
could go to Tennessee and, using a modem, sign into a clearly-
labeled and password-controlled bulletin board and download
materials, basing the conviction on Memphis "local community
standards" rather than the standards of the group that had gone
past those barriers to join the bulletin board in question.
The rights of a local territorial jurisdiction to regulate what
goes on in public there simply don't translate into a mandate to
prevent local citizens from traveling from the privacy of their
own homes to more exotic locales.

 <P>
       Since no one has to go to any particular area of
Cyberspace, we  simply shouldn't regulate those who upload
obnoxious content as if they were sending unwelcome messages
that cannot be avoided. But we do need to protect the
limited-access and special purpose spaces there against unwelcome
(and not easily disregarded) intrusions.  And we need to
provide the means for parents to at least attempt to control
where their kids may wander.  Once we have done that, we should
in general let online discussions develop as they will.

 <P>
       Those who seek to regulate content on the net will object
that even private discussions online can create serious harms to
third parties -- ruining reputations, creating fear among those
not party to the conversation, inciting or facilitating crime --
so that there should be some constraints on the kinds of online
"places" those who frequent the net should be allowed to build.
Taking seriously the notion that online discussions happen in a
distinct "place," albeit a place with global dimensions, helps to
put into focus the question who should govern that space.  Who
should have the final say as to whether particular types of
spaces should be permitted to exist at all?

 <P>
       If we give Tennessee the last word on whether there
should be a place for dirty pictures, how can we avoid giving
some other country (Singapore?) the right to say that there
should be no place for uncensored political discussions?  If we
prosecute any discussion that others find "threatening," then
conversations that used to be permissible (if not admirable) in
private settings in the "real" world will not be possible in
our new, collective, electronic living room.  If we treat the
posting of a message as an "action" sufficient to convert mere
speech into conspiracy, we will criminalize what we previously
ignored as idle chatter.

 <P>
       Because properly labeled online messages involve the
right of participants to assemble for discussions that no one is
forced to join, we should carefully regulate anyone who sets
themselves up as a regulator of such meeting places.  The
market will probably keep sysops from exercising too much power
-- someone who doesn't like the restrictions imposed by a local
discussion group "moderator" can move somewhere else or start
his or her own forum.  But blanket governmental pronouncements that
certain messages are illegal should be much more suspect,
especially given the voluntary nature of online exchanges.

  <P>
      The hardest cases are posed by online discussions that
(1) offend privacy and dignity values, where no response can
remedy the harm, or (2) the existence of which may allow
children to access materials their parents would find unsuitable.
If you know a group of any size is talking about you (or your
group) in unflattering terms, there can be little consolation
short of prohibiting the entire discussion.  Even if online
discussions are properly labeled and protected by passwords and
other reasonable steps to help prevent access by minors, some
kids will wander down the online streets to the red light
district.  Yet preservation of the right of adults of differing
persuasions to travel in a Cyberspace of their own creation
necessarily carries with it the price of allowing anyone to
build an online place the very existence of which may deeply
offend someone else (and not which kids, perhaps posing as
adults, may reach).


 <P>
       Passwords and labels and headers create useful boundaries
that give the Internet astonishing diversity.  If you view that
diversity as forcing its way into every home, unbidden, then
you might want local governments to be entitled to keep it out.
But if you consider that any participant has to go out of the
local neighborhood, through barriers and passwords, to get to
the content that would offend geographically-proximate
neighbors, you would view efforts to prohibit access to certain
content on the net as the equivalent of prohibiting travel.  If
we insist that online discussions be adequately labeled, then
those who gain access to them must be seen as engaged in an act
of voluntary assembly.  If the market provides  online systems
that contain only material suitable for children we will have
provided adequate means to allow parents to control where their
children go.

  <P>
      No territorial sovereign can for long effectively
prohibit either electronic travel or online assembly.  Those made
uncomfortable by the existence of foreign places, even those
where people condemn and ridicule all that we hold dear, have
had to get used to the diversity of the world -- and have
gradually gotten to know their enemies and themselves better by
means of a gradual exchange of information across boundaries.
Ultimately, those who raise concerns about obnoxious content on
the net, and those who instinctively seek to protect free
speech, can find common cause in allowing the online world to
achieve a greater degree of complexity: with semi-permeable
boundaries that assure those who want to say something get to
do so -- to those who want to hear it - and those who want to
travel can do so, while others stay at home.

<BODY>
<h3>Jurisdictional Quid Pro Quo and the Law of Cyberspace</h3>

<h4>By: David R. Johnson</h4>
<hr>

<P>
        The strong form of the theory that there is (or will be) a
"law of cyberspace" holds that the new electronic networks are a
separate legal jurisdiction (or, maybe, more than one). Even those
who might go to the extreme with such a view, perhaps advocating
"sovereignty" for the net, nevertheless must recognize that
plodding old territorial sovereigns will continue to assert
jurisdiction and make laws about what happens online.  And even
the weakest versions of the theory -- even those that might deny
that there is anything special (legally) about electronic
activity -- must concede that the dispersion of communicants
across the globe is bound to raise difficult questions of choice
of law, personal jurisdiction, and venue.

 <P>
       As I understand them, both national and international law
doctrines regarding jurisdiction rely heavily on questions
regarding the (1) the extent of the voluntary "contacts" the
relevant person has had with the interested jurisdiction and (2)
the fairness of asserting personal jurisdiction over the acts of a
foreign person.  There is a sliding scale, with the importance of
looking to fairness becoming greater as the extent of contacts
diminishes. There may also be a corrollation between a state's
assertion of jurisdiction over a person or matter and its
practical ability to enforce a judgment. Thus, the application of
a particular jurisdiction's law to the substance of a dispute
similarly depends upon a combination of voluntary actions
(contacts and contracts) and a weighting of the extent of the
local state's interests (and abilities) to protect its citizens
from outside abuse.

<P>
        Cyberspace intensifies all of the mysteries surrounding
these already mysterious matters.  The net allows more people to
have many more "contacts" with jurisdictions in which they do not
live -- and which they may never physically visit.  The
informality and unpredictability of communications across
interconnected networks may make it hard to determine when there
has been a voluntary "contract" to submit to or abide by some
local law. It is hard to determine "where" online acts occur or,
in some cases, even "where" some types of injury (e.g., to the
reputation of a pseudonym used only on the net) are
suffered. And the net calls the enforcement ability of national
sovereigns into question, at least with regard to activity online.

<P>
        But, I submit, there may be something of a solution to
these technologically-spawned jurisdictional mysteries
in the technology itself.  The rise of cross-jurisdictional
communications can compound the question of what is "fair."  But
it can also help answer it if we adopt a new sort of
jurisdictional relativism -- if we accept the notion that one
electronic contact deserves another, of "jurisdiction in kind."
More specifically, we might decide that any given territorial
sovereign has jurisdiction over (and can apply it's law to) any
person and set of actions in cyberspace to precisely the same
extent as, and in the manner that, the person and actions entered
the electronic space the sovereign nation can control.

 <P>
       For example, building on cases regarding the fairness of a
state's asserting personal jurisdiction over a foreign person just
because that person made a telephone call into the state,
scholars have debated whether the passage of an Internet message
into or through a physical jurisdiction is enough to support
personal jurisdiction for purposes of regulation or righting a
wrong. That's too stark a question.  Why not concede that the
state in question can of course assert jurisdiction to the extent
it can do so by sending and receiving Internet messages?

 <P>
       The traditional "fairness" inquiry asks whether there was
enough consensual contact to allow a state to require the person
in question to "appear" (physically) in its courts. The new
jurisdictional relativism would say that, if she perpetrated some
wrong by e-mail, a person may be required to "appear" in
interested local courts by e-mail. Moreover, a state may be
justified in such a case in applying its own laws to protect its
citizens -- if and to the extent that it can enforce those laws by
means of e-mail. For example, consider an incoming message, sent
from a distant person who could not fairly (or feasibly) be
required to appear in local courts, that allegedly violates
local laws against fraudulent advertising.  The offended country
might still assert jurisdiction to hold a hearing by e-mail and
then to enforce any resulting judgment by means of implementing a
filter or "cancelbot" that would preclude or monitor future
messages of that type from that person (assuming that was the
appropriate penalty under local law). The local state might also
levy on any local assets of the perpetrator, of course, but even
if there were none the local authority would have the ability to
use the new medium to protect its local interests with respect to
that medium.

  <P>
      I certainly don't want to encourage more regulation or
assertions of jurisdiction by territorial sovereigns with respect
to the vulnerable and valuable international networks -- much
less prior restraint of free speech conducted by e-mail. The net
should be allowed to grow without premature intervention by any
legal authorities other than those that spontaneously arise
online. But we can also recognize and plan for the inevitable
desires of local politicians to be seen to protect local
interests.  Until we get a global first amendment, we have reason
to fear that overreaching and overreaction might lead to
disconcerting surprises and ugly clashes between legal systems.
One way to reduce these jurisdictional conflicts is to recognize
the net as a new jurisdiction. A second, interim way would be to
limit the assertions of jurisdiction by local states to those
rooted (procedurally and with respect to enforcement) in precisely
the same kind of "contacts" that gave rise to the question in the
first place.

<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>Responsibility and Roles in Cyberspace</TITLE></HEAD>
<BODY>
<h3>Responsibility and Roles in Cyberspace</h3>

<h4>By: David R. Johnson</h4>
<hr>

  <P>
      A lot of law is about responsibility. One fundamental
principle of law is that everyone is responsible for her own
actions.  A lot of law also has to do with "vicarious"
responsibility, such as that of a principal for the actions
of an agent.  And key issues surrounding "standards of care"
and even contractual interpretation revolve, in the end,
on basic rules regarding who is "responsible" for taking,
or having taken, particular actions under specified circumstances.

 <P>
       As we contemplate the impact of global electronic
communication on the way we experience law, and the rise of law on
the net itself, one central problem stems from the tendency of the
network to obscure identity -- and a consequent tendency to blur
the whole question of responsibility.  The net technically allows
one person to appear as many different personae, in many different
roles. It allows the partial or complete screening of the "real"
identity of the person on the other end of an e-mail. It allows
the creation of ad hoc groups -- with "corporate" identities of
their own -- that may or may not persist or have a bank account. So
even though we might still agree as a general matter that "everyone
is responsible for his own acts," it can become unclear,
in Cyberspace, who that everyone is and which acts belong to whom.

 <P>
       This is not just a temporary phenomenon, rooted in a
failure of system administrators to enforce security measures. To
the contrary, electronic communication encourages the creation of
new electronic masks and action across new semi-permeable corporate
membranes.  Many early users of the net affirmatively welcome the
ability to use a pseudonym -- it lets them escape into a fictional
world of their own making.  And even the most down-to-earth
business user confronts the ambiguities of electronic role playing.
She has to wonder about whether the e-mail sent to the discussion
group on the net from work will be understood to be offered in
her role as an employee, or simply as a member of the discussion
list, or perhaps as part of her hobby or home business. Lawyers
wonder whether consulting through the net creates a "virtual" law
firm partnership, with consequent responsibilities for the actions
and inaction of others.  Everyone online is playing with the very
substance of identity and responsibility.

   <P>
     There have always been mysteries surrounding the law's
regulation of those who act in a particular "capacity", of course.
We don't normally think about it.  But the very terms "frolic and
detour" connote the helpful role played by physical location in
signalling the capacity in which we and our employees and
principals may be understood to undertake specified
"responsibilities".  In the real world, we have a physical office
building to give the cue that we are probably dealing with someone
in their role as an employee authorized to bind their corporate
employer.  In Cyberspace, we may have only an e-mail address, and
we can't even be sure that isn't a fake. In the real world, we have
physical cues that allow us to tailor our actions and speech to
the recipient, taking into account their age, apparent abilities
and so forth.

  <P>
      In Cyberspace, we know something about the online actions
of those who visit any given "forum," but we know only what they
chose to show -- and we know nothing about the rest of their lives.
The rise of the net thus exacerbates the problem of fitting
responsibility to roles because users can put on and take off a
role with a single keystroke and because the net shields us from
knowledge about all the other capacities that might be enjoyed (or
adopted) by a particular person and that might support our own
actions.

  <P>
      Two fundamental solutions to these problems present
themselves. We could insist on re-inserting into networked
communications the types of clues and ascertainable information
that would once again make us more comfortable that we know, or
could easily find out, the identity of those with whom we are
dealing.  Alternatively, we could enhance the capability of
Cyberspace to hide the "real person" behind the actions
taken there, and re-formulate our legal rules to fit this
attribute of the virtual landscape. In all likelihood, we will
do some of both, thereby creating distinct areas of Cyberspace
in which the law of responsibility will have to be formulated
quite differently -- a law of the open, anonymous electronic
street and a law of more private, more fully "responsible"
electronic gathering places.

 <P>
       In the areas of Cyberspace in which identities are
required to be "real" and "roles" involving action on behalf of
principals must be fully disclosed, not much of our legal doctrine
will change in any fundamental way.  A traditional legal system
will be able to enforce traditional rules, because it will be able
to tell who took any potentially injurious action. The
question whether the enforcement of obligations and duties in such
a sphere will be done by existing territorial authorities, or by a
new set of net-based institutions, is a minor jurisdictional
detail that has more to do with transaction costs than anything
else.

  <P>
      In contrast, in the areas of Cyberspace where "real"
identity is masked and roles are not required to be correlated or
disclosed, the law will have to change fundamentally. There will
be no hope of tracking down and punishing the "real" perpetrator
of a harm (or enforcing an electronic contract against the "real"
signatory).  So the law will only be able to deal with the portion
of a person represented by their ID -- and it will only be able to
operate on rights and assets that are explicitly associated with
that ID.  If the law wants to impose rules that establish duties
to other participants of the net, it will have to do so with
reference to the revealed characteristics of those participants
(e.g., what they say their age or sex or educational level is, and
how they behave online -- not what they are "really" like as
individuals). There can still be meaningful law, with all its usual
doctrines about duties of care, authority to bind principles,
and so forth, but it will be a law that does not purport to deal
with whole persons. It will be a law that deals only with roles
and applies its duties and sanctions only INSOFAR AS someone
continues to play the role in question.

 <P>
       Actually, the contrast may appear starker than it really
is. If you look hard at the real world of whole persons, you start
to see that people are only allowed to appear in court when and to
the extent they occupy certain roles or make claims in certain
capacities.  Similarly, Cyberspace will be built in part on a
process by which those acting in the space will pour more and
more reliable reality into the "roles" they play there. We will
have cybercorporations that are at least as persistent and
credit worthy as their real world counterparts. We will have
sanctions that work effectively, even though imposed only
against an e-mail ID, because whoever is behind the ID will invest
more and more in establishing the reputation of that particular
online identity.

 <P>
       But the two online spheres will be different. And their
co-existence will open up a whole new potential sphere of choice.
We will be able to create and destroy our roles more freely. And
we will be able to choose what portion of our lives to spend in
fully identifiable capacities and what portion to spend in
untraceable role playing.  So the net will create new freedoms
and, correspondingly, new challenges for the role of the law in
creating and enforcing those responsibilities that make freedom
operate for the greater good.

<h3>Rewarding Authorship in Cyberspace--Is Intellectual Property the Answer or the Problem?</h3>

<h4>By: David R. Johnson</h4><hr>

  <P>
      The National Information Infrastructure Advisory
Committee has a special subcommittee on protection of
intellectual property rights. Assistant Attorney General Anne
Bingaman will propose guidelines regarding preservation of
intellectual property, consistently with antitrust laws, on the
information superhighway -- noting in her announcement how
important intellectual property protection is to eliciting
authorship.

  <P>
     An MIT student is arrested for hosting a computer bulletin
board that allowed users to copy software.  A Florida sysop is
held liable for users' actions in uploading Playboy photos
without his knowledge.  Everywhere we turn, there are stern
warnings that the new ease of making electronic copies will
destroy incentives for the creation of new works -- and,
therefore, that the network will destroy culture as we know it
unless strong new measures are taken to enforce copyright and
patent laws.

 <P>
       Let me try to make the contrary case: the case that
intellectual property law is creating serious problems and that we
need to find ways to weaken our current protections dramatically
for intellectual property, at least insofar as these protections
apply to short electronic works in the form of text exchanged over
the networks.

<P>
        I will limit my argument to short text works, for the
moment, but IP law is causing problems in lots of different
areas.  The complexity of assembling diverse copyrighted
materials of all types is inhibiting the creation of multi-media
works (without corresponding positive benefits).  Claims by West
Publishing Company to "own" the copyright to the page numbers in
their compilations of court cases are inhibiting the electronic
publication of the law in counterproductive ways (without
producing any offsetting useful effects). The rise of serious
prospects for patenting software and protecting functional
"interface" features with copyright is stunting the growth of a
creative new industry.

 <P>
       The most striking contrast between copyright and common
sense now concerns its application to short text messages
exchanged via electronic networks.  The new Berne convention
doctrines providing that every e-mail message is automatically
copyrighted, without the benefit even of a notice, combined with
suggestions that copyright compliance must be vigorously
enforced by system operators at their own peril chills the
kinds of free-wheeling discussions and message-forwarding
essential to development of our new electronic global dialog.

 <P>
       When our culture was an oral one, the key form of
"copying" was story-telling. No one "owned" the story -- but
good storytellers could make a living because not everyone had
the skills to practice their art.  When the printing press made
it easier to distribute permanent copies, the state intervened
to create artificial monopolies by creating a new "ownership" law.
But the best protections of authors' and publishers' prerogatives
stemmed from the cost of a press and the difficulty and cost of
copying as compared to the relatively low cost of buying an
authorized copy. Now that it's so easy and cheap to make an
electronic copy, all the pressure is placed on the legal scheme.
Yet the rise in unauthorized copying may be not so much a sign of
declining morality as a signal that the new medium should be
treated differently from the old.

<P>
        In a brilliant article in _Wired_ magazine, John Perry
Barlow suggests that an increase in electronic copying will not
destroy culture as we know it -- because we will revert to arts
that are more like story telling and live performance. I agree
that our bards will still make a living, because they will,
uniquely, give great e-mail. We can reward those who create great
works online by paying to listen to them in a timely fashion,
-- without worrying that those sitting attentively around the
electronic campfire may retell the tale to others. There is an
incentive to pay to get the next day's story -- and the
interactive and iterative character of the medium makes it matter
whether you are receiving the message directly from the author or
indirectly from a member of the author's audience.

  <P>
      I think this is all great news -- unless the law screws
things up. It means that the works easiest to protect and charge
for in cyberspace will be those that are truly interactive -- those
that demand the presence of the author in a capacity allowing give
and take.

<h3> The Unscrupulous Diner's Dilemma and Anonymity in Cyberspace</h3>

<h4> By: David R. Johnson</h4><hr>

<P>
        We are beginning to understand, on a scientific basis, the
fundamentals of group behavior -- and this new understanding has
implications for the law of cyberspace.  This month's Scientific
American includes a fascinating article on "the Dynamics of Social
Dilemmas" -- a study of cooperation featuring the example of a
group that has agreed to split the meal check evenly and then
must decide, individually, whether to order lobster or hot dog.
The bottom line: collaboration occurs in groups that are small,
last a long time, and know a lot about each other.

 <P>
       At a glance, this finding seems a disaster for the
prospect of civilization in cyberspace, where communications span
the globe, clusters of online citizens meet only sporadically and
for brief periods, and the malleable nature of the medium can
cloak much of the information about others online. How can Counsel
Connect, for example, hope to foster collegiality in the legal
profession's electronic guildhall if the scientists are right?
Won't the participants in transitory, impersonal communications
across large groups engage in "free riding", spoofing and
exploitation -- and subject us, collectively, to a tragedy of the
electronic commons?

 <P>
       To the contrary, it turns out that electronic
communications foster just the type of trust and collaboration the
scientists predict for small, stable and personable groups -- they
give rise to community -- IF certain ground rules apply. If users
are allowed to form separate areas of the system, then even large
systems appear, functionally, to consist of much smaller groups of
"regulars." The local pub (or cracker barrel, as some would say)
emerges naturally.  If users are required to communicate under
their own identity, then there is less temptation to exploit
others or abuse trust.  Particularly in the context of a
professional communications network, the participants behave
responsibly (even thoughtfully) because they have to expect to
continue to be found at the same electronic address throughout
their professional careers. And, over time, even this
text-based medium is rich enough to convey as sense of
personal acquaintance with those we have never met face to
face. Repeated selfless contributions to the community will be
remembered and can be rewarded over time by the group -- and
antisocial conduct can be punished.

  <P>
      If the electronic network creates new, tightly integrated
social groups capable of eliciting collaboration and punishing
defection, then these groups may exercise more powerful social
control than those that apply in the "real" world -- and there may
be less need for a more formal type of "law" in cyberspace.
Everyone knows that complex contracts count for less when parties
must deal repeatedly with each other and become highly
interdependent.  The US has more lawyers than any other country,
the theory goes, because we are so much less integrated as a
social group than the homogeneous cultures of other countries. As
we all move our commercial transactions to "EDI" (electronic data
interchange) and portions of our cultural and social lives become
electronic, perhaps we will all live in more homogeneous online
cultures and the need for lawyers will decline.  There might be a
need for protection of the rights of individuals against such
groups -- but diversity coupled with freedom to find a group
compatible with each individual's values may even make such formal
rights less necessary. The real conflicts in cyberspace seem more
likely to occur between groups, across social boundaries.

<P>
        Presumably, the scientists' findings apply to interactions
between groups as well. We can expect collaboration to
arise between distinct cyberspace cultures that must deal with
each other on a continuing basis. The optimal conditions can be
approximated IF the system operators can effectively speak for
their members and control their members' activities. I predict
that we will see the rise of compacts between SYSOPs regarding
such matters as accurate labelling of files, enforcement of rules
privacy, and system security. To some degree, the global
Internet is already based on an informal set of such agreements.
But any such agreements will require the collaborating systems to
be able to enforce their own local rules locally -- and that
implies an ability to identify (and discipline) anyone who
deviates from such rules.

 <P>
       The ultimate implication, I believe, is that to achieve a
civilized form of cyberspace, we have to limit the use of
anonymous communications.  Many early citizens of cyberspace will
bitterly oppose any such development, arguing that anonymous and
pseudonymous electronic communications are vital to preserve
electronic freedoms and allow free expression of human
personality.  But the problem with that view is that we all
collectively face the diners' dilemma -- we must collaborate in
groups to build a rich social fabric, and we know that the ability
to act anonymously, sporadically, in large groups brings out the
worst in human character.  One thing is clear: the architecture of
the network will have a profound impact on the nature of the
societies that form there. Now that we know what's at stake, it's
time for the sysops who control key policies (such as those
associated with the identity and identifiability of participants)
to build in the structures that hold the greatest potential for

<h3>Volume Controls in Cyberspace? -- Hard First Amendment Questions
in the Age of Electronic Networking</h3>

<h4>By: David R. Johnson</h4><hr>

 <P>
       Electronic speech, transmitted over the global networks,
has reduced the significance of all physical barriers to
communication. There is no need to travel to make a speech heard
by millions. You don't even need a stamp to send a message around
the world! It's not surprising, therefore, that we are beginning
to see clashes between those who favor the free flow of
information and those who seek to impose limits on what can be
said. The recent obscenity conviction in Memphis of the operators
of a bulletin board physically located in California -- and legal
in California -- is just one example.

  <P>
      Some call for enforcement of the First Amendment in
cyberspace. Some point out that the First Amendment is a local
U.S. ordinance -- not applicable, for example, to those sued in
England or Australia under lower standards applicable to
defamation in those locales. But no one has yet come
to grips with the hard question of how we will balance the
community interests in imposing some limitations on speech
against the desire to facilitate open communication
over the Net.

<P>
        In other words, if we did have a "First Amendment" in
cyberspace, generally agreed upon as a global balancing tool for
the rights of speech and the protection of other interests, what
would it say? How would it read? It couldn't say "Sysops shall
make no rule limiting freedom of speech" -- that just wouldn't be
helpful.  And we certainly can't just apply the FCC rules applicable
to old fashioned broadcasts -- these are justified by a bankrupt
notion of scarcity and premised on centralized control.

<P>
        In the "real" world of speech carried on physical objects
(letters, magazines, etc.) and communicated in local settings
(before assembled audiences), we have acknowledged lots and lots
of limitations. Obscene materials are not protected. Defamation
with malice can give rise to liability. Copyright infringement is
a criminal act. And the courts have upheld all kinds of
limitations on the time, place and manner of speech acts.  You are
not allowed to hold a loud parade at two in the morning in a
residential area.

 <P>
       Cyberspace will have to have similar exceptions to its
First Amendment principles -- but they will have to differ
appropriately in light of the differences in the territory.
Obscenity will have to be defined by the community standards of
particular online forums, with labelling and contracts governing
the decisions by adults to subject themselves (and their
children) to any particular standard.  Defamation law might be
different in an online setting in which the right of reply is
so much more readily available. Copyright law will surely change
substantially, since the ease of non-commercial copying on the
Net will put enormous pressure on the fair use doctrine.

  <P>
      In addition, and perhaps most importantly, the Net will
have to develop its own version of "time place and manner"
regulation.  The screens that lead to cyberspace are in our homes.
Despite the theoretical feasibility of "bozo filters," we need
some protection against an obnoxious tide of electronic junk mail.
Receiving and weeding through e-mail takes a lot of time and
money. There is an analog in cyberspace of unduly LOUD
communication -- sending a broadcast e-mail to lots of unwilling
recipients, or posting extensive off-topic comments in an online
discussion group. In response to obnoxious advertising posted by
two lawyers who "spammed" the net, there is now a body of "judges"
who claim the power to review and cancel inappropriate postings to
usenet newsgroups. (A vigilante "cancelbot" preceded this more
orderly and representative forum.) I can report that LEXIS COUNSEL
CONNECT, the online meeting place for lawyers, has been forced to
limit members' right to send broadcast e-mail -- in response to
complaints about the manner in which this speech is conducted and
its unreasonable tendency to disturb our peace and fill our
mailboxes.

  <P>
      The hard-core First Amendment advocates will object to any
such regulation, arguing that the marketplace of ideas and the
culture of online netiquette (and an occasional flame war) will
keep obnoxious posters in line. I favor the free flow of ideas.
And I realize the spirit of the First Amendment is to protect
unpopular views. But this new form of regulation of time, place and
manner of online speech has nothing to do with the content of the
speech. (No one cares that the spamming lawyers were advertising.)
Moreover, the answer to these First Amendment objections is not
limited to the ultimate right of a majority to protect itself
against unwanted intrusions. The ultimate rationale for creating
rules against unduly loud electronic speech is that we need to be
able to hear ourselves think, collectively.

   <P>
     Kevin Kelly's brilliant new book, "Out of Control," talks
extensively about the emergence of complex adaptive systems and
suggests, as others have, that the global Net is becoming a sort
of "hive mind." If we look at complex structures of this sort, we
see that most involve a large number of connections -- allowing
constant communication between individual elements. But most do
NOT permit one particular individual to speak to the group as a
whole against their will. There is no "leader fish" in a school.
Neurons trade chemical signals primarily with neighbors. Ants and
bees talk relatively quietly among themselves. Undue prominence of
any one unwelcome signal or source or information is a form of
disease or madness or social and political disaster -- a form of
hostage-taking.

  <P>
      I think it is fundamental to our ideas about government
that the state should not have a point of view of its own
distinct from the general desire to increase the freedom and
ability of individuals to express themselves and form communities.
If one voice can overpower, even though purporting to speak on
behalf of or in search of the global good, then the basic
processes of filtering and evaluation that make a group consensus
so wise can be destroyed.

    <P>
    This provides us with one central principle for
developing the limitations on the right to speak in
cyberspace.  We need those limitations to facilitate each
individual's voluntary decisions about what to say and hear and read
and from whom. Speech acts can no more be absolutely protected in
cyberspace than in the "real" world -- indeed, the greater power to
speak may well increase the need for time, place and manner
restrictions. But on the other hand, the apparently limitless
extent of this cyberspace holds out hope that everyone will
be able to find a place to say whatever they want to say --
and that the connectedness of it all will help the best
ideas to win at the end of the day.

<h3>Copyright Infringement</h3>
<h4>Is caching a web page an infringement of copyright?</h4>
<hr>
<p>Every web browser can make a &"cached&" copy of a web page, stored locally, to facilitate rapid access to the page.  In addition, some service providers cache web pages at central locations to speed access by their users.  The question is whether caching without permission from the owner of the copyright is infringing.
<p>Those who favor the free flow of information over the net can argue that posting a web page amounts to granting a license for its redistribution -- that there is an implied license allowing caching. But an implied license might be revoked by express terms -- such as a statement on the face of the web page that retracts any such license.
<p>Technologists would also argue that caching is needed to keep the web running quickly. They might claim that caching is a &'fair use&' within the meaning of traditional copyright law. But opponents of caching could argue that some caching interferes with the ability of the original web site to track traffic -- which has an adverse impact on sales of advertising and therefor disqualifies the caching as a fair use.
<p>One possible means of reducing the problems posed by caching (and by claims that caching is infringing) may be to enhance the html standard to allow those posting web pages to indicate their preferences regarding caching by means of tags and techical switches that can be read and implemented automatically by browsers and server software.
<p>For more extended discussion of this topic, see a September 1, 1995 paper on this subject developed by a Cyberspace Law Institute colloquy, entitled <a href="caching.html">The Special Problem of Caching and Copyright Protection</a>

<h3>Copyright Infringement</h3>
<h4>Should sysops be liable for infringement by users?</h4>
<hr>
<p>Some cases have suggested that system operators should be strictly liable for any copyright infringement by their users, whether or not they were on notice of such infringement or took reasonable steps following such notice. Sysops, in contrast, have argued that they are mere carriers and, despite their need to reserve some control over the materials on their systems, cannot monitor all online activity and should not have any liability for users actions.
<p>The most recent case to consider this issue, Netcom vs. Church of Scientology, suggested that a sysop may be liable for contributory infringement, but only after being put on reasonable notice of an infringing file and, only then, if the sysop failed to take reasonable action. This seems like a sensible solution, but it leaves open the question when notice is &'reasonable&' and what actions must be taken once prima facia infringement has been shown.
<p>The Cyberspace Law Institute's Virtual Magistrate project is designed to help copyright owners, sysops and users by providing a means -- rapid online arbitration -- to determine when it is reasonable for a sysop to take down an allegedly infringing (or otherwise wrongful) file. The idea is that, rather than having risk averse sysops delete any file challenged by any alleged rights holder, sysops will be protected from liability if they defer to the judgments of a neutral third party.

<h3>Copyright Infringement</h3>
<h4>Should standard copyright principles apply in Cyberspace?</h4>
<hr>
<p>Maybe.
<p>Copyright law in brickspace attempts to balance incentives for authors and opportunities for dissemination of information. Strong copyright protection generally is a more effective incentive for authors but reduces the ability of others to build upon the author's efforts.
<p>Traditional copyright law generally places the burden on the user to get permission from the copyright holder to make a new physical copy. It is easy to tell when you are making a physical copy of a book, and most people don't need to make a copy of a book in order to read it. In contrast, in Cyberspace, even browsing causes a copy to be made. And placing the burden on the user to get permission to make a copy could interfere with the most natural and valuable uses of this new global copying machine we call Cyberspace.
<p>Copyright protection is an important incentive for authors because they rely on the right to prohibit copying to obtain compensation in brickspace. There is a question whether many of the authors who write in Cyberspace need this incentive. Some have suggested that the absence of strong copyright will lead to the absence of content in cyberspace. Look around online and tell us if you think there is not enough content here.

<h3>Access Rights and Spamming</h3>
<h4>Does a sysop have the right to deny access to any person or posting for any reason?</h4>
<hr>
<p>We are used to thinking of system operators (those who own systems and control the issuance of IDs and passwords, or physical links, that give access to the system) as property owners -- or publishers -- who in general should have discretion to admit or deny access to users or content as they see fit.
<p>This view makes sense as long as there are many alternative routes by which any given user or idea can makes its way out to the wider world. So far, it appears that a user denied access to any one online system will be able, at a reasonable cost, to get access by some other means. And it also looks like no one system can dominate the online marketplace of ideas.
<p>But problems may arise in cases in which a user has invested heavily in establishing a particular online identity. In such cases, arbitrary denial of continuing access can impose substantial costs. Even if non-negotiable contracts under which access is given reserve the right to the sysop to withdraw access without "just cause", such contracts might be found unconscionable or otherwise be rendered unenforceable if the sysop's reservation of a right to terminate a user's ID imposes serious harm in a surprising way without a substantial and reasonable (and lawful) business purpose.
<p> Similarly, some particular systems may become subject to requirements to carry particular substantive materials -- or may be prohibited from engaging in &quot;censorship&quot. For example, some governmental or educational forum's may be required to be open to all otherwise lawful postings. Where the harm from exclusion is great, and where the forum is an important one that might be said to have some duty to act evenhandedly or to serve a public function, there may be a right to access. 
<P>In short, the more decentralized the new online medium remains, the more clear it will be that each sysop should remain free to build whatever "flavor" of online space that particular sysop thinks will be most valuable to its desired constituency. But if "bottlenecks" develop, or if the expectations of users are undercut in ways that impose substantial losses without adequate justification, then a case to restrict sysop editorial freedom in specific ways, in some limited cases, might emerge.

<h3>Privacy and Trade Secrets</h3>
<h4>Should a sysop have the right to monitor private email messages?</h4>
<hr>
<p>Within any given system, the right of the system operator to monitor posting and messages turns on what rules and terms and conditions have been agreed to by the users. Even the U.S. wiretap statute (the Electronic Communications Privacy Act) deliberately allows access to messages with the consent of the originator or intended recipient. And ECPA contemplates that employers may access messages sent on their behalf by employees.
<P>But the question whether a sysop SHOULD monitor "private" email messages is different from the question whether such activity will trigger legal liability. Enticing users to send messages they come to consider "private" (i.e., expect to be disclosed only to addressees), but then monitoring those messages systematically, is, at a minimum, impolite.  Arguably, it ought to be considered to violate a general principle favoring the protection of private communications on the net.
<P>The policy questions all come down to (1) what is meant by "private" and (2) what kinds of expectations of privacy (or public disclosure)  sysops want to create with respect to  particular sets of messages and users. We need public "bulletin boards" -- like usenet newsgroups. And we need private email.
<P>In some limited cases, there may be grounds for a sysop to monitor private email for limited periods. For example, ECPA recognizes that a sysop may need to access private messages in order to protect the security of its system or to comply with a lawful warrant of a law enforcement agency. But even these exceptions do not contemplate or permit systematic monitoring of messages the senders of which would expect to be kept private.

<h3>Privacy and Trade Secrets</h3>
<h4>Should sysops who are employers of employee users have any special rights or duties with regard to access to employee's email messages?</h4>
<hr>
<p>Insofar as employees act as the agents of their employers, there is an argument that the employer (the "principal" on whose behalf the employee acts) should have the right to access the employee's emails or to consent to their diclosure to others.
<P>But some employers see the wisdom of providing employee's with a private workspace. These employers typically either provide a means for employees to label incidental personal email or impose restrictions on any actions taken to access employee email without prior consent of the employee concerned.
<P>Some employers argue that the fact that they own or pay for the equipment used by employees gives them the right to monitor or access any employee messages. This argument proves too much. Employers regularly supply pens and paper and telephones. But that doesn't give them the right to access any personal communications. And most employers do not seek to ban any incidental use of company property, because attempting to do so would hurt morale.
<P>Some employer sysops may have special duties to access the email messages of employees in order to respond to legal process, assure compliance with applicable laws, and fulfill contractual obligations to third parties.
<P>In general, the use of email and other electronic communication tools in a work setting does raise special issues relating to the duties of the employer and employee to others. But most of questions can be resolved reasonably by application of common sense, clear communication of applicable rules, and implementation of procedures that responsibly and thoughtfully take the interests of all concerned into account.

<h3>Sysop Liability -- Different Types of Sysop Liability</h3>
<hr>
<P> There are three basic, different, types of sysop liability:

<ul>
<li>Direct</a>
<li>Vicarious</a>
<li>Contributory</a>
</ul>
<P>
Direct Liability is liability for the sysop's own actions or negligence.
<P>
Vicarious Liability is liability of the sysop for the actions of its employees and agents.
<P>
Contributory Liability is liability of the sysop for the actions it takes that contribute in some way to wrongdoing by others.
<P>
In general, a sysop will be liable for his or her own wrongdoing. A company acting as a sysop is liable for the wrongdoing of its employees if they are acting within the scope of their employment.
<P>
In this course, we will focus on the last category: "Contributory Liability", because a key question facing all sysops is the extent to which they are or should be held liable for the wrongful postings or other actions of their users.

<h3>Sysop Liability -- A First Example</h3>
<hr>
<P> 
Imagine that you are a sysop running a publicly available discussion group on the net. (Let's say you use some "bulletin board system" software that allows the posting of sequential messages and the uploading of files). Your system is focused on tropical fish and you encourage your users to discuss the best way to manage their acquariums. You don't charge for access to your system, and just spend a few minutes a day maintaining it, as a hobby. You don't prescreen uploaded files and you have never had any problems with computer viruses, user disagreements, or anything else.
<P>
One day, while you are out mowing the lawn, a member of your small online community uploads a software program that is designed to help tropical fish hobbyists keep track of their fish and their tanks. It's a great program, lots of interesting data and a friendly interface. 
<P>
Before you have finished raking up the cuttings, several of your users have downloaded the file.
<P>
Mowing the lawn has made you so tired that you decide to put off your regular check of your online system until the next day. By the time you log on, 15 hours later, the file has been downloaded 25 times.
<P>
There is just one problem. In your emailbox, you find an angry note from a person who claims to have written the software program. The note demands that you remove the file "immediately" and threatens a suit for copyright infringement. 
<P>
What should you do?
<ul>
<li><a href="ex1del.html">Delete the file and send a note of apology</a>
<li><a href="ex1ig.html">Ignore the note</a>
<li><a href="ex1send.html">Send an email to the user who posted the file asking for his views</a>

<h3>Sysop Liability -- Arguments</h3>
<hr>
<P> <h4>Arguments for sysop liability:<br></h4>
<ul>
<li>Sysops stand to gain from the activities of users. They should bear the costs those activities create.
<li>Sysops are the only people in a position to deter and penalize wrongful actions. Strict liability will give them the incentive to stop users from causing harm.
<li>Everyone should be liable for failing to take reasonably available steps to prevent foreseeable harm.
<li>Sysops exercise editorial control over the materials that appear on their systems. They are just like other "publishers" and they should be held responsible for what they publish.

<li>Sysops will overreact, out of fear of liability, and will delete postings that are lawful and should be protected, thereby chilling the free exchange of information on the net.
<li>People should be responsible only for the harm they do themselves. We should impose liability on actual wrongdoers, not innocent sysops.
<li>Sysops are just like "common carriers" and they should be given immunity from any liablity for carrying allegedly wrongful messages, so they will be encouraged to carry all messages without discrimination.
<li>Sysops should not be held liable unless they are on notice that a posted comment is clearly unlawful -- and should be required, even then, only to take actions that are readily available and not unduly burdensome. 
</ul>

<h3>Sysop Liability -- Analogies</h3>
<hr>
The question whether a sysop should be liable for wrongful postings by users has been argued to turn on various analogies. Ultimately, we may have to analyze the role of sysops on its own terms -- taking into account the actual circumstances facing sysops, users and victims of harmful messages, rather than trying to stretch prior cases to fit this new phenomenon. But it may be useful to consider some of the rules applicable to other intermediaries who carry messages that might be found to be infringing, defamatory, criminal or otherwise wrongful:<br>

<h3>Sysop Liability -- Example 2</h3>
<hr>
<P>
Consider, again, that you run the tropical fish bulletin board system and that a user has posted a message suggesting that the ABC Tropical Fish Distribution Company sends out diseased fish and refuses to supply replacements when the fish die in transit. 
<P>
ABCTFC calls, irate, claiming the message is untrue and threatening to sue for "trade libel". You give them a chance to post their rebuttal online. But the user who posted the original message refuses to retract his comment or apologize. Finally, ABCTFC serves you with a formal demand that you take the message down or be subject to suit as a redistributor of a defamatory message.
<P>
Which of the following arguments is the best one to make to defend your decision not to take the message down? 
<ul>
<li><a href="false.html">The original message is true and truth is a defense to any libel claim</a>
<li><a href="slander.html">The online posting is merely slander, not libel, so there must be proof of specific damages to justify any award</a>
<li><a href="FA.html">The First Amendment protects comments about commercial services</a>
<li><a href="FA2.html">The First Amendment protects distributors of messages like you from suit</a>
<li><a href="proof.html">You are not on reasonable notice that the message is wrongful until the fish store provides proof that it is right</a>
<li><a href="opinion.html">The comment is mere opinion and, thus, not actionable</a>
<li><a href="reply.html">Once you have provided the offended party with a right of reply, you should not be liable -- because the truth will prevail in an open marketplace for ideas</a>
<li><a href="immunity.html">As a "common carrier" of messages, you have immunity</a>
<li><a href="store.html">Your operation is like a bookstore</a>

</ul>
<P>

Whatever you argued, here is  <a href="result.html">what is likely to happen in this case</a>.

<h3>Sysop Liability -- Proposals for Change</h3>
<hr>
<P>
Given current uncertainty about the exposure of sysops to liability for the wrongful actions of users, and the accompanying chill on the free flow of information over the net, there have been several proposals for change in applicable rules. 
<P> 
An "Electronic Communications Forwarding Act", which was discussed some years ago, would give sysops immunity for merely forwarding the messages of others, provided that they did not sponsor or promote the messages as their own or actively interfere with the ability of an allegedly harmed party to identify and seek redress against the wrongdoer.
<P>
The Communications Decency Act, passed as part of the telecommunications reform bill, contains a provision that seeks to make clear that those who merely transmit online messages should not be deemed to be "publishers" of the materials -- but it does not apply to intellectual property claims and its complex language has not been construed in any specific case.
<P>
Some would argue that the "reasonable notice" and "reasonable action" standards embodied in the Netcom case provide the best hope for a workable solution. The "Virtual Magistrate" pilot project was begun on the premise that a sysop should be best able to defend its decision to take down or leave up an allegedly offending file if turned the complaint over to a neutral third party for rapid online arbitration. This pilot project is just beginning and it is too soon to determine whether it will provide a meaningful solution.

Please write your essay -- no more than five paragraphs -- on the following hypothetical: <br>
<P>
<b>A user of America Online uploads a graphical file that contains a picture of the Little Mermaid, but without her sea shells. No AOL employee sees the posting for several weeks. Disney eventually notices it and complains. AOL consults with the poster, who claims that the file is a "parody" of Disney's movie and as such is protected by copyright law and the First Amendment. AOL decides to leave the posting up. Disney sues AOL (the poster is so poor as to be "judgment proof"). The suit is brought in England. Under English law, the posting is found, on analysis, to be defamatory. AOL still argues that it should not be held liable for its actions, because it did not author or post the message. Who should win, and why?</b>

<hr>
<P>
Various laws may limit your options in establishing a company email policy. And you need to consider the implications of any policy for other types of activities and for employee morale.
<P>
Your policies regarding email should be consistent with company policy regarding other issues relating to privacy, use of company property, and access to employee workspaces. But there are some special features of electronic communications that you might want to take into account in formulating your policies on this new medium.
<P>

Dip into the materials below, as you feel necessary, to review the factors that bear generally on your selection of a combination of policy options.

<center><H1>Company Email Policy -- Procedural Considerations</h1>

</center>

<hr>
<P>
Your company should have a policy regarding access to and use of company email and <em> it should tell all employees what that policy is</em>.
<P>
The most sustainable and productive policies are those that give appropriate respect to employees' desire for and expectations of privacy, and that also provide for responsible and thoughtful procedures when legal obligations or business needs suggest that some invasion of those privacy interests is warranted.  Indeed, the very existence of a policy and of an appropriate procedure for balancing the interests of the many parties involved in this issue may itself be the most valuable tool to defend against after the fact attacks on any particular company practices.
<P>
You should include employees (as well as technical experts, lawyers, and management) in the process of forumating your company policies on these issues. Employee users of the system will help spot issues and their involvement will help you develop sound policies that achieve widespread acceptance and respect. Don't adopt policies or procedures that you would be embarrassed to describe fully to your employees -- or to see described in the morning newspaper.
<P>
While you are formulating your company policy, you should gather some key information regarding the nature and extent of your company's electronic messaging systems, who has access to what types of data, what provisions have been made for backups and security, who is charged with responding to requests for access by third parties, and who has done what to assess and minimize foreseeable risks.
<P>
Make sure your policy is consistent with and incorporated into whatever process you use to establish and disseminate other company policies.

<h3>Sysop Liability -- What is a Sysop?</h3>
<hr>
<P> A system operator ("Sysop") is the person who controls the operation of an online system, including the access IDs, passwords, and other software and hardware systems and settings that control access to the system.
<P>
Specifically, the term sysop is used here to refer to the person who sets policies or rules for an online system. It does not connote merely the person providing technical support or engaged in day to day operations (though that may be done by the person setting the rules).
<P>
Sysops are the de facto legislators of the net. They are also it's sherriffs and lord high executioners. Absent agreements or practices to the contrary, they have the power to admit or banish users, establish applicable rules, delete files, create software filters, establish security measures, and otherwise determine the characteristics of any particular online place.

<h3>Sysop Liability -- What kinds of liability?</h3>
<hr>
<P> An injured party (or a governmental prosecutor) might seek to impose liability on a sysop for various reasons, including:<br>
<UL>
<li>Failure to provide access to the system, as promised.
<li>Negligently allowing the system to spread a computer virus.
<li>Cooperating with a fraudulant scheme.
<li>Invading the privacy of a user.
<li>Collaborating in criminal activities.
</ul>
or
<ul>
<li>Allowing distribution of copyrighted material posted by a user without authorization.
<li>Facilitating dissemination of defamatory material posted by a user.

</ul>
<P>
Note that the first portion of the list concerns actions taken directly by the system operator, probably with some knowledge and intent, whereas the second portion concerns "vicarious" or "contributory" liability on the part of the sysop for actions taken by others. It is this latter kind of liability that will be the focus of this course.

<h3>Sysop Liability -- Who might impose liability?</h3>
<hr>
<P> Good question.
<P>
Obviously, most aggrieved persons will bring suit in the courts of the states or countries in which they live. And prosecutors seeking to impose liablity on wrongful actors will seek to bring them into the courts where they have authority. But wrongdoers on the net may be hard to find -- and can be anywhere in the world.
<P>
Liability may also be established by contract and may be imposed as a result of an arbitration or other "alternative dispute resolution" proceedure.
<P>
For purposes of this course, we'll assume that a U.S. federal or state court has jurisdiction over a system operator whose equipment and personnel are within the territory over which the court has jurisdiction.

<h3>Sysop Liability -- A First Example</h3>
<h4>You answered: Delete the file and send a note of apology</h4>
<hr>
<P> 
Well, that might tend to reduce your risks of liability.
<P>
But it might also be a bit premature. Suppose it turns out that the person who sent you the email doesn't actually own the copyright or might be determined to have given an express or implied license to the poster? 
<P>
Moreover, your this action may or may not be enough to preclude your liability.  The infamous "Frena" case seemed to say that a sysop operator is liable for distribution by user actions of copyrighted files without regard to whether or not the sysop had knowledge of the activity.  
<P>
Let's look at the various <a href="args.html">arguments</a> that might be made for and against a finding of liability in this case.

You ignore the note at your peril.

Now that you are on notice of a claim that your system is being used to disseminate copyrighted material, you may be found liable for contributory infringement unless you take reasonable steps to prevent the harm.

<h3>Sysop Liability -- A First Example</h3>
<h4>You answered: Send an email to the user who posted the file asking for his views</h4>
<hr>
<P> 
It's always a good idea to investigate -- and to give your users the consideration of asking their views. 
<P>
Sending the note to the poster may be enough to elicit an apology and to cause the user to take the copy of the file down. But the user may contest the complaining party's case, arguing that the software is not copyrighted or that the poster has a license to distribute it. 
<P>
In any event, some harm has already been done (assuming the software is protected by copyright). Maybe you should take the file down immediately. Maybe you should contact those who downloaded it (if you have this information) to warn them that their actions were not authorized. You should certainly also send a note to the complaining party to tell them what you are doing and make sure they know you are acting responsibly.

<h3>Sysop Liability -- Analogies</h3>
<h4>Telephone Companies</h4>

<hr>
<P>

In the United States, telephone companies are treated as "common carriers" and are given immunity by statute from any liability for the wrongful content of messages they carry. 
<P>
This immunity is justified in part in terms of the requirement that phone companies provide connections to all comers at tarriffed rates. It may also be defended on the ground that the phone company may not monitor private communications -- thought it may do so under some circumstances. Another rationale for this immunity is that it helps to avoid censorship.

<h4>Newspapers and Magazines</h4>

<hr>
<P>

Newspapers and magazines are treated as "publishers" of all the materials in their publications.  
<P>
In the United States, they have First Amendment protection -- freedom of the press. But the First Amendment doesn't protect copyright infringment or malicious defamation. So Newspapers and Magazines may be liable for the contents they publish. If they recklessly disregard the question of truth, they may be liable for the defamatory quality of letters from readers or advertisements. If they are negligent with regard to messages that facilitate grave intentional harm, they may also be liable. And, under some cases, they may be strictly liable for copyright infringement, even if they were not aware that the materials they publish are infringing (though their state of knowledge may be taken into account in setting damages).

<h4>Television Stations</h4>

<hr>
<P>

Based on the argument that radio spectrum is scarce -- and that the television medium is pervasive -- TV Stations have been subjected to an elaborate regulatory scheme and may even lose their licenses if the materials they broadcast do not meet a "public interest" standard.  
<P>
In contrast, some TV and cable stations required to provide "public access" for third parties to broadcast materials not controlled by the networks or the licensed stations, have been granted immunity for any liability for such broadcasts -- on the basis of the "common carrier" analogy.

<h4>Book Sellers</h4>

<hr>
<P>

Book sellers may be liable as "redistributors" of the materials they sell.  
<P>
In general, this means they are not liable for defamation, for example, unless and until they are put on notice that particular materials are defamatory. An important First Amendment case in the U.S. held that book stores need not read every book on their shelves in order to avoid liability.
<P>
On the other hand, no such doctrine of reduced liability for "redistributors" appears to have developed in the context of copyright law. An infringer must know that they are making a copy, but there is no requirement that the infringer know that the material is copyrighted (and not even any requirement that the copyright holder have attached a copyright notice) before a finding of liability for infringement is made. Book stores are not often sued for copyright infringement, however, because the publisher of an infringing work is usually a much more inviting target.

<h4>Schools</h4>

<hr>
<P>
In general, schools may be liable for the wrongful statements of the professors and others they employ, provided the statements are made in the course of employment.  
<P>
But schools have not generally been held liable for the wrongful messages distributed within their walls by students or other visitors.
<P>
One argument for this result is that the statements in question are generally aural statements made in "real time", and would thus be impossible for the schools to control.

<h4>Restaurants and Hotels</h4>

<hr>
<P>
Restaurants and hotels are not generally held liable for the contents of the messages exchanged on their premises -- or, indeed, for other wrongful deeds perpetrated by their patrons.  
<P>
In extreme cases, where a hotel seems to exist openly and notoriously for the purpose of facilitating a crime, like prostitution or drug use, it might be condemned as a bawdy house or crack house -- and shut down.
<P>
There is at least one case holding the owner of bar liable for failure to erase a defamatory message scrawled on the wall of a bathroom on his premises, after the offending notice was brought to his attention.
<P>
But there appears to be no requirement that the proprietor of a commercial space monitor individual conversations or police the content of the large semi-public meetings held on its premises.

<h4>Radio Talk Show Host</h4>

<hr>
<P>
Radio Talk Shows open their microphones to third parties who could slander others, use language prohibited on public airwaves, and otherwise blurt out harmful messages. But they are not, generally, liable for what others say.  
<P>
There are cases that suggest, however, that a radio talk show must use a delay tape that allows them to monitor the content of comments from callers and to edit out offending remarks before they are broadcast over the air. Failure to use a delay tape has been found to constitute lack of due care, for purposes of assessing liability for a resulting harm.

A bicycle messenger or Fedex are "private carriers". They are not required to accept all comers. They offer transportion pursuant to contractual relationships with particular customers. Nevertheless, they have not been held liable for the contents of the messages they carry.

A jury could conclude otherwise.
<P>
Sysops don't generally have the resources to investigate fully the question whether a particular posting is or is not truthful.

<h3>Sysop Liability -- Example 2</h3>
<h4> Argument: The online posting is merely slander, not libel, so there must be proof of specific damages to justify any award</h4>
<hr>
<P>
At common law, there were requirements for special proof of damages when a defamatory statement was made orally, rather than in writing. This rule reflects the greater uncertainty regarding whether mere conversation would cause harm -- as distinct from a presumption of harm following from widespread distribution ("publication") of printed materials.
<P>
In many respects, the online medium is as informal as spoken conversation. But the potential for electronic messages to propogate and persist suggests that they are likely to be analogized to written or printed materials with respect to any presumption of harm or requirements for special proof.

Your argument leaves you at risk.

The First Amendment might provide a basis for an argument that those who merely redistribute messages should not be held liable for defamatory contents.

This may or may not be a convincing argument, depending on the specifics of the message, the reliability of the source, and the nature of the victim's arguments.

The online medium does allow much more effective response by an allegedly defamed party than is possible in other contexts. But one response to your defense is that "the truth can never catch up with a lie".

In general, it is a good practice to provide someone who claims to be harmed by an online message with a chance to reply -- even if there is no clear legal doctrine holding that this response is all that is required to preclude further liability on the part of the message disseminator.

<h3>Sysop Liability -- Example 2</h3>
<h4> Argument: As a "common carrier" of messages, you have immunity</h4>
<hr>
<P>
As the proprietor of an online bulletin board system, you reserve the right to delete off-topic or offending messages. You may not edit particular messages, but you definitely take steps to create a special online place with content you think is valuable. As a result, it is hard for you to argue successfully that you qualify, literally, for the "common carrier" immunity provided by existing statutes.

Maybe sysops should be granted immunity, so as to facilitate the free flow of ideas over the net.  But there is not yet any clear rule to that effect.

<h3>Sysop Liability -- Example 2 -- Result</h3>

<hr>
<P>
In this case, having refused to take down a message that would clearly be harmful and actionably defamatory, if false, you will likely be held liable -- unless the message is found to be true.
<P>
Your only real defense, other than taking down the message upon demand, is to investigate the circumstances and determine whether or not you would prevail at trial. Even that is not much of a defense, of course, because you will likely suffer serious costs and disruptions just to vindicate your position.
<P>
You might buttress your position by submitting the question to a neutral party -- or inducing the parties to take the question to arbitration or mediation. (The "Virtual Magistrate" project is designed to provide rapid, online, arbitration to help take pressure off sysops who must otherwise guess right about each complaint.) But there is no guarantee that doing this -- or offering a right of reply -- will immunize you from liability.
<P>
At present, a sysop's lot is not a happy one.

<hr>
<P>
Compuserve was faced with a complaint about allegedly defamatory material in a newsletter distributed in one of its forums.  It defended the case on the ground that, even if the material was actionable, Compuserve was not liable because (1) it was not the original author or publisher of the material -- that role having been played by an independent contractor responsible for publishing the newsletter and presiding over the relevant area of the Compuserve online service, and (2) it had no notice of the allegedly harmful contents, nor a reasonable ability to review the newsletter in advance of its distribution.

Compuserve won the case.

<h3>Sysop Liability -- Classic Cases</h3>
<h4>Stratton Oakmont v. Prodigy</h4>
<hr>
<P>
Stratton Oakmont alleged that false statements posted to a Prodigy bulletin board destroyed the value of its stock. The messages were apparently posted by a third party using an ID of a Prodigy employee without authorization. The complaint focused on Prodigy's failure to discover and delete the comment for a substantial period.   
<P> 
On a motion for partial summary judgment, a lower court found that Prodigy could be held liable as the "publisher" of the comment. 
<P>
The analysis is not very satisfying, since it relies on the supposed fact that Prodigy generally held itself out as engaged in an editorial process designed to make its system suitable for families. The court refused to consider later-submitted evidence that Prodigy had changed its prior policies of reviewing all messages before they were posted. The court also refused to consider evidence that prior review of messages would be techically impossible -- much less arguments that such review might not be able to prevent the alledged harm and that liabilty would chill the distribution of legitimate and valuable speech.  
<P>
The parties later settled the case. But the court still refused to change or withdraw its prior opinion, even at the request of the parties.

Company Email Policy</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<body >

<center><H1>Company Email Policy -- Background</h1>
</center>
<center><H3>Electronic Communications Privacy Act</h3></center>
<hr>
<P>
In the United States, the Electronic Communications Privacy Act governs unauthorized access to and disclosure of electronic mail messages. See 18 U.S.Code Sections 2501 et. seq. and 2701 et. seq.
<P>
While it is important to be familiar with ECPA, this law does not generally apply to limit the policies that an employer may adopt with regard to use of company email systems by employees and access to or disclosure of employee email, for several reasons.
<ul>
<li> The wiretap statute allows the real time interception of messages by a company using equipment and procedures used in the ordinary course of its business. (This provision doesn't apply to access to stored email. And it may be qualified by other laws applicable to workplace monitoring.)
<li> Access to private email is permitted with the consent of the sender or recipient, and employers can often require that consent as a condition of employment.
<li> Access to private email is also permitted under specified circumstances that include protection of the security of the system and the rights of the system provider (which would often be the employer).
<li> The statute prohibits "unauthorized" access, but the employer is often in a position to grant authority to access, by defining the terms under which email and other electronic services are provided.
<li> Insofar as the employee sends messages as an agent of the employer, the employer, as the principal on whose behalf the message was sent, would have the authority to consent to access or disclosure.
<li> The special limitations on disclosure of private email, in ECPA, expressly apply only to those who provide electronic communications services to the public -- and an internal system provided by an employer to employees would not be so characterized.
</ul>
<P>
Note that many states also have "wiretap" statutes that in general track the provisions of the federal act -- but that some states require the consent of ALL parties before interception of or access to an electronic communication.

<hr>
<P>
Companies may be required by contracts, or by discovery demands in litigation, or by lawful demands from law enforcement authorities, to search and turn over company records, including email sent or received by company employees.
<P>
Companies need to be careful not to make promises to their employees  that are inconsistent with the company's obligations to other parties. And employees should be warned that the electronic messages they send and store may one day be required to be disclosed to other parties.
<P>
Note also that the need to preserve records for litigation may give rise to orders prohibiting the destruction of any records. This can create serious problems for regular archival and backup procedures.

<center><H3>Special Features of Electronic Messaging</h3></center>
<hr>
<P>
Consider the following aspects of electronic messages when you are formulating your policies:
<ul>
<li>Email and files may be protected by passwords, encryption and similar means.
<li>Electronic messages and files tend to be more persistent than oral communications. Copies Proliferate.
<li>It may or may not be easy to tell who sent a particular message. Alteration of particular messages is feasible. But use of a company email system may also create detailed electronic records that disclose more information than was previously available concerning an employee's activities.
<li>An email address may belong to a group.
<li>Email is cheap and easy -- use of it for incidental personal purposes isn't likely to strain company resources.
<li>Because of the absence of the restraint provided by face to face confrontations, electronic messages can convey intense emotions. On the other hand, asynchronous messaging allows reflection and research before a message is sent.
<li>It may be easy or hard to give an employee an ability to "retract" an email message once it is sent.
<li>Use of company email systems from remote locations may create records of company activities that are not stored on equipment owned by the company.
<li>Computer viruses can spread through electronic messaging systems.
<li>The use of IDs and passwords creates an expectation of privacy.
<li>System administration personnel with high security clearances generally need, and generally have, access to private electronic communications. This may not be true if encryption is in use -- but non-escrowed encryption can pose issues concerning the ability of the company to get access to a company record in the absense of the employee who knows the key.
<li>Most email and other electronic communications systems now link to other systems outside the company. Some companies provide access to and use of their email systems to customers and suppliers who are not employees of the company. This may pose special security risks or trigger special duties under laws governing those who provide electronic communications services to the public.
<li>Email systems may be used to infringe copyright, perpetrate fraud, distribute defamatory statements, and otherwise inflict harm on third parties. Because of the scope of this new medium, the harm caused by a wrongful message may occur more rapidly, or be greater in scope, than that caused by paper documents.
<li>It is generally easy to search large sets of electronic messages with automated search engines.

Company Email Policy</TITLE>

<center><H1>Company Email Policy -- Background</h1>
</center>
<center><H3>Blurring Boundaries</h3></center>
<hr>
<P>
Some companies instinctively conclude that they can and should reserve the right to access employee email whenever they want, because they provide the hardware and software used by company employees. But the boundaries between company property and the property of others, between employees and independent contractors, and even between the company's computer systems and those of others, are blurring.

<P>
Before adopting too simplistic a company policy, consider the following:
<ul>
<li>Many of those who use the company systems may be independent contractors, rather than employees. They may even be entirely independent suppliers or customers.
<li>Your company may or may not own the system used to provide email for employees. Many companies now contract with third party networks for this service.
<li>Email originating on your company's system may be sent over private links, or the public internet, to third paries.  Some messages in employee mailboxes may have come in through such routes -- and the senders of such messages may have no notice of, and may not have consented to, any company policies regarding access or disclosure.
<li>Your company also owns and provides to employees many other types of property -- such as pencils and telelphones -- that are regularly used by employees to send personal and private messages.
<li>Your company probably considers some of the spaces inside its buildings, such as desk drawers in an employee's desk, to be entitled to special privacy protections.
<li>Employees work at home and use equipment not owned by the company.
<li>Company owned databases, bulletin boards and web pages may contain links to materials at remote location that are not owned or authored by the company.
 
</ul>

<A NAME="6"></A>\6\  Restatement (Third) of Foreign Relations Law of 
the United States &szlig; 201 (1987) (&quot;Under international 
law, a state is an entity that has a defined territory 
and a permanent population, under the control of its 
own government . . . .&quot;); <I>id.</I> &szlig; 402 (a state 
has &quot;jurisdiction to prescribe law with respect 
to (1)(a) conduct that, wholly or in substantial part, 
takes place within its territory; (b) the status of 
persons, or interests in things, present within its 
territory; (c) conduct outside its territory that has 
or is intended to have substantial effect within its 
territory; . . .&quot;); <I>see also</I> Lea Brilmayer, <I>Consent, 
Contract, and Territory,</I> 74 Minn. L. Rev. 1, 11-12 
(noting the significance of state authority derived 
from sovereignty over physical territory in the context 
of social contract theory).<P>

<A NAME="7"></A>\7\  The ability of the sovereign to claim personal 
jurisdiction over a particular party, for instance, 
turns importantly on the party's relationship to the 
physical jurisdiction over which the sovereign has 
control, e.g., the presence of the party or assets 
belonging to the party, within the jurisdiction, or 
activities of the party that are directed to persons 
or things within the jurisdiction.  Similarly, the 
law chosen to apply to a contract, tort, or criminal 
action has historically been influenced primarily by 
the physical location of the parties or the deed in 
question.  <I>See generally,</I> Henry H. Perritt Jr., <I>Jurisdiction 
in Cyberspace</I> (October 28, 1995) (unpublished manuscript

<A NAME="9"></A>\9\  The exception proves this rule--we feel outrage 
when a journalist who crosses a territorial boundary 
without any signs is imprisoned for any supposed offense 
against the local state. Some &quot;signposts&quot; 
are culturally understood conventions that accompany 
entry into specialized places, such as courtrooms, 
office buildings, and churches.  But not all signposts 
and boundaries dividing different rule sets are geographically 
or physically based.  Sets of different rules may apply 
when the affected parties play particular roles, such 
as members of self-regulatory organizations, agents 
of corporate entities, and so forth.  Henry H. Perritt 
Jr.,<I> Self-governing Electronic Communities</I> 36-49, 59-60 
(Apr. 1995) (on file with the <I>Stanford Law Review</I>).

<A NAME="17"></A>\17\  The difficulty of policing an electronic border 
may have something to do with its relative length. 
<I>See</I> comment of Prof. Peter Martin, NewJuris Electronic 
Conference (Sept. 22, 1993) at p. 13 (discussing cyberspace's 
&quot;near infinite boundary&quot; with territorial 
jurisdictions).  Physical roads and ports linking sovereign 
territories are few in number, and geographical boundaries 
can be fenced and policed. In contrast, the number 
of starting points for an electronic &quot;trip&quot; 
out of a given country is staggering, consisting of 
every telephone capable of connecting outside the territory. 
 Even if electronic communications are concentrated 
into high volume connections, a customs house opened 
on an electronic border would cause a massive traffic 
jam, threatening the very electronic commerce such 
facilities were constructed to encourage.<P>

(1992) (examining the challenges to sovereignty posed 
by the information revolution):<BR>

<blockquote>
Technology has made us a &quot;global&quot; community

or not, mankind now has a completely integrated international 
financial and information marketplace capable of moving 
money and ideas to any place on this planet in minutes.

power can restrain it for long.
</blockquote><BR>
<I>Id.</I> at 61-62.   For example, the Securities and Exchange 
Commission has taken the position that securities offerings 
&quot;that occur outside the United States&quot; are 
not subject to the registration requirements of Section 
5 of the Securities Act of 1933, even if United States 
residents are the purchasers in the overseas market. 
 <I>See</I> SEC Rule 90; <I>see also </I>Rule 903 (in order for offers 
and sales to be deemed to &quot;occur outside the United

as &quot;any activity undertaken for the purpose of, 
or that could reasonably be expected to have the effect 
of, conditioning the market in the United States&quot; 
for the securities in question).  If, as many predict, 
trading on physical exchanges increasingly gives way 
to computerized trading over the Net, <I>see, e.g.,</I> Therese

rule will inevitably become increasingly difficult 
to apply on a coherent basis; where, in such a market, 
does the offer &quot;occur&quot;?  Can information 
about the offering placed on the World Wide Web &quot;reasonably 
be expected to have the effect of conditioning the 
market in the United States&quot; for the securities 
in question?  <I>See, generally</I>, Solomon and Corso, <I>op. 
cit.,</I> at 330. [The authors wish to thank Prof. Merritt 
Fox, whose talk, entitled <I>The Political Economy of 
Statutory Reach: US Disclosure Rules for a Globalizing

<A NAME="20"></A>\20\  For example, German authorities, seeking to prevent 
violations of that country's laws against distribution 
of pornographic material, ordered CompuServe to disable 
access by German residents to certain global Usenet 
newsgroups that would otherwise be accessible through 
that commercial service. See Karen Kaplan, <I>Germany 
Forces Online Service to Censor Internet,</I> L.A. Times,

Teutonic Wall over Porn</I>, Christian Sci. Monitor, Jan 
4, 1996, at 1; <I>Cyberporn Debate Goes International; 
Germany Pulls the Shade On CompuServe, Internet,</I> Wash. 
Post, Jan. 1, 1996, at F13 (describing efforts by a 
local Bavarian police force had the effect of requiring 
CompuServe to temporarily cut off the availability 
of news groups to its entire audience (at least until 
a way to prevent delivery of specified groups to the 
German audience could be developed).  Anyone inside 
Germany with an Internet connection could easily find 
a way to access the prohibited news groups during the 
ban.  Auerbach, <I>supra</I> <A HREF="#12">note \12\</A>, at 15. Although initially 
compliant, CompuServe subsequently rescinded the ban 
on most of the files by sending parents a new program 
to choose for themselves what items to restrict.  <I>CompuServe 
Ends Access Suspension: It reopens all but five adult-oriented 
newsgroups. Parents can now block offensive material,</I> 
L.A. Times, Feb. 14, 1996, at D1.  <BR>
Similarly, Tennessee may insist (indirectly, through 
enforcement of a federal law that defers to local community 
standards) that an electronic bulletin board in California 
install filters that prevent offensive screens from 
being displayed to users in Tennessee if it is to avoid 
liability under local obscenity standards in Tennessee. 
 <I>See</I> United States v. Thomas, _ F.3d _, 1996 WL 30477 
(6th Cir. 1996) (affirming the convictions of a California 
couple for violations of federal obscenity laws stemming 
from electronic bulletin board postings made by the 
couple in California but accessible from and offensive 
to the community standards of Tennessee).  <I>See generally</I> 
Electronic Frontier Foundation, <A HREF="http://www.eff.org/pub/Legal/Cases/AABBS_Thomases_Memphis/Old/aa_eff_vbrief.html"><I>A Virtual Amicus Brief

 The bulletin board in this case had very clear warnings 
and password protection.  This intangible boundary 
limited entrance to only those who voluntarily desired 
to see the materials and accepted the system operator's 
rules.  It is our contention that posting offensive 
materials in areas where unwilling readers may come 
across them inadvertently raises different problems 
that are better dealt with by those who understand 
the technology involved rather than by extrapolating 
from the conflicting laws of multiple geographic jurisdictions.

<A NAME="26"></A>\26\ Privacy, at least, is a relatively familiar concept, 
susceptible of definition on the Net by reference to 
analogies with mail systems, telephone calls and print 
publication of invasive materials. But many new issues 
posed by phenomena unique to the Net are not even so 
familiar. Because electronic communications are not 
necessarily tied to real world identities, new questions 
about the rights to continued existence, or to protection 
of the reputation, of a pseudonym arise. The potential 
to launch a computer virus or to &quot;spam the net&quot; 
by sending multiple offpoint messages to newsgroups, 
for example, creates a need to define rules governing 
online behavior.  When large numbers of people collaborate 
across the net to create services or works of value, 
we will face the question whether they have formed 
a corporate entity or partnership--with rights and 
duties of its own that are distinct from those of the 
individual participants--in a context in which there 
may have been no &quot;registration&quot; with any 
particular geographic authority and the rights of any 
such authority to regulate that new &quot;legal person&quot; 
remain unsettled.<P>

<A NAME="31"></A>\31\  Indeed, the persistence and accessibility of electronic 
messages create such a sense of &quot;placeness&quot; 
that meetings in Cyberspace may become a viable alternative 
to meetings in physical space.  <I>See </I>I. Trotter Hardy, 
<I>Electronic Conferences: The Report of an Experiment</I>, 
6 Harv. J. Law &amp; Tech. 213, 232-34 (1993) (discussing 
the advantages of e-mail conferences).  In contrast, 
there is no &quot;Telespace&quot; because the conversations 
we conduct by telephone disappear when the parties 
hang up.  Voicemail creates an aural version of electronic 
mail, but it is not part of an interconnected system 
that you can travel through, by hypertext links or 
otherwise, to a range of public and semi-public locations.<P>

    <A NAME="32"></A>\32\  Some information products combine a local CD-ROM 
with online access to provide updated information. 
 But even these products typically provide some on-screen 
indication when the user is going online. Failure to 
provide notice might well be deemed fraudulent, particularly 
if additional charges for use of the online system 
were imposed.  In any event, a product that brings 
information to the screen, from an online location, 
without disclosing the online connection to the user, 
should not be characterized as having allowed the user 
to visit a legally significant user visit to online 
space.  &quot;Visiting&quot; a space implies some knowledge 
that you are there.<P>

<A NAME="35"></A>\35\  Having a noticeable border may be a prerequisite 
to the establishment of any legal regime that can claim 
to be separate from pre-existing regimes.  If someone 
acting in any given space has no warning that the rules 
have changed, the legitimacy of any attempt to enforce 
a distinctive system of law is fatally weakened.  No 
geographically based sovereign could plausibly claim 
to have jurisdiction over a territory with secret boundaries. 
 And no self-regulatory organization could assert its 
prerogatives while making it hard for members and nonmembers 
to tell each other apart or disguising when they were 
(or were not) playing their membership-related roles.<P>

<A NAME="36"></A>\36\  For example, we will have to take into account 
the desire of participants in online communications 
for pseudonymity.  This will affect the extent to which 
information about the applicant's identity must be 
disclosed in order to obtain a valid address registration.

<A NAME="38"></A>\38\  Subsequent distribution of printed versions might 
be characterized as publication, without undermining 
the benefits of applying this new doctrine, because 
it is much easier to determine who has taken such action 
and where (in physical space) it occurred, and the 
party who engages in physical distribution of defamatory 
works has much clearer warning regarding the nature 
of the act and the applicability of the laws of a particular

<A NAME="40"></A>\40\  In the context of &quot;telemedicine&quot;, early 
efforts to avoid this result seem to take the form 
of allowing doctors to interact with other doctors 
in consultations, requiring compliance with local regulations 
only when the doctor deals directly with a patient.

of lawyers is muddled:  Regulations are sometimes based

absent an explicit agreement, rather than adopting

involves copying Web pages to a hard drive so that

 Because making &quot;cached&quot; copies in computer

<A NAME="58"></A>\58\  This danger of confusion exists whether the name 
conflicts with &quot;real world&quot; trademark uses 
or only other online uses. To be sure, whoever decides 
these questions must consider the views of geographically 
based authorities when online names interfere with 
the existing trademarks of physical goods.  But they 
must also decide ownership questions about online identities 
with addresses, names, and logos having no application 
offline.  The views of territorially based authorities 
would appear to have less bearing in this context.<P>

<A NAME="59"></A>\59\  Domain name space may raise the question whether 
the Net should develop an online equivalent of eminent 
domain. Newly discovered public needs, such as to use 
a particular domain or to eliminate it to establish 
a new system, could interfere with &quot;investment 
backed expectations.&quot;  To keep geographically 
based trademark authorities at bay, Net authorities 
may need to &quot;grandfather&quot; in strong global 
trademarks and prevent those who acquired certain domain 
names on a &quot;first-come, first-served&quot; basis 
from engaging in holdups--a responsible &quot;foreign 
policy&quot; to ward off overregulation by local sovereigns. 
 The impact on individuals of these efforts to pursue 
the greater good may be require mandatory compensation. 
 Who will pay and how remains unclear.<P>

 Things began to change in the eleventh and twelfth 
centuries [with the] emergence of a class of professional 
merchants.  There were significant barriers to overcome 
before substantial interregional and inter-national 
trade could develop, however.  Merchants spoke different 
languages and had different cultural backgrounds.  
Beyond that, geographic distances frequently prevented 
direct communication, let alone the building of strong 
interpersonal bonds that would facilitate trust.  Numerous 
middlemen were often required to bring about an exchange 
. . . . All of this, in the face of localized, often 
contradictory laws and business practices, produced 
hostility towards foreign commercial customs and led 
to mercantile confrontations.  There was a clear need

Cyberspace not only permits the effective delineation 
of internal boundaries between different online spaces, 
but it also allows for effective delineation of distinct 
online roles within different spheres of activity and 
as to which different rules apply.  In the nonvirtual 
world, we slip in and out of such roles frequently; 
the rules applicable to the behavior of a single individual, 
in a single territorial jurisdiction, may change as 
he moves between different legally-significant persona 
(acting as an employee, a member of a church, a parent, 
or the officer of a corporation, for example).  Cyberspace 
may make the boundaries between these different roles 
easier to maintain, insofar as explicit &quot;tags&quot; 
-- distinct &quot;signature files,&quot; or screen 
names-- can relatively easily be attached to messages 
originating from the author's different roles. <P>

a rationale for a sovereign's legitimacy.  When exactly

 At best, that consent can only be inferred indirectly, 
from our continued presence within the US borders -- 
the love-it-or-leave-it, vote-with-your-feet theory 
of political legitimacy.  But by that token, is Saddam 
Hussein's rule legitimate, as least as to those Iraqis 
who have &euml;consented' in this fashion?  Have the 
Zairois consented to Mobutu's rule?  In the world of 
atoms, we simply cannot ignore the fact that real movement 
of real people is not always so easy, and that most 
people can hardly be charged with having chosen the 
jurisdiction in which they live or the laws that they 
are made to obey.  But in cyberspace, there is an infinite 
amount of space, and movement between online communities 
is entirely frictionless.  Here, there really is the 
opportunity to obtain consent to a social contract; 
virtual communities can be established with their own 
particular rule-sets, power to maintain a degree of 
order and to banish wrongdoers can be lodged, or not, 
in particular individuals or groups, and those who 
find the rules oppressive or unfair may simply leave

<A NAME="103"></A>\103\ The ease with which individuals may move between 
communities (or inhabit multiple communities simultaneous 
through a fractionation of their own individual identities) 
also implies that Cyberspace may provide conditions 
necessary and sufficient for something more closely 
resembling the optimal collective production of a particular 
set of goods -- namely, &quot;laws&quot; -- than can 
be achieved in the real world.  Cyberspace may closely 
approximate the idealized model for the allocation 
of local goods and services set forth by Charles Tiebout, 
see Charles Tiebout, A Pure Theory of Local Expenditures, 
64 J. POL. ECON. 416 (1956),  in which optimal allocation 
of locally-produced public goods is provided by small 
jurisdictions competing for mobile residents.  The 
Tiebout model of intergovernmental competition has 
four components: (1) a perfectly elastic supply of 
jurisdictions, (2) costless mobility of individuals 
among jurisdictions, (3) full information about the 
attributes of all jurisdictions, and (4) no interjurisdictional 
externalities.  <I>See</I> Robert P. Inman and Daniel L. Rubinfeld, 
<I>The Political Economy of Federalism</I>, Working Paper 
No. 94-15, Boalt Hall Program in Law and Economics 
(1994), at 11-16, <I>(reprinted in</I> D. Mueller (ed.), <I>Developments 
in Public Choice</I>, Cambridge Univ. Press 1995).  (As 
Inman and Rubinfeld demonstrate, a fifth assumption 
of the Tiebout model--the provision of public goods 
with a &quot;congestible technology&quot; such that 
the per capita cost of providing each level of a public 
good first decreases and then increases as more individuals 
move into the jurisdiction--is not necessary for the 
model.  <I>Id.,</I> at 13.)  In a Tieboutian world, <BR>
. . . each locality provides a package of  local public 
goods consistent with the preferences of its residents 
(consumer-voters).  Residents whose preferences remain 
unsatisfied by a particular locality's package of goods 
and services would (costlessly) move. . . . Escape 
from undesirable packages of goods and services is 
feasible as a result of two explicit characteristics 
of the Tiebout model:  absence of externalities and 
mobility of residents.<BR>
Gillette, <I>In Partial Praise of Dillon's Rule, or, Can

cyberspace may be a closer approximation to ideal Tieboutian 
competition between rule-sets than exists in the nonvirtual 
world, a consequence of (1) the low cost of establishing 
an online &quot;jurisdiction,&quot; see text at <A HREF="#72">note 
\72d\</A>, (2) the ease of exit from online communities, 
(3) the relative ease of acquiring information about 
the practices of online communities, and (4) the greater 
impermeability of the internal, software-mediated boundaries 
between online communities in cyberspace, see <I>supra</I> 
<A HREF="#98">note \98\</A>, which may mitigate (at least to some extent) 
the problem of inter-community externalities.<P>

<H1>What is VTR?</H1>
</center>
<HR size=10>

The Vintage Triumph Register is a national club of over 3700 Triumph
owners and enthusiasts.  (<a href="join-vtr.html"> Membership info is
available here</a>; you do not have to own a Triumph to join.)

<p>
VTR is the only national club in North America which covers
and supports all <a href="models.html">models of Triumphs</a>.  VTR
regularly publishes a quarterly magazine, "<a
href="tvt/tvt.html"><i>The Vintage Triumph.</i></a>"

<p>In addition to the magazine, <a href="join-vtr.html">membership in
VTR</a> also includes: <ul>

<li> free classified advertising in <a
href="tvt/tvt.html"><i>The Vintage Triumph,</i></a>

<li> access to VTR's staff of <a href="consultants.html">vehicle
consultants,</a>

<li> a VTR <a href="mtap.html">Member Travel Assistance Program,</a>

<li> a discount book service, and 

<li> various VTR club regalia.

</ul>

<p>

Most recently, VTR has worked out an agreement with a major classic
auto insurance carrier to now provide low cost collector car auto
liability to VTR members for any year Triumph at costs far below
regular insurance rates.

<p> VTR also has an <a href="conventions/">annual convention</a>,
hosted each year by one of VTR's many local chapters.

<p>
If you'd like to become a member, there is more information online
about <a href="join-vtr.html">joining VTR</a>.

<BODY BGCOLOR="c0d0c0">


<H1>The Vintage Triumph Register FAQ</h1>

<p>

This Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) list has been created to attempt
to answer some of the regular questions that come to Triumph
enthusiasts soon after they find out about the Vintage Triumph
Register (VTR.)  The FAQ is not meant to discuss any topic
exhaustively. It will hopefully provide readers with pointers on where
to find useful information, especially material available on the
Internet.
   
<h4>Admin </h4>

This document is now automatically extracted from the VTR World Wide
Web site - <a href="http://www.vtr.org">
"http://www.vtr.org"</a>. We have tried to keep the integrity
of the FAQ intact but there are probably errors.  Please let us know
of any you find by sending mail to <a
href="mailto:vtr-www@www.vtr.org"> "vtr-www@www.vtr.org".</a>

<p>
This FAQ was last updated 24 December 1996.
   
<h4>FAQ Sections</h4>

   The FAQ is divided into the following sections:

<ul>

<li> <a href="faq-contents.html">FAQ Contents</a>
       
<li> <a href="faq-section1.html">FAQ Section 1:</a> General
Information on The Vintage Triumph Register

<li> <a href="faq-section2.html">FAQ Section 2:</a> Information on VTR
upcoming events

</ul>
       
<h4>Acknowledgements</h4>

Dozens of people have made contributions to the VTR FAQ over the time
since its creation; there are too many to name individually.  Special
thanks go to Mark Bradakis, Andy Mace, and Bill Sohl who have been
particularly helpful.

<H1>The Vintage Triumph Register Competition Rules</h1>

<p>

Some sort of explanation of why the VTR has competition rules should
go here.  I seem to recall such a discussion published in TVT with one
of the sets of rules.  I'll try to find it and put it in here. <i>
(WWW Editor Note)</i>
   
<p> <i>Please note that these are <b>not</b> guaranteed to be the most
recent versions of the rules.  To acquire the rules in use at any
specific VTR event, please contact the event coordinator.</i>

<p>
There are currently on-line rules for the following events: 

<ul>

<li> <a href="autocross.html">Autocross</a>

<li> <a href="concours.html">Concours</a>

<li> <a href="judgform.html">Concours Judging Form</a>

<li> <a href="rally.html">Rallyes</a>

<H1> The VTR Member Travel <br> Assistance Program (MTAP)</H1>
</center>
<HR IMAGE="/pics/parts/hr7.gif" SIZE=10>

<p>

If you've ever had the misfortune to have your Triumph break down
on a long road trip, you know that "Foreign Auto Parts" means Honda
and Toyota, not Triumph and MG, and finding help and parts can be
a frustrating experience.  VTR Rallye Advisor Vicki Schlierer has
volunteered to coordinate a VTR Member Travel Assistance Program
(MTAP).  MTAP is very simple: VTR members offer whatever help they
can to other members unfortunate enough to break down on the road.
You don't have to be a mechanical expert to participate, just be
willing to offer whatever help you can to a fellow enthusiast.  The
MTAP list will be published annually in a convenient format to
carry in your Triumph.

<p>
The concept isn't new: the Triumph Sports Six Club of England has
a "self-help scheme" that works in the same way.  Their members say
that it's rare that the scheme is used, but it's good to know its
there!

<p>
To take part in the MTAP, just fill out the form below and return
it to the address below.  (Yes, we're working on having an electronic
version of the form...)

<TITLE>The Triumph Buyer's Guide</TITLE>
</head>
<BODY BGCOLOR="c0d0c0">


<h2>The Triumph Buyer's Guide</h2>

<p>

This page should provided a pretty detailed list of items to look for,
informing a prospective buyer of the common characteristics of all
Triumphs that are of importance to a prospective buyer.

<p>  Items that may possibly be included:

<ul>
<li> What differentiates the models?
<li> How do I find sellers?
<li> What should I look for? (Checklists?)
<li> Pricing guidelines
<li> Bill of sale paperwork
<li> Where to get insurance
</ul>

<p>
More detailed information is provided for each of the specific models:

<ul>
<a href="GT6/GT6-buying.html"> GT6 </a> ...
<a href="Herald/Herald-buying.html"> Herald/Vitesse </a> ...
<a href="Spitfire/Spitfire-buying.html"> Spitfire </a> ...
<a href="Stag/Stag-buying.html"> Stag </a> ...
<a href="TR2/TR2-buying.html"> TR2 </a> ...
<a href="TR3/TR3-buying.html"> TR3/3A/3B </a> ...
<a href="TR4/TR4-buying.html"> TR4 </a> ...
<a href="TR4A/TR4A-buying.html"> TR4A </a> ...
<a href="TR5/TR5-buying.html"> TR5/TR250 </a> ...
<a href="TR6/TR6-buying.html"> TR6 </a> ...
<a href="TR7/TR7-buying.html"> TR7 </a> ... 
<a href="TR8/TR8-buying.html"> TR8 </a> ...
<a href="Roadster2000/Roadster-2000-buying.html"> 2000 Roadster </a> ...
</ul>


<p>Here are a few generic tests. Some you can do yourself and the rest a
mechanic should be able to do at a reasonable cost in about 30 to 45 minutes.

<ul>
<li>
Run a compression test.   Indicades ring and valve seal.

<li>
Have the oil pressure tested by a seperate guage.   Indicates engine and oil
pump wear.

<li>
Have the water in the radiator tested for exhaust gasses.   Indicates head
gasket leaks.

<li>
Drive the car and see if the transmission shifts smoothly with no grinding or
knocks.   Listen and feel for bad synchros and chipped teeth.

<li>
Let off and on the clutch slowly, feeling for a full positive engagement with
no slipping.   Indicates a bad clutch.

<li>
Try braking hard in an open parking lot.   Indicates brake problems.

<li>
Check the oil for clouding and look for grey slime on the dip stick.
 Indicates a head gasket leak.

<li>
When checking for rust, take a small magnet to feel for thick areas of bondo.

<li>
Welding may indicate serious rust problems or a major impact.

</ul>

The price you indicated for this car approaches what someone might pay for a
parts car. Often you get what you pay for but occasionally you will find a
great deal.

</center>
<HR IMAGE="/pics/parts/hr7.gif" SIZE=10>

<p> Ongoing maintenance is a part of the Triumph enthusiast's car
hobby.  If you choose to perform your own maintenance, these pages are
intended to provide some helpful hints.  Most of the information
herein will pertain to most Triumph models.  As with all areas of the
Vintage Triumph Register, contributions to these pages are always
welcome.

<p> The information in this handbook is organized according to the
"system" of the car of which it is a part.  Some items which don't fit
in any particular system, but which pertain to the whole car are in a
"Miscellaneous" Category.

<p> The Vintage Triumph Register takes no responsibility for any
problems you may encounter following the advice given herein.  Take
all suggestions with a grain of salt, and be sure to use your own
common sense -- it's your car, and your health at stake!

<h1>The Triumph Parts Suppliers Guide</h1>
</center>
<HR IMAGE="/pics/parts/hr7.gif" SIZE=10>

<p> Fortunately for the Triumph enthusiast, there are a large number
of parts suppliers for Triumph parts, both in the United States and in
the United Kingdom.  Almost any part you could possibly want for your
car, ranging from special bolts or washers to complete body shells and
frames can be purchased from current suppliers.

<p>
However, rather than duplicate a great deal of work in putting such a
list together, an excellent list of <a
href="http://www.team.net/sol/britpart.html">British Car Parts, 
Publications, and Services</a> is already maintained by the British Cars
Mailing list.  We would suggest that you examine that list for
suppliers, particularly of the few rarer parts.

<p> Also, since most orders are placed by mail, you may be interested in
knowing your <a href="mail-order.html">mail order rights and
privileges.</a>

<p> However, for most of the parts you need, the three largest USA
suppliers for Triumph parts may be sufficient.  (These are also the
only <a href="http://www.ipl.co.uk/MG/herit01a.html">British Motor
Industry Heritage Trust approved specialists</a> in the USA.)

<p>

Other parts suppliers available via the WWW can be found on the <a
href="/other-links.html#commercial">commercial sites</a> section of
the VTR "other links" page.

<H1> Triumphs Mailing List Subscription Information</H1>
</center>
<HR size=10>

Probably the single most valuable usage of the Internet for a Triumph
owner is a subscription to the Triumphs mailing list.  This mailing
list serves as a "discussion group/forum" and is read by hundreds of
Triumph enthusiasts, including some of the <a
href="consultants.html">VTR consultants</a>, as well as many other
people with great expertise with specific Triumph models.

<p>

There really isn't any better discussion group for Triumph
motorcars anywhere!  Ownership of a Triumph is not a prerequisite to
joining the list.  

<p>
However, the mailing list is a fairly high-volume mailing list,
with anywhere from 10-50 messages each day.

<p>
The list is available in a real-time format (each mail message is sent
separately) or as a digest, with the day's messages collected into one
large nightly mailing.  Some folks prefer the digest format over the
steady stream of mail throughout the day.

<p>
</a>The <B>Triumphs</B> mailing list, and others located at
autox.team.net are run by an automated "list Server" (majordomo)
maintained by Mark Bradakis.  You can find information about
<i>this</i> majordomo by sending the command <b><a
href="http://www.team.net/md-help.html">help</a></B> on the first line
of an e-mail message to: <a href="mailto: majordomo@autox.team.net">
majordomo@autox.team.net </a> (Click here to send mail!.)

<p>
Alternatively, you can use the links below to subscribe or unsubscribe
from the lists:

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.team.net/cgi-bin/lwgate/TRIUMPHS/">Triumphs
Mailing List (real-time format, 10-50 messages each day)</a>

<li><a href="http://www.team.net/cgi-bin/lwgate/TRIUMPHS-DIGEST/">Triumphs
Mailing List Digest (digest format, 1 bundle of messages each day)</a>
</ul>

<p>

Messages can be sent to the list by mailing them to <a
href="mailto:triumphs@autox.team.net">triumphs@autox.team.net</a>.

<p>

<A HREF = "http://www.team.net/www/corp-use.html">If you will be representing an
auto-related business on one of these mailing lists, please read this
first!</a>

<p>
Note: the Triumphs mailing list is not officially affiliated with VTR
in any way, but is read by many VTR members.

<TITLE>VTR FAQ Section 1</TITLE>
</head>
<BODY BGCOLOR="c0d0c0">


<h2>
FAQ SECTION 1 - General Information on The Vintage Triumph Register.
(VTR)
</h2>

<ul>
<li> Q1.1 What is VTR?
<p>

The Vintage Triumph Register is a national club of over 3700 Triumph
owners and enthusiasts. (You do not have to own a Triumph to join.)
VTR is the only national club in North America which covers and
supports all models of Triumphs. VTR regularly publishes a 
magazine, "The Vintage Triumph."

<p>

<p><li> Q1.2 What benefits are there to belonging to VTR?
<p>

<p>In addition to the magazine, membership in VTR also includes:
<ul>

<li> free classified advertising in <a
href="/tvt/tvt.html"><i>The Vintage Triumph,</i></a>

<li> access to VTR's staff of <a href="/consultants.html">vehicle
consultants,</a>

<li> a VTR <a href="/mtap.html">Member Travel Assistance Program,</a>

<li> a discount book service, and 

<li> various VTR club regalia.

</ul>

<p>
Most recently, VTR has worked out an agreement with a 
major classic auto insurance carrier to now
provide low cost collector car auto liability for any year
Triumph at costs far below regular insurance rates.

<p> VTR also has an <a href="/conventions">annual convention</a>,
hosted each year by one of VTR's many local chapters.

<p>
<p><li> Q1.3 How do I join VTR?

<pre>
	Membership dues for VTR are: 
	  $25 for all USA zipcode addresses 
	  $30 (US Dollars) for Canada and Mexico 
	  $35 (US Dollars) anywhere else 
</pre>

To join the VTR now, send name, address and dues to: 

<pre>
	    VTR-E - New Membership
	    15218 West Warren Avenue
	    Dearborn, MI 48126
</pre>

or, write to the above address for a free information brochure, or
send email to vtr@autox.team.net with your mailing address.  Please
include details about your car when sending in new membership info.

<a name="chapter.zone">
<p><li> Q1.4 What is the difference between VTR Chapters and VTR Zones?
<p>

The VTR establishes a Chartered Chapter when 10 or more current VTR
members have formed a local Triumph group or when 10 or more current
VTR members are part of a British Car club and wish to be associated
with the VTR National Organization.  The process to accomplish this
would be to submit a letter to the Chapter Coodinator for that area of
the country which denotes the Name of the organization, the purpose
for existence, the area covered by the organization (i.e. Sacramento,
CA) and signed by at least ten current VTR members who are members of
that organization.

<p>

A VTR Zone can be established by submitting a letter to the Chapter
Coordinator for that area with the same information as for a Chapter,
except it only requires one to nine current VTR members signatures.
The purpose of a zone is to establish a beginning point with which to
attact additional current VTR members in order to eventually qualify
for VTR Chapter status.

<p>

A VTR Zone does not qualify for the insurance program and other
benefits which are available to all VTR Chapters.

<p>

<p><li> Q1.5 What are related newsgroups and mailing lists?
<p>

There is a Vintage Triumph Register mailing list, for VTR members to
discuss issues related to VTR or their cars.  There are currently only
about three dozen participants, but involvement is rapidly growing.  If
you would like to be added to the mailing list, send a mail message to

<pre>
	    majordomo@autox.team.net
</pre>
	and put
<pre>
	    subscribe vtr
</pre>

	in the body of the message.

<p>
There is also a Triumphs mailing list with over 200 readers.
To subscribe to that list, send the same message, but
instead with the line

<pre>
             subscribe triumphs
</pre>
in the body of the message.

<p>	   

Alternately, you might be interested in the British car mailing list,
which currently covers a fairly wide range of vehicles, with over
1500 people all over the globe participating.  Well, most of them just
read; if all 1500 posted a message or two every day it would soon be
overwhelming.  Still, it is a pretty busy mailing list.  If you want
to give it a try, use the line 

<pre>
              subscribe british-cars-digest
</pre>
in the body of the message.

<p>
<p><li> Q1.6
 What is "team.net"?
<p>

Team.Net, the dot is <b>not</b> silent, is basically just a name made up to
refer to various automotive related electronic services.  It started
with a simple mailing list or two a number of years ago, and now
includes a broader spectrum of mailing lists, archives of past mail,
images, and a source of information for various programs that present
this resource to users.  A fair amount of this work is done by a
machine named triumph, oddly enough.

<h2>
FAQ SECTION 2 -  Information on VTR upcoming events
</h2>

<ul>
<li> Q2.1 When / Where is the 1997 VTR convention?
<p>
 
The <a href="http://www.vtr.org/conventions/vtr-97.html">1997 Vintage
Triumph Register National Convention </a> will be held July 9-12,
1997 in Fort Worth, Texas by the Red River Triumph Club of Dallas /
Fort Worth.

<p> Fort Worth is known for its pride in the preservation of the Old
West, and the area features rodeos, honky tonks, world-renowned
museums, the Ft. Worth Stockyards, and many other cultural and social
delights.  Events such as honky-tonkin' at Billy Bob's Texas,
beautiful and informative driving tours of the Fort Worth area, and
the National events we all love (<i>Concours d'Elegance</i>,
Participant's Choice show, numerous rallyes, an autocross, funkhana,
etc.) are planned, and we hope to have some fun tours to places like
the Pate Transportation Museum, old-style Granbury, Texas, and to take
your car's picture with a beautifully restored Spitfire warbird at the
Cavenaugh Flight Museum.  Interesting technical sessions are in the
works, like how to refinish your wood dash panels, and we also will
have some really neat raffle and auction prizes.

<p>
For more details, see the Vintage Triumph Register World-Wide-Web
pages at <a href="http://www.vtr.org">
http://www.vtr.org</a> or contact the event coordinators:

<p>
<p>
<li> Q2.2 What about local events?
<p>

Many of the Vintage Triumph Register local chapters have events on
nearly a monthly basis.  To find out about these events, you can
either contact the local chapter (see
http://www.vtr.org/chapters.html), or examine the on-line 
calendar at http://www.vtr.org/events
<p>
Instructions on adding an event to the calendar can be found on the
event pages.

The Triumph 2000 Roadster is of particular interest to the Triumph
enthusiast, as it is the immediate predecessor to the well-known TR2-TR8
series of sports cars.  A lesser known distinction for the car is that
it was the last production car to feature a rumble seat.  (A "dickey
seat" in England.)

<p>
The 2000 Roadster is essentially the same as the prior Triumph 1800
Roadster, with minor changes, and the Standard Vanguard 2088cc engine.

Triumph Alternator Diagnosis and Repair

<p>
	"Five bucks! That's all for the 
core?" 

<p>
	A few months ago, when my 
alternator ceased charging my car's 
battery, I took it to a local armature 
shop for exchange on a rebuilt unit. 
Considering what they offered me 
for my old unit, against the $100 
for the rebuilt, I decided to keep it, 
take my time to diagnose the cause 
of failure, correct the defective 
component, and keep it for an 
immediate spare when I need it. 
<p>
	Diagnosing the problem was 
easy. Even the defective regulator 
was reasonably cheap (about $18 
locally) and easy to replace. 
Explaining the process to someone 
else, perhaps with a slightly 
different wiring harness, regulator, 
or diode pack gets more 
complicated. 
<p>
	This article is aimed at those 
who enjoy diagnosing and repairing 
things, either to save a buck or just 
to be able to say they did it. For 
others it may provide a little more 
basic insight into how  alternators 
work. Just for a disclaimer, there 
are some off-the-wall problems 
these testing procedures can miss 
(broken  insulation on the field or 
stator winding comes to mind). Ive 
tried to present simple testing that 
will catch the most likely problems. 
<p>
	As with any other auto 
component that's been around for 
more than a year or two, there are 
bound to be variations as 
manufacturers try to consolidate 
model lines and improve  
performance. Lucas alternators are 
no exception. 
<p>
	I spoke with a very helpful 
tech rep, Ron Hellebuyek, at Lucas 
Aftermarket Operations (yes, I 
actually spoke to the Prince of 
Darkness and he was darn 
friendly). He was able to supply me 
with copies of pages from ancient 
tomes, describing and illustrating 
the differences in the alternators of 
our car's vintage.
<p>
	In an attempt to keep this 
article within proper perspective I'll 
only attempt to cover the 15-18 
ACR models. They were used on 
TR6s, 7s and 8s,  Spitfires and 
GT6s (spanning the early 70s 
through 1980). TR7s and 8s with 
air conditioning needed the much 
higher current output of the 20 or 
25 ACR. They all feature similar 
internal regulators.
<p>
	Even though the three wire 
harness connection(s) may be 
different, they're basically the same 
in operation. The large brown wire 
(# 8 or 10) is the main output to 
charge the battery. The smaller 
brown wire (#14 or 16) comes from 
the harness and supplies battery 
sensing voltage (if used by the 
regulator). The small brown/yellow 
wire goes to the INDicator bulb 
on the dash.
<p>
	Alternators, just like 
generators, produce alternating 
current. Generators convert, or 
"rectify", the current to DC by 
means of the commutator and 
brushes. Semiconductor devices 
called diodes are used in alternators 
to keep the current flowing in one 
direction.  Inside our alternators are 
six diodes connected together 
electrically into a single component 
known as a full-wave bridge 
rectifier. There are 3 more diodes in 
the pack that direct current back to 
the field windings once the 
alternator is turning at speed. 
Generators employ an external 
regulator that controls both voltage 
and current flow (amps) and, by 
using a cut-out, prevents any 
reverse flow. In alternators no cut-
out is needed because a good diode 
pack only flows current in one 
direction. Due to the inherent 
electrical characteristics of the 
stator/field combination at high 
rpms, current level is self-limiting, 
eliminating the need for a current 
regulator. To keep from over 
charging the battery, Lucas does 
employ an internal, solid state 
voltage regulator that maintains 
alternator output between 13.6 and 
14.4 volts. Output is controlled by 
regulating the on/off duration of the 
excitation current thats fed back 
to the field windings once the 
alternator is up to speed.
<p>
	Over the years, as voltage 
regulators have been superseded, 
there have been two, three, and 
four-wire hook-ups inside these 
alternators. Some are battery 
sensing, some are machine 
(alternator) sensing, some can do 
both. This is where some of the 
confusion starts.
<p>
	The four-wire (Black, Red, 
Yellow, White) regulator has a dual 
sensing, "fail-safe" feature; it can 
monitor both the battery and, if that 
connection fails, the machine. The 
two-wire (Black, Yellow) unit 
monitors available field 
excitation voltage, while the 
three-wire (Black, Yellow, White or 
Red) can monitor either the 
machine or the battery, depending 
on its connection at the diode pack. 
(Have your eyes started glazing 
over yet?) In all units the "field" 
connection is now made via a small 
strap, or "link", between the case of 
the regulator and the center field 
brush. This has replaced a green 
wire found on earlier units.
<p>
	Unless you know your 
alternator came on your car, it may 
have been replaced with an 
aftermarket rebuild using non-
Lucas regulators. Original Lucas 
regulators had a numerical code 
stamped into the case. Later units 
have a 3 letter and 3 digit code. 
Now the I.D. is something like 
UCB 104. Without those codes 
assume it's non-Lucas aftermarket. 
As of mid-1994 Lucas was 
supplying two, three, and four-wire 
regulators. 
<p>
	There are a couple of other 
items that may or may not be cased 
inside your alternator. Earlier units 
housed a 3 microfarad capacitor, 
attached between ground and the 
main output terminal to suppress 
radio noise. This was discontinued 
in 1979 and the part is no longer 
available. On newer units there's a 
surge protection diode wired 
between ground and the "IND" 
(indicator) conductor. As I'm 
finding out on some rebuilt units, 
this device may or may not be in 
place, probably depending on the 
vintage of the core. The alternator 
will work without it, but it does 
serve a purpose. This device is a 
zener diode, installed to protect the 
regulator's main output transistor. It 
absorbs high transient voltage 
caused by a faulty connector or by 
removing a battery cable while the 
engine is running. This diode is 
still available from Lucas and, if 
you're missing it, you may want to 
get one. (Check your parts catalogs 
for Lucas # UZB 106, cost is about 
$9) 
<p>
	Allow me to drive this point 
into your cranium; surge diode or 
no, NEVER, EVER, REMOVE 
EITHER BATTERY CABLE 
WHILE THE ALTERNATOR IS 
SUPPLYING CURRENT TO THE 
HARNESS. In less that a heartbeat 
an overvoltage spike could destroy 
a perfectly good regulator, or worse. 
'Nuff said?
<p>
	OK, out of nowhere, your 
"IGN" light starts glowing, where 
do you start? That little glow 
indicates an electrical imbalance 
between the alternator and the 
battery. 
<p>
	The warning light circuit also 
supplies a small current, via the 
IND terminal, to the field coil 
when the ignition is switched on. 
That in turn sets up a magnetic 
field, or "flux", within the field coil. 
Then, by spinning that magnetic 
field inside the stator windings, the 
alternator generates electricity. 
Once the car starts, the field 
becomes "self excited" and no 
longer needs current from the 
warning light circuit. If the 
alternator produces voltage that's 
less than the battery (or none at 
all), current continues to flow from 
the battery through the bulb and it 
continues to glow. If, after the car 
starts, the output voltage of the 
alternator equals the voltage at the 
battery terminals no current can 
flow because both terminals of the 
bulb have the same "potential". 
<p>
	If your battery goes flat and 
the bulb never comes on, you can 
check the operation of the bulb and 
it's wiring. After recharging the 
battery, and with the engine off, 
disconnect the plug that attaches 
the brown/yellow wire to the back 
of the alternator and turn the 
ignition switch "on".  Using a 
jumper wire, ground the 
brown/yellow wire. The bulb should 
light. If it doesn't, find out why. 
The bulb is either burned out or 
there's a bad connection.  
<p>
	When your bulb starts glowing 
or the dashboard gauge shows a no-
charge condition, see if charging 
current is reaching the battery. 
With the engine running at high 
idle (1500 rpm), measure the 
voltage at the battery terminals 
using a volt/ohm meter (VOM); 
digital is more accurate, but for this 
test an analog needle will work 
fine. On high idle, the voltage at 
the terminals should be between 
13.6 and 14.4 volts. Outside that 
range indicates bad or dirty 
connections or defective alternator. 
<p>
	The shop manuals recommend 
test procedures, but they require a 
specialized set-up. Easier, take the 
alternator into a TRAK or one of 
the armature shops for a bench test. 
Chances are they'll tell you it's 
dead. They won't tell you what's 
wrong, they'll just want to sell you 
another unit.
<p>
	Barring physical damage 
(engine fire, broken casing, etc.), 
there are only a couple things in an 
alternator that can fail. Bearings 
can fail from over tightened belts or 
age -- usually the one at the pulley 
end goes first. A medium sized gear 
puller and an $8 SKF brand bearing 
(#6202-2Z or equiv.) can it put 
right. Brushes, the carbon type that 
conducts "flux" current to the field 
coil through the slip rings, will last 
for 75-100 thousand miles and are 
cheap -- about $2 for the pair -- to 
replace. Renew them if they're 
shorter that 1/4". 
<p>
	Electrically, the stator and 
field windings are pretty durable, 
again, barring physical damage. 
That leaves the diode pack or 
regulator for likely failure. The 
stator, field windings, and diode 
pack can all be checked with any 
reasonable digital VOM (Radio 
Shack has a pocket sized unit, #22-
171, that sells for about $25, $18 on 
sale) or a self-powered 12v test 
lamp. 
<p>
	Get the alternator off the car, 
over to the work bench, and remove 
the rear plastic cover. Support the 
unit with the electronic component 
end up. See those three soldered 
connections near the grounding 
bolt? Those stator leads need to be 
desoldered from the diode pack. 
Youll probably need a 100-125 
watt soldering gun. Avoid using 
any more heat that necessary to 
prevent diode damage. Using 
needle-nose pliers, gently pull them 
away from the diode leads. Next, 
note how many and what color 
wires are coming out of the voltage 
regulator (that 11/2" square metal-
clad box), and where they attach. 
Note also any other wires and 
where they go. There will be at 
least one more jumper running 
from the outer field brush to the 
"IND" terminal. MAKE A 
DRAWING! 

<p>
<center>
<img src = "alternator-conec.gif">
</center>

	Remove the spade connectors 
that attach the regulator (and brush 
box) to the diode pack. Remove the 
two screws that retain the brush 
box/regulator assembly;  you need 
to do this to check the brushes and 
get to the slip rings of the field 
windings. 

<p>
	Time to start testing. Using a 
digital VOM, in the ohm setting, 
or the 12v powered test lamp, begin 
with those unsoldered stator leads. 
Check resistance between all three 
leads. On the VOM you should get 
a reading of around 0.2-0.3 ohms, 
virtually no resistance. With the 
12v lamp it should glow at full 
brightness. Next measure between 
those same three wires and that 
grounding bolt that holds the diode 
pack in place. There should be no 
reading, or the bulb should not 
light. Any other reactions here and 
you've found a bad stator. 

<p>
	Now that the brush box is off, 
check the windings of the field coil. 
With the VOM still in the ohm 
setting, probe the surfaces of the 
inner and outer slip rings. The 
copper should be nice and shiny. 
The reading should be around 4-7 
ohms, or the bulb should light. 
Next, test the insulation of the rotor 
windings. Get one probe tip down 
onto a clean metal area (scrape a 
little if necessary) of the rotor body, 
then probe both slip rings, one at a 
time. There should be no reading or 
the bulb shouldn't light. Any other 
reactions indicate a bad field 
winding, slip ring, or solder 
connection between the two. 

<p>
	All nine diodes of the rectifier 
need to be checked individually, but 
that can be done with it still in 
place. Remember good diodes only 
flow current in one direction. The 
diodes are tied together electrically 
onto three plates which serve as 
heat sinks and as attachment points 
for the alternator's harness plug and 
the voltage regulator. Testing can 
become a little confusing to explain 
so Ill break it down into numbered 
steps.  The two outer plates have 
the same polarity. The inner plate, 
closest to the brush box, is reversed. 
With that in mind, set your digital 
VOM to the "diode" setting (the 
ohm setting is no good here), or 
power up the test lamp. 

<p>
<ol>
<li>Attach the black (-) lead to 
one of the spade terminals of the 
outermost IND plate. Touch the 
red (+) lead to each of the three 
diode leads (where you desoldered 
the stator wires). You should get a 
meter reading at each terminal. 
Using the test lamp, the bulb should 
light. 

<p>
<li>Move the black lead onto 
the center plate and repeat the 
process with the red lead.

<p>
<li>For the third, innermost 
plate, reverse the leads; i.e. red to 
the plate, black to the diode leads. 

<p>
	If you got a reading or the 
bulb lit in each of the nine tests, so 
far, so good. They're all conducting 
in the forward direction. 

<p>
	Now, we need to reverse the 
diode test procedure, and the 
current flow. 

<p>
<li>Starting with the inner 
plate, connect the black lead to the 
plate and probe the diode leads with 
the red. There should be no reading 
or the bulb should not light.

<p>
<li>Moving back out to the 
middle plate, once more swap 
leads, puting red on the plate's 
spade connector and probe the 
diode leads with the black.

<p>
<li>Finally, back to the outer 
plate, attach red onto the spade 
terminal, black on the diode leads.

<p>
	During the reverse part of the 
diode test there should be no 
reaction by meter or bulb.
</ol>

<p>
	If you find one or two bad 
diodes in the pack you may  be able 
to replace the offending bits (30 
amp, 100 volt), but the whole diode 
pack can be replaced for about $15;  
by the time you find the parts, try to 
cobble them in . . .why bother. If 
there are two or more diodes out, 
consider the regulator faulty also. 
Replace both units. 

<p>
	There are involved ways to 
check the regulator, but if the 
brushes, stator, field windings, and 
diode pack check out, chances are 
real good that replacing the 
regulator will get the alternator 
back in service.

<p>
	When replacing a regulator on 
a 15 through 18 ACR (or the 20 or 
25 ACR), replacement by one with 
the same wire count as the original 
is quickest and most desirable. 

<p>
	The only difference between 
the three and four-wire regulators is 
the dual-sensing capability 
provided by the fourth wire; the 
white provides battery sensing 
while red provides machine 
sensing.  A three-wire will replace 
a four-wire unit by disregarding the 
fourth wire connection. 

<p>
<center>
<img src = "alternator-plug.gif">
</center>

	On three-wire units, the white 
wire will attach to the "S" terminal 
(where the smaller brown harness 
plug wire attaches); that makes it a 
battery sensing unit. A red wire 
from the regulator will attach to a 
"+" main output terminal of the 
diode pack (where the larger brown 
plug wire attaches); it's a machine 
sensor. Black and yellow will go 
back to ground and the outer field 
brush respectively. A four-wire unit 
will replace a three-wire by simply 
connecting the additional red or 
white wire to the other appropriate 
terminal.

<p>
	Two-wire units, with just a 
black and yellow lead, monitor the 
voltage values of the IND exciter 
circuit. No external sensor is 
required. Attach the black lead to 
ground and the yellow lead to the 
outer field brush terminal. 

<p>
	When reattaching the wires, 
don't forget that little jumper wire 
that runs from the outer field brush 
to the IND spade.

<p>
	In a conversation with Dave at 
The Roadster Factory, they carry 
three-wire regulators. When I 
checked with my local rebuild shop 
(Arlington Armature), they carry a 
two-wire and, even though their 
computer listing said three, a four-
wire unit. When I called 
Motorhead, they had a NOS on the 
shelf, circa 1976, with a green and 
yellow wire -- who knows? 


<p>
	Now, if you have an earlier 
model TR with a five-wire, two 
plug connection on the back of your 
15 AC alternator, there's an update 
kit that will allow you to convert 
your wiring harness to the newer, 
single, three-prong connector. 
Since that older style alternator is 
getting harder to find, the updated 
connector may get your TR back on 
the road sooner.  The Lucas 
conversion kit part number is CYB 
400. Roadster Factory carries the 
kit for about $6. It probably 
wouldnt be a bad idea to have one 
on hand.

<p>
	I can guarantee I have not 
covered all the possibilities in 
Lucas alternator wiring 
configurations, but I have tried to 
cover the ones most likely found in 
our cars. If, and when, your 
alternator forgets how to work, try 
to rebuild it yourself. If time doesn't 
permit, buy the rebuilt, but hang 
onto the core and rebuild it for a 
spare. You just never know when 
you'll need a back up.

	can with the top up and then lower to remove the last 2.
</ul>

<h3>Drill rivets:</h3>
<ul>
<li>	Drill and remove all rivets.
<li>	NOTE: Some repairs have used another size rivet, so move up
	to the next size bit and re-drill.  Usually drilling 1/4" deep
	and rotating the drill handle back and forth while drilling
	will pop the cap and allow the rest to be tapped through with
	a small punch.  Use aluminum for all non-exposed rivets as
	they are much easier to fix your mistakes and put on a new
	top next time.
</ul>

<h3>Adjust frame:</h3>
<ul>
<li>	Lay the frame partially folded, inside down on the floor.
	View from the rear and make both sides symetrical.  It
	helps to have a second car to compare with.  Trial fit
	on the car a few times.  There are 3 bolts on each side,
	these should be replaced.  I used hip bolts cut to length
	for all of these as the hip reduces the wear on the threads
	at the hinge point.  It removes the slop in the joints.
</ul>

<h3>Paint frame:</h3>
<ul>
<li>	Sand rust, Navel Jelly, rinse, paint, dry overnight.
</ul>

<h3>Install top:</h3>

<ol>
	<li>  Lay top inside on carpet, fold in half, outside out,
	    align door edges, "white-out" a 2 1/4" mark on front center.
	<li> Fold in half, inside out, align rear window edges and door
	    rear edges, "white-out" a 1" mark on rear center, another
	    1/2" mark on top of rear window bow stub, both sides.
	<li> Place top inside up, firmly push rear channel in crevice
	    at rear, double check, double check, punch hole from inside
	    through channel, though outside layer.  Insert snap, rivet,
	    from outside through top, channel, inside layer, add washer
	    and snap rivet (practice once first).
	<li> Pulling out from center and keeping the channel firmly
	    pressed into the crevice, repeat the prior step for the next one
	    on either side of center, add foam rivet cover to 3 rivets
	<li> Now get an assistant to help here, pull as much a humanly
	    possible to each end and rivet the other 4 holes.  This
	    determines the amount of wrinkle in the rear window as well
	    as how much you miss the door opening.  Every 1/4" counts.
	    NOTE: you may read ahead to see what an advantage 1/4" is.
	<li> Bolt top to car with top over trunk, leave 2 outer channel
	    bolts slightly loose.
	<li> Slide strap pins through sewned end of strap so the good side
	    is down AFTER sliding through channel slot, repeat.
	<li> Pull Strap over center bow to front, leave front frame unclamped,
	    so each side is about 1" short, mark line on the front of the
	    leading edge clip.  Now wrap around clip the other way and punch
	    2 holes (this gets it closer to the top and out of the clamp's
	    way).  Rivet, repeat for other side.  Check frame position,
	    drill and repeat as necessary.  GET this RIGHT!  Toggle clamp's.
	<li> Rivet main bow both sides
	<li> Position front bow outside rivet hole 1/2 way between main bow
	    rivet hole and leading edge rivet hole (12 1/4" each side).
	    NOTE: This determines height of the sides over the windows.
	<li> Position rear outside rivet hole 10" rear of main bow rivet
	    hole and rivet in place.
	<li> Repeat rivet and position steps (9-10) for the other side.
	<li> Apply strips of velcro on all 3 bows, start in the middle.
	<li> Pull top over frame with mark in middle, use 2 1/4" over lap
	    with Robbins top, all bows should line up with the seams.
	    Try the top fit by holding and closing top, match main bow.
	    The top should already be cut to match the front edge contour.
	    Punch hole for middle rivet on the mark made previously, the
	    2 1/4" mark on a Robbins top should align with the edge and hole.
	    Spray inside front edge of frame, pull top, rivet center.
	    NOTE: You use the spark plug cap here to prevent the rail
	    from crushing, place over rivet stem.
	<li> Test fit, pull, make hole, rivet, repeat for center 5 rivets
	    NOTE: The Robbins top is cut the same as the frame, so just
	    leave a consistent amount and pull it out from the center.
	<li> Fold, glue, edge flap, pull the corner pieces, rivet, repeat.
	<li> NOTE: verify three body snaps are in the original position as
	    you want this top to fit other cars and be correct.  Mine
	    are 7" from rear to middle, 7 1/2" from middle to front.
	<li> Pull rear to the side, remember the end of the door jam piece
	    must align with the door edge of the chrome cap by the time
	    you get there, so you likely need to stretch each side about 1",
	    i.e 1/4" per snap.  Mark hole from the outside, punch hole for
	    snaps (1/8" punch), use the snap tool, snap each snap as you go
	    and work around to the door.  Place snap hole 1/2" from bottom
	    of reflective strip, so the botton of the top is snug against
	    the body.  Just get the snaps to stay in place, finish later. 
	    NOTE: this is about 3/4" from absolute edge.
	<li> Inside car, wrap front bow with stub, front, bottom, rear and
	    rivet it 4 times.  Make it look nice, snug only, don't pull
	    this one.
	<li> Place the holes for the rear stub, rear, bottom, front.  Check
	    the mark you made here for center.  I release the rear channel,
	    folded the top in strange ways to attach the snaps to the rear
	    stub.  I also gave the side snaps some more effort.
	<li> Replace the side velcro and bolts, adjust with window placement

</ol>
<p>	    

	You're done, I suggest leaving the top up and out in the sun a
	couple of weeks to let it get stretched out.

<title>Better Motor Oil -- Consumer Reports Review</title>

<h2>Better Motor Oil -- Consumer Reports Review</h2>
<h4>Article by Marti Emerald of KGTV, Channel 10 News, San Diego, CA,<br>
Reported from <i>Consumer Reports</i> Magazine</h4>
</center>
<HR size=10>

<p>
Consumer Reports has gone inside the engines of New York City taxi
cabs to test motor oils.  It's the magazine's biggest and most
expensive test ever.  One that could save you money--and maybe even
your car.<P>

75 New York City taxis took part in Consumer Reports' test.  Inside
each engine is one of 20 motor oils from Quaker State, Pennzoil and
other brands.  Test director Don Mays explains: "Cabs and their engines
are the perfect test vehicles.  The stop-and-go driving of taxi
service gives motor oils a very severe workout.  Plus, taxi cabs
accumulate a lot of miles over a very short period of time."<P>

Early on in the project, identical engines, all even painted the same
blue color, went into the cabs.  Identical engines meant each oil
would be tested under the same conditions.  Then the cabs are sent out
on their regular rounds.  Now, most have completed their 60,000 test
miles.  The engines are being checked for wear and tear deposits.  And
testers say they're already seeing some differences.<P>

<blockquote>
<EM>"When we're all through, we hope to be able to tell you which are
the best oils for your car, and how often you should change your
oil."</EM><P>
<p align=right>
<font size=-1>
Don Mays -- Consumer Reports
</font>
</p>
</blockquote>

For now, says Mays, no matter what brand of oil you use, there's one
thing to look for:<P>

<blockquote>
<EM>"Make sure that the oil you get has got a starburst symbol on the
label.  That indicates that the oil meets the highest performance
standards."</EM><P>
<p align=right>
<font size=-1>
Don Mays -- Consumer Reports
</font>
</p>
</blockquote>

These oils usually cost no more.  But tests show they can save wear
and tear on your engine, cut down on deposits and even give you better
gas mileage, no matter where you drive.<P>

Consumer Reports warns, if you have a new car, using oil without the
starburst may void your engine warranty.  Testers say the oil should
also have the right thickness grade.  For instance, 10-W-30 or 5-W-30.
To find the grade recommended for your car, check your owner's manual
or the oil cap on your engine.

<TITLE>Triumph TR6 Window Seals</TITLE>

<h2>
Triumph TR6 Window Seals</h2>
<i>by Kenneth Streeter<br>
<a href="mailto:streeter@sanders.com">streeter@sanders.com</a></i>
</center>
<HR size=10>


<p>

Steve Sutton had asked about the application of the TR6 window seals
on the Triumphs mailing list:

<blockquote>
<pre>

Subject: TR-6 rubber seals (74 1/2 TR-6)
   Date: Wed, 2 Oct 1996 13:34:53 -0700
  From:  Steve Sutton <ssutton@ridgecrest.ca.us>
     To: triumphs@autox.team.net


I am just finishing up installing the last rubber seals on my TR-6 and
have run into a snag.  I don't how two of the seals are correctly
installed.  The first is the seal that is glued to the each side of
the windshield frame and helps seal the side windows.  The seal has
part # 620913 and looks like this is cross-section 'O_' .  Does the
'O' portion align with the outer edge of the windshield frame or the
other side (the '_' portion)?

Also, the front hood (bonnet) seal has a slight curve when looking at
it's cross-section.  Does the curve go up (toward the hood) or down
(toward the grill)?

</pre>
</blockquote>


In order to answer the question, I took a quick jog out to the parking
lot to take a look at <a href="/people/streeter/lbc/">my TR6</a> (74
1/2, CF 27535) to see how these seals are installed.  I don't know for
certain that the seals are as applied by the factory, but they sure
seem like it!

<p>

However, trying to describe in text what this all looked like, it
became clear that a picture would be worth at least a thousand words.
Thus, here is my somber attempt at a line art depicting how the window
seal and door seal are attached to the side of the windshield frame:
(the below diagram is of the right side window)



<p>
<center>
<img src = "window-seals.gif">
</center>
<p>


As for the front bonnet seal, it is much simpler.  The curve goes up
towards the bonnet.  (This seal is mostly horizontal, as the seal
itself is applied to the "bent-over" top lip of the front valence.)
The below drawing may help demonstrate what this looks like.  (The
drawing is from the perspective of kneeling next to the right side of
the car, so that the seal is at eye level, looking at the bonnet seal,
with the hood raised.)

<p>

<p>

I hope these are understandable!  If there are better artists out
there, feel free to improve upon my diagrams, and send them to me to
put in this page!

<TITLE>Triumph Pressure Differential Warning Actuator</TITLE>
</head>
<BODY BGCOLOR="c0d0c0">

<h2>
Triumph Pressure Differential Warning Actuator</h2>
<i>by Charlie Brown<br>
<a href="mailto:CBrown1500@aol.com">CBrown1500@aol.com</a></i>
</center>
<HR size=10>


<p>

There's a small, sometimes overlooked, piece of important equipment on
Triumphs with dual (tandem) brake systems: the Pressure Differential
Warning Actuator, also known as the PDWA.

<p>

Around the late '60s, Triumph began using these simple devices to warn
drivers of leaks in their braking system. I say "simple" because the
actual mechanical portion is just that. The switch, however, and it's
electrical connection to the wiring harness took on slightly different
variations through the years - consult the manual for your car.
<p>

The operation is straight forward and easy to understand. Although the
early units had two internal pistons and two end caps, and later units
had a single larger piston and one end opening, the operation is the
same. When you apply the brake, pressure from the master cylinder's
front and rear lines flows by and exerts an equal force on either end
of the piston(s) (sometimes referred to as the "shuttlecock") located
in the PDWA. If at any time, fluid leaks from either the front or rear
system, the greater pressure from the end that's not leaking will
force the PDWA piston toward the side that can't hold pressure. When
that happens, the reduced dimension at the center of the piston is
moved off-center, causing the actuating pin of the electrical switch
to depress, triggering the dashboard warning light.


<p>
<center>
<img src = "pdwa-drawing.gif">
</center>
<p>

As with any brake component that uses rubber seals, they are subject
to eventual failure.  In the case of the PDWA, fault comes in the form
of decaying "O" rings.  When the O-rings fail to seal, brake fluid is
allowed to enter the central switch chamber and eventually past the
switch itself, creating an external brake fluid leak.

<p>

Although I couldn't find a listing for a rebuild kit from the typical
suppliers, Lucas Girling shows a drawing, and gives overhaul
procedures in some of the generic instruction sheets that come bundled
with their master cylinder overhaul kits. Lacking an official rebuild
kit, and after experimenting with different compounds, I found the
proper "O" rings by special order from a local hydraulics supplier.

<p>

Upon disassembly of my PDWA, I found the supposedly dry central switch
chamber fouled with old brake fluid and contamination that had found
its way past leaking "O" rings. My later style has one end cap, so the
contents of the unit had to tapped out of that end. The far end "O"
ring stuck in the bore and had to be carefully "hooked" out. Earlier
units can be opened at both ends, making the internals a bit easier to
push out. As with any brake component, carefully watch the order in
which the parts come out. On the early two end cap units, there may be
a tiny ball bearing and an "earth connection spring" that works with
the switch assembly. Carefully examine the bore. It should be smooth
and not pitted. If it's pitted you've got two choices: replace with
new (from about $90 - $190)), or have it resleeved by a place like
White Post Restorations or Apple Hydraulics (about $60).

<p>
<center>
<img src = "pdwa-photo.gif">
</center>
<p>

Barring a pitted bore, or really badly rusted components, the only
renewable parts needed are two internal O-Rings and another "O" ring
or copper crush washers fitted on the end plug(s). Early PDWAs, with
the double pistons, used smaller square cut "O" rings. Unfortunately,
these are hard to find in small quantities, and of the correct
material. They can be replaced with the normal, round profile "O" ring
of the same dimensions. That size should be something like 7/32" ID x
11/32 OD (Uniform Dash size -009). Later units with single pistons
have 3/8" ID x 9/16" OD (size -110) and a 5/8" ID x 3/4" OD (size
-016) for the end cap seal. In either case, carefully measure the ID,
OD, and profile of the old "O" rings just to be sure. I can only be
sure of what I've disassembled!

<p>

Here's the really important information. When you go to the local
hydraulic supply counter, specify Ethylene Propylene (EP) for your "O"
ring material. It's the only compound that will stand up to a
prolonged soak in DOT 3 or DOT 4 brake fluid. Anything else (at least
at the time of this article) is doomed to early failure.

<p>

If you choose to replace your badly rusted early PDWA with a later
unit, you may encounter a brake line thread problem. The threaded
ports on the later, single piston, unit are different. Be prepared to
replace one or two of the brake lines, or find yourself a brake line
tool that will do an ISO or bubble flare. Eastwood carries the tool,
but it's about $70.

<p>

On reassembly, as with any brake component, work on a clean surface
and use the brake fluid of your choice to lubricate all parts. Before
replacing the switch (along with the ball bearing and spring on early
units), check to make sure the reduced "waist" area of the piston is
centralized below the switch hole. If the piston(s) are off center
when you reinstall the PDWA, you'll need to re-centralize the piston
using the procedure in your shop manual.

The Stag is one of the least well known Triumphs imported to the
United States.  The Stag was a wonderful concept, but sales suffered
primarily due to problems with the maintenance of the newly designed
Triumph V-8: a 3.0 litre overhead camshaft engine.

</center> 

<p> Setting the air-fuel mixture using a Colortune involves replacing
the spark plug in one of the cylinders with the special Colortune
plug.  The Colortune plug has a transparent window that allows you  to
see the flame color in the cylinder as it fires.  An overly rich
mixture will have a yellow flame and will be accompanied by black
smoke (and noxious fumes) from the tailpipes.  As you lean it out to
the optimum stoichiometric mixture, the flame color will change to
Bunsen blue.  A mixture that is too lean will still have a blue
flame, but the brightness will decrease as the mixture is weakened.
If the piston dampers in each carb are working correctly, you should
see the flame color change from blue to yellow when you open the
throttle, and then change back to blue as the engine comes up to
speed.  Read the Colortune instruction sheet for full details on how
the system works.
<p> In order to set the air-fuel ratio correctly, you need to know which
carburetor feeds which cylinder before you can start making adjustments.
In this section, all references to &quot;right&quot; or &quot;left&quot;
are made when sitting in the driver's seat looking toward the front of
the car.
<p> The Stag V8 engine is fed by two Zenith Stromberg 175CD SEV
carburetors mounted on a two-plane manifold.  The right carburetor
feeds the lower plane, which connects cylinders 1, 4, 6, and 7.  The
left carburetor feeds the upper plane, which connects cylinders 2, 3,
5, and 8.  There is a small balancing passageway that connects the two
manifold planes, so you may see some small effects of adjusting one of
the carbs in a cylinder not directly connected to it.  Be aware that
the cylinders in the Stag V8 are not numbered per the standard method
(#1 at the left front), as illustrated in the figure below:

<h3>Tuning and Improving the Stag Ignition System</h3> 
This section was written by William Mayo and Walter Holliday 
</center> 
<center> 
and originally appeared in Issue 38 of The Vintage Triumph magazine
(currently out of print) 
</center> 
 
<p> 
The importance of a sound ignition system to the running of a car  
cannot be overstressed.  This is particulaly true of the Stag, whose  
high-revving V-8 and twin-point distributor create special  
challenges. 
 
<p> 
The heart of the ignition system is the distributor - Lucas in the  
case of the Stag.  The Lucas distributor is as reliable as any,  
provided it is given proper maintenance.  This is actually quite  
simple and will reward the owner with increased distributor life and  
enhanced reliability, performance, and economy. 
 
<p> 
To service the unit, one needs only a small oil can, a tube of Bosch  
point lube (or similar), and a thin-blade screwdriver.  Removal of  
the unit and major service require, in addition, a 1/2&quot; and  
7/16&quot; combination wrench, and a Phillips screwdriver. 
 
<p> 
Before maintenance can be performed, one must first ascertain the  
condition of the unit through a thorough inspection.  Carefully pry  
back the cap retaining clips by hand or with the aid of a  
screwdriver.  Once off, rotate the ignition rotor counterclockwise  
to the full extent of its travel.  If the rotor does not return to  
the home position, or is slow to return, the centrifugal advance  
mechanism is probably gummed up or dirty.  Lubrication may solve the  
problem, and as this can be done &quot;in situ&quot;, it should be tried  
first.  If cleaning is necessary, removal of the unit is required.   
Ensure also that the rotor is tight to the shaft.  If it can shift  
back and forth on its own, the rotor key is worn and the rotor needs  
replacing.  The operation of the vacuum advance, retard, or  
advance/retard mechanism should also be checked.  On Stags an  
incredibly high number of these units are defective or perished.   
This results in a poor idle and power curve as the car is relying  
entirely on the centrifugal advance and has a vacuum leak as well.   
To check the unit, follow the hose or hoses to the vacuum pick-up on  
the carb or manifold and remove it at this point.  Leave it attached  
to the distributor.  Examine the hose for cracking or brittleness  
and replace it if perished.  It is of common size and can be  
obtained at an American (for the Stag, &quot;foreign&quot; parts  
house. After inspecting or replacing the hose, suck on the end of it  
and observe the resulting movement in the distributor.  One of the  
following results should occur:  (1) If no vacuum is built up, the  
vacuum unit has a hole in the diaphragm and needs to be replaced.   
(2) If vacuum is built up, but leaks down when you block the tube  
with your tongue, the diaphragm has a small hole in it and still  
needs to be replaced.  (3) If vacuum is built up, but the plate  
refuses to move or moves sluggishly and sticks, lubrication and/or  
cleaning are required.  (4) If the plate moves, then returns when  
you release vacuum, it is functioning properly. 
 
<p> 
Next, we remove the rotor and try to move the shaft side-to-side in  
order to check the condition of the distributor bushings.  If this  
movement exceeds .002 to .003&quot;, the bushings are worn out.  Worn  
bushings cause irregular dwell, poor idle, and poor running.  If  
worn out, the distributor must be rebushed, replaced, or an  
electronic ignition may be fitted... more on this <a  
href="#elec">later</a>. 
 
<p> 
Assuming the distributor has passed muster, we can lubricate it.   
The distributor is not self-lubricating (except for the lower  
bushing).  Lubrication should be done sparingly and often  
(approximately every 3000 miles).  Excessive oil or grease will be  
spattered on the points causing them to burn.  Apply two drops of  
oil to the spindle bushing by way of the large screw located  
directly under the rotor.  (There may be a felt pad on top of this  
screw to retain the centrifugal advance weights.)  Apply one drop to  
each point pivot pin and one or two drops to the collar where the  
breaker plate and the lower plate contact.  Smear a bit of the point  
lube on the cam faces (the area where the points touch the  
spindle).  <strong>DO NOT</strong> use Vaseline or other types of  
grease as they will spin off the cam from the heat and centrifugal  
force.  Other brands of point lube (such as GM) can be used if the  
Bosch type is not readily available.  Also, smear a small amount on  
the distributor cap/body interface.  This will seal out water, thus  
preventing cross-firing or grounding in moist conditions.  Wipe off  
any excess oil or grease and carefully examine the cap and rotor  
before returning them to the distributor. 
 
<p> 
Examine the firing tip of the rotor for burning, the center of the  
rotor (where the carbon rod touches) for wear, and the key to make  
sure that the rotor will not rotate on the shaft.  Check the cap  
electrodes for burning and the cap in general for minute cracks or  
carbon tracking.  Any of these condition can cause misfiring under  
certain condition.  Finally, check the center carbon electrode for wear.
This is a common occurrance on the Stag.  The new length is approximately
1/2&quot;.  If it protrudes less than 1/8&quot;, it is time to replace
the cap.  When the electrode wears to the point that it no longer touches
the rotor, the rotor will develop a cratered appearance from arcing.
The rotor will also have tiny arc marks on it.  At this point,
performance will be seriously affected.  Since the cap (Unipart GDC117)
is fitted to very few other cars (TR8, Rover, and some Roll-Royce),
the prudent owner should carry a spare in the trunk. 
 
<p> 
If distributor removal is necessary, <i>i.e.,</i> to replace the  
vacuum unit, rebush the shaft, or to install electronic ignition,  
this can be done after removing the coil with a 7/16&quot; wrench.   
The coil must also be removed to set the timing, unless using  
factory tool S349.  Before removing the distributor, align the  
engine at TDC and mark the position of the rotor with a small  
scratch on the distributor body to aid reinstallation.  Do not  
rotate the engine with the distributor removed or you will lose the  
ignition timing. 
 
<p> 
<A NAME="elec"></a> 
Since the points are expensive and subject to a high rate of wear as  
well as frequent need for adjustment, we generally recommend their  
replacement with an electronic ignition unit.  Although many brands  
are of questionable quality, we have found the Allison unit to be  
both reliable and inexpensive.  Of the approximately 100 unit we  
have sold or installed, we have not had a single warranty claim, and  
they come with a lifetime warranty.  The advantages of the unit are:   
(1) as the unit uses a light beam, there are no touching parts,  
hence no wear, (2) the unit can be used in a distributor with a worn  
shaft bushing without loss of performance, thus obviating the need  
to rebush the unit, (3) easier starting and better idle, and (4) no  
need to reset the dwell or timing once it is initially set. 
 
<p> 
The coil should also be checked by holding the coil wire  
approximately 1/2 to 3/4&quot; from the engine block while an  
assistant cranks the engine.  The coil should have a strong spark.   
Coils do wear out, usually by internally shorting some of the  
windings, and should be replaced if weak or suspect.  If using the  
stock ignition system, replace the unit with a Lucas Super Sport  
coil.  If using an electronic ignition system, use an Allison street  
or track coil.  The various types of coils are designed with a  
specific build-up and discharge rate and the correct type should be  
used.  While the engine will run with practically any coil, optimum  
performance will not be achieved if an incorrect one is fitted. 
 
<p> 
Spark plug wires should also be examined for wear and insulation  
breakdown.  Carbon core wires tend to break down after a while  
causing poor performance.  If arcing to ground is seen when the  
bonnet is raised and the engine is running at night, the wires  
should definitely be replaced.  Ensure, also, that the wires are  
secure in the looms on the cam covers and thus out of harm's way.   
The Stag has two looms on each side of the engine and on many cars  
they are either missing or broken.  If so, they should be replaced.   
Spark plugs should be cleaned and gapped every 6000 miles and  
replaced every 12,000 miles or sooner if indicated.  We prefer the  
NGK BP5E or BP5R to the stock plugs.

and originally appeared in Issue 38 of The Vintage Triumph magazine 
(currently out of print) 
</center>  
<center>[Section added by Tim Buja]</center> 
<p> The Stag needs all the help it can get in order to prevent boiling  
over.  Most Stags have the familiar hexagon-shaped brass plug on  
top of the radiator; early models had the American style pressure  
relief cap.  During periods of peak pressure, coolant is allowed to  
run into the plastic collection bottle.  Because most of these  
bottles were fitted with pressure caps rated at only 13 lbs. per  
square inch, we strongly recommend the use of 20 lb. caps which  
became standard on later model Stags.  If your dealer can provide  
one, it is Unipart # GRC124. 
 
<p> Equally important is the use of a good thermostat.  Never attempt to  
operate the car without one.  The principal behing the  
&quot;pump-assisted, thermo-siphoned&quot; cooling system is that  
coolant remains in the radiator long enough to be cooled before  
returning to the engine.  The thermostat regulates this flow.  In  
addition, it provides a very necessary build up of pressure because  
the water pump works best when it assists the flow of coolant  
already in motion.

<p> [Be sure that you have the correct type of thermostat.  To improve
drivability and shorten the engine warm-up time, the Stag has a bypass
port behind the thermostat which connects the water pump suction line
to the intake manifold coolant chamber.  Since it collects all of the
coolant flow from the engine through both of the cylinder heads, the
intake manifold coolant chamber is the hottest part of the cooling system.
The heated manifold prevents fuel from condensing on its inner walls and
causing drivability problems like lean stumble.  The bypass port allows
the manifold to heat up faster by allowing coolant to flow into the water
pump via the intake manifold coolant chamber as the engine warms up.
In addition to the manifold chamber passageway, coolant can also flow
from the left cylinder head through the heater control valve and heater
core to the water pump.  If the heater valve is closed, there won't be any
flow through this path, leaving the bypass port as the only path for
coolant flow into the water pump when the engine is cold.

<p>  As the engine comes up to normal operating temperature, the
thermostat should close off the bypass port as it opens the main discharge
line to the upper radiator hose (hot side of the radiator).  Most
thermostats do not have the blanking disk that closes this bypass port.
If you use one without the blanking disk, the water pump will take suction
from both the hot and cold sides of the radiator.  In addition to raising
the temperature of the coolant pumped back into the engine, this will
reduce the volume of coolant flowing through the radiator.  The
Robertshaw type 412-180 thermostat (or equivalent) has the proper blanking
disk to close off the bypass port at normal operating temperature.]
 
<p> The mating of aluminum and iron castings in an engine poses the  
special problem of corrosion, and as local water sources often  
contain a high concentration of minerals, coolant composition should  
not be overlooked.  We recommend a mixture of Prestone II antifreeze  
and distilled water at all times.  The correct ratio is 50/50.  In  
that strength, your car is drivable from a cold start down to -33F,  
and, after minimal warm up, as cold as -53F.  Whenever adding  
coolant, be sure to use the same mixture. 
 
<p> The Stag cooling system holds 22-1/2 US pints.  If you can't fit  
that volume into a dry engine [and heater core], then there is  
probably a trapped air pocket somewhere.  Coolant should be added  
with the engine running and warm.  Make sure the heater control is  
in [the full hot] position.  It's been suggested that having the  
front end of the car raised when filling will eliminate air  
pockets.  As a final step, hold the overflow bottle higher than the  
radiator when filling. 
 
<p> Back flush the cooling system once a year after cleansing with a  
suitable cleaning agent.  If you have any doubt about the condition  
of your radiator, it is best to have it &quot;rodded&quot; and  
cleaned in a tank by a competent radiator shop.  Make sure that the  
radiator is not painted by the shop afterward, as most types of  
paint can clog the thin metal fins.  If you must have the cosmetic  
touch, we suggest a light coating of the type of paint used on  
barbecue grills. 
 
<p> It really is important to keep the radiator full at all times.   
Replacement heads are costly items.  The high-mounted water pump  
makes the balance of water between the heads delicate at best.  As  
many Stag owners know all too well, the heads must be properly  
cool[ed] to prevent warpage... after skimming off 10 to 15  
thousandths, about all you can do is buy expensive, extra-thick  
gaskets. 
 
<p> Crankcase oil functions as a coolant, too, so keep it clean and up  
to capacity.  Proper torque settings of head bolts are exceptionally  
important.  We are looking into the rumored advantage of increasing  
the manufacturer's recommended setting (55 [ft-]lb.) by additional 5  
[ft-] lb. 
 
<p> The intake manifold, which allows coolant to flow from head to head,  
while at the same time keeping the carburettors warm, uses gaskets  
on either side that have very narrow bands of material surrounding  
the inlets.  These are sometimes the source of leaks.  Universal  
type radiator hoses, of the &quot;accordion&quot; type, are not  
recommended as they offer little flexibility and can cause cracks  
where they attach to the radiator fittings.  Use properly suited,  
molded radiator hoses.  Exhaust headers, available for the Stag, are  
thought to act as heat sinks, thereby eliminating a certain amount  
of heat. 
 
<p> In summing up, it is fair to say that practically  
<strong>anything</strong> can be the cause of overheating.  On that  
list you might include:  ignition timing, exhaust valve clearance,  
vacuum hoses to distributor or air cleaner, air leaking in past the  
&quot;O&quot; ring on the base of the carburettors, a cracked block,  
and sticking brakes.  One final suggestion:  If you live in an  
excessively hot area and wish to have every measure of protection  
available, you might want to consider installing one of the  
imported, heavy duty radiators.  These units are 4-row, staggered  
core affairs, and reputed to be of very high quality.

<HR>  <A NAME="wheel"></a> <center> <h3>Tips for the Maintenance of Stag Wheels</h3> This section was written by William Mayo and Walter Holliday 
</center> 
<center> 
and appeared in Issue 38 of The Vintage Triumph magazine (currently 
out of print) 
</center>  
<p> 
Proper maintenance has the result of making a vehicle safer, more  
reliable, and less expensive to own.  For those Stags equipped with  
wire wheels (1970-1972) it is important that spline extensions and  
hubs be attended to properly.  Failure to do so can result in spline  
wear (&quot;clunking&quot;) and, in extreme cases, loss of a wheel  
at speed. 
 
<p> 
Spline maintenance is easy enough, although it is somewhat messy.   
Mechanics tend to avoid it because it's also rather time consuming,  
hence it becomes the responsibility of the owner.  First, the wheel  
nut is removed, and if possible, the wheel itself.  If the wheel  
will not come off, squirt some WD-40 [or similar penetrating oil]  
into the space between the splines and allow it to penetrate.  If  
the wheel still refuses to part from the spline, the next step is to  
drive the car back and forth slowly (2-3 mph) on level ground while  
repeatedly applying the brakes.  Having done this, jack up the car  
again and further attempt to remove the wheel.  If neither method  
works, the wheel and hub are probably too perished to use anyway,  
and the wheel will have to be torched off.  After removing the  
wheel, the splines should be thoroughly cleaned with solvent and a  
wire brush.  I find that a brush the size of a toothbrush works  
best, particularly for the wheel.  After cleaning, the splines  
should be coated lightly with PBC (a copper-based lubricant) and  
reassembled.  Do not use other types of grease as they still allow  
rust and corrosion <i>[and can spatter the surface of the wheel with an  
oily film - TVT Ed.]</i>.  Replace the wheel and tighten the nut.   
Retighten after driving 50 miles.  This procedure should be  
performed twice a year. 
 
<p> 
While on the subject of wire wheels, I should also mention that for  
a wire wheel to be really safe and serviceable, all of the spokes  
should be intact and tight.  Two spokes broken of the wheel's  
seventy-two does not mean that the wheel is 70/72 OK.  If any spokes  
are broken, get them replaced and have the wheel trued.  A rough  
test can be made by &quot;plinking&quot; the spokes with your finger  
or a wrench and listening to the response.  All of the spokes should  
have approximately the same sound.  A dead sounding spoke means that  
truing is called for. 
 
<p> 
Regarding alloy wheels, the situation is much simpler.  All lugs  
should be lightly coated with PBC and hand-tightened with a 6-point  
socket and torque wrench.  As the lug nuts are of aluminum alloy  
(and expensive) air wrenches should not be used.  On a final note,  
if your car must ever be towed on its front wheels (and has wire  
wheels) the wheels will have to be tightened every few miles as  
counter-rotation will cause the nuts to loosen.  If possible, it is  
always best to flat-bed or trailer the car. 

<p> <a href="#QuickIndex">Return to Quick Index</a>  
<HR>  <A NAME="idle"></a> <center> <h3>Setting the Idle Speed</h3>
This section was written by Tim Buja </center>  

<P>
When setting the idle speed on a Stag equipped with the Borg Warner
automatic transmission, you must strike a balance between an idle
speed high enough for sufficient oil pressure, but low enough to permit
smooth gear selection.  Ideally, the BW automatic prefers its idle speed
to be around 500-600 rpm in neutral, but it is rare to find a Stag that
will idle that low nowadays due to worn carb and distributor parts.  An
idle speed higher than 900-1000 rpm in neutral will cause the
transmission to engage Reverse or Drive with a lurch.  If you can't get
the idle speed low enough, you may need to check the carb throttle shaft
seals and/or the carb pedestal-to-manifold o-ring for leaks, and for
proper actuation of the vacuum retard mechanism.

<P> It is common for the breaker point baseplate assembly to wear to the
point where the proper point gap can not be reliably set and maintained.
Since this affects both dwell and timing, it will also affect the idle
quality and speed.

<P> Another wear point to check is where the vacuum capsule actuating rod
connects to the breaker point baseplate.  Check for elongation of the
hole in the actuating rod, and for wear in the threaded pin that connects
it to the baseplate.  Excessive slop in either part here will not allow
the vacuum capsule to reliably retard the timing to its proper setting.
This will result in a higher than normal idle speed, which can result in
annoying vibration or shaking at idle with both Drive and brakes
engaged (when you're stuck at a traffic light, for example).  If you
encounter this shaking, try moving the gear selector from Drive to
Neutral.  If the idle comes up to 1300 rpm (or higher), your vacuum retard
is probably not functioning properly.  Try slightly opening the throttle
to raise the engine speed up to 2000-2500 rpm, then quickly release it
so that the throttle snaps closed.  If your idle then returns to 800-900
rpm, there's a good chance that your distributor's vacuum retard system
parts need attention.

<P>
In addition to the items listed in the general <A href ="../buyers-guide.html">Triumph Buyers Guide </A>,
there are a number of specific items of interest on the Stag.

<H3><A NAME="look"></A>What to look for when buying a Stag</H3>

<P>
The Stag engine has proved to be its great weakness. Some people
have even christened it the &quot;Triumph Snag&quot;. The key
problem with the Stag is its cooling system. To test it, you should
let any potential purchase idle for 15 minutes (preferably on
a hot day) while keeping an eye on the temperature gauge. Check
that the radiator is as hot at the bottom as it is at the top.
If it's not, there may be problems with coolant circulation and
expensive damage may have already been done. In addition, check
that the thermostat (in the intake manifold) hasn't been removed
to mask some chronic cooling problem, and make sure that the oil
pressure light is connected. If not, leave well enough alone.
<P>
An overheating Stag will eventually end up with a warped head.
Like the TR7 (which uses half of the Stag V8), Stag heads have
a bad reputation for warping in service, often with as few as
25,000 miles. The blown gaskets which soon follow can lead to
damaged head faces which will need skimming if they are to be
rescued. The trouble is that Triumph only allowed 0.010&quot;
for removal before the head had to be replaced. In some cases,
this is still not enough to save the head. A blown head gasket
can also cause engine coolant to seep between the head and the
studs. An electrochemical reaction between the aluminum head and
the steel studs causes the head studs to seize in place, making
head removal almost impossible since the studs and bolts used
to attach the head to the block are not parallel. Some people
have had to lift the car with an engine hoist and pound on the
head studs with an air hammer, using the weight of the car to
pull the studs through the head. Internal corrosion of the coolant
passages is another problem if a corrosion-inhibiting coolant
was not used.
<P>
Timing chains are another source of concern. The single-roller
chains wear quickly and should be replaced every 25-30,000 miles.
If they break or skip a tooth, the valves will embed themselves
in the pistons. The hydraulic timing chain tensioners are actuated
by the engine lube oil, so you must keep the idle rpm up high
enough to maintain sufficient oil pressure. If you hear the timing
chains rattle when you start the engine, but the noise goes away
a few seconds later as the oil pressure comes up, plan on replacing
the timing chains within the next 3000-5000 miles.  If the rattle
doesn't go away at idle, don't drive the car any further or you'll
be facing a major repair bill in the very near future.  You don't
want to see the oil light come on at idle, since it means you have
less than 5psi of oil pressure.
<P>
There was a brief period when crankshaft bearings wore out prematurely
due to a temporary machining problem which resulted in the wrong
surface finish on the crankshaft journals. If you have to regrind
the crankshaft, make sure that it is properly hardened afterwards
or you'll have a disaster in a very short time.  Since the original
factory hardening process only penetrated around 10-15 thousandths
below the surface, you may remove all of the hardened surface with the
first regrind.  Premature wear could also occur as a consequence of
poor maintenance, or if the engine (and hence, the oil) was running
too hot as a consequence of cooling problems.
<P>
Test for suspension bushing wear in the usual manner by shaking
each wheel sideways while a helper applies the brakes. If there
is play, the suspension bushings may need to be replaced; if there
is play with the brakes off, then suspect a wheel bearing.
<P>
A trait common to Triumphs that use semi-trailing arm rear suspension
(Triumph 2000/2500, TR4A IRS, TR5, TR250, TR6) is a curious sideways
lurch at the rear when you let off the throttle in the middle
of a turn. This lurch doesn't always happen, but when it does,
it's caused by the splines of the telescopic drive shafts sticking
under power and then freeing in coast, thereby locking, then releasing
the rear suspension. The official word from Triumph was that this
is a lubrication problem that should not arise, though they did
admit that it sometimes does occur. Contrary to popular opinion,
the lurch is not caused by worn semi-trailing arm bushings.
<P>
Like the TR6 that shares its manual gearbox, the Stag has a reputation
for wearing out its synchromesh in second and third gears. They
also tend to suffer from gearlever buzzes after a lot of use.
The automatic transmission (Borg-Warner Type 35) tends to engage Reverse
and Drive with a lurch if the idle speed is set too high.  Reluctance to
shift at speed can be caused by a poorly adjusted downshift cable.
A metallic ping from the propellor shaft can be heard if the differential
input flange bolts are loose. The differential has a good reputation,
although they tend to whine as they age. Most new differentials whine
from day one because a recent batch of ring &amp; pinions appear to have
been improperly hardened..
<P>
Power steering leaks may occur, but no more than on any other
power-steered car. Inspect the rack gaiters for signs of oil leaks.
Type F Automatic Transmission fluid should be used to top up the
reservoir. Note that the power steering pump must be unbolted
to remove the battery, although the hoses stay connected.
<P>
Brake troubles are rare. The convertible storage hold can leak,
and if the top was not stored correctly, it can be very difficult
to erect. Before the top is lowered into the hold, the rear section
must be locked in the vertical position using the two latches
provided. Failure to do this will cause the rear section to become
trapped in the hold, although instructions are provided in the
owner's manual on how to extract it.
<P>
The tinworm can and does attack the Stag, and you should look
for rust damage in the floorpan, fenders (inner and outer), rear
fender/sill joints, rear subframe mountings, and the outriggers.
Check these areas <I>very</I> carefully, for while replacement
panels are available, they are expensive. It seems that post-1974
Stags are more susceptible to rust problems than are the earlier
models due to the factory switching to a different sheet steel
supplier.

<P>
<A HREF="#quick">Return to Quick Index</A> <HR>

<H3><A NAME="maint"></A>Required (not just simply recommended)
Maintenance</H3>

<P>
Proper and timely maintenance is crucial for the longevity of
a Stag. If you already own one, keep these tips in mind. If you're
looking to buy one, read the following and then ask the owner
about how it was maintained.
<P>
The most important maintenance item on a Stag is an annual reverse
flush of the cooling system, followed by replacing the coolant
with a good quality anti-freeze with the proper corrosion inhibitor
for aluminum engines. This should be followed up by weekly (or
even more frequent) checks of the coolant level in the expansion
tank. You must maintain the correct coolant level, since the gear-driven
water pump is mounted high in the engine. Even a small loss of
coolant will drop the level below the point needed to maintain
circulation. Next, plan on changing the oil and filter every 3,000
miles and checking the timing chains every 25,000 miles. Once
they start to rattle, there's a danger of jumping a tooth, causing
destructive encounters between valves and pistons.
<P>
It's important to keep the rear axle breather clear. Clogging
here can cause the oil to overheat and escape through the seals,
with the consequent danger of seizure. The breather is on the
top of the differential casing, near the right rear corner.  Check
that the pin is loose in the breather hole.
<P>
Driveshafts need a regular shot of the correct grease to keep
the sliding splines from becoming worn, or in the worst case scenerio,
seized.  Replacements are expensive.
<P>
If there are any signs of overheating from whatever cause, do
not attempt to drive any further. The Stag, with its very heat-sensitive
alloy heads and lubrication system, will not see you to your destination
before suffering expensive engine damage.

<h2>Triumph Gearbox Ratios</h2>
<h3>&quot;small car&quot; range</h3>
<i>Compiled by Andrew Mace from various Triumph literature and reference
works.</i>

<p>

This chart is meant to represent the various gearsets available over
the years for the Herald-based Triumphs and in what cars each gearset
was commonly found. This information is not meant to imply
interchangeability, although it is possible in some cases to install a
gearbox from one model into another (i.e., Toledo gearboxes in Mk.IV
Spitfires) with little or no modification required.  Except as noted,
overdrive units are not discussed here. <p>

<h2>Old Paint Charts for Triumph Colors</h2>
<i>by
<a href="mailto:mcmullen@isnet.is.bgsm.edu">Patrick McMullen</a><br>
HTML rendition by <http://www.vtr.org/people/streeter/index.html">Ken Streeter</a></i>

One of the continual problems plaguing restorers of any automobile,
particularly those from manufacturers that have long since been out of
business, is attempting to match original paint colors, or find an
original paint color that the restorer likes!

<p> To aid in this effort, <a
href="mailto:mcmullen@isnet.is.bgsm.edu">Patrick McMullen</a> has
scanned a number of old paint chip charts for inclusion in the VTR WWW
pages.  When looking at these charts, please remember that these
colors have undoubtedly changed over time, may have been subtly
changed in the scanning process, and vary greatly according to the
settings on your computer monitor, but they can at least give you a
rough idea of what some of the colors may have looked like!

<h4> The scanned paint chip charts: </h4>

<ul>
<li> <a href="acme2.jpg">ACME, 1960</a>
<i>(  66K )</i> -- This is a complete chart from ACME dated 1960
for Triumphs.  It has the color chips, their names, and ACME code numbers.

<p> <li> <a href="standard.jpg">DuPont, 1965</a> <i>(  78K )</i>
 -- This chart is from DuPont, and includes the color
chips, names, DuPont codes, Triumph color code numbers, and Triumph
models on which that color was used.

<p> <li> <a href="dupont2.jpg">DuPont, 1979, pg 1</a>
<i>( 129K )</i> -- This chart is from DuPont, and includes the color
chips, names, DuPont codes, and Triumph color code numbers.  These
colors appear to be for the TR6.

<p> <li> <a href="dupont7.jpg">DuPont, 1979, pg 2</a>
<i>( 164K )</i>
-- This chart is from DuPont, and includes the color
chips, names, DuPont codes, and Triumph color code numbers.  These
colors appear to be for the TR7.

<h1>
The Vintage Triumph Register<br> 
1997 National Convention
</h1>

<h2>
Fort Worth, Texas<br>
July 9-12, 1997
</H2>

<p>
<blockquote>
The Red River Triumph Club of Dallas / Ft. Worth, Texas, hereby
invites you to the VTR 1997 National Convention.  We are honored to be
hosting the national next July.
<p>

The event hotel is the Green Oaks Inn and Conference Center in Fort
Worth, and is featuring a rate of $68 plus tax for conventioneers.
Their numbers are 1-800-772-2341 in Texas, and 1-800-433-2174 outside
Texas.  

<p>
Fort Worth is known for its pride in the preservation of the Old West,
and the area features rodeos, honky tonks, world-renowned museums, the
Ft. Worth Stockyards, and many other cultural and social delights.

<p>
Events such as honky-tonkin' at Billy Bob's Texas, beautiful and
informative driving tours of the Fort Worth area, and the National
events we all love are planned, and we hope to have some fun tours to
places like the Pate Transportation Museum, old-style Granbury, Texas,
and to take your car's picture with a beautifully restored Spitfire
warbird at the Cavenaugh Flight Museum.  Interesting technical
sessions are in the works, like how to refinish your wood dash panels,
and we also will have some really neat raffle and auction prizes.

<p>
Everything's bigger in Texas (except Texas Triumphs - they're still
the same size) and that includes our welcome to you for the 1997
National!  Come on down, ya'll!

<p>
Susan Hensley<br>
President, Red River Triumph Club

TO: All Dealers
DEPT: Service and Parts
DISTRIBUTION: All Dealers
BULLETIN: S-62-48
DATE: January 2, 1963
SUBJECT: Spa White Painted Wheels
RELEASE: Immediate


Owing to reasons beyond their control, we have been advised by the factory in
England that, with effect early in March 1963, all models in the range will
have their road wheels painted in Spa White color in place of the silver
aluminum color at present in use.

This change will considerably enhance the appearance of our products and it
is imperative that all dealers are advised as this can be used as an
additional selling point.

There will be no additional charge made for this improvement.

[signed]
A. E. Sherman
Vice President - Service

</pre>

<i>This seems to have ended by 1969; by the time of arrival of the
"Federalized" 1969 Mk.3 Spitfire, wheels had returned to silver, even
though there were early Mk.3 cars with Spa White wheels.
The TR250 wheels were probably silver under those "pseudo-Rostyle"
wheel covers, too.

<b>
First things first - should that hyphen be there or not? (TR-4A vs.
TR4A)
</b>
<p>
I originally put the hyphen in the title because that's the way 
the name appeared
in Triumph's first ad for the car ("This month Triumph introduces
next month's two best-selling sports cars"). 
However, it doesn't appear that way in many other places:
not in the owner's or workshop manuals (though the workshop manual
talks about the "TR.4A" a fair bit), nor in Robson's nor Piggot's
books. The Kastner Competition Preparation Manual supplement
talks about the TR-4A, though. 
<p>
I guess the answer is that they're all correct!

<p>
Externally, the TR4A looks like a continuation of the TR4. 
The cars share a few pieces of sheet metal and have much the same
engine, but most everything else differs. For starters, the 
TR4A is on a much wider frame and a redesigned suspension. 
The front suspension is adjustable for camber and the rear
suspension is independent - or could be. Triumph dealers in
the US convinced Standard-Triumph that they could continue
to sell non-IRS cars at a good price, and Triumph responded with
a clever solid axle design that fit into the IRS frame.

A different <i>slant</i> on the Herald
</h3>

<blockquote><i>
Many, many thanks to Dale Hickman of Hobart, Tasmania, Australia, <a
href="mailto:Dale.Hickman@tres.tas.gov.au">Dale.Hickman@tres.tas.gov.au</a>
for providing the pictures and text below. Dale sheds some light on an
Australian version of the Herald unfamiliar to most of us!
</i></blockquote>

<p>

  I have a 12/50 Coup&eacute (everyday car) and a 12/50 saloon
(awaiting full restoration). Both of these are the
Australian-assembled versions, which were fitted with the Vitesse 1600
bonnets and disc brakes as standard. The Coup&eacute came with the
twin carb setup as standard, while the saloon has the single Solex. I
have been told that all Australian sold Coup&eacutes (presumably 1200s
as well) were fitted with the twin SUs.

<p>

  It is interesting to note that it appears the 12/50s were not
specifically marketed as a Herald in Australia as they do not have any
Herald badges -- simply the 12/50 badge on the boot and a Triumph
badge on the dash in place of the Herald badge. My Coup&eacute was
manufactured in March 1965 from an exported CKD kit in November 1964
(after the production of Coup&eacutes ceased). It is also fitted with
the early smooth roof [as opposed to the later style, with its
"ribbed" sail panels].

<p>
  I have found that there is little information published about the
Australian version. The only article I have seen is a reprint of a
Road Test from a "Wheels" Magazine in 1964. It is reprinted in the
Brooklands Road Test book "Triumph Herald 1959-1971". This article is
on the saloon version but it does mention that the 12/50 range started
with the introduction of the Coup&eacute. As far as I am aware, a
convertible version was not offered.

<p>
  The 12/50s were assembled by AMI (Australian Motor Industries), who
later went on to concentrate mainly on assembling Toyotas in
Australia. Several years ago they finally were totally bought out by
Toyota. Consequently all the Triumph records were discarded, but these
are now with another Triumph fanatic. I have spoken to him and he has
verified that my car is original.

<p>

  I been able to obtain from him some details of Herald production by AMI.
The following chart lists the various models, years and numbers produced:

  The details of my cars are:

<blockquote>
<p>
12/50 Coup&eacute<BR>
Commission No: GB14387CP<BR>
Engine No: GD13691HE<BR>
(AMI) Body No: C64069<BR>

<p>
12/50 saloon<BR>
Commission No: GB10687DL<BR>
Engine No: GD13645HE<BR>
(AMI) Body No: X64135<BR>
</blockquote>

<i>[Note that Commission numbers of these 12/50 cars are in the GB series, which,
according to Triumph factory literature was used primarily to designate the
Herald Mk. II 1200 "Export" model; this same series was used to identify later
Triumph ("Sports") 1200 models in the United States. The GD prefix for the
engine numbers denotes an engine to 12/50 specification. The earlier 
AMI-assembled 948 series Heralds carried unique Commission and engine numbers,
with a KA prefix for 1959 and a KB prefix for 1960 and later cars.]</i>

<p>
<h3>
  Features unique to the Australian 12/50:
</h3>

<ul>

<LI> fitted with Vitesse 1600 bonnet
<LI> disc brakes standard (type 12 calipers but fitted with dust
shields)
<LI> no cubby box lid
<LI> both saloon and Coup&eacute had separate temperature and fuel
gauges
("Jaeger" white with black writing)
<LI> water valve to heater located on head rather than heater body
<LI> different sill tread plates fitted
<LI> moulded rubber footwells for front seats in place of carpet
<LI> different wheel trims
<LI> sunshine roof was not fitted to either model
<LI> Coup&eacute had the earlier type smooth roof
<LI> no Herald badges
<LI> badging
<ul>
      <LI> the 12/50 badge on the bootlid on the saloon is positioned
      identically to that on the UK model, but on the Coup&eacute it
      is angled -- presumably using the same mounting holes as the
      Coup&eacute script badge fitted to other Coup&eacutes.

      <LI> The saloon had two-tone paint with the roof painted a
      different colour to the rest of the car.
</UL>
<LI> Australian versions were not fitted with the rubber bumper insets
but
rather had a smooth chrome capping on them (different from that fitted
on
Vitesses). The saloon was fitted with these front and back. I am not
too sure
about the Coup&eacute as mine only has it fitted on the front. The
rear
bumper is simply painted. If it was originally fitted it must have
been
beyond replating when the car was rebuilt.
<LI> front turn indicators are the inside lens on the Australian cars
-- all
pictures of UK Vitesses I have seen show the amber lens to the
outside.
</UL>

<b>
What's the Herald got to do with me, the Triumph sports car
owner?
</b>

<p>
  Fair enough question. Answer: the Herald has a lot to do with your
sports car. For example, the Herald was the first series- produced
Triumph styled by Giovanni Michelotti, whose designs would later be
applied throughout the Triumph range, for both family cars and sports
cars. The very existence of the Spitfire and GT6 is due to the basic
engineering of the Herald and its upmarket sibling, the Vitesse. Even
the engine of the TR250/5/6 is directly related to that of the
Herald. (In fact, the Herald engine is itself a direct descendant of
the 803cc engine developed for the Standard 8 in the early 1950s.)

<H1>The Triumph Mayflower, 1950-1953<br>
Triumph's "American" Connection</H1>

</pre>
<i>Andy Mace's 1952 Mayflower,
"Priscilla", at the 1989 VTR National Convention</i>

<br clear="left">

<p>
"The Mayflower _was_ singular -- a car of great character, built by and for
characters. Road tester Tom McCahill called it a slab-sided tobacco can, a
geranium pot, a turnip. Those to whom it appealed nicknamed it the 'Watch
Charm Rolls,' but others called it many worse things. Sir John Black,
however, doted on the little dear, and at Standard-Triumph that was
tantamount to automotive sainthood. Sir John got his comeuppance soon enough,
when the Mayflower hit the American market: it sold by the half-dozen." --
from _Triumph Cars; The Complete Story_, by Graham Robson and Richard
Langworth, c. 1979, 1988.

<p>
It definitely was with an eye on the American market that Standard-Triumph
developed the Mayflower. In retrospect, however, it appears that eye was not
too well focused. The Mayflower was in a number of ways innovative in style
and in engineering; at the same time many features were antiquated, and the
car as a whole was generally poorly suited to its intended buyers -- those
Americans theoretically still hungry for new cars after World War II.
Unfortunately, the Mayflower missed that seller's market but was too early
for the compact/small import car craze of the late 1950s.

<p>
In style, the Mayflower was conceived as a "little brother" to the Town &
Country/Renown saloons. Unfortunately, it has long been open to question
whether the "knife-edge" style worked on such a short wheelbase. Liked or
hated, it was quite distinctive, particularly as compared to some of its
contemporaries: Austin Devon, Ford Anglia and Prefect Morris Minor,
Volkswagen Beetle.

<p>
The "knife-edge" styling (generally credited to Walter Belgrove of
Standard-Triumph and Leslie Moore of Mulliners) proved useful in providing an
incredible amount of usable interior space, and the unit-body design made for
a very rigid structure. Thin pillars allowed a large glass area that gave a
more open feeling, and ventilation was aided by vent windows in both front
doors and in the rear quarter lights. Of particular note in the
well-appointed interior were innovative separate front seats: as the seatback
was pulled forward for access to the rear seat, the seat cushion glided
forward as well.

<p>
In addition to accommodating its passengers well, the Mayflower also carried
a fair amount of luggage. The boot lid hinged at the bottom and could serve
as an extension of the luggage platform. The license plate and lamp, mounted
on the boot lid, swiveled down as the lid was lowered. The spare tire was
stored underneath the car, much as is the practice currently with a number of
small trucks and SUVs.

<p>
Mechanically, the Mayflower was a mix of old, new and cost cutting. The
side-valve four-cylinder engine was unique to the Mayflower, although it
derived from a prewar Standard unit. Especially when coupled with the
three-speed, column-shift gearbox, the engine was really not up to the task
of propelling such a heavy car at great speeds. However, at least the gearbox
featured synchromesh on all three forward speeds. That gearbox, as well as
the rear axle, came from the Standard Vanguard.

<p>
New for the Mayflower, however, was the front suspension, whose design was
continued almost unaltered in the TR2 and TR3. Road wheels on the Mayflower
would also look familiar to a TR owner, but those on the Mayflower lacked the
perforations of the TR road wheel. Brakes were also familiar Lockheed units,
with two leading shoes in front and leading/trailing shoes in the rear. An
"umbrella handle"-style handbrake was located under the dash.

<H3>The near-"mythical" Mayflower drophead</H3>

<p>
A total of 35,000 Mayflowers were built between 1950 and 1953. Included in
that total were a quantity of CKD cars assembled in Sweden and elsewhere.
Early on in the Mayflower production, a total of 10 dropheads were built.
While the Mayflower saloon bodies were built by Fisher & Ludlow, the
dropheads were converted from saloons by Mulliners, long specialists in such
conversions and long connected with Standard-Triumph.[*] It seems likely that
the great cost of the conversion made continued production of dropheads
impractical, and the dropheads were long gone by 1953, when the Standard 8
and 10 (see <a
href="http://www.vtr.org/Triumph10/index.html">The Triumph 10, 1957-1960 </a>
replaced the Mayflower. Few (if any) genuine Mayflower dropheads exist today.

<p>
[*NOTE: Mulliners, taken over by Standard-Triumph in the late 1950s, were
responsible for a number of estate car and "commercial vehicle conversions"
of Standard products such as the Vanguard and the 8/10/Pennant line and also
built TR2-3 bodies. Mulliners also controlled the Forward Radiator Company,
who in addition to their namesake product also produced TR3B bodies.]

Also included in the 35,000 total are approximately 500 U.S.-spec. Mayflowers
imported officially by Fergus Motors of New York City. These cars may be
identified by a serially numbered Fergus Motors ID plate on the firewall near
the Commission number plate.

<H3>A Nash Connection?</H3>

<p>
Not long after Mayflower production began, Sir John Black approached
Nash-Kelvinator's George Mason regarding use Mayflower components in what was
to become the Metropolitan. Later on, Sir John apparently changed his mind.
The Metropolitan ultimately used Austin engines, but bodies were built by
Fisher & Ludlow. Nearly three times as many Metropolitans were built (around
100,000 as opposed to 35,000 Mayflowers); it may not have been a good
decision.

<p>
The TR6 ranks among one of the most popular British cars for modern
everyday transport.  The TR6 was introduced in 1969 with a re-skinned
body versus the prior <a href="../TR5/TR5.html"> TR5/250</a>.  More
TR6s were produced by Triumph than any prior TR: over ninety thousand
were sold before the TR6 was replaced by the <a
href="../TR7/TR7.html"> TR7</a> in 1976.

<H1>The Triumph 10, 1957-1960</H1>

<p>
<img src="triumph10.gif">
<p>

<p>
Rather forgotten in the history of Triumphs in the United States is the
Triumph 10, a car better known in most markets as the Standard 10, which, in
turn, was an "upmarket" version of the Standard 8.

<p>
The Standard 8 was introduced in the latter part of 1953 as a replacement for
the controversial Triumph Mayflower. The 8 was pretty much the first (and
perhaps last) all-new car developed by the Standard-Triumph company. The "SC"
(Small Car) project called for a unitized body carrying an all new engine,
transmission and rear axle developed specifically for it. The first 8s were
incredibly spartan: sliding windows in the doors, no external boot access
(although the rear seatback did fold down), no grille and very little other
brightwork. In less than a year, however, the Standard 10 was added to the
line, adding back most of the equipment that probably should have been there
from the start.

<p>
The 803cc engine developed for the Standard 8 is particularly significant to
Triumph enthusiasts, although not certainly in its original form. Bore and
stroke for the 803 were 58mm x 76mm, giving some 26 hp. If that stroke
measurement looks familiar, however, that's because this engine was the basis
for virtually all Triumph engines to follow (excepting the slant-4 and V8
engines). The Standard 10 used a 63mm bore (948cc) version of this engine.
That same engine later powered the first Heralds, and in other enlarged,
stroked and expanded forms, it became the engine for every Herald, Spitfire,
Vitesse, GT6, 2000 and even TR5/6. Developments of the original Standard 8
gearbox and differential were used in many Triumphs virtually through the end
of Triumph production.

<p>
Most of these cars did indeed feature a "Standard" badge, But by 1957 the
success of the TR3 in the United States prompted an attempt to broaden
Standard-Triumph's market. With little more than a change of badging and a
few lamps, the Standard 10 became the Triumph 10, sold not only as a four-
door sedan but also as a four-door wagon with a "cargo-style" door at the
rear. The last of the Triumph 10s in the United States featured somewhat
revised styling, in the form of front sheetmetal and trim taken from the
Standard Pennant. So far as I can determine, the rear styling of the home
market Pennant was not adapted for the last of the Triumph 10s.

<H3>TR10?</H3>

<p>
The car was never officially called the "TR10," although many have referred
to it as such over the years. In fact, Workshop Manuals, Spare Parts
Catalogues and sales literature refer to the cars only as the Triumph Sedan
or Triumph Estate Wagon. The only references to "10" are found on the car
itself: on the Commission number plate (which refers to the Triumph 10HP),
and on the front badge. The badge is very much like that of the small-mouth
TR3, although the 10 badge is usually seen in the later blue-and-white color
scheme, and "10" replaces the TR3, with TRIUMPH across the bottom of the
badge.

<p>
As with many other imports, 10s came to the United States, or at least left a
U.S. dealer's showroom, rather better equipped than their home market
counterparts. Many cars were "duotoned" either with a light color from the
side trim up and darker color below, or sometimes with a light color on
bottom and dark color from the bottom of the windows up and over the roof.
The Estate Wagons were often seen in yet another duotone version: lower body
and roof were a color, and the area between the "beltline" and rain gutter
was finished in white.

<p>
Interiors featured a choice of color with contrasting "flashes," along with
full carpeting. In both the Sedan and Estate Wagon, the rear seatback folded
flat, giving a fairly long, flat loading area that proved quite useful in
either body style. Wide whitewall tires were common, and it is likely that
not too many cars were sold without the optional heater, at least in northern
states. A radio, chrome wheel ring trims and windshield washer were other
options. Although not mentioned in later sales literature, a semi-automatic
transmission (TRIMATIC) was available. A button on the shift knob actuated
the clutch.

<p>
Sales of the two models were not spectacular -- production figures show only
9907 sedans and 7351 wagons built under the Triumph name -- but the cars
helped pave the way in the U.S. for their successor, the Herald. In fact, the
two models sold side-by-side for a while in 1960. Surprisingly, though, the
Estate Wagon version of the Herald was never officially marketed in the U.S.,
although the 10 Estate Wagon did reasonably well here. Apparently the
TRIMATIC never made the transition to Herald at all.

<TITLE>The Triumph 10, 1957-1960</TITLE>

<BODY BGCOLOR="c0d0c0">


<H1>The Triumph 10, 1957-1960</H1>

<p>
<img src="triumph10.gif">
<p>

<p>
Rather forgotten in the history of Triumphs in the United States is the
Triumph 10, a car better known in most markets as the Standard 10, which, in
turn, was an "upmarket" version of the Standard 8.

<p>
The Standard 8 was introduced in the latter part of 1953 as a replacement for
the controversial Triumph Mayflower. The 8 was pretty much the first (and
perhaps last) all-new car developed by the Standard-Triumph company. The "SC"
(Small Car) project called for a unitized body carrying an all new engine,
transmission and rear axle developed specifically for it. The first 8s were
incredibly spartan: sliding windows in the doors, no external boot access
(although the rear seatback did fold down), no grille and very little other
brightwork. In less than a year, however, the Standard 10 was added to the
line, adding back most of the equipment that probably should have been there
from the start.

<p>
The 803cc engine developed for the Standard 8 is particularly significant to
Triumph enthusiasts, although not certainly in its original form. Bore and
stroke for the 803 were 58mm x 76mm, giving some 26 hp. If that stroke
measurement looks familiar, however, that's because this engine was the basis
for virtually all Triumph engines to follow (excepting the slant-4 and V8
engines). The Standard 10 used a 63mm bore (948cc) version of this engine.
That same engine later powered the first Heralds, and in other enlarged,
stroked and expanded forms, it became the engine for every Herald, Spitfire,
Vitesse, GT6, 2000 and even TR5/6. Developments of the original Standard 8
gearbox and differential were used in many Triumphs virtually through the end
of Triumph production.

<p>
Most of these cars did indeed feature a "Standard" badge, But by 1957 the
success of the TR3 in the United States prompted an attempt to broaden
Standard-Triumph's market. With little more than a change of badging and a
few lamps, the Standard 10 became the Triumph 10, sold not only as a four-
door sedan but also as a four-door wagon with a "cargo-style" door at the
rear. The last of the Triumph 10s in the United States featured somewhat
revised styling, in the form of front sheetmetal and trim taken from the
Standard Pennant. So far as I can determine, the rear styling of the home
market Pennant was not adapted for the last of the Triumph 10s.

<H3>TR10?</H3>

<p>
The car was never officially called the "TR10," although many have referred
to it as such over the years. In fact, Workshop Manuals, Spare Parts
Catalogues and sales literature refer to the cars only as the Triumph Sedan
or Triumph Estate Wagon. The only references to "10" are found on the car
itself: on the Commission number plate (which refers to the Triumph 10HP),
and on the front badge. The badge is very much like that of the small-mouth
TR3, although the 10 badge is usually seen in the later blue-and-white color
scheme, and "10" replaces the TR3, with TRIUMPH across the bottom of the
badge.

<p>
As with many other imports, 10s came to the United States, or at least left a
U.S. dealer's showroom, rather better equipped than their home market
counterparts. Many cars were "duotoned" either with a light color from the
side trim up and darker color below, or sometimes with a light color on
bottom and dark color from the bottom of the windows up and over the roof.
The Estate Wagons were often seen in yet another duotone version: lower body
and roof were a color, and the area between the "beltline" and rain gutter
was finished in white.

<p>
Interiors featured a choice of color with contrasting "flashes," along with
full carpeting. In both the Sedan and Estate Wagon, the rear seatback folded
flat, giving a fairly long, flat loading area that proved quite useful in
either body style. Wide whitewall tires were common, and it is likely that
not too many cars were sold without the optional heater, at least in northern
states. A radio, chrome wheel ring trims and windshield washer were other
options. Although not mentioned in later sales literature, a semi-automatic
transmission (TRIMATIC) was available. A button on the shift knob actuated
the clutch.

<p>
Sales of the two models were not spectacular -- production figures show only
9907 sedans and 7351 wagons built under the Triumph name -- but the cars
helped pave the way in the U.S. for their successor, the Herald. In fact, the
two models sold side-by-side for a while in 1960. Surprisingly, though, the
Estate Wagon version of the Herald was never officially marketed in the U.S.,
although the 10 Estate Wagon did reasonably well here. Apparently the
TRIMATIC never made the transition to Herald at all.

January and September 1959 sales literature):</H3>

Choosing the best motor oil is a topic that comes up frequently in 
discussions between motoheads, whether they are talking about motorcycles 
or cars. The following article is intended to help you make a choice based 
on more than the advertising hype.

<p>

Oil companies provide data on their oils most often referred to as 
"typical inspection data". This is an average of the actual physical and a 
few common chemical properties of their oils. This information is 
available to the public through their distributors or by writing or 
calling the company directly. I have compiled a list of the most popular, 
premium oils so that a ready comparison can be made. If your favorite oil 
is not on the list get the data from the distributor and use what I have 
as a data base.

<p>
This article is going to look at six of the most important properties of a 
motor oil readily available to the public: viscosity, viscosity index 
(VI), flash point, pour point, % sulfated ash, and % zinc.

<p>
Viscosity is a measure of the "flowability" of an oil. More specifically,
it is the property of an oil to develop and maintain a certain amount of
shearing stress dependent on flow, and then to offer continued resistance
to flow. Thicker oils generally have a higher viscosity, and thinner oils
a lower viscosity. This is the most important property for an engine. An
oil with too low a viscosity can shear and loose film strength at high
temperatures. An oil with too high a viscosity may not pump to the proper
parts at low temperatures and the film may tear at high rpm.

<p>
The weights given on oils are arbitrary numbers assigned by the S.A.E. 
(Society of Automotive Engineers). These numbers correspond to "real" 
viscosity, as measured by several accepted techniques. These measurements 
are taken at specific temperatures. Oils that fall into a certain range 
are designated 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 by the S.A.E. The W means the oil 
meets specifications for viscosity at 0 F and is therefore suitable for 
Winter use.

<p>
The following chart shows the relationship of "real" viscosity to their 
S.A.E. assigned numbers. The relationship of gear oils to engine oils is 
also shown.

<p>
Multi viscosity oils work like this: Polymers are added to a light base 
(5W, 10W, 20W), which prevent the oil from thinning as much as it warms 
up. At cold temperatures the polymers are coiled up and allow the oil to 
flow as their low numbers indicate. As the oil warms up the polymers begin 
to unwind into long chains that prevent the oil from thinning as much as 
it normally would. The result is that at 100 degrees C the oil has thinned 
only as much as the higher viscosity number indicates. Another way of 
looking at multi-vis oils is to think of a 20W-50 as a 20 weight oil that 
will not thin more than a 50 weight would when hot.

<p>
Multi viscosity oils are one of the great improvements in oils, but they 
should be chosen wisely. Always use a multi grade with the narrowest span 
of viscosity that is appropriate for the temperatures you are going to 
encounter. In the winter base your decision on the lowest temperature you 
will encounter, in the summer, the highest temperature you expect. The 
polymers can shear and burn forming deposits that can cause ring sticking 
and other problems. 10W-40 and 5W-30 require a lot of polymers (synthetics 
excluded) to achieve that range. This has caused problems in diesel 
engines, but fewer polymers are better for all engines. The wide viscosity 
range oils, in general, are more prone to viscosity and thermal breakdown 
due to the high polymer content. It is the oil that lubricates, not the 
additives. Oils that can do their job with the fewest additives are the 
best.

<p>
Very few manufactures recommend 10W-40 any more, and some threaten to void 
warranties if it is used. It was not included in this article for that 
reason. 20W-50 is the same 30 point spread, but because it starts with a 
heavier base it requires less viscosity index improvers (polymers) to do 
the job. AMSOIL can formulate their 10W-30 and 15W-40 with no viscosity 
index improvers but uses some in the 10W-40 and 5W-30. Mobil 1 uses no 
viscosity improvers in their 5W-30, and I assume the new 10W-30. Follow 
your manufacturer's recommendations as to which weights are appropriate 
for your vehicle.

<p>
Viscosity Index is an empirical number indicating the rate of change in 
viscosity of an oil within a given temperature range. Higher numbers 
indicate a low change, lower numbers indicate a relatively large change. 
The higher the number the better. This is one major property of an oil 
that keeps your bearings happy. These numbers can only be compared within 
a viscosity range. It is not an indication of how well the oil resists 
thermal breakdown.

<p>
Flash point is the temperature at which an oil gives off vapors that can 
be ignited with a flame held over the oil. The lower the flash point the 
greater tendency for the oil to suffer vaporization loss at high 
temperatures and to burn off on hot cylinder walls and pistons. The flash 
point can be an indicator of the quality of the base stock used. The 
higher the flash point the better. 400 F is the minimum to prevent 
possible high consumption. Flash point is in degrees F.

<p>
Pour point is 5 degrees F above the point at which a chilled oil shows no 
movement at the surface for 5 seconds when inclined. This measurement is 
especially important for oils used in the winter. A borderline pumping 
temperature is given by some manufacturers. This is the temperature at 
which the oil will pump and maintain adequate oil pressure. This was not 
given by a lot of the manufacturers, but seems to be about 20 degrees F 
above the pour point. The lower the pour point the better. Pour point is 
in degrees F.

<p>
% sulfated ash is how much solid material is left when the oil burns. A 
high ash content will tend to form more sludge and deposits in the engine. 
Low ash content also seems to promote long valve life. Look for oils with 
a low ash content.

<p>
% zinc is the amount of zinc used as an extreme pressure, anti- wear 
additive. The zinc is only used when there is actual metal to metal 
contact in the engine. Hopefully the oil will do its job and this will 
rarely occur, but if it does, the zinc compounds react with the metal to 
prevent scuffing and wear. A level of .11% is enough to protect an 
automobile engine for the extended oil drain interval, under normal use. 
Those of you with high revving, air cooled motorcycles or turbo charged 
cars or bikes might want to look at the oils with the higher zinc content. 
More doesn't give you better protection, it gives you longer protection if 
the rate of metal to metal contact is abnormally high. High zinc content 
can lead to deposit formation and plug fouling.

<p>
All of the oils above meet current SG/CD ratings and all vehicle 
manufacture's warranty requirements in the proper viscosity. All are "good 
enough", but those with the better numbers are icing on the cake.

<p>
The synthetics offer the only truly significant differences, due to their 
superior high temperature oxidation resistance, high film strength, very 
low tendency to form deposits, stable viscosity base, and low temperature 
flow characteristics. Synthetics are superior lubricants compared to 
traditional petroleum oils. You will have to decide if their high cost is 
justified in your application.

<p>
The extended oil drain intervals given by the vehicle manufacturers 
(typically 7500 miles) and synthetic oil companies (up to 25,000 miles) 
are for what is called normal service. Normal service is defined as the 
engine at normal operating temperature, at highway speeds, and in a dust 
free environment. Stop and go, city driving, trips of less than 10 miles, 
or extreme heat or cold puts the oil change interval into the severe 
service category, which is 3000 miles for most vehicles. Synthetics can be 
run two to three times the mileage of petroleum oils with no problems. 
They do not react to combustion and combustion by-products to the extent 
that the dead dinosaur juice does. The longer drain intervals possible 
help take the bite out of the higher cost of the synthetics. If your car 
or bike is still under warranty you will have to stick to the recommended 
drain intervals. These are set for petroleum oils and the manufacturers 
make no official allowance for the use of synthetics.

<p>Oil additives should not be used. The oil companies have gone to great 
lengths to develop an additive package that meets the vehicle's 
requirements. Some of these additives are synergistic, that is the effect 
of two additives together is greater than the effect of each acting 
separately. If you add anything to the oil you may upset this balance and 
prevent the oil from performing to specification.

<p>The numbers above are not, by any means, all there is to determining what 
makes a top quality oil. The exact base stock used, the type, quality, and 
quantity of additives used are very important. The given data combined 
with the manufacturer's claims, your personal experience, and the 
reputation of the oil among others who use it should help you make an 
informed choice.

<h2>Converting Positive Ground to Negative Ground</h2>
</center>
<HR size=10>

The reason to do this conversion is convenience, not reliability - it 
allows you to use modern electrical accesories, especially radios.

<p> There is an article in the April 1993 issue of British Car
summarizing this conversion - the following is a summary of the
important points, with additions based on the experience of VTR
members.

<ol>
<li>Remove the battery

<li>If you have a radio, remove it.

<li>Remove the central panel in dash and reverse the wires conected to
the Ammeter.  Replace panel.

<li>If you have an electrical fuel pump (non-original on TR-4), and
it's a late model SU with a diode across the points rather than a
condensor, reverse the connections to the diode.

<li>Connect the (-) post of the coil to the wire going to the
distributor, the (+) post to the wire going to the ignition switch.

<li>Replace the battery, with the terminals reversed.  If you are
using the car as a daily driver, I'd strongly reccomend that you
replace both the ground strap and the positive lead going to the
starter solenoid with new cables. It's cheap, and will give you a
better connection, which means more reliable starting.

<li>Disconnect the two leads to the generator.  Temporarily connect
one end of a length of wire to the positive terminal of the battery.
Touch the other end of the wire to the F terminal on the generator
(the one the smaller lead is connected to, wire is brown with green
stripe) several times briefly.  This repolarises the field windings so
you get the proper output.

<li>Reconnect the two leads to the generator.
</ol>

That's it - all the electrical devices on the car will now work like
normal.  You can install a new negative-ground radio, or other
electrical accesories.  I put in an electric windshield washer pump -
much better than pushing that stupid button!  Feel free to ask the VTR
mailing list if you have any questions.

<p> By the way, if you have starting problems, check that the starter
motor bolts are tight and that all connections are clean.  Most
electrical problems on my car have been caused by corrosion and bad
grounds rather than component failure.

<TITLE>VTR Autocross Rules</TITLE>
</head>
<BODY BGCOLOR="c0d0c0">


<center>
<h2>The Vintage Triumph Register Autocross Rules
<br>February 11, 1994</h2>
</center>

<br>
<h3>Purpose </h3>
   The purpose of these rules is to standardize the classing and safety
considerations of VTR autocross events held annually and regionally.  It is
this intent which drives the creation and maintenance of this document.  Given
the rather unchanging nature of the cars we have to deal with (i.e. there
probably won't be any new Triumphs for a while...) this shouldn't have to be
revised too often. If there is a question over the rationale behind a
particular rule, it can generally be explained by looking at it from a safety
point of view.

<h3>Format </h3>
   These rules are divided up into a number of numbered logical sections,
starting with eligibility and safety, course rules, timing and scoring, protest
guidelines, class definitions, and finally the class layout.

<h3>Changes </h3>
     If there are to be changes to these rules for a regional event, the 
competitors should be notified at registration.  For National events, the
competitors should be notified at least 2 weeks before the event begins and a
copy of these Rules and changes distributed with the registration packet.


<h3>1. Vehicle Eligibility </h3>
   The event shall be open to all vehicles that can pass the safety inspection
and can meet the rules set out herein.  Cars need not be licensed or eligible
for licensing (in the case of prepared cars) as long as they otherwise conform
to these Rules.


<h3>2. Vehicle Safety </h3>

<ul>
<b>  2.1.  Driver Restraint </b>
      Seat lap belts are the minimum acceptable driver restraint.  Open top
   cars without roll bars shall not have two-strap (4 point) shoulder
   harnesses.

<p><b>   2.2.  Roll Bars </b>
      Roll bars are recommended for those who are going to be serious about
   competition events.  All open Prepared category cars without a windshield
   shall be required to have a roll bar.

<p><b>   2.3.  Safety Inspection </b>
      All vehicles must pass a safety inspection on the following points before
   being allowed to compete. It is not up to the safety inspector to classify
   the car.  It is recommended that the successful completion of the safety
   inspection be indicated by a small decal or sticker applied to the
   windshield or roll bar of the vehicle.

<ul>
<p><b>      2.3.1.   Loose Items </b>
         All loose items inside and outside the car shall be removed or
      secured.  This shall include floor mats, passenger seat backs, tools,
      spare tires, etc.

<p><b>      2.3.2.   Trim rings </b>
         Trim rings, snap-on hubcaps, and detachable fender skirts must be
      removed.

<p><b>      2.3.3.   Wheels and Tires </b>
         Wheels shall be safely attached.  All lugs and studs shall be present
      and functional.  There shall be no missing or broken spokes on wire
      wheels.  One loose spoke per wheel is permitted. There  shall  be no
      cracks in disc or cast wheels.  Wheel bearings shall be in good
      condition.  Tires shall have no cord showing at any time. Cars with cord
      showing will not be permitted to continue.

<p><b>      2.3.4.   Engine and Drivetrain </b>
         There shall be no visible fluid leaks when the car is running. 
      Throttle return action shall be safe and positive.

<p><b>      2.3.5.   Brake System </b>
         There shall be no visible leaks of brake fluid at any point in the
      system.  Brakes should have adequate pedal height and firmness. 
      Sufficient fluid shall be in the brake master cylinder.

<p><b>      2.3.6.   Battery </b>
         The battery shall be securely fastened.

<p><b>      2.3.7.   Camber Compensators </b>
         For safety reasons (to avoid rollovers), camber compensators,
      negative camber or axle limit straps are strongly recommended on all
      stock class vehicles equipped with swing axle type suspensions.  They are
      required on all swing axle Modified or Prepared vehicles.

<p><b>      2.3.8.   Tonneau Covers and Convertible tops. </b>
         Tonneau covers must be removed or at least not covering the area in
      front of the seat back.  Convertible tops must be down except in cases of
      precipitation.  This is for safety reasons.
</ul>

<p><b>   2.4.  Identification </b>
      Cars shall be identified either via  markings on the passenger side of
   the windshield or on both sides of the vehicle.  Markings in either case
   should include the car # and class in a form legible from the timing and
   scoring station.  The addition of sponsorship 'advertisements' is permitted.

<p><b>   2.5.  Mufflers </b>
      Adequate mufflers are required.  'Adequate' is defined by sound level,
   not the construction. Any vehicle deemed too loud by the Event Chairman for
   the event may be required to add muffling or prohibited from competition. 
   Remember, we're trying to be nice to the neighbors.

</ul>

<h3>3. Driver Safety </h3>
   The primary purpose is to assure a safe event.  With this in mind, we
require the following driver safety precautions.

<ul>
<b>   3.1.  Helmets </b>
      Helmets complying with Snell Foundation approval or Federal Specification
   Z-90.1 or D.O.T. shall  be  worn while on the course.  Loaner helmets should
   be available for drivers not having their own.

<p><b>    3.2.  Seat Belts </b>
      Driver restraints as previously specified shall be worn while on course.

<p><b>   3.3.  Eye Protection </b>
      A face shield, goggles, or similar face protection shall be worn by
   persons competing in any car with other than a stock windshield.

<p><b>   3.4.  Clothing</b>
      Closed footwear (no sandals) shall be worn.  On closed road racing
   circuits, long pants shall be worn.  Clothing of natural fibre is preferred.

<p><b>   3.5.  Access to site </b>
      Only authorized personnel who have signed any necessary waivers or
   insurance release forms will be allowed on the course or hazardous areas
   during competition. 

<p><b>   3.6.   Safety Instructions </b>
      Anyone not following instructions by autocross workers in regard to
   safety will be disqualified and/or evicted from the site.
</ul>

<h3>4. Event Management </h3>
<ul>

<b>   4.1.  Car and Driver Limits</b>
      A driver may enter the event only once.  A given car may be entered more
   than once in a class, however the identification should clearly denote
   different drivers and which is currently competing.
<p>      Passengers are not allowed during any timed runs used as consideration
   for trophies.  Competitors  are not allowed as passengers until all vehicles
   have completed all their timed runs.  Passengers are (if permitted by the
   insurance policy) allowed during 'fun runs'.
<p>      A driver may enter the event in more than one car.  He may, however, only
   be considered for trophy competition in one vehicle.  In addition, this must
   be the vehicle he runs first, and must complete all competition runs in this
   car before driving any other vehicle on course.  This may mean running
   non-trophy car after all others have completed their runs.

<p><b>   4.2.  Ladies Classes </b>

<ul>
<p><b>      4.2.1. </b>
         Ladies classes shall be as outlined in appendix A.
         The ladies shall have the option of running in the open classes. 
      Timing and scoring shall be notified before the first run is taken and
      the identification of class on the car shall reflect the appropriate open
      class.
</ul>

<p><b>   4.3.  Conflict of Interest </b>
      No person may compete who has run through any part of the course in or on
   any wheeled vehicle. Event officials, competing or not should use caution to
   avoid conflict of interest situations during the event.  If in doubt, the
   official should disqualify himself from any decision to be made and have an
   unbiased substitute appointed by the Event Master.
<p>      The Event Master may allow a parade lap, allowing all competitors to
   preview the course if necessary. 

<p><b>   4.4.  Course </b>
      The course should be designed to be competitive to all classes of cars,
   safe, and enjoyable.  Particular attention should be paid to the needs of
   older fragile British cars.
<ul>

<p><b>      4.4.1.   Map </b>
         A map of the course should be posted in an accessible location.

<p><b>      4.4.2.   Order of Running. </b>
         All cars shall take their first run, then all cars shall take their
      second run, etc. There shall be a minimum of 2 runs.  The event may
      however, be split into two sections to allow competitors to participate
      in other events.  In this case, the two sections may be treated as
      separate as far as run order is concerned.  See the 'how to run the
      event' document which should accompany these Rules for clarification on
      how to make it all work.

<p><b>      4.4.3.   Reruns </b>
         Reruns shall be given due to timing failure, objects on course, or
      pylons downed by previous competitors at the discretion of the chief of
      Timing and Scoring.  Reruns are not granted for  mechanical failure of
      the car.  Pylon penalties are not carried over, and DNF's on a run for
      which a rerun would have been granted shall stand and no rerun shall be
      granted.  There must be a 5 car or 5 minute gap, whichever is greater,
      before a rerun may be taken.

<p><b>      4.4.4.   Penalties </b>
         Penalties shall be assessed at the rate of 2 sec per downed pylon.  A
      pylon is considered down if it is knocked over or if it is knocked out of
      a box marked around it's base.  If any  part of a still standing pylon is
      on or inside the marked box, the pylon is considered to be good and no
      pylon is assessed.

<p>         A 'DNF' is scored if there is an uncorrected deviation from the
      course.  A course deviation shall not be charged if the vehicle knocks
      down a marker defining the limits of the course.

<p><b>      4.4.5.   Recommended Officials </b>
         It is recommended that the following officials be selected well in
      advance of the event.  Folks who do this on a regular basis are
      recommended and except for the Event Master and Chief of Tech need not be
      VTR members.
<ul>
<li>         Event master:  He shall be the main man.  It is the responsibility of
      the EM to oversee the Timing and Scoring, Technical Inspection, Safety,
      Protests, and course design.  Ideally the Event Master will be a VTR
      member familiar with the sport of autocrossing. 

<li>         Course Designer:  Should ideally be someone who is not competing in
      the event.  This individual should however be conversant with the foibles
      of Triumph motorcars.

<li>         Chief of Tech:  Responsible for setting up technical inspection
      procedures and that all vehicles meet eligibility and safety regulations. 
      He shall be a VTR member with a good knowledge of the Triumph cars
      expected at the event.

<li>         Chief of Timing and Scoring:  Responsible for accurately  taking,
      reading, and recording times, and posting them in a timely and
      conspicuous manner during the event.  Responsible for the preparation  of 
      the official results.
</ul>
</ul>

<p><b>   4.5.  Timing and Scoring. </b>
      Shall be taken to the nearest 1000th of a second.
<p>      Reruns due to timer failure are at the discretion of Chief of T&S.
<p>      Times shall be posted in an accessible place in a timely manner.  Ideally
   before the next run takes place.
<p>      In the case of a tie, the next fastest runs shall be compared. If a tie
   still remains, it shall be scored as a tie.
<p>      Preparation of the official results shall include car#, class, driver's
   name, times, and other information considered relevant.  The official
   National convention autocross results shall be mailed to  the VTR newsletter
   editor by a date not to exceed 2 weeks after the event.

<p><b>   4.6.  Protests</b>
      Hopefully, you as a good sportsperson will not feel the need to file a
   protest at any time. Please keep in mind that this event is organized and
   managed by amateurs who cheerfully give their time and do their best but can
   be expected to make a few mistakes.  Make a good effort to work problems out
   through informal channels before engaging in official protests.  A quick
   friendly talk can accomplish much that official shouting and rule quoting
   cannot.  But if it should become necessary, the procedure shall be as
   follows:

<ul>
<p><b>      4.6.1.   Step 1 </b>
         Calmly and rationally consider the issues. Will this protest
      materially  effect  the  outcome of the competition?  Is the protest well
      founded?  A protest that is well founded is reasonable, logical,  and
      based on sound evidence.  A well founded protest may further be defined
      as one on which reasonable humans may differ.  A protest therefore may be
      denied but still be well founded.  A protest that is not judged to be
      well founded will be denied.   If the Protest Committee determines the
      protestor has acted in a vexatious manner or in bad faith, they may
      penalize him.

<p><b>      4.6.2.   Step 2 </b>
         Approach the parties in question. Try to settle the problem out in a
      calm rational reasonable manner.  If this fails:

<p><b>      4.6.3.   Step 3 </b>
         Talk over the problem with the Event Master. If he, you, and the
      parties in question cannot come to a reasonable agreement, move on to:

<p><b>      4.6.4.   Step 4 </b>
         File a written protest with the EM. You should be as descriptive as
      possible of your reasons for protest. Cite specific rules if possible.
<p>         The written protest is then to be considered by the protest
      committee.  This shall consist of the EM, CTI, and CTS.  They may in
      addition consult with any available "experts" on the vehicle type in
      question.  If there is any conflict of interest, the EM shall appoint
      another unbiased party to the position on the committee.
<p>         The result of the committee's decision shall be made to all effected
      parties as soon as possible.
</ul>
</ul>

<h3>5. Classes </h3>

   Cars shall be classed so that cars of similar capabilities shall compete
against one another.  There are 3 broad categories which are further divided
down into individual classes as per Appendix A.  Please realize  that certain
compromises need to be made while setting this up.

<ul>
<b>   5.1.  Stock Class </b>
      This shall consist of cars produced for the North American market only. 
   These vehicles are those produced for normal use and capable of being
   licensed in the US and Canada.
<p>      Except for the modifications listed below, Stock Category vehicles must
   run as specified by the factory with standard equipment as defined.  The
   modifications listed below are aimed at making cars maintainable, yet living
   within the definition of Stock.  Major performance oriented modifications
   will place the vehicle in Modified or Prepared categories.
<p>      It is the responsibility of the entrant to prove that his car conforms to
   these Rules by the use of the owner's manual, shop manual, or other
   manufacturer's documentation.  If the item in question does not include
   sufficient information in the documentation to prove its legality, it is
   then the protestor's responsibility to prove the item illegal.

<ul>

<p><b>         5.1.1 Bodywork</b>
            Accessories, gauges, indicators, lights, and appearance, comfort,
         and convenience modifications which have no effect on performance or
         handling are allowed.  This does not allow driver's seat
         substitution.
<p>            Any fuel tank cap may be used.
<p>            Windshields may be folded down if the mechanism is standard
         equipment.  Doing so will require the driver to wear appropriate eye
         protection as outlined previously.
<p>            Alternate steering wheels of +/- 1 inch from standard diameter are
         allowed.
<p>            Roll bars may be added.
<p>            Any driver restraint system is allowed, subject to 2.1.
<p>            A trailer hitch may be added.

<p><b>      5.1.2.   Tires</b>
         Any DOT approved tire may be used.  No racing slicks (non-DOT) tires
      may be used.  If it fits on the stock size rim, under the fender and is
      DOT approved, it's OK.
<p>         Tires must have measurable tread.  Tires with less than 2/32" are
      allowed, but must still have measurable tread.  Measurable is defined as
      any indication of tread is visible or capable of being felt by hand. 
      Regrooving is not permitted.
<p>         There must not be cord showing at any time.  If cord appears, the car
      shall not be allowed to continue until the tire is replaced.

<p><b>      5.1.3.   Wheels </b>
         Any wheel may be used provided it is of stock diameter, width, and
      offset.  Offset is allowed to vary by +/- 0.25".

<p><b>      5.1.4.   Shocks </b>
         Any bushing material is permitted.  Any make of shock may be used
      provided the number, type (lever vs. tube), points of attachment, and
      method of attachment are not changed.  Adjustable spring perches are not
      allowed unless original equipment.
         Heavy duty and adjustable damping shocks are allowed.

<p><b>      5.1.5.   Brakes </b>
         Any type of brake lining may be used.  Type of mechanism and size may
      not be changed.

<p><b>      5.1.6.   Swaybars (anti-roll bars) </b>
         Front anti-roll bars may be deleted, added or substituted.  Any
      bushing material is permitted.

<p><b>      5.1.7.   Suspension </b>
         Cars with swing axle suspension may be lowered to achieve negative
      camber and may use a camber compensator or limit straps.  Make it safe.

<p><b>      5.1.8.   Electrical System </b>
         The battery make, type, size may be changed, but not its location.
         The make of plugs, points, coil, and wires is free.
         Ignition  points may be converted to electronic trigger system,
      provided the distributor housing is unchanged.

<p><b>      5.1.9.   Engine and Drivetrain. </b>
         The purpose here is to allow 'maintenance modifications' while moving
      'performance modifications' to the Prepared and Modified Categories.
<p>         All filter elements are free.  Air filters may be removed, but the
      housing may not be changed.  Spin on oil filters and oil coolers are
      allowed.
<p>         Cylinders may be overbored by 0.0472" max. Engines with replaceable
      cylinder liners may not exceed 0.0472" over the maximum dealer
      deliverable.  This allows 87mm liners in TR2/3/4 engines.
<p>         Rotating and reciprocating parts may be balanced and matched, but not
      lightened.
<p>         Intake and exhaust ports may be matched, but there shall be no
      changes further than 1" from the interface.
<p>         Any part of the exhaust system beyond the manifold on non-catalytic
      converter cars or beyond the catalytic converter on catalytic converter
      equipped cars may be substituted provided it meets the noise 
      requirements and is street legal in the state in which the entrant
      resides.
<p>         Safety devices such as scattershields, reverse lock outs, engine
      overrev cut outs, and catch tanks may be added.
<p>         Any thermostat may be used.
<p>         Water pump drive belts shall be present and functional.
<p>         Heads may be machined up to 0.090" for the purpose of removing
      warpage.
<p>         Emission control equipment except for catalytic converters may be
      removed.
<p>         Engine swapping is allowed within a given model provided it does not
      increase the displacement more than 200cc.  This allows the TR4->TR3
      swap, and Spitfire MkII->MkI, MkIII->MkII, MkIV->MkIII, and 1500->MkIV.
</ul>

<H1>The Vintage Triumph Register Concours Rules</h1>
<h2>by George Rabey, VTR Chief Judge
<br>February 13, 1994</h2>
</center>

<br>
<h3>1.  INTRODUCTION</h3>

Each year at the VTR National, the Concours event has attracted a large
number of entries and for some, it is the premier event of the weekend.  As
more and more Triumphs are restored and returned to the land of living cars,
the concours has grown each year.  For some reason, the host clubs seem to have
the most difficulty organizing this one event.  These rules have been
established to standardize this event from one year to the next and from one
area of the country to the next.

<p> Of equal importance, each participant in the concours must be familiar with
his/her responsibilities (see section 4) as outlined in these rules.  Ignorance
of the rules shall not be an excuse for any complaint or protest.

<ul>
<b>    1.1  SCHEDULING:</b>
       The Concours Event shall be scheduled on the Saturday of the National
    Event.  Starting time should be late enough to allow the participants
    enough time to detail their cars yet early enough to allow the judges to
    finish by a reasonable time in the afternoon.  A realistic time for the
    beginning of the judging shall be no later than 11:00 AM.

<p> <b>    1.2  PREREGISTRATION:</b>
       To aid the host club in preparation, MOST cars should be preregistered
    by class for participation in the Concours Event.  This is to allow the
    host club sufficient time for space allocation, trophy preparation, line up
    time, etc.  This does not preclude a FEW last minute entries, but late
    registrations SHALL NOT affect class reorganizations under Rule 2.3.
</ul>

<h3>2.  CLASSES:</h3>

    The following are the minimum classes which MUST be offered at the VTR
National Convention:  

<pre>
    Historical {Pre-TR}
    TR-2/TR-3
    TR-3A Early {Pre TS 60000}
    TR-3A Late  {Post TS 60000}
    TR-3B
    TR-4
    TR-4A
    TR-250 / TR-5
    TR-6 Early {all-chrome bumpers}
    TR-6 Late  {bumpers with rubber overriders}
    TR-7
    TR-8
    Spitfire Mk 1
    Spitfire Mk 2/3
    Spitfire Mk 4/1500
    GT-6
    Modified
    Special Interest
    Senior
</pre>

<ul>
<b>    2.1  SENIOR CLASS: </b>
       Any car which has won two VTR National Convention First Place Concours
    awards MUST enter the Senior Class if the owner wishes to pursue Concours. 
    Three trophies will be awarded in Senior Class.  Senior Class cars must be
    preregistered.  Senior cars shall compete against the score sheet only, not
    against each other.  A score of 350 points shall be required to win a
    Senior Award.  There will be no limit to the number of senior awards
    presented at any one national convention.

<ul>
<br><b>    2.1.1  PRESERVATION AWARD: </b>
       If the owner wishes to pursue concours after having obtained one Senior
    Award, the car shall be entered for a Preservation Award.  The scoring
    shall be the same as for Senior except that a score of 365 points shall be
    required for the awarding of a Preservation Award.  Preservation Award cars
    must be preregistered.  There shall be no limit to the number of
    Preservation Awards that a given automobile may win.

</ul>

<p> <b>    2.2  MODIFIED CLASS: </b>
       A car shall be deemed to be "MODIFIED", and placed in the modified
    class, if there is a major component change, i.e. engine, or multiple (2 or
    more) minor component changes, multiple body and/or trim modifications. 
    Minor modifications, which would not otherwise place the car in the
    Modified Class, shall receive one half the deduction of a missing part for
    each modified part.  The contestant may enter Modified Class on their own,
    but must do so PRIOR to the start of the judging.  The decision of the VTR
    Chief Judge in this matter shall be FINAL.  Judging in this class shall be
    for appearance and workmanship only, not authenticity.

<p> <b>    2.3  CLASS COMBINING: </b>
       The classes listed under Rule 2.0, along with Senior, are the MINIMUM
    classes which must be offered.  If three or more cars of the same type are
    preregistered, for which there is no class, i.e. Stags, then another class
    shall be created.  Classes of fewer than three cars SHALL NOT be combined
    without the permission of the participants affected.
</ul>

<h3>3.  JUDGING SYSTEM & AWARDS</h3>

<ul>
<b>    3.1  400 POINT SYSTEM:</b>
       Judging shall be conducted on the VTR 400 point system.  All cars shall
    begin with 400 points and suffer deductions for deviations from standard.

<p><b>    3.2  1st, 2nd, 3rd TROPHY MINIMUM POINTS: </b>
       Minimum points for awarding of trophies, regardless of the number of
    cars in a class, are as follows:
<pre>
       FIRST - 350
       SECOND - 300
       THIRD - 250
</pre>

<p><b>    3.3  BEST OF SHOW: </b>
       The Best of Show Award shall be selected as follows: 
       After all classes are judged, the top two cars in each class shall be
    judged again by the VTR Chief Judge and all Judging Team Leaders.  This
    will even out any slight variances in the judging which might exist from
    one team to the other.

<p><b>    3.4   CERTIFICATE OF EXCELLENCE: </b>
       In addition to the top three place trophy awards in each class, any car
    which scores high enough shall be awarded certificates as follows:
<pre>
       GOLD - 350
       SILVER - 300 
       BRONZE - 250
</pre>

<p>       Certificate winners may purchase, through the VTR, a plaque for
    permanent display of their award. The VTR will maintain a record of all
    scores to verify eligibility.

<p><b>    3.5  DISPUTES and PROTESTS: </b>
       Any disputes which arise shall be handled as follows: 
       The owner shall first discuss the problem with the team leader of
    his/her class.  If this is unsatisfactory in resolving the problem the
    owner shall then immediately appeal to the Host Club Concours Director. 
    The final step shall be to take the problem to the Chief Judge who shall
    resolve the issue in consultation with all interested parties.  All
    disputes (protests) shall be raised prior to completion of judging for the
    class in which the dispute arose.

<p><b>    3.6   ASPECTS OF JUDGING: </b>

<i>(See also the <a href="judgform.html">Concours Judging Form</a>.)</i>

<ul>
<p><b>       3.6.1 PERIOD ACCESSORIES: </b>
         Accessories which were available to the owner during the period when
       the car was current shall not be a cause for a deduction and shall not
       be considered modifications. This includes modern radios if installed in
       a period mount.

<p><b>       3.6.2  REPLACEMENT PARTS: </b>
         Replacement and/or reproduction parts abound for Triumphs.  No
       deduction shall be taken for replacement parts unless they differ
       significantly in appearance or material from the original.  In such case
       the deduction shall be one-half of the deduction that would be taken if
       the part were missing.

<p><b>       3.6.3  SAFETY ITEMS: </b>
         No deduction shall be made for safety items such as a fire
       extinguisher, fuel line hose clamps, seat belts, fuel filters, etc. The
       installation must be neat and  unobtrusive.

<p><b>       3.6.4 MODIFICATIONS: </b>
         See section 2.2 on MODIFIED CLASS

<p><b>       3.6.5  OVER-RESTORATION: </b>
         It is the responsibility of the team leaders to report to the Chief
       Judge any car which they feel to be over-restored.  Examples of over-
       restoration are as follows:
<pre>
         Too much chrome
         Leather where it shouldn't be
         Wool carpet where it shouldn't be
         Etc.
</pre>
<p>
         The Chief Judge, in conference with the team leader, shall determine
       if the car is in fact over-restored.  If such is the case the car shall
       be moved to the modified class and judged accordingly.  The Chief Judge
       may seek any advice deemed appropriate in reaching this decision.  If
       only portions, and not the entire car, is judged to be over restored,
       then the over-restored items or parts shall receive one-half the
       deduction of a missing item or part.
</ul>
</ul>

<h3>4.   PARTICIPANT'S RESPONSIBILITIES:</h3>

<ul>
<b>    4.1  MOVING EVENT CERTIFICATION/PREREQUISITE: </b>
       
       It is the VTR's position that all cars entered in the Concours Event
    MUST participate in one or more of the moving events offered at the
    National Convention: Rally, Autocross, etc.  (Driving to the national
    convention shall specifically NOTbe recognized as satisfying this
    requirement.)  It will be the responsibility of the Host Club Concours
    Director to provide readily verifiable VISIBLE proof that each car entered
    in concours satisfies this rule.  EXCEPTIONS TO THIS RULE WILL NOT BE
    GRANTED.

<p>       Cars must be driven onto the concours field under their own power.

<p><b>    4.2   PARTICIPANTS CHOICE: </b>
       If Participants/Peoples Choice judging is also offered by the host club
    at the national convention, a car may enter one or the other, not both.

<p><b>    4.3   DISPLAY OF VEHICLE: </b>
       Cars shall be displayed on the concours field as follows:

<pre>
       Tops installed and erected, sidecurtains and canvas displayed.
       Hoods open.
       Trunks open.
</pre>

    Any area not open shall receive maximum deduction allowed for that area,
    i.e. engine compartment.  Judges shall not touch the cars without
    permission of the owner.

<p> <b>  4.4  OWNER MUST BE PRESENT TO BE JUDGED </b>
       Owners must be present during the judging of their cars to answer any
    questions of the judges.  Owners may not ask judges for their scores, nor
    will the owners be given their score sheets.

<p><b>    4.5  DISPUTES & PROTESTS: </b>
       See section 3.5 for details.

</ul>

<h3>5.  HOST CLUB RESPONSIBILITIES: </h3>

<ul>
<p><b>    5.1  JUDGING COMMITTEE </b>
       At the national level of competition a "judging committee" shall be
    available as follows:
<pre>
       VTR Chief Judge
       Host Club Concours Director and Assistant (or Co-Directors)
       Class Judging Team Leaders
       Individual Team Members
</pre>

<ul>
<p><b>       5.1.1 HOST CLUB STAFFING: </b>
         The host club shall provide the following staffing levels:
<pre>
         Concours Director and optional assistant
         Six Team Leaders, to be trained by the VTR Chief Judge.
         Minimum of two Scribes to record scores.
         Marshallers-As many as may be required to help line up the cars and
                     to run the score sheets to the Scribes.
</pre>
</ul>

<p><b>    5.2  CHIEF JUDGE: </b>
       The VTR Chief Judge, or his designated representative from the VTR Board
    of Directors, MUST be present on the concours field from the time the
    judging begins until it ends.  The same is true for the Host Club Concours
    Director, who shall avail himself/herself of the Chief Judge for the
    solving of problems as they arise.

<p><b>    5.3  CLASS JUDGING TEAMS: </b>
       Class judging teams shall consist of volunteer class team leaders and
    judges. A team may judge more than one class, i.e. TR-2 through TR-5.  It
    shall be legal for a member who has a car entered in concours to be a
    judging team member PROVIDED he/she does not serve on the team which judges
    his/her class.  It is highly recommended that team leaders be certified by
    the VTR, or readily accepted as experts in the cars of the class they will
    judge.  They will act as supervisors of the volunteer judges  who will work
    under them.

<p><b>    5.4  JUDGING TEAM LOGISTICS </b>
       The host club should make every attempt to provide some sort of mobile
    communications and/or transportation for the Chief Judge during the
    concours event.  Also, since heat and sun can become a severe problem, some
    sort of shaded shelter should be made available for all of the judges.

<p><b>    5.5  JUDGES' SCHOOL: </b>
       In order to maintain these standards the VTR shall establish a judges'
    school to be conducted each year at the National Event, taught by the VTR
    Chief Judge. The school shall include, but not be limited to the following:

<pre>
       VTR Concours Rules
       VTR Judging Standards
       Team Organization
       Judges Decorum
       Resolving Conflicts
       Tie Breakers
</pre>

    The host club shall provide a two to three hour block of time and an indoor
    area for this school.
</ul>

<h3>6. EPILOGUE: </h3>
    As our cars become older, and hence more valuable, it becomes necessary to
adopt concours standards to try to level out the differences in judging from
one part of the country to the other.  The hope is that in the future, one win
will mean the same as the next, regardless of the location, while at the same
time keeping the fun in the concours event.  This is especially true in light
of the increasing value of our collector cars.  We are still hobbyists, not
speculators.

<TITLE>VTR Convention Rallye Guidelines</TITLE>
</head>
<BODY BGCOLOR="c0d0c0">


<center>
<H1>Vintage Triumph Register Convention Rallyes</h1>
<h2>General Guidelines</h2>
</center>

<br>
<h3>I. Type of events </h3>

   There shall be two types of rallyes offered at the national convention: a
gimmick or fun rallye and a TSD event.  The gimmick rallye may take on many
forms; the TSD event should be a non-trapped timed rallye.  It is possible for
someone without significant rallye experience to put together an acceptable
gimmick rallye using these guidelines and the official VTR general
instructions.  It is required by VTR that only experienced personnel write and
work the TSD rallye.  If the host club has no such people, it should look to
other local clubs with such experience to put on the event.  An experienced
club should be able to use these guidelines and official VTR general
instructions to put on a TSD event.

<h3>II.   General Instructions and Supplemental Instructions </h3>

   The official VTR general instructions (GIs) for <a
href="fun-rally.html"> gimmick rallyes</a> and <a
href="tsd-rally.html"> TSD rallyes</a> shall apply to each event.  In
addition, there shall be supplemental instructions (SIs) for each
event which may supersede the GIs.  Supplementals should be kept brief
and not rewrite the GIs.  At a minimum, SIs should contain the
following information:

<p><b>For Gimmick Rallyes:</b>
<pre>
   1. Start location and time
   2. Scoring information
   3. Mileage measurement (including conditions and type of vehicle) if
      applicable
   4. Time limit
   5. Any changes to the GIs.
   6. Other pertinent information
   7. Official Rallye Glossary
</pre>

<b>For TSD rallyes: </b>

<pre>
   1. Start location and time
   2. Scoring information
   3. Timing information (minutes and hundredths or minutes and seconds)
   4. Official mileage measurement information (type of vehicle, odometer, tire
      size and pressure, conditions, driven or undriven wheel, calibration
      standard)
   5. Rallye format
   6. Other pertinent information
   7. Official Rallye Glossary
</pre>

   The official VTR Glossary of Terms and Abbreviations lists the acceptable
terms and abbreviations to be used on either type of event.  The rallyemaster
should edit the list to include only those terms actually used in the route
instructions and provide that edited list as part of the SIs, to avoid any
possible confusion on the part of the contestants.

<h3>III.  Gimmick Rallyes </h3>

<ul>

<p><b>   A. General </b>
      The gimmick rallye should be a fun, low pressure event of about 50 miles
   including the odometer correction leg if needed.  In no case should the
   event exceed 60 miles or 2.5 hours.

<p><b>   B. Pre-check </b>
      Have two people run the rallye route, with the rallyemaster in the back
   seat.  The rallyemaster should let the test crew run the event and not
   interfere unless something goes drastically awry.  At least one pre-check is
   necessary; additional pre-checks are desirable.  Do a check after each major
   rewrite.

<p><b>   C. Types of gimmick rallyes   </b>

<ul>
<b>      1. Question and Answer </b>
         This is one of the simplest events to put on.  Worded instructions
      (using the glossary and the GIs) are used to indicate the course and
      questions are asked about things on (or off) the route.  In this event
      the route should be easy and the questions can be tricky.  It is common
      to use riddles or word puzzles.  A good guide is to have at least half as
      many questions as miles; for example a 50 mile Q&A rallye should have at
      least 25 questions.  Mileage or time may be used as a tie-breaker.  A
      part of the rallye may look like this:

<pre>
         15. Turn left at the Golden Arches.
         16. Right.
         Q 8. How may cardinals are there?
         17. Left after the red barn.
         18. Bear right at Y.
         Q 9. How much is soda today?
</pre>

      Get the idea?  Your imagination is the limit on the questions, but avoid
      anything that may not be common knowledge.  Don't ask for the gas price
      that approaches the natural log of the half life of U235 for example.   A
      scavenger hunt is fun for this type of event as well.

<p><b>      2. Poker Rallye </b>
         A variation on the Q&A rallye is the poker rallye.  This rallye
      requires checkpoint workers along the route.  It is possible to get local
      merchants to cooperate with this scheme as well.  The route instructions
      take contestants along the route where they pick up playing cards at
      checkpoints or at local businesses (sponsors of the convention?).  There
      should be 5 cards total.  They can get one at the start, one at the
      finish and 3 along the way, or any way as long as they have a hand of 5
      cards at the end. The winning poker hand wins the event.

<p><b>      3. The Hare and Hound </b>
         Another worded instruction format that incorporates "decision points"
      or in rallye lingo ODOTS (optional direction of travel).  Worded
      instructions are used and at an intersection where more than one
      direction of travel on legal rallye roads is possible, ODOT is used.  The
      contestants have to guess which way to go.  The right course is confirmed
      by a marker within 1/2 mile of the intersection.  The marker could be a
      sign indicated in the routes, or a special sign put up by the
      rallyemaster (in many cases little hares).  In its purest form a lead car
      runs about 30 minutes ahead of the rallye and throws down lime bags to
      mark its path.  Scoring is on questions and mileage.

<p><b>      4. Map rallye </b>
         This can also take many forms.  One of the most fun is to have
      checkpoint locations marked on a map and the contestants take the
      shortest route between them as determined by the map.  This can also be
      easily made into a scavenger hunt.  Questions can be used about things
      seen on the shortest route and on longer incorrect routes.
</ul>

<p><b>   D. Mileage and Odometer Checks </b>
      If mileage is to be used as part of the scoring process, it is necessary
   to provide a way to compare the rallye vehicle odometer to the one used to
   measure the event.  This is done with an odo check.  Pick relatively
   straight roads and easy course following.  Measure the mileage with the
   official vehicle.  Give the contestants many official mileage along the odo
   check and the final odo check mileage at the end.  They can then figure the
   difference between their odo and the one used to measure the rallye route
   (odo factor).  The odo factor is equal to official mileage/contestant's
   mileage.  When this factor is multiplied by the mileage shown on the
   contestant's odo at any point in the rallye, it will convert that mileage to
   official miles.  This system even works with cars with kilometers instead of
   miles (they just have a big factor). The odo check should be 10% of the
   total rallye or 8 miles whichever is greater.

<p>
      It is standard to estimate official mileage to 0.01 miles.
Either the contestant or the scoring committee must convert the
   contestant's mileage to official miles.  You can ask the contestant to do
   this in the route instructions, or have the contestant fill in his odo check
   mileage on the score card and have the scoring committee do the
   multiplication. 

<p><b>   E. Scoring </b>
      If mileage is used, 1 point for each 0.01 miles over or under official
   mileage is standard.  Each contestant's score should be determined by
   multiplying the contestant's mileage by the odo factor.  Under no
   circumstances use the contestants uncorrected mileage for scoring (they are
   using Smith's instruments, remember?) 25 points for each incorrect question. 
   Lowest score wins.  Any scoring scheme may be applied if it is consistent.

<p><b>   F. Instruction Security </b>
      If the gimmick rallye is made available to contestants throughout the
   convention, be sure to collect the route instructions.

<p><b>   G. Panic Packs </b>
      Provide a course map with the name of the convention hotel and a phone
   number in a sealed envelope with the car number printed on it.  This panic
   pack must be turned in unopened or the contestant is disqualified; however
   it will help ensure that no one gets hopelessly lost.
</ul>

<h3>IV.   Questions?</h3>
   Contact the VTR rallye advisor if there are any questions about these events
or for help with a specific rallye.

<h3>V. Classes </h3>

   There will be only two classes for each event: novice and experienced.  No
"equipped" TSD classes (computers, electronic odometers, etc.) will be part of
a VTR convention.

<b>
What's the Herald got to do with me, the Triumph sports car
owner?
</b>

<p>
  Fair enough question. Answer: the Herald has a lot to do with your
sports car. For example, the Herald was the first series- produced
Triumph styled by Giovanni Michelotti, whose designs would later be
applied throughout the Triumph range, for both family cars and sports
cars. The very existence of the Spitfire and GT6 is due to the basic
engineering of the Herald and its upmarket sibling, the Vitesse. Even
the engine of the TR250/5/6 is directly related to that of the
Herald. (In fact, the Herald engine is itself a direct descendant of
the 803cc engine developed for the Standard 8 in the early 1950s.)

<h1>A History of the Triumph Herald and Vitesse</h1>
</center>
<hr size=10>

<h3>
The Herald line
</h3>

<p>

  The first Herald to go on sale to the general public in April 1959
was what has long since become one of the rarest versions: The
Coup&eacute. Not quite a full four-seater (in fact, the rear seat was an
option), the car nonetheless was equipped with features quite familiar
to British sports car fans: four speed transmission; 948 cc engine
with twin SU H1 carburetors and an output of 50.5 bhp gross/42.5 bhp
net. Some features of the new car were considered quite novel at the
time: independent rear suspension; an incredibly tight turning circle
(25 ft.); "collapsible" and adjustable steering column; and a greatly
reduced maintenance schedule through use of nylon and rubber bushes
that virtually eliminated grease fittings on the chassis.

<p>
  The Coup&eacute was soon joined by a Saloon version, which allowed
rather more room for a full rear seat. The Saloon was originally
powered by a single Solex-carbureted, 38.5 bhp gross/34.5 bhp net
version of the same 948 cc engine, though later the twin-carb
engine would be offered as well. By March 1960, these two models
were joined by a Convertible, which also offered a top that
folded almost completely out of sight, a full (though a bit
cramped) rear seat and the twin-carb engine. 1960 also saw the
introduction of the Herald S, a stripped-down saloon that never
caught on.

<p>
  Bigger news the following year was the introduction of the
1200 series, incorporating the same Coup&eacute, Saloon and Convertible
body styles with a larger engine and somewhat more relaxed final
drive. Soon added to the range was an Estate Wagon and the short-
lived Courier van, a "commercial" version of the Estate wagon
much like the once-common sedan delivery versions of American
station wagons. A further upgrading of the 1147cc engine came
with introduction of the 12/50, a 1200 Saloon with 51 hp engine,
folding sunroof, different grille (seen later in the U.S. on the
Sports 1200) and uprated trim.

<p>
  Improvements continued, with all Herald 1200s eventually receiving
the sturdier frame seen first on the 12/50 (and earlier on the Vitesse
six-cylinder derivative) and a 48 hp version of the 12/50 engine. By
the end of 1964, the Coup&eacute had disappeared, perhaps falling
victim to the popularity of the <a
href="../Spitfire/Spitfire.html">Spitfire</a>!

<p>
  In 1968, facing competition both from other marques and other
models in the Triumph range, the Herald received a final, major
upgrading. More power came from a single-carb version of the
1296cc Spitfire Mk.3 (and Triumph 1300) engine, and a front-end
restyle came from adapting a variation of the Vitesse sheetmetal.
Improvements were made also to the interior and drivetrain
components. The resulting 13/60 came, as before, in Saloon,
Convertible and Estate Wagon variants, replacing all previous
configurations of Herald save the 1200 Saloon, which continued as
before. Sales of the 1200 quickly dropped off, though, while the
13/60 models were more successful for a time.

<p>
  By 1970, the rear-drive Triumph Toledo and front-drive 1500/
1500TC were too much competition. The 1200 Saloon disappeared in
May 1970, followed by the 13/60 Saloon in December and the
Convertible and Estate cars in May 1971.

<h3>
Vitesse
</h3>

<p> Meanwhile, back in 1959 and the introduction of the Herald, any
number of new models, projects and prototypes were being considered by
Standard-Triumph. One of these was an engine project -- a six-cylinder
engine derived from the SC/Herald engine (the engine that ultimately
was to power the 2000 and <a href="../TR5/TR5.html>TR5/TR250</a>/<a
href="../TR6/TR6.html>TR6</a> models). By 1960, Triumph engineers had
shoehorned a 2-litre version of this six into a modified Herald
Coup&eacute. The concept caught on, at least within the Triumph
organization. No one expected sales to be exceptional, and the cost to
bring the car to production was fairly low, so the car looked to be
profitable.

<p>
  Major changes from the original Herald involved new front styling
from Michelotti and a reworked, sturdier chassis frame (later adapted
on Heralds as mentioned above). When the Vitesse was launched in 1962,
it featured a 1600cc engine rather than the 2000cc engine of the first
prototype, and the car was offered only in Saloon and Convertible
versions. Lagging sales of the Herald Coup&eacute were to blame for
the lack of a Coup&eacute in the Vitesse range. In 1965, the
substitution of Stromberg sidedraft carburetors and manifold from the
2000 for the original Solex setup resulted in a significant gain of
horsepower, acceleration and fuel economy.

<p>

  By 1966, the Vitesse had been significantly upgraded in the face of
increased competition, primarily in sharing a 95hp, 2- litre motor and
other components introduced in the new <a
href="../GT6/GT6.html">GT6</a>, all-synchromesh transmission (developed
originally for factory Spitfire rallye cars), sturdier axles and
differential, larger front disc brakes, and the 4.5" wide wheels used
on Courier, GT6 and 2000 models.

<p>
  By this time, though, the limitations of the swing-axle rear
suspension were noted more and more both in the Vitesse and GT6.
Although the now-familiar swing-spring fix had been around since
the beginning of the Herald line in 1959, it was not applied
until 1971, and then only to the Spitfire. Instead, a double-
jointed half axle setup was designed, utilizing the same
transverse spring but adding a lower wishbone and rotoflex
couplings and relocating the trailing arm and shock absorbers
(now lever type on the Vitesse). The Vitesse 2-litre Mk. 2,
introduced in late 1968, incorporated this change along with a
further increase in horsepower, gained from a different camshaft
and use of the "full-width" cylinder head. (The GT6 Mk.2 -- or
GT6+ in North America -- also shared these improvements.) As good
as the car now was, though, it was perhaps a bit late in coming.
Sales tapered off steadily; the last Vitesse was built in May
1971, only weeks before Dolomite production began.

<h3>
The U.S. Market
</h3>

<p> Before you American fans get too excited about some of these
models, please be advised that the above descriptions don't
necessarily apply to the United States market.

<p> The Herald Coup&eacute was dropped in the US well before the end
of its production run. The Estate car was never officially imported (a
mistake in the opinion of some), nor was the 12/50 (the sunroof
feature alone might have been a great boost to Herald sales in this
country). Interestingly enough, the Herald 1200 name was replaced in
the U.S. during the 1964 model year by "Sports 1200"; the latter
featured the home market 12/50's grille and a 48 hp. version of the
1147cc engine. Trunk badging noted the change.

<p> By the mid-1960s, marketing of the Herald was not a high priority.
What advertising there was often referred only to the "Triumph 1200,"
with no reference to the Herald or Sports names.

<p> The original Vitesse (1600cc.) Convertible, badged in the U.S. as
a "Sports 6," was marketed in 1963 as a "limited-edition car"; even at
that, fewer than 700 were sold before the model was withdrawn from the
U.S.  market in 1964. The Sports 6 was perhaps better suited to
American highways than was the Herald, but it faced stiff price
competition from cars such as Ford's new Mustang. (The Vitesse Saloon
was not officially imported to the U.S.)

<p> Original U.S. prices (POE East Coast) and U.S. sales figures (from
Robson's Triumph Herald and Vitesse) were as follows:

<pre>
	   Herald 948cc
	      Saloon      ($1849) --  3,612
	      Coup&eacute       ($2149) --  1,049
	      Convertible ($2229) --  2,822
	   Herald/Sports 1200
	      Saloon      ($1699) --  4,609
	      Convertible ($1949) -- 11,654
	   Sports 6
	      Convertible ($2499) --    679
</pre>

<p>

<h2>Herald/Sports 6 Spotter's Guide -- US Models</h2>

<h4>Key features at a glance </h4>


<p>
<b>Herald (948cc): Coup&eacute, Saloon, Convertible</b>

<ul>

<li> <b>Exterior:</b> handle on top of bonnet (Coup&eacute and
Convertible also feature bright metal strip from leading edge of
handle forward and thin bright band covers bonnet flange surrounding
grille); Coup&eacute and Convertible feature crossed-flags badge at
rear upper edge of rear quarters (no flags on saloon); roof badges on
saloon read "Herald"; all cars feature Triumph "open-book" badge in
blue and white in upper center of grille; virtually all U.S.
specification cars carried the familiar white rubber bumper extrusions
front and rear; plain chromed "nave plate" adorns silver painted
wheels

<p> <li> <b>Interior:</b> dashboard in molded pressboard and painted
flat black with glovebox and hinged "chip basket" below; white-faced
gauges -- large speedo w/fuel gauge and separate temp. gauge in Saloon
models, small speedo and separate temp. and fuel gauges in Coup&eacute
and Convertible; grey steering wheel, column, switches and knobs;
upholstery usually with contrasting piping, flash on door and rear
side panels; Coupe and Convertible door panels included map pocket;
window winder knob in white, and white escutcheons for window winder
and door handle

</ul>

<b>
Herald 1200 Coup&eacute, Saloon, Convertible
</b>

<ul>

<li> <b>Exterior:</b> No handle on top of bonnet, but all models
feature bright metal strip, now extending from heater intake forward,
but extra bright strip around grille opening is gone; Coupe and
Convertible still feature crossed-flags badge at rear upper edge of
rear quarters; roof badges on saloons usually read "Triumph"; later
Sports 1200 models identified by home market 12/50-style grille and
"Sports" script badge replaces similar Herald badge on trunklid; front
valence modified with additional air intake, rear valences now bolt
on, and white rubber bumpers continue; Vitesse-style "Star" frame
incorporated circa 1963; other running manufacturing variances
incorporated as well; wheels -- painted Spa White starting circa 1963
-- received full wheel covers (actually sided left or right, and also
seen on U.S. specification Spitfires) in about the 1964 model year.

<p> <li> <b>Interior:</b> dashboard still of molded pressboard, but
most often covered by black padded vinyl, and now featuring a polished
wooden facia; glovebox gains a door, but hinged "chip basket" is gone;
black-faced gauges -- large speedo w/fuel gauge and separate temp.
gauge in all models; black steering wheel, column, switches, knobs,
window winder knob now black, and black escutcheons for window winder
and door handle; upholstery usually solid color throughout, seat
backrests are much thicker than on 948cc models, map pockets are gone
from convertible door panels.


</ul>

<b>
Sports 6 Convertible
</b>

<ul> <li> <b>Exterior:</b> much as Herald 1200, but front restyled
with "trademark" slanted pairs of 5.75" headlamps; Sports 6 badge on
trunklid; front and rear valences as Herald, but featuring aluminum
extrusions instead of white rubber; wheels featured chrome nave plate
as Herald, but with slotted rim embellishers

<p> <li> <b> Interior:</b> as Herald 1200, except: in the latter part of
1963 a revised dashboard featured a smaller speedo with a matching
tachometer and separate fuel and temperature gauges, and a large map
pocket was added in the passenger footwell.

</ul>

<b>
Numbering of Major Components
</b>

<p> For the most part, engines, gearboxes and rear axle units are
numbered similarly to the cars, although there are some exceptions.
[NOTE: as with other Triumph engine units, the HE suffix denotes a
high compression engine, and LE denotes a low compression engine.]

<ul>

<li> <b>Herald (948cc.)</b> The G prefix denotes single-carburetor
engine, Y denotes twin-carbuetor engine. The G (4.875:1 ratio) and Y
(4.55:1) prefixes were similarly used on rear axle units. Gearboxes
carried the G prefix.

<p> <li> <b>Herald 1200; Sports 1200 </b> The GA prefix is most
commonly found on engine, gearbox and rear axle (4.11:1). Prefix
letters GD may also be found on engines; this denotes either the 48
hp. or 51 hp. version of the "12/50" engine.

<p> <li> <b> Herald 13/60 (not officially imported to the U.S.)</b>
The GE prefix is most often found on engine and rear axle; GA prefix
continues on gearbox. 

<p> <li> <b>Sports 6 (Vitesse 1600) </b> The HB prefix, as used in
Commission numbers, is also found on engine, gearbox and rear axle.

</ul>

After 25-35 years, it would not be a surprise to come across a Herald
or Vitesse with major components whose numbers do not match the
listings above. As components are easily swapped with their "sports
car" counterparts, one might find, for example, FC- or FD-prefix
components (Spitfire 4-Mk.2 or Mk.3) in Heralds, or KC- or KD-prefix
components (GT6) in a Sports 6.

<img src="TR7.gif">
<p>

The TR7, <i>The Shape of Things to Come,</i> was the most widely produced
TR, with over one hundered thousand manufactured.  The TR7 was a
radical change from the prior <a href="http:../TR6/TR6.html"> TR6</a>,
which had evolved gradually from the first <a
href="http:../TR2/TR2.html"> TR2</a>.  The TR7 is a more plentiful
 car than the earlier TRs, although enjoying less widespread
popularity, making it an excellent car for a Triumph enthusiast who
wants to be able to <b><i>drive</i></b> his Triumph regularly!

<p>
Currently, the best source of information about the TR7 is the
archive of the <a href="http://www.team.net/TR8"> World Wide
Wedge mailing list</a>.

<h2>The Triumph Spitfire Buyer's Guide</h2>
</center>
<hr size=10>

<p>
In addition to the items listed in the general <a href =
"../buyers-guide.html"> Triumph Buyers Guide </a>, there are a number
of specific items of interest on the Spitfire.

<p>

Parts availability for the Spitfire is excellent, with a number of major
suppliers providing most parts for the Spitfire, ranging from tune up
components and interior kits to most body panels.

<p>
There are two stages in checking the quality of a potential 
Spitfire purchase.  Make a list of all the areas you intend to 
inspect and stick to the list.  

<h3> First Stage-walk around </h3>

<ul>

<li> <b>Body:</b> One of the most important things to watch for on the
Spitfire, as with all Triumphs, is rust.  Rust coming through the paint
generally indicates that there is 5 to 10 times more rust lurking
beneath the body panels.  Where does one look for rust on a Spitfire, other
then everywhere?

<p> Look for areas that have been repainted, especially over possible
rust.  Is the car the original color?  Look closely for body filler
and lumps around the fenders and trunk.  (If appropriate, lightly run
your hand across the finish to feel for small bumps or dents).  Be
sure to pay particular attention to the following areas:

<ul>

<li> Under the carpets at the front of footwells, underneath the
driver's pedals, and along the seat rails.

<li> Under the bonnet, particularly behind the rear wheels, and at the
hinge mounting points where the bonnet is attached to the frame.

<li> In the engine compartment around the battery box, and under the
hydraulic master cylinders, where leaking fluids may have removed
paint, allowing rust to spread.
</ul>

<p> Also check the chrome for the the quality of the finish, dents or
missing parts.  Front windscreen should be free from scratches.
Convertible top should fit, back windows clear, studs secure, and
stitching firm.

<p> While standing about 10 feet away, check each side of the car for
the alignment of the doors.  Poor door alignment could indicate a bad
frame or rusted rocker panels. Check the front and back for "lean" or
suspension/chassis defects.  Try bouncing the corners to check the
shocks.

<p><li> <b>Interior:</b> Open and close each door for fit.  Look for rust
and check color.  Check the rocker panels for rust/repair.  Examine
door panels and raise/lower windows.  Test locks.  Upholstery on seats
should be free from cracks.  Check under seats for disintigrating seat
foams. Slide seats forward and back.  Check the carpet for wear.
Sneak a peek under the front carpet for floorboard rust, replacement
for damage.  Cracked dash? Look for the original steering wheel, ash
tray, map light, glove box compartment(s). Seatbelts should be
attached and not excessively worn.  Spare tire and jack?
	
<p><li> <b>Electrical: </b> 
There are no particularly unusual electrical problems on the Spitfire,
other than the typical problems common to nearly all British cars.
Check all lights and plastic parts for damage.  Be sure to test
headlights (bright/dim), turn signals, backup, and brake lights.

</UL>

<h3> Second Stage-More detail </H3>

<ul>

<li><b>Body fit:</b> Open the bonnet latches and check fit, dents, or
twisting.  Look for rust inside around lights and wheel arches.  Check
A-post for corrosion around attachment to door sill.  Open boot and
check hinges and edges for rust.  Check doors again for proper fit.
Look for corrosion in footwells and examine inner sills to floor pan.
Check under rear wheel arches.

<p><li><b>Mechanical: </b> Check fluids and belts. Start engine and check
hand brake, brake and clutch pedals.  Listen and look for exhaust
problems.  Engine should be appropriately clean.  Look for oil/water
leaks and mystery parts.  Listen for knocking, grinding, banging,
rattling, or loud ticking.

<p><li><b>Test Drive:</b> Try the gears while parked.  Move in reverse 
first.  The car should not "jump" out of gear (gearbox).  Now 
try first gear and continue through each gear, checking for 
smooth opperation.  Tire wear  can cause the car to pull to 
one side.  Brakes can also pull. Uphill climbing should be 
without labor.  Listen for bearing noise.  Check for vibration 
in the steering wheel.

</ul>

<p>

<h3>Prices</h3>
The prices given below are determined by the author's experience, and
are not necessarily indicative of prices in your area.  

<pre>
	CONDITION						Price
	------------------------------------    		-------
	Restored - 100% as new, 95 points min concourse		 $6,000
	Excellent - mostly restored or superb original		 $4,500
	Amateur partly restored, or very good original		 $3,000
	Good, complete, runs and drives well			 $2,000
	Fair, drivable, needs minor repairs, but complete	 $1,200
	Poor, not too incomplete, not badly rusted/damaged	   $600
	Poor, rough, incomplete, damaged, or badly rusted	   $300
</pre>

Remember, these are values based on a normal (non duress) situation.
If you are trying to sell a Spitfire (or any collector car for that
matter) in a hurry (i.e. divorce settlements, need immediate cash to
close on the new house, etc.) then prices can be lower, especially in
winter months in the northern states.  Price valuations from
appraiser's are usually given to estimate the cost of replacement.

<p>
<img src="TR5.gif">
<p>

The TR5 and the TR250 were introduced in October 1967, to provide
additional power for the Triumph TR.  The two-liter four cylinder
engine which had served Triumph so well from the TR2 to the TR4 was
replaced in the TR5 and TR250 by a two-and-a-half liter six cylinder
engine, to provide additional power and smoothness.  Other than the
engine, the TR5/TR250 were extremely similar to the TR4A it replaced.

<! To meet emerging emissions regulations in the USA, separate
versions of the car appeared for the American and British markets: the
British-spec TR5 and the American-spec TR250.  The primary distinction
between the two vehicles was that the TR5 received Lucas fuel
injection producing nearly 150hp, while the TR250 used two Stromberg
carburettors, generating just over 100hp. >

<pre>



</pre>
<i>Andy Mace's 1952 Mayflower,
"Priscilla", at the 1989 VTR National Convention</i>

<br clear="left">

<p>
"The Mayflower _was_ singular -- a car of great character, built by and for
characters. Road tester Tom McCahill called it a slab-sided tobacco can, a
geranium pot, a turnip. Those to whom it appealed nicknamed it the 'Watch
Charm Rolls,' but others called it many worse things. Sir John Black,
however, doted on the little dear, and at Standard-Triumph that was
tantamount to automotive sainthood. Sir John got his comeuppance soon enough,
when the Mayflower hit the American market: it sold by the half-dozen." --
from _Triumph Cars; The Complete Story_, by Graham Robson and Richard
Langworth, c. 1979, 1988.

<p>
It definitely was with an eye on the American market that Standard-Triumph
developed the Mayflower. In retrospect, however, it appears that eye was not
too well focused. The Mayflower was in a number of ways innovative in style
and in engineering; at the same time many features were antiquated, and the
car as a whole was generally poorly suited to its intended buyers -- those
Americans theoretically still hungry for new cars after World War II.
Unfortunately, the Mayflower missed that seller's market but was too early
for the compact/small import car craze of the late 1950s.

<p>
In style, the Mayflower was conceived as a "little brother" to the Town &
Country/Renown saloons. Unfortunately, it has long been open to question
whether the "knife-edge" style worked on such a short wheelbase. Liked or
hated, it was quite distinctive, particularly as compared to some of its
contemporaries: Austin Devon, Ford Anglia and Prefect Morris Minor,
Volkswagen Beetle.

<p>
The "knife-edge" styling (generally credited to Walter Belgrove of
Standard-Triumph and Leslie Moore of Mulliners) proved useful in providing an
incredible amount of usable interior space, and the unit-body design made for
a very rigid structure. Thin pillars allowed a large glass area that gave a
more open feeling, and ventilation was aided by vent windows in both front
doors and in the rear quarter lights. Of particular note in the
well-appointed interior were innovative separate front seats: as the seatback
was pulled forward for access to the rear seat, the seat cushion glided
forward as well.

<p>
In addition to accommodating its passengers well, the Mayflower also carried
a fair amount of luggage. The boot lid hinged at the bottom and could serve
as an extension of the luggage platform. The license plate and lamp, mounted
on the boot lid, swiveled down as the lid was lowered. The spare tire was
stored underneath the car, much as is the practice currently with a number of
small trucks and SUVs.

<p>
Mechanically, the Mayflower was a mix of old, new and cost cutting. The
side-valve four-cylinder engine was unique to the Mayflower, although it
derived from a prewar Standard unit. Especially when coupled with the
three-speed, column-shift gearbox, the engine was really not up to the task
of propelling such a heavy car at great speeds. However, at least the gearbox
featured synchromesh on all three forward speeds. That gearbox, as well as
the rear axle, came from the Standard Vanguard.

<p>
New for the Mayflower, however, was the front suspension, whose design was
continued almost unaltered in the TR2 and TR3. Road wheels on the Mayflower
would also look familiar to a TR owner, but those on the Mayflower lacked the
perforations of the TR road wheel. Brakes were also familiar Lockheed units,
with two leading shoes in front and leading/trailing shoes in the rear. An
"umbrella handle"-style handbrake was located under the dash.

<H3>The near-"mythical" Mayflower drophead</H3>

<p>
A total of 35,000 Mayflowers were built between 1950 and 1953. Included in
that total were a quantity of CKD cars assembled in Sweden and elsewhere.
Early on in the Mayflower production, a total of 10 dropheads were built.
While the Mayflower saloon bodies were built by Fisher & Ludlow, the
dropheads were converted from saloons by Mulliners, long specialists in such
conversions and long connected with Standard-Triumph.[*] It seems likely that
the great cost of the conversion made continued production of dropheads
impractical, and the dropheads were long gone by 1953, when the Standard 8
and 10 (see <a
href="http://www.vtr.org/Triumph10/index.html">The Triumph 10, 1957-1960 </a>
replaced the Mayflower. Few (if any) genuine Mayflower dropheads exist today.

<p>
[*NOTE: Mulliners, taken over by Standard-Triumph in the late 1950s, were
responsible for a number of estate car and "commercial vehicle conversions"
of Standard products such as the Vanguard and the 8/10/Pennant line and also
built TR2-3 bodies. Mulliners also controlled the Forward Radiator Company,
who in addition to their namesake product also produced TR3B bodies.]

Also included in the 35,000 total are approximately 500 U.S.-spec. Mayflowers
imported officially by Fergus Motors of New York City. These cars may be
identified by a serially numbered Fergus Motors ID plate on the firewall near
the Commission number plate.

<H3>A Nash Connection?</H3>

<p>
Not long after Mayflower production began, Sir John Black approached
Nash-Kelvinator's George Mason regarding use Mayflower components in what was
to become the Metropolitan. Later on, Sir John apparently changed his mind.
The Metropolitan ultimately used Austin engines, but bodies were built by
Fisher & Ludlow. Nearly three times as many Metropolitans were built (around
100,000 as opposed to 35,000 Mayflowers); it may not have been a good
decision.

<TITLE>A Triumph GT6 Buyers' Guide</TITLE>

<h2>A Triumph GT6 Buyers' Guide</h2>
</center>

<p>
    Christopher A. Kantjariev (cak@dimebank.com)    
<br>
    Richard George                                

<P><DT><B>Overview:</B>

<dd>In addition to the items listed in the general <a href =
"../buyers-guide.html"> Triumph Buyers Guide </a>, there are a number
of specific items of interest on the GT6.

<DD>The car's weak spot is definitely the tranny, and the differential is
probably next.  

<P><DT><B>Engine:</B>

<DD>Check the compression. That year has the 9.25:1 head, so the
numbers should probably be in the 175-185 range (cold). The car has
the fairly bulletproof <a href="../TR6/TR6.html"> TR6</a> block, with
the usual problems with low oil flow to the valve gear. Watch out for
excess rattle up there; it might mean some work is needed (the shaft
is about $80, and the rockers are $16 each). Check for smog stuff if
the car is going to a smog state; '69 probably just needs PCV valve
and vacuum advance/retard lines.

<P><DD>
Be careful if the car has to pass local emissions tests to get
re-registered - these cars used the strombergs with the needle that
slides on the side of the jet - Unfortunately, this wears a groove in
the jet which hoses up your mixture (and of course the jet is non
replaceable in this carb, and its mostly non-adjustable...)  (I.E. IT
WON'T PASS).  The last time my '69 had to go through, I had to borrow
someone else's carbs to do it...

<P><DD>
There are supposed to be fibreboard panels around the engine
compartment; if these are missing it's a place to negotiate about
originality and price. Of course, they're pretty much a nuisance,
but...

<P><DT><B>Tranny:</B>
<DD>
This is the car's weak spot; it *will* fail. Listen for excess noise
and feel for worn synchros. Be prepared to either rebuild it or walk
away from the deal if it crunches at all.

<P><DD>
Putting Redline MTL in will often help synchro problems, but the main
failure seems to be the bearing on the output shaft.


<P><DT><B>Suspension/driveline:</B>
<DD>Check the state of the rotoflex couplings in the back (look for cracks
in the rubber donuts) No one seems to replace them when they need it,
so be prepared to replace them yourself immediately after purchase.

<P><DD>
Listen for excessive differential noise.

<P><DD>
Listen for universal joint clunks and thunks.  Expect that at least
one U joint will be loose and want replacement.  These are all fairly
cheap and available, but a royal pain to install. Same for all the
rubber bits in the suspension. Worn rear radius arm bushings,
especially, will cause slightly weird handling over bumps, and the
rear end is squirrelly enough as it is!

<P><DD> Check the steering rack gaiters for tears and the rack
mounting bushings for play. There will probably be wear in the
trunnions.  The Roadster Factory (TRF) offers a complete front
suspension rebuild kit for under $100, and it's well worth doing on a
"new" car.

<P><DT><B>Overdrive: </B>
<DD>If it works, great. If it doesn't, well ... it *probably* needs to
have the O rings replaced, but that means pulling the tranny (and
probably the engine with it).

<P><DT><B>Body:</B>
<DD>Probably the most important thing is the firewall; the car relies on
this for structural strength. Go over it with a magnet and make sure
there isn't much (any!) bondo. Look to see if the tranny cover mates
well; if it doesn't, you'll get heat and fumes into the passenger
compartment.

<P><DD>
Check the battery box area and the floor underneath it - your usual
owner will replace the battery box only after it has caused severe
rust on the floor under it.

<P><DD>
Look for the usual things about rust and trim. The rear shock mounts
to the body at the upper end, so that area needs to be solid too.
Check for chrome trim: there should be trim strips along the front and
rear wings, and under the doors (under the sills, actually). Check for
bonnet shake and the integrity of the rubber seals at the rear of the
bonnet and the inner wheelwells.

<P><DT><B>Frame: </B>
<DD>Hmm. The body is a main spine with outriggers. Check the outriggers
for rust; they provide most of the transverse strength of the car.
Check the rear frame members for rust.

<P><DT><B>Brakes:</B>
<DD>Nothing out of the ordinary here; before writing off the brakes as
weak, make sure the rears have been adjusted. Look for leaks around
the master/cylinders.  The brake master cylinder rebuilds easily, but
the parts are expensive.  The reservoir lid tends to crack; you used
to have to buy the complete reservoir and lid, but TRF has just
started listing the lid separately.

<P><DT><B>Price:</B>
<DD>While some jokers seem to think they can ask 4 grand+ for a perfect
one, you should be able to find a good one for $1500 - 2500 (At least
where I am...)  (I think the 4 grand ones sit for a while, and the
owner gets discouraged and...).

<P><DT><B>Fit/function:</B>
<DD>My legs aren't quite as long as TerriAnn's, but I have trouble fitting
into my GT6, too. Didn't stop me from buying it, and one of the first
things I did was buy a 13" steering wheel. Made a huge difference.
Leaning the seat back fairly far did the rest; now I'm quite happy
motoring down the road in a semi-prone position ...

<P><DD>
It's a hot little box -- both in speed an interior temperature.
Handling is prety good, though the rear end tends to "hop" trying to
find the apex...  TriumphTune offers various bits that improve it
greatly.

<TITLE>The Triumph Herald/Vitesse Buyer's Guide</TITLE>
</head>
<BODY BGCOLOR="c0d0c0">

<h1>The Triumph Herald/Vitesse Buyer's Guide</h1>
</center>
<hr size=10>

<p>

In addition to the items listed in the general <a href =
"../buyers-guide.html"> Triumph Buyers Guide </a>, there are a number
of specific items of interest on the Herald/Vitesse.


<p>


Assessing a Herald or Vitesse for possible purchase is very much like
assessing any Triumph. Due to the many mechanical similarities, most
of the same strengths and weaknesses of <a
href="../Spitfire/Spitfire.html>Spitfires</a> or <a
href="../GT6/GT6.html">GT6s</a> apply to the Herald/Vitesse range.

<ul>

<li> <b>Engine:</b> The engines generally took a lot of punishment,
but ultimately that punishment shows in wear of cylinder bores,
crankshafts, main and big-end bearings, thrust washers, etc. Expect to
pay about the same for a rebuild of a Herald engine as you would for
the nearly identical Spitfire engine. Some 948cc engine parts are
becoming scarce.) On the six-cylinder, check carefully for all the
same sorts of problems common to GT6 and <a
href="../TR6/TR6.html">TR6</a> engines. Again, rebuilding costs are
about on a par with other Triumph sixes, and some 1600cc parts are
scarce.

<p><li> <b>Transmission:</b> The Heralds used a transmission virtually
identical to the Spitfire, and the usual problems are likely to be
found, especially with worn synchros and damaged gears from those who
never mastered the "double-declutching" necessary to engage a
non-synchro first gear while moving. Don't be fooled, though, by a
sloppy shift lever. A $20 bushing kit will quickly cure that problem,
as it will on the GT6 and pre-1975 Spitfires.

<p>
  With the 1600cc cars, the transmission was very similar to the
Herald, but with different gearing. If you encounter a non-
running Sports 6/Vitesse 1600, there's a fair chance that the
transmission is in poor shape (from being marginally able to cope
with the six). There is also a fair chance that it is missing
completely; early Vitesse gearboxes were often pirated by racers
of Spitfires, the Vitesse ratios serving as an ideal "close-
ratio" gearbox for racing!

<p><li> <b>Brakes:</b>
  The electrical and hydraulic systems of these cars will show
no surprises for those familiar with other Triumphs or indeed any
other British-made cars. The rear brakes of the Herald are, for
all intents and purposes, identical to those of the Spitfire. The
same holds true for the front disk brakes. As parts changed on
the Spitfire (such as the larger calipers used from the Mk.3
Spitfire on), they changed as well on the Herald. Similarly, the
brake parts used on the Vitesse/Sports 6 parallel those used on
the GT6 models. Interchangeability is even found front-to-rear in
a sense: if you encounter trouble locating a front brake drum for
a Herald, look for a rear drum from a GT6!

<p><li> <b>Chassis/Frame:</b>
  One of the most critical parts of any car is, of course, the
chassis; the Herald/Vitesse line is no exception. The frame is
especially critical on these cars in that their construction and
strength are based on large sections of the bodyshell bolted to
each other and to the frame, unlike the largely welded-up
bodyshells found on most other Triumphs. Unfortunately, these
cars seem to have been extraordinarily susceptible to rust in the
chassis, especially in areas where salt was used during the
winter.

<p>
  Any Herald or Sports 6 chassis should be checked carefully for
rust, which usually appears first in the rear frame extensions
that support the trunk. Next, and even more critical, are the
outriggers and side rails (which appear much as the names
suggest) off the main backbone. The rearmost outriggers often
disintegrate, taking with them the radius arm mount for the rear
axles. Needless to say, this leads to handling unpredictable at
best, deadly at worst!

<p>
  Due no doubt to the great popularity the Heralds and Vitesses
still enjoy in England, many repair pieces are available for the
chassis. Unfortunately for those of us in North America, one is
more likely to encounter a Herald or Vitesse with chassis repairs
that are well-intended, but perhaps lacking in strength or
quality, or one in dire need of repair (see story in TVT #57).
Proper repairs ideally require quality NOS or reproduction
pieces, body removal from the chassis, careful fitting and
alignment and quality welding of the pieces.

</ul>
<h3>
But will your kids like it?
</h3>

<p>  Like most other Triumphs, Heralds and Vitesses truly come from
an earlier, simpler time. Even at its introduction in 1959, the
Herald was at once quite advanced (independent rear suspension,
reduced maintenance, etc.) but archaic (separate frame at a time
when many builders of small cars were turning to unibody
construction). Thirty-five years later, the cars seem absolutely
primitive compared to most current economy cars. Certainly the
earliest Heralds in particular are not ideal for long-distance
travel on the Interstate.

<p>
  It probably is best to look upon them the way many of their
original owners did -- as second cars: the Convertible offering a
bit of sportiness over the family station wagon or four-door
sedan, but with enough room for two adults and two children; the
Saloon offering economical, reasonable closed comfort for four
(not to mention the practicality of the large trunk and, on 948
models, a fold-down rear seatback offering a long and almost-flat
load area); or the Sports 6, with the six-cylinder smoothness, if
not the all-out horsepower, that most contemporary American cars
offered, in a distinctive, small package.

<p>

  It is a certainty that you won't see yourself coming and going, even
at a car meet. Likely as not, Heralds and Vitesses will be outnumbered
even at <a href="../conventions/index.html">Triumph meets</a> by
Mayflowers, long- door <a href="../TR2/TR2.html">TR2s</a> and
documented ex-works competition cars. That's part of the fun. It's
also a safe bet that you won't put your children through medical
school with profits from the eventual sale of your Herald or Sports
6. But it's quite likely that you will enjoy driving "the economy car
made by sports-car engineers" and knowing that you're helping to
preserve a part of Triumph history as unique and important as the
sports cars.

<h1>The Triumph TR4A Buyer's Guide</h1>
</center>
<hr size=10>

<p>

In addition to the items listed in the general <a href =
"../buyers-guide.html"> Triumph Buyers Guide </a>, there are a number
of specific items of interest on the TR4A.


<p>


Assessing a TR4A for possible purchase is very much like
assessing any Triumph. Due to the many mechanical similarities, most
of the same strengths and weaknesses of 
<a href="../TR4/TR4.html">TR4</a> 
or 
<a href="../TR6/TR6.html">TR6</a> apply to the TR4A range.

<ul>

<li> <b>Engine:</b> The engines generally took a lot of punishment,
but ultimately that punishment shows in wear of cylinder bores,
crankshafts, main and big-end bearings, thrust washers, etc.
Liners and pistons are available in various sizes and are
fairly straightforward to replace. Low oil pressure may be
"cured" by replacing the oil pump and big end bearings (easily
done with the engine in the car). Look for a missing radiator
shroud as the source of overheating problems.

<p><li> <b>Transmission:</b> 
The later TR transmission is fairly bulletproof. Look for malfunctioning
or maladjusted overdrive; the adjustment is simple, and swapping
an OD into a non-OD is straightforward (if you can find the parts).
The TR box is one of the nicest feeling gearboxes this side of
a Hewland racing transaxle.


<p><li> <b>Brakes:</b>
  The electrical and hydraulic systems of these cars will show
no surprises for those familiar with other Triumphs or indeed any
other British-made cars. 
Weak brakes often mean poorly adjusted rear drums.

<p><li> <b>Chassis/Frame:</b>
  One of the most critical parts of any car is, of course, the
chassis; the TR4A is no exception. The fore/aft strength of
the car counts on solid sills. Clunks from the rear under
power may indicate worn, missing or broken differential mounts;
usually the front right mount wears and then breaks, followed quickly
by its left rear counterpart. Loose or worn universal joints
are another common source of noise at the rear; lubrication of
these items is essential (and sometimes difficult). A nice
addition to find is the rubber gaiters from a TR250 to cover
the inner joints.

<p> <li> <b>Body:</b>
Apart from the sills, these cars have several other common rust
points: the trailing end of the front fenders, where mud and muck
gets caught behind the "access panels" (which seem to be
rarely used), and the upper arches of the rear fenders. Rustproofing
(and paint!) seems to have been applied to these areas after
assembly, leaving much exposed metal.

<TITLE>The Triumph TR6 Buyer's Guide</TITLE>

<h2>The Triumph TR6 Buyer's Guide</h2>
</center>

<p>
In addition to the items listed in the general <a href =
"../buyers-guide.html"> Triumph Buyers Guide </a>, there are a number
of specific items of interest on the TR6.

<p>
Parts availability for the TR6 is excellent, with a number of major
suppliers providing most parts for the TR6, ranging from tune up
components and interior kits to complete body shells.

<h3>Potential TR6 Problem Areas:</h3>
<ul>

<li> <b>Body:</b> One of the most important things to watch for on the
TR6, as with all Triumphs, is rust.  Rust coming through the paint
generally indicates that there is 5 to 10 times more rust lurking
beneath the body panels.  Where does one look for rust on a TR6, other
then everywhere?

<ul>
<li>  The top of rear deck at the seams between the deck panels and fenders.
Even slight bubbling of the paint in this area may be indicative of
more serious rust deeper within the seams.  

<li> Under the carpets at the front of footwells, underneath the
driver's pedals, and along the
seat rails.

<li> On the front quarter panels behind the wheels, particularly at
the junction with the firewall.

<li> Behind the rear wheels, all the way back to the rear valence,
around the tops of that portion of the taillight which wraps around
the side of the fender.  Remember to check the *inside* of these
panels as well as the outside.

<li> In the engine compartment around the battery box, and under the
hydraulic master cylinders, where leaking fluids may have removed
paint, allowing rust to spread.
</ul>

<br>
<li> <b>Frame:</b>

The TR6 frame is a boxed section frame with baffles that separate the
long sections.  The most common problem with these frame members is
that salt and water can easily get inside the frame member and rot it
from the inside out. The problem first shows up a "blisters" along the
seams where the frame sections join together.  Two particular special
problem areas are where the trailing arms (for the rear suspension)
and differential are attached to the frame.  

<dd>Look very carefully at the location that the trailing arms mount to
the frame. Very easy to get to, it's just behind the seats, and
underneath the car. If there is rust on these pieces, get up, dust
yourself off, and say 'Thanks, but no thanks'.  (Unless you are
looking for a donor car for a major project.)  Repairing/replacing
these sections is very time and labour intensive, usually requiring a
body off repair or a new frame to fix it "right."  If you drive the
car, listen for telltale clunks coming from torn diff mounts, although
these "clunks" sounds a lot like simple worn U-joint noise.  Yet
another frame/body warning sign are problems with sagging sills and
doors that are tough to open/close.

<p>
<li> <b>Electricals:</b>  There are no particularly unusual electrical
problems on the TR6, other than the typical problems common to nearly
all British cars.

<p>
<li> <b>Mechanicals:</b>
In general, the TR6 drivetrain is pretty solid and robust.  Lots of
mechanical parts are available for the TR6, from numerous suppliers.
Some of the more common mechanical problems that may cost you more
than you expected include:

<ul>

<li> <b>Differential: </b>the bearings are ball bearing type. They can
fail. Failure often results in major differential failure that is
remedied by replacing the diff.  Also the ring and pinion can break
for any number of reasons (not the least of which would be smokey
burnouts :-() Rebuilding TR6 diffs requires special tools too. Farm
the work out.

<li> <b>Engine:</b> The TR6 engine is pretty strong, and can go long
without any major overhaul.  When they start to get tired, they can be
easily reconditioned by a competent overhauler. If the current owner
said that he/she rebuilt it, do not consider the engine overhaul to
contribute to the overall value of the car. The sole exception to this
rule is that if the mechanic is/was a real TR mechanic.

<dd>
	The most informative thing you can learn about a TR6 engine if 
you can't actually run it is to check the condition of the Thrust Washers.  
These are the biggest failure point.  Replacement can require a 
different crankshaft and block if the condition is severe enough. This can 
be a good bargaining point when buying a TR6.

<dd>	To check, simply push the crankshaft pulley rearward as hard as 
you can, then have an assistant sit in the car.  Now, use your hand to 
span the space between the crank pulley and the front of the engine, and 
inform your assistant to lightly step on the clutch pedal.  You'll feel 
the crank pulley move forward slightly, and this will reveal the 
condition of the thrust washers.  

<dd>	The allowable axial play for the crankshaft is .007-.013   If the 
distance seems greater than say, the thickness of your fingernail, you 
should bargain for a lower price, knowing that you'll have to be into the 
lower end of the motor soon.  If the distance approaches 1/8", you can 
bet that the thrust washers have fallen into the oil pan, and the 
connecting rod bearings are short to fail.  In this case, a different 
engine would probably be in order.

<li> <b>Front end:</b> the front end on a TR6 is pretty strong. Most
of the parts are relatively easy to replace given time and patience.

<li> <b>Rear Hubs:</b> The rear hubs are a common malady. The bearings
for the rear hubs are sealed bearings (in a sense.) There is no way to
lubricate them, and they can fail for a number of reasons. At any
rate, if you catch them early (when they start to slop a bit) then you
can get them rebuilt by a competent shop (with experience!) or
mail-order British car specialist. If you don't catch them in
time...it's in the bin with them! Expensive! Don't try to fix them
yourself, or you will repeat the story that a lot of TR6 owners tell
of a shop that wrecked a set of hubs. There are special tools required
to do the hubs right as well as above average mechanical skills. Farm
out hub rebuilding!

<li> <b>Transmission:</b> The transmissions on TR6s are pretty
good. If they make noise in any gears, the overhaul can be
expensive. It a transmission in a prospective purchase has been
rebuilt, if the current owner rebuilt it, do not consider this piece
in the overall value of the vehicle. Also, make sure that all gears
shift smoothly. Bad synchros and slop in the shift mechanism can make
the best transmission beat itself to death in very short order!

<li> <b>U-joints:</b> There are six U-joints on the TR6. The factory
installed units were permanently lubricated. This means that they fail
after a while. If they have been replaced, they might have grease
nipples which if used to grease the u-joints will aid in longevity.

</ul>
</ul>

<h3>Prices</h3>
The April '94 issue of "British Car" includes a
Triumph TR6 price guide:  (reprinted here without permission, so
please don't include this in a hardcopy newsletter without permission)

<pre>
	CONDITION						Price
	------------------------------------    		-------
	Restored - 100% as new, 95 points min concourse		$12,000
	Excellent - mostly restored or superb original		 $9,000
	Amateur partly restored, or very good original		 $6,250
	Good, complete, runs and drives well			 $4,000
	Fair, drivable, needs minor repairs, but complete	 $2,300
	Poor, not too incomplete, not badly rusted/damaged	 $1,200
	Poor, rough, incomplete, damaged, or badly rusted	   $700
</pre>

Remember, these are values based on a normal (non duress) situation.
If you are trying to sell a TR6 (or any collector car for that
matter) in a hurry (i.e. divorce settlements, need immediate cash to
close on the new house, etc.) then prices can be lower, especially in
winter months in the northern states.  Also price valuations are
usually given to estimate the cost of replacement.

<TITLE>Bonnet release cable broken! (TR4-TR6)</TITLE>

<h2>Bonnet release cable broken! (TR4-TR6)</h2>
<i>by Ken Streeter, with input from<br>
6-Pack and TRF</i>
</center>
<HR size=10>

A broken bonnet release cable on the TR4-TR6 can cause no end of
difficulty in getting the hood up to fix the problem!  This is a
common problem in North American TRs with LHD steering, since the hood
release cable is quite long and cumbersome, having been intended to be
on the right side of the car.

<p> The summer 1994 issue of the 6-Pack (TR-6 club) newsletter
published a reprint of a Triumph Technical Service Bulletin dealing
with broken hood releases.  In summary, you will need to remove the
glove box, to gain access to one of the holes through the firewall.
(There are plenty of likely holes for the heater control, choke cable,
etc.)  With a long screw driver, and lots of patience, you should be
able to reach and activate the lock release mechanism.

<h4> An ounce of prevention...</h4>

<p> A smart trick to prevent future problems is recommended by TRF:
attach a wire to the release lever, and route it so you can pull it
from below to open the latch.  It helps to put a loop in the end to
pull on.  Then put the loop somewhere you can reach it from under the
car - there's a convenient hole in the TR6 bodywork to stuff it
through.

<TITLE>Gas Masks for Automotive Painting</TITLE>

<BODY BGCOLOR="c0d0c0">

<h2>Gas Masks for Automotive Painting</h2>
<i>by Scott Cypher</i>
</center>
<HR size=10>


<p>

From working with Hazardous Chemicals (Alcohols, to Freons, to Carcinogens,
to Nerve Gas), I agree with the recommendatons that are given by paint
sales representatives as to the extreme dangers involved with
automotive painting.

<ol>

<li> Full Face vs. 1/2 mask.  Gaseous vapors enter the body through
many routes.  Your eyes are particulary vulnerable.  There is a great
opportunity to scar your eyes from repeated exposure to volatile
chemicals, that make your eyes "numb" to paint fumes.  (If you wear
contacts, you could "melt" the contacts while they are in your eyes) I
know a great many car painters that never protected their eyes, and
now poo-poo full face respirators because they "don't feel it"
anymore.

<p><li> Charcoal canisters absorb many vapors, expecially H20.  Leaving
respirators in unsealed containers (i.e. not a Zip Loc baggie) does
prematurely wear out a set of chemical filters.  Yes, the true test is
inhaling above a KNOWN smelly source, and seeing is believing if you
smell it.  Do NOT use a mask that passes chemical odors.

<p><li> However, smelling it is not necessarily an indicator of bad
filters.  It could be a poorly fit, or badly sealed mask, hence the
need to keep your mask clean and in good repair. There are methods to
check mask integrity, and sealability (which I won't go into now,
emailme if you want details) when you fit up. I recommend to anyone
using a chemical mask, get the proper training on usage, from someone
familiar with working with truly hazardous/deadly chemicals.  It is
far too easy to ignore this potential that exists to "save time" or
convenience.  You might avoid acute exposure, but since many of these
chemicals and/or carcinogens are less than 30 years old, chronic (long
term) effects of repeated exposures are not documented nor studied.

</ol>

<p> Please, as someone who worked with FOOLS and was a fool for six
years, don't paint without a respirator, and don't use a respirator
without training from a certified expert.  You might not truly know,
but are you willing to risk your life?  You might have already.  Think
about it, like the GIs affected by Agent orange tests, or the atomic
bomb.  They were OK for quite awhile, but then things got worse.  Do
you want that to happen to you?  If nothing else, don't trivialize the
impact chemicals can have.  If you don't have the data to support one
view over the other, don't advocate one over other.  I would err to
the side of caution, rather than err at all.

<h2>Generator to Alternator Conversions</h2>
<i>by Jim Roberts of the Internet British-Cars list </i>
</center><br>
<HR size=10>

     I recently converted my TR4 to use an alternator rather than a
generator. This was prompted by
a severe Lucas attack wherein the voltage regulator failed, drained the
battery through the charging circuit to the back of the generator.  Mucho
smoke, big  burning-phenolic, Bakelite, and PVC stink.  After reading the
article in Feb British Cars, I decided on a Subaru alternator made by Hitachi
(Subarus are abundant in Boulder, CO).  The local Subaru repair and chop-shop
sold me a used one for $35, with a trade-in guarantee (if it don't work,
bring it back we'll give you another one).  It didn't work, but the second
one did (Hitachi Model LR160-16C).

<p>
     The mechanical work consisted of boring out the pulley (it's got a
keyway so you can't just drill it),  machining the stand-offs that fit to the
engine bracket (I could do that myself), adding a few washers to the bracket
arm, and getting a new belt (the wide belts are actually 3/4" wide but are
ordered as 7/8" belts).  At no time did I have to mess with the brackets on
the engine.

<p>
     The real pain was repairing the wiring harness that had melted the
entire length of the harness  containing the charging wires (I'm talkin' to
and from the ammeter on the dash).   I pulled the glove box and heater box
and started cutting.  Surprisingly few wires had to be completely replaced,
most were OK or could be patched.  Got it back together, with over-sized
wires where ever possible.  The Bentley manual and Subaru manual (inspected
upon purchase of the alternator) were useful here.  Bottom line, it's running
great, cost me about $60 bucks.  Now if I could only get rid of that smell.

<h2>Complete Interior Restoration</h2>

<i> by Bill Beamon, of Internet British-Cars list</i>
<br>
</center>
<HR size=10>

When I decided to restore my car's interior, I was faced with a
trade-off between cost and effort: How much you are willing to pay
someone to do all the work versus how much time and effort you are
willing to contribute yourself. With sufficient excess funds, many of
us with older British cars would probably own a different kind of
vehicle rather than be involved with the knuckle busting hassles of
keeping a vehicle roadworthy. Me? I like the involvement. Not
EVERYBODY can do it.

<p>
Such was the decision I faced when I changed the overdrive. Why not do the
interior? I always wanted tan, anyway and some repair was already in order,
as I was replacing some footwell floor panels that were rusty. And I didn't
want to spend THAT much on the interior.

<p>
So, I checked the kits. Moss had them on sale for $799. I saw one and didn't
like the quality or the color. I started looking for raw material. I found a
local place with surplus carpet, both boat (good UV resistance and wear) and
home stuff. and I found another place with surplus foam and upholstery
materials, including both boat and aviation quality vinyls (both have
excellent UV resistance) at good prices. They had some really good tan
aviation vinyl that looked and felt like leather. It was reasonable and it
matched the carpet sample I had.

<p>
Next, I looked at the interior carefully to see just how big this
project would be, anyway. As it happens, it takes a special machine to sew
vinyl material properly. Except for the seats and the door panels,
everything else was flat (okay, the door panels are flat, too, but I wanted
some padding and a pocket for maps, etc. on each; stuff that required sewing).

<p>
What I ended up doing is to have a professional do the seats and door panels
and sew some welting on the exposed edges of a couple of rugs. She also did
a new center console arm rest lid. She charged me $350 and it was well worth
it. For $100, I did the rugs and all the other flat panels on the sides,
behind the seats and in the footwells.

<p>
First, I pulled everything out and sent the seats (with old seatcovers still
on for patterns) and door panels to the upholstery lady, along with the
vinyl sample and a note as to what I wanted for the padding and pockets.

<p>
First, for the flat panels over the wheel arches, under the footwells and
against the trunk in back, I pulled off the old black vinyl to get the badly
preserved cardboard underneath. From them, I made patterns on 1/8-in
masonite, which I cut two at a time. After cutting the new panels, check
each for proper fit before attaching the vinyl. Some of the pointed parts of
mine were missing and I WAGged (okay, estimated) their shape. I drilled
holes where the screws went on the old panels. The new vinyl was attached to
the masonite with a good spray upholstery adhesive (about $8/can), leaving
about 2-in excess at the edges. V-notches were cut in the excess at the
corners and curve radius points so the overlap could be folded around back
and glued. Messy, but not a difficult job. Mark the screw holes.

<p>
My car had two overlapping rugs under each seat. I used them as patterns to
make a single rug for each side. I used a waterproof indoor/outdoor carpet
(Ozite?, about 3/16th-in thick) for a base. again, I cut the carpet material
about 3-in wider all around than the slightly undersized base, so I could
fold the edges over and glue them with the same spray adhesive. Where rug
met rug, I folded it over. Where it was a raw edge, I had her sew on a vinyl
tape trim edge. I also glued carpet to the lower door panels and up in the
footwells where the rubber kickplate was glued along the frame box.

<p>
The wheel arch areas took football-shaped pieces which I had to notch, since
the carpet didn't stretch. Holes were cut for the seatbelt attach points. It
was glued to the arch.

<p>
The area behind the seats was more carefully done, as the carpet had
to allow for the bulge and distortion caused bt the differential
"hump". The straight edge at the back will form a "V" when it conforms
to the hump, so I nibbled at the Ozite pattern till it looked right.
Then I glued the carpet, as before, except I had the lady add a vinyl
finishing edge trim, rather than folding the carpet round back and
gluing it.

<p>
Carpet for the transmission tunnel was shaped to the original carpet, except
the edges were made wider where it could slide under the rugs at each side.
The top and bottom edges got vinyl trim sewn on. I glued the carpet to the
original rubberized horsehair, or whatever the hell it is, for extra
thermal/noise insulation.

<p>
I spent some time on it, but what I did did not take special tools. The lady
who did the upholstery did an excellent job (Hattie Stump in Daytona) and it
all went together right. 

<p>Two other things: The door panels took a special
"blueboard" which has aluminum foil on one side for water resistance. Hattie
supplied that. And a vinyl/plastic spray paint the upholsterers and autobody
people use was used to color the console and radio panel to match the seats.
And I painted the weatherstripping aroud the doors. I kept the dash, the top
door trim panels, and the vinyl strip around the back of the cockpit black,
as the black top was new. I don't know if Hattie would do it again for that
price; this was a couple of years ago.

<p>
Hope this helps.

<TITLE>Brake Bleeding</TITLE>

<h2>Brake Bleeding</h2>
<i>by Ken Streeter,<br>
with input from Scott Fisher, Greg Meboe, and Gary Schneider.</i>
</center>
<HR size=10>


<h3> Special hints on bleeding the brakes on your car. </h3>

For a description of the basic procedure, you would be best off
checking your shop manual.  However, if you are having problems with
bleeding your brakes, the below hints may help!

<p>
<h4> Hints on Brake Bleeding. </h4>

<ul>
<li><b> Getting no fluid out of a bleed nipple </b>

<p>This is going to sound really simple, but is the master cylinder
topped off with fluid?  It is is surprisingly easy to forget to do
this!

<p>If you have fluid in the master cylinder, try removing the bleed
nipple entirely and see if you get flow under pedal pressure.

<ul>

<li> Case 1. Fluid squirts from line: You have a blocked or corroded
bleed nipple, which will need to be cleaned out with an awl or similar
pointy tool, or replaced.

<li> Case 2. Still no fluid: Unscrew the hose at the car side so it
doesn't twist or kink, and see if you get a stream of fluid under
pedal pressure.  When testing, have a wadded rag over the end of line
to catch the fluid - the pressure is great enough to spray the other
side of the garage, get in your eye or on your paint, etc.  Also,
press on the pedal about a dozen times when doing this; if the fluid
all drained out of the system before you started bleeding the brakes,
(if you overhauled some part of the brake system) it can take a
surprisingly long time to pump fluid throughout the system.

</ul>
</ul>

<li><b>Soft brakes even after bleeding</b>
<ul>
You probably still have air in the system somewhere. If you have had
parts of the brake system disconnected, ensure that the bleed nipples
for the wheel cylinders and front calipers are at the
<i><b>top</b></i>, so that the air can all escape during the bleeding
process.  (The air bubbles rise to the top.)

</ul>
<li><b>Front or Rear brakes bled, but no luck at other end</b>
<ul>
<p> Your Pressure Differential Warning Actuator (PDWA) may be tripped.
This would close off either the front or back hydraulic circuit and
leave the other functional.  It's easy to trip this when bleeding the
brakes.  If this is your problem, the brake warning light will glow
brightly when the ignition is turned on.  (Unless of course your brake
warning light switch or bulb is not working...)

<p> If the PDWA is tripped, the shuttle in the PDWA can be re-centered
by the following procedure:

<ul>

<li>Open a bleed nipple on the brake system that does work.

<li>With the ignition switch on, observe the brake warning light.
Press on the brake pedal carefully and watch the light.  It and the
oil pressure light should dim as the switch centralizes.  You should
also hear a click.  Do not press too much or too fast, or the switch
goes past center.  Just keep repeating the proceedure until it works,
varying the wheel/brake circut until you figure out which way the
switch was on.
</ul>

If the above absolutely does not work for you, the PDWA can be
mechanically recentered, but is more difficult, involving partial
disassembly of the PDWA unit.
</ul>
<li><b>You have tried all of the above, but still have no luck!</b>

<p>  You may want to invest in a simple vacuum pump to bleed the
brakes.  One such tool, available for about $20 at Walmart is the 
"Mityvac Vacuum Pump / Brake Bleeding Kit."  The pump is applied to a
bleed nipple, and pulls fluid through the system.  This technique has
the advantage that the master cylinder does not require "priming" in
order to get the bleeding process started.

<p>In my experience, the vacuum pump does a good job and is a
one-person operation (with the exception of checking the results in
the "conventional" fashion).  As always, your mileage may vary.

<h2>Removing Brake Drum Screws</h2>
<a href="mailto:britcars@hpfckjs.fc.hp.com"><i>by Kevin Spooner<br></i></a>
</center>
<HR size=10>

I recently learned a neat trick for removing the small screws holding
the brake drum to the hub.  It is going to be hard to explain in words
(a demonstration is worth 10M words).

<p>

You need a heavy sharp pointed punch, a good quality center punch will
work.  Place the tip of the punch in the screw slot near one end and
angled so that the direction of force when it is hit will loosen the
screw.  Now hit the punch lightly with a hammer to set it so it won't
slip when you realy beat it.  Once it is set you can wail on the punch
and the screw will start to turn.  Once it starts to turn you can
remove it with a screw driver because you have only damaged a small
part of the slot.  You can even reuse the screw.  This avoids any
potential damage to the seals, hubs, etc. from heating, and is a lot
faster than drilling.

<h2>Brake Fluids</h2>
<i>by Kenneth Streeter,<br>
with input from various sources</i>
</center>
<HR size=10>

<p>

The discussion of whether to use DOT3, DOT4, or DOT5 brake fluids in
Triumphs is a common topic.  The information provided herein should
help you to decide which of these brake fluids are best for you and
your car.  I would point out that I am not an "expert" on the topic,
but have collected the experiences of many other Triumph enthusiasts,
as well as opinions of professional auto restorers.  I have tempered
my findings with my own experiences and opinions.

<p>

I would also take this opportunity to point out that the <b>type</b>
of brake fluid used in your car is far less important, from a safety
standpoint, than a properly functioning braking system.  If you are
working on your own brakes, be extremely careful, don't skimp on poor
components, and bleed the brake system very carefully and thoroughly.

<p>

<h4>DOT3</h4>
<ul>
DOT3 brake fluid is the "conventional" brake fluid used in most
vehicles.  One of the most familiar brands is "Prestone."

<p><b>Advantages:</b>
<ul>
<li> DOT3 fluid is inexpensive, and available at most gas stations,
department stores, and any auto parts store.
</ul>

<b>Disadvantages:</b>
<ul><li> DOT3 fluid eats paint!

<li> DOT3 fluid absorbs water very readily.  (This is often referred
to as being hydroscopic.)  As such, once a container of DOT3 has been
opened, it should not be stored for periods much longer than a week
before use.

<li> Since DOT3 fluid absorbs water, any moisture absorbed by the
fluid can encourage corrosion in the brake lines and cylinders.
</ul>
</ul>

<h4>DOT4</h4>
<ul>

DOT4 brake fluid is the brake fluid suggested for use in late model
Triumphs.  The most familiar brand is "Castrol GT-LMA"

<p><b>Advantages:</b>
<ul>
<li> DOT4 fluid is available at most auto parts stores, and at some
(but not all) gas stations or department stores.

<li>DOT4 fluid does not absorb water as readily as DOT3 fluid.

<li>DOT4 fluid has a higher boiling point than DOT3 fluid, making it
more suitable for high performance applications where the brake
systems are expected to get hot.

</ul>

<b>Disadvantages:</b>
<ul>
<li>DOT4 fluid eats paint!  Small leaks around the master cylinder
will eventually dissolve away the paint on your bodywork in the
general vicinity of the leak, and then give rust a chance to attack
the body of your car!

<li> DOT4 fluid is generally about 50% more expensive than DOT3 fluid.

<li> Since DOT4 fluid still absorbs some water, any moisture absorbed
by the fluid can encourage corrosion in the brake lines and cylinders.
</ul>
</ul>

<h4>DOT5</h4>
<ul>

DOT5 brake fluid is also known as "silicone" brake fluid.
<p>
<b>Advantages:</b>

<ul> 
<li>DOT5 doesn't eat paint.

<li>DOT5 does not absorb water and may be useful where water
absorption is a problem.

<li>DOT5 is compatible with all rubber formulations. (See more on this
under disadvantages, below.)
</ul>

<b>Disadvantages:</b>

<ul>
<li>DOT5 does NOT mix with DOT3 or DOT4.  Most reported problems with DOT5
are probably due to some degree of mixing with other fluid types.  The
best way to convert to DOT5 is to totally rebuild the hydraulic system.

<li>
Reports of DOT5 causing premature failure of rubber brake parts were
more common with early DOT5 formulations.  This is thought to be due
to improper addition of swelling agents and has been fixed in recent
formulations.

<li> Since DOT5 does not absorb water, any moisture in the hydraulic
system will "puddle" in one place.  This can cause localized corrosion
in the hydraulics.

<li> Careful bleeding is required to get all of the air out of the
system.  Small bubbles can form in the fluid that will form large
bubbles over time.  It may be necessary to do a series of bleeds.

<li> DOT5 is slightly compressible (giving a very slightly soft
pedal), and has a lower boiling point than DOT4.

<li> DOT5 is about twice as expensive as DOT4 fluid.  It is also
difficult to find, generally only available at selected auto parts stores.

</ul>
</ul>

<h2>General Recommendations:</h2>

<ol> 

<li> If it works for you, use it.  You won't hurt anything if you
do the conversion correctly.

<li> If you have a brake system that doesn't leak or show any other
signs of failure, but has old seals in it, don't change fluid types as
a result of reading this article.  If it isn't broken, don't "fix" it
-- you may simply break it instead!

<li> DOT3 is an adequate brake fluid for use in Triumphs, although
it is rarely preferred.

<li> DOT4 fluid, for a slight increase in cost, will give
significantly increased resistance to moisture absorption, thus
decreasing the likelihood of corrosion compared to DOT3.

<li> DOT4 fluid has a higher boiling point than DOT3, making it
preferable for high performance uses such as racing, autocross, or
excessive use of the brakes in mountainous areas.

<li> DOT5 is a good choice for the weekend driver/show car.  It
doesn't absorb water and it doesn't eat paint.  One caveat is that
because it doesn't absorb water, water that gets in the system will
tend to collect at low points.  In this scenario, it would actually be
promoting corrosion! 

<li> DOT5 is probably not the thing to use in your race car although
it is rated to stand up to the heat generated during racing
conditions.  The reason for this recommendation is the difficult
bleeding mentioned above.

<li> Flushing of the brake system every couple years to remove any
absorbed or collected water is probably a good idea to prevent
corrosion, regardless of the type of brake fluid used.

<li>As always, your experiences may vary.

<a name=basic>Basic Purposes of Lubricants:</a>
</h3>

<ol>
<li>Separate Surfaces

<li>Removal of Heat (up to 1/3 of combustion heat may be transferred
away from engine by oil)

<li>Containment of Contaminants

<li>Sealing
</ul>

<hr width=75%>
<h3>
<a name=refining>Refining of Crude Oil into a Lubricant</a>
</h3>

<ol>
<li>Refining is the process of removing all the bad stuff.  The bad
stuff is primarily oxidants.  The result of oxidation of the
lubricant is first varnish, then it polymerizes into 'goop'.  (SA
grade oil will goop in 5000 miles)

<li>Add Oxidation Inhibitors.

<li>Add Detergents.  Reacts with oxidized material.  Helps keep piston
rings clean (Rings are quite hot).  Leaves an ash residue when
combusted.  Not used in airplane engine oils.

<p>In an automobile engine, the piston speed (RPM) and therefore piston
tempature changes greatly and quickly.  The tempature differences
allow the ash to break up into small deposits, and go into the
exhaust or blow by the rings into the crankcase and lubricants.

<p>In an airplane engine, the pistons are operating continuously at a
single speed, and therefore do not go through heating and cooling
cycles, so the ash deposits would not break up.

<p>Generally, for automobile motor, lubricant is limited to 1% ash
content.  2% ash is asking for trouble (although 2% may be okay for a
diesel engine).  Red Line Racing Oils are low detergent.  Detergent
is left out because ash can cause detonation.

<li>Add Dispersants.  Dispersants are ashless detergents, which
complex low temperature combustion byproducts.  Dispersants keep
partially oxidized particles in suspension, and help keep the engine
clean.  Dispersants can come apart in exterme high temperature.

<p>Average oil filter is a 20 micron filter.  Could go down to 1 micron.
Stuff that dispersant holds in suspension is much less than microns
(it is measured at the molecular level, in Angstroms).  At proper
temperature, the stuff is not really a problem.  Most of the stuff is
Aromatic Hydrocarbons, boil around 180 F, and leave through crankcase
ventilation.

<li>Add Anti-Wear additives.  These additives chemically react with
iron to prevent welding of moving metal surfaces.  Most common
additive is ZDP, or Zinc Dialkyl Dithio Phosphate.  What happens is
essentially a chemical polishing of the metal surface.

<p>The surface gets plated with either Iron Phosphate or Iron Sulfate,
both of which are softer than the base Iron.  This chemical reaction
occurs in the 300 to 400 F range, and the Zinc is a temperature
controlling carrier (controls the temperature at which the reaction
occurs.  When the two metal surfaces come in contact, a small amount
of the surface plating is 'scraped' off of the surface.  This is
replenished by more ZDP contact with the metal.  This action prevents
the metals welding through heat generated by high friction contact.
The ZDP in the lubricant may last up to 20,000 miles.

<li>Add AntiFoam.  Anti foam is a surfactant, usually silicone, and
weakens bubbles.

<h3>
<a name=synthetics>Synthetic Lubricants</a>
</h3>
<p>Major Difference is synthetics are not petroleum based.

<p>Key Advantages:

<ol>
<li> Volitility: Synthetics do not evaporate as readilly as Petro.
based.  Usually, synthetic lubricants are based on 1 molecule with a
flat distillation curve.

<li> Better viscosity versus temperature behavior: a)Thin less as they
get hot, b) Thicken less as they cool

<li> better oxidation stability

<li> Synthetic Oil has 10% better heat transfer than Petrolium based
lubricants.
</ol>

<h3><a name=mobil1>Differences between RedLine and Mobil 1</a></h3>

Redline starts out with a Jet Turbine Oil Base, which has a higher
level of thermal stability, and they have to add less friction
modifiers.

<p>Red Line has 1/2 Cf of Mobil 1.

<p>Viscosity vs. Sheer strength are similar, but Red Line handles high
loads better.

<p>Can gain 1 - 2% more power by going to a lower viscosity oil.

<p>There is no longer a problem with synthetic lubricants eating away
seals.  (Original Mobil-1, no longer available, left out seal-swell).

<p>Red Line blends its lubricants, but does not manufacture the
synthetic bases.

<h3>
<a name=vi>Viscosity Index Improvers</a>
</h3>

<p><b>Rubber and Plastic Polymers
</b>

<p>Start with a base of straight weight Oil.  Then add a polymeric
thickener. When hot, the long polymer chain is really moving around,
causing the oil to flow less.  When cold, the polymers stick to each
other, essentially comming out of suspension.  The polymers are
stable up to about 210 F, where they start to break up.  The
drawbacks to VI polymers is that they can cause engine dirt because
of their low shear strength.

<p>What this chart shows is that a straight oil has the same viscosity
regardless of shear rate.  However, as the shear rate increases, the
shear breaks down the VI polymers, and multigrade oils have less
actual viscosity at the localized high shear rate area.

<p>The weak link is the rod bearings and Cam, in terms of rate of shear.
There is less friction at the piston rings.  Anti Wear is much more
important at the cam.

<h3>
<a name=slick50>Slick 50</a>
</h3>
<p>Lubrisol, Dema Elgin, a Ford Engineer all agree that it does not do
anything.  According to Roy, to plate teflon on a metal needs an
absolutely clean, high temperature surface, in a vacuum.  Therefore,
it is highly unlikely that the teflon in slick 50 actually plates the
metal surface.  In addition the Cf (Coefficient of friction) of
Teflon is actually greater than the Cf of an Oil Film on Steel. Also,
if the teflon did fill in 'craters' in the steel, than it would fill
in the honing of the cylinder, and the oil would not seal the piston
rings.

<a name=coolants>Coolants</a>
</h3>

<p>Red Line Water Wetter is a surfactant - reduces the surface tension
of the water.  Allows the water to more intimately contact metal.
When the water boils, the surfactant makes smaller bubbles, which
makes it easier for the bubble to be pushed away from the metal
surface, and allow more water to contact the metal.

<p>Water Wetter has a high Ph, but also has silicates, so it can be used
in aluminium radiators.  However, if left for a long time, the
silicates are depleted, and damage will occur.  The liquid versions
of Water Wetter do not have phosphates.

<p>Discovered by Roy Howell.  Some engineers were begging Roy to develop
a corrosion inhibitor to add to straight water for racers, since
racers rarely use AntiFreeze.  He did some work, developed  Water
Wetter simply as a corrosion inhibitor, and gave it to Huffaker.
Huffaker immediately noticed lower operating temperatures, and Roy
started to investigate why.

<p>You *can* cool an engine too much.  The ideal temperature for coolant
is 190 F.

<p>AntiFreeze has 1/4 heat transfer capability of straight water.

<h3>
<a name=atf>Automatic Transmission Fluid</a>

<p>Type F - no Friction Modifiers.  Ford originally did not want slip in

<p>Dexron - GM - less Cf than Type F

<p>Now Mercon and Dexron II are almost identical.



<hr width=75%>
<h3>
<a name=gear-oil>Gear Oil</a>
</h3>
<p>Gear oil viscosity is measured at 150 F vs. 210 F for motor oil.
Therefore, 40 W motor oil is the same as 95 W gear oil.

<p>Gear oil is acidic, motor oil is alkiline.  Gear oil needs very high
wear protection - Extreme Pressure (marked as EP).  Therefore, it
has a very high sulfer and phospor content.  Sulfur and Phosphate
reactions start at a lower temperature, and Gear Oil has much more
additive than motor oil.  This additive is corrosive to copper
bearings and bronze synchro rings.

<p>Positraction additives are Friction modifiers - make the base oil much
more slippery.  They coat the metal surfaces, and prevent the
stick/slip mode of operation, preventing shudder, and causes smoother
take-up.  Friction Modifiers may detract from EP characteristics.

<p>Friction modifiers cause smooth take-up of Limited slip units.  For
track racing, FM is probably undesireable, and immediate take-up is
more important.  For Street, FM is usually reccomended for more
comfortable operation.

<p>Gear oils decompose at lower temperature, usually 250 F.

<p>Gear Lubrication Ratings
<pre>
	GL-1	No Additives
	GL-2
	GL-3
	GL-4	Suitable for light duty hypoid sets
	GL-5	Has lots of sulfer - Heavy duty hypoids
	GL-6
</pre>
<p>Hypoid type gear sets have a sliding rather than rolling action, and
therefore require much greater wear protection.

<p>GL-5 Should be used in rear differentials.

<p>GL-6 is a heavier weight GL-5.  Used for heavy trucks and Tow
Vehicles.

<p>Red Line 75 - 90 NS has No Slip, i.e., no Friction Modifiers.<br>
Red Line 75 - 90 has Friction Modifiers.

<p>Gear mesh in Gears litterally chops up and cuts apart the long
polymer chains of Viscosity Index improvers.

<p>Smell of gear oil is from high sulfur content.

<p>Quaiff Differential is a worm gear, and needs a very slippery oil.

<h3>
<a name=grease>Bearing Grease</a>
</h3>
<p>Dont fully pack the hub, as it will just overflow.  As it turns, the

<h3>
<a name=cv-joint>Molybdenum in CV Joint Lube</a>
</h3>
<p>Molybdenum in CV joint lube is important in high-angle CV joints,
especially off-road applications, where wet lube may be thrown from

<p>Castrol R is Castor Oil based.  Good lubrication, but dirty.

<p>Methyl Lead goes to intake faster than Ethyl Lead.  EPA now has
authority to outlaw lead entirely.

<p>Marvel Mystery Oil and Rislone are surfactants and penetrants.

<p>Neo and other Zero Weight oils are actually 0W - 20 multigrade oils,
so as soon as they warm up, they are effectively 20 weight oil.

<h3>
<a name=recommendations>Recommendations</a>
</h3>

<p>Red Line does not recommend DOT-5 Brake Fluid for racing.  More
compressible at temperature.

<p>Should not use silicone (DOT-5) brake fluid in ABS systems, as
there is little to no lubrication for ABS pump.

<p>Red Line recommends breaking in an engine on straight viscosity oil.

<p>Red Line does not recommend mixing race oil with regular oil.

<p>Can use Race Oil for 3 to 4 Events.

<TITLE>Radiator Removal on a TR6</TITLE>
</head>
<BODY BGCOLOR="c0d0c0">


<HR size=10>
<center>
<h2>Radiator Removal on a TR6</h2>
<i>by Ken Streeter<br>
15 May 1995</i>
</center>
<HR size=10>

Removing the radiator on the TR6 is a relatively easy task, and is
required for a number of other maintenance tasks such as replacement
of the anti-roll bar.  The below summary is similar to what would be
found in the shop manual, but with some addded notes/precautions.

<h4> Step by Step Radiator Removal</h4>
<ol>

<li> <b> Place front end of the car on jackstands.</b> Although this
step is not strictly required, I found it a practical necessity in
order to be able to loosen the bottom radiator hose, particularly with
a drain pan placed underneath the car.

<li> <b> Remove bottom radiator hose from radiator.</b> This will
probably be the most difficult part of the entire radiator removal.
It is typically quite stuck (if it wasn't leaking), and is in an
awkward spot.  Be sure to have a drain pan with a 8 quart capacity
under the hose before you take it off!

<li> <b> Remove top hose from radiator.</b> If you got the bottom hose
off, this one should be a breeze!

<li> <b> Loosen nut/bolt holding radiator stays at chassis end.</b>
These nut/bolt pairs only need to be loosened enough to allow the
radiator stay bracket to pivot on this bolt.  These are often rusted
on quite securely.

<li> <b> Remove nuts attaching radiator stays to radiator.</b>  No
real surprises here, although later models will require first removing
the charcoal canister on the passenger side.  The charcoal canister
can be removed from the canister bracket after loosening the strap.

<li> <b> Rotate radiator stays off of and away from the radiator. </b>

<li> <b> Remove nut, lockwasher, and spacer from lower radiator
mounting bolts. </b> On later models, the anti-runon valve will need
to be removed from the charcoal canister bracket in order to gain
access to the lower radiator bolt on the passenger side.  (The
anti-runon valve is removed from the bracket by rotating it 45
degrees, and lifting it out.)  After removing the nut, lockwasher, and
spacer from the passenger side radiator, the charcoal canister bracket
is free to be removed.

<li> <b> Lift radiator out of the car.</b>  Be careful not to whack
the radiator against the fan when lifting it out.  The fins are
easily bent!  Bent fins can be easily straightened out with a small
screwdriver, good lighting, and a lot of patience!

<TITLE>Leaking Water Pump</TITLE>

<center>
<h2>Leaking Water Pump</h2>
<i>by Ken Streeter,<br>
with input from various sources</i>
</center>
<HR size=10>

If the water pump is starting to go bad, there is a weep hole on the
underside of the water pump, that will let coolant drip out, as an
early warning signal that your pump might be bad.  (It is intended to 
let excess lubricant from the bearings drip
out rather than get forced past the seal into the coolant, and also let
coolant drip out when the seal goes bad rather than contaminate the
lubricant in the bearings. )
 
<p> If coolant is leaking from this hole, the water pump is starting
to show signs of wear.  In some cases, the pump will slowly weep on
the first few runs after sitting for a while (months) and then stop.
If your car is a daily driver and its weeping, then I suggest replacing
first off.  If you just brought it out of winter storage, watch your
fluid levels, engine temp, and the rate of the leak for about a week
of running.  If it doesn't stop, then replace.  Don't go any longer,
the pump might sieze or fail!!!

<p> An additional check for water pump condition is to remove the belt
and jiggle the rotor; too much radial play points to a bad bearing.
New water pumps are not too expensive, and fairly easy to install.  It is
generally simpler to buy a new (or rebuilt) pump assembly than to try
to repair an existing pump.

<h2>The Triumph TR6 Engine Guidelines</h2>
<i> by Mark Bradakis<br>
September 1989</i>
</center>
<HR size=10>

Squeezing a few more horsepower out of the TR6 engine is a perennial
question among TR6 owners, particularly when considering the rebuild
of a tired engine.  This page is intended to provide some
information, to help guide you in deciding what, if any, engine
modifications make the most sense for your driving style and your TR6.

<p>
For those of you who do not read rec.autos.tech, I am in the process of
telling everything I know about Triumphs.  Here's the first article.

<p>This is the first in a series (2 or 3 more?) of articles on some basic stuff
one can do to get more grunt out of a Triumph straight 6 engine.  Hopefully I
will remember to use "Triumph" in the keywords so those of you who give
neither diddly nor squat about such drivel can kill the probably much too
lengthy notes.  Those of you who ARE interested would do well to have the
following on hand before planning any serious work:

<ul>
<li> Bentley service manual for appropriate model

<li> Competition Preparation Handbook, again as appropriate.  Somewhat out of date
  but always popular.  Still full of good advice and details of some stuff.

<li> Catalogs, from places like The Roadster Factory, Moss, Victoria British.
  These cover general type parts and supplies for the various models.  If
  in need of addresses, I have them available.

<li> Specialty catalogs:
<pre>
         British Frame and Engine
         4831 Ryland Avenue
         Temple City, CA 91780
</pre>
<p>
     Owner Ken Gallanders drag races a TR3 from what I hear.  He carries
     mostly TR3-4 oriented stuff, some six cylinder items.  He is one USA
     source of parts from
<pre>
         Racestorations
         Sanders Road
         Gainsborough, Lincs. DN21 1Rz
         England
</pre>
<p>
     Probably the best TR oriented performance catalog is the one from

<pre>
        Triumph Tune
        22-28 Manor Road
        Richmond, Surrey
        England TW9 1YB
</pre>

<li> If racing, pertinant rules for sanctioning body and class.

<li> One more item I was going to mention, but I seem to have
misplaced the address.  Some fellow recently had an advert in the back
of "The English Channel", the newsletter of the Vintage Triumph
Register. He was selling a booklet on TR6 performance, giving a
listing of parts, Weber carb settings and so forth, similar to what I
plan on dosing out here.  He was charging $15, my stuff is free.  If
that bothers your conscience, donate some bucks to the alternative
radio station closest to you, and we'll call it even.  Soliciting
funds for the Fat Chance Tool Procurement Fund over the net would
probably get me killed.  Anyway, I will probably get the booklet
myself, just to see what he says.  I will post the address in a later
note.



<h3>Basic info about the Triumph six cylinder engine</h3>

<p>
The Triumph 6 is a cast iron block, cast iron head pushrod engine of 2
or 2.5 liter displacement.  The 2 liter (1998cc) engine was found in
the GT6, as well as the Triumph 2000 sedan.  An earlier version of
1600 cc or so was fitted to the Vitesse, I believe.  This 2 liter 6
has a bore of 2.94 inches and a stroke of 2.992 inches.  Basically
square.  The 2.5 liter engine, actually 2498cc, uses the same bore but
increases the stroke three quarters of inch to 3.74 inches.  The early
TR-250 and TR5 cars even used the same block as the GT6, but later the
larger displacement cars got a slightly different block with a bit
more clearence at the bottom for the crank throws.

<p>The early GT6 Mark I engine (66-68) had a head with pushrod guides being
pressed in tubes, while later cars of both displacements used the same head
casting with integral guides.  In the long stroke motor the head was used as
cast, but the 2 liter got it trimmed down to maintain good compression.
[Actually some early cars had different port spacing than later cars.]  This
will be covered in more detail in the section on heads and intake
systems.

<p>Rather than write a lot of confusing numbers, here's a chart in
which all the confusing numbers are well organized.  I will use the US
of A market and model designations and specs unless noted.


<pre>
           GT6 Mk. I   GT6+   GT6 Mk. III    TR250      TR6a     TR6b

Years      66-68      69-70       71-73       68       69-73     74-76
disp.      1998       1998        1998       2498      2498      2498
stroke     2.992      2.992       2.992      3.74      3.74      3.74
CR         8.5:1      9.25:1      9.25:1     8.5:1     8.5:1     7.75:1
bhp        95@5000    95@4700    95@4700   111@4500  104@4500   101@4900
torque    117@3000   117@3400   117@3400   152@3000  142@3000   128@3000
</pre>

<p>
There is some discrepency as to when the low-compression TR6 came about, and
what the actual power output is for that motor.  Maybe I should have thrown in
the specs for 9.5:1 injected TR6 just for fun.  Anyway, later cars (75-76?) had
106 bhp but same torque and compression.  Look at page 43 of the Bentleys for
some further info about which year did what.  72 and 73 TR6s were actually
different enough to warrant their own column above, but the chart is wide
enough as is.  Also, the GT6 Mk. III was manufactured up until december of 73,
so you may actually come across a car labeled as a '74 model year car.

<p>
The remainder of the articles will consist of discussions on the various head
configurations, intake and exhaust systems, camshaft specs and tuning
considerations.  I probably won't belabor you just yet with any chassis
preparation stuff.

<p> So given that basic info, send away for some catalogs and think
about what sort of performance and usage you REALLY want out of the
car.  Feel free to email or post any specific questions, comments or
complaints.  The chances of me being always right are pretty slim, as
you might surmise.  I never worked for Triumph, I don't have Kas
Kastner's autograph and I only talked to Mike Cook once years ago
about Rotoflex couplings for the GT6.

<h2>Oil Additives</h2>
</center>
<HR size=10>

<h1>Snake Oil!</h1>
<h4>Is That Additive Really A Negative?</h4>
<h4>Article and Photos by Fred Rau,<br>
Originally printed in <i>Road Rider</i> magazine, now known as 
<i>Motorcycle Consumer News</i>, August 1992</i></h4>

     <p>Information for this article was compiled from reports and
studies by the University of Nevada Desert Research Center, DuPont
Chemical Company, Avco Lycoming (aircraft engine manufacturers),
North Dakota State University, Briggs and Stratton (engine
manufacturers), the University of Utah Engineering Experiment
Station, California State Polytechnic College and the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration's Lewis Research Center.

    <p> Road Rider does not claim to have all the answers. Nor do we
care to presume to tell you what to do. We have simply tried to
provide you with all the information we were able to dredge up on
this subject, in hopes it will help you in making your own, informed
decision.

 <h4>You Can't Tell The Players Without A Program </h4>

   <p>  On starting this project, we set out to find as many different
oil additives as we could buy. That turned out to be a mistake. There
were simply too many available! At the very first auto parts store
we visited, there were over two dozen different brand names
available. By the end of the day, we had identified over 40 different
oil additives for sale and realized we needed to rethink our strategy.

   <p>  First of all, we found that if we checked the fine print on the
packages, quite a number of the additives came from the same
manufacturer. Also, we began to notice that the additives could be
separated into basic "groups" that seemed to carry approximately the
same ingredients and the same promises.

  <p>   In the end, we divided our additives into four basic groups and
purchased at   least three brands from three different manufacturers
for each group. We defined our four groups this way:
<ol>

<li>  Products that seemed to be nothing more than regular
50-rated engine oil (including standard additives) with PTFE (Teflon
TM) added.

<li>  Products that seemed to be nothing more than regular
50-rated engine oil (including standard additives) with zinc
dialkyldithiophosphate added.

<li> Products containing (as near as we could determine) much
the same additives as are already found in most major brands of
engine oil, though in different quantities and combinations.

<li> Products made up primarily of solvents and/or detergents.
</ol>

   <p>  There may be some differences in chemical makeup within groups,
but that is impossible to tell since the additive manufacturers
refuse to list the specific ingredients of their products. We will
discuss each group individually.

<h4> The PTFE Mystery </h4>

<p>Currently, the most common and popular oil additives on the market
are those that contain PTFE powders suspended in a regular,
over-the-counter type, 50-rated petroleum or synthetic engine oil.
PTFE is the common abbreviation used for Polytetrafloeraethylene,
more commonly known by the tradename "Teflon," which is a registered
trademark of the DuPont Chemical Corporation.   Among those oil
additives we have identified as containing PTFE are: Slick 50, Liquid
Ring, Lubrilon, Microlon, Matrix, Petrolon (same company as Slick
50), QMl, and T-Plus (K-Mart). There are probably many more names in
use on many more products using PTFE. We have found that oil additive
makers like to market their products under a multitude of "private
brand" names.
    <p> While some of these products may contain other additives in
addition to PTFE, all seem to rely on the PTFE as their primary
active ingredient and all, without exception, do not list what other
ingredients they may contain.
    <p> Though they have gained rather wide acceptance among the
motoring public, oil additives containing PTFE have also garnered
their share of critics among experts in the field of lubrication. By
far the most damning testimonial against these products originally
came from the DuPont Chemical Corporation, inventor of PTFE and
holder of the patents and trademarks for Teflon. In a statement
issued about ten years ago, DuPont's Fluoropolymers   Division
Product Specialist, J.F. Imbalzano said, "Teflon is not useful as an
ingredient in oil additives or oils used for internal combustion
engines."
    <p> At the time, DuPont threatened legal action against anyone who
used the name "Teflon" on any oil product destined for use in an
internal combustion engine, and refused to sell its PTFE powders to
any one who intended to use them for such purposes.
   <p>  After a flurry of lawsuits from oil additive makers, claiming
DuPont could not prove that PTFE was harmful to engines, DuPont was
forced to once again begin selling their PTFE to the additive
producers. The additive makers like to claim this is some kind of
"proof' that their products work, when in fact it is nothing more
than proof that the American legal ethic of "innocent until proven
guilty" is still alive and well. The decision against Dupont involved
what is called "restraint of trade." You can't refuse to sell a
product to someone just because there is a possibility they might use
it for a purpose other than what you intended it for.
    <p> It should be noted that DuPont's official position on the use of
PTFE in engine oils remains carefully aloof and non-commital, for
obvious legal reasons. DuPont states that though they sell PTFE to
oil additive producers, they have "no proof of the validity of the
additive makers' claims." They further state that they have "no
knowledge of any advantage gained through the use of PTFE in engine
oil."
    <p> Fear of potential lawsuits for possible misrepresentation of a
product seem to  run much higher among those with the most to lose.
    <p> After DuPont's decision and attempt to halt the use of PTFE in
engine oils, several of the oil additive companies simply went
elsewhere for their PTFE powders, such as purchasing them in other
countries. In some cases, they disguise or hype their PTFE as being
something different or special by listing it under one of their own
tradenames. That doesn't change the fact that it is still PTFE.
   <p>  In addition, there is some evidence that certain supplies of
PTFE powders (from manufacturers other than DuPont) are of a cruder
version than the original, made with larger sized flakes that are
more likely to "settle out" in your oil or clog up your filters. One
fairly good indication that a product contains this kind of PTFE is
if the instructions for its use advise you to "shake well before
using." It only stands to reason that if the manufacturer knows the
solids in his product will settle to the bottom of a container while
sitting on a shelf, the same thing is going to happen inside your
engine when it is left idle for any period of time.
     <p>The problem with putting PTFE in your oil, as explained to us by
several industry experts, is that PTFE is a solid. The additive
makers claim this solid "coats" the moving parts in an engine (though
that is far from being scientifically proven).  Slick 50 is currently
both the most aggressive advertiser and the most popular seller, with
claims of over 14 million treatments sold.  However, such solids seem
even more inclined to coat non-moving parts, like oil passages and
filters. After all, if it can build up under the pressures and
friction exerted on a cylinder wall, then it stands to reason it
should build up even better in places with low pressures and
virtually no friction.
    <p> This conclusion seems to be borne out by tests on oil additives
containing PTFE conducted by the NASA Lewis Research Center, which
said in their report, "In the types of bearing surface contact we
have looked at, we have seen no benefit. In some cases we have seen
detrimental effect. The solids in the oil tend to accumulate at
inlets and act as a dam, which simply blocks the oil from entering.
Instead of helping, it is actually depriving parts of lubricant."
    <p> Remember, PTFE in oil additives is a suspended solid. Now think
about why you have an oil filter on your engine. To remove suspended
solids, right? Right. Therefore it would seem to follow that if your
oil filter is doing its job, it will collect as much of the PTFE as
possible, as quickly as possible. This can result in a clogged oil
filter and decreased oil pressure throughout your engine.
    <p> In response to our inquiries about this sort of problem, several
of the PTFE pushers responded that their particulates were of a
sub-micron size, capable of passing through an ordinary oil filter
unrestricted. This certainly sounds good, and may in some cases
actually be true, but it makes little difference when you know the
rest of the story. You see, PTFE has other qualities besides being a
friction reducer:  It expands radically when exposed to heat. So even
if those particles are small enough to pass through your filter when
you purchase them, they very well may not be when your engine reaches
normal operating temperature.
    <p> Here again, the' scientific evidence seems to support this, as
in tests conducted by researchers at the University of Utah
Engineering Experiment Station involving Petrolon additive with PTFE.
     <p>The Petrolon test report states, "There was a pressure drop
across the oil filter resulting from possible clogging of small
passageways." In addition, oil analysis showed that iron
contamination doubled after using the treatment, indicating that
engine wear didn't go down - it appeared to shoot up.
     <p>This particular report was paid for by Petrolon (marketers of
Slick 50), and was not all bad news for their products. The tests,
conducted on a Chevrolet six-cylinder automobile engine, showed that
after treatment with the PTFE additive the test engine's friction was
reduced by 13.1 per- cent. Also, output horsepower increased from 5.3
percent to 8.1 percent, and fuel economy improved from 11.8 percent
under light load to 3.8 percent under heavy load.
    <p> These are the kind of results an aggressive marketing company
like Petrolon can really sink their teeth into. If we only reported
the results in the last paragraph to you, you'd be inclined to think
Slick 50 was indeed a magic engine elixir. What you have to keep in
mind is that often times the benefits (like increased horse power and
fuel economy) may be out weighed by some serious drawbacks (like the
indications of reduced oil pressure and increased wear rate).

<h4>The Plot Thickens</h4>
     <p>Just as we were about to go to press with this article, we were
contacted by the public relations firm of Trent and Company, an
outfit with a prestigious address in the Empire State Building, New
York. They advised us they were working for a company called QMI out
of Lakeland, Florida, that was marketing a "technological
breakthrough" product in oil additives. Naturally, we asked them to
send us all pertinent information,  including any testing and
research data.
    <p> What we got was pretty much what we expected. QMI's oil
additive, according to their press release, uses "ten times more PTFE
resins than its closest competitor." Using the "unique SX-6000
formula," they say they are the only company to use "aqueous
dispersion resin which means the microns (particle sizes) are
extensively smaller and can penetrate tight areas." This, they claim,
"completely eliminates the problem of clogged filters and oil
passages."
    <p> Intrigued by their press release, we set up a telephone
interview with their Vice- President of Technical Services, Mr. Owen
Heatwole. Mr. Heatwole's name was immediately recognized by us as one
that had popped in earlier research of this subject as a former
employee of Petrolon, a company whose name seems inextricably linked
in some fashion or another with virtually every PTFE-related additive
maker in the country.
    <p> Mr. Heatwole was a charming and persuasive talker with a knack
for avoiding direct answers as good as any seasoned politician. His
glib pitch for his product was the best we've ever heard, but when
dissected and pared down to the verifiable facts, it actually said
very little.
    <p> When we asked about the ingredients in QMI's treatments, we got
almost exactly the response we expected. Mr. Heatwole said he would
"have to avoid discussing specifics about the formula, for
proprietary reasons."
     <p>After telling us that QMI was being used by  "a  major oil
company,"  a "nuclear plant owned by a major corporation" and a
"major engine manufacturer," Mr. Heatwole followed up with,
"Naturally, I can't reveal their names- for proprietary reasons."
    <p> He further claimed to have extensive testing and research data
available from a "major laboratory," proving conclusively how
effective QMI was. When we asked for the name of the lab, can you
guess? Yup, "We can't give out that information, for proprietary
reasons."
     <p>What QMI did give us was the typical "testimonials," though we
must admit theirs came from more recognizable sources than usual.
They seem to have won over the likes of both Team Kawasaki and Bobby
Unser, who evidently endorse and use QMI in their racing engines. Mr.
Heatwole was very proud of the fact that  their product was being
used in engines that he himself admitted are "torn down and
completely inspected on a weekly basis." Of course, what he left out
is that those same engines are almost totally rebuilt every time
they're torn down. So what does that prove in terms of his product
reducing wear and promoting engine longevity? Virtually nothing.
    <p> Mr. Heatwole declined to name the source of QMI's PTFE supply
"for proprietary reasons." He bragged that their product is sold
under many different private labels, but refused to identify those
labels "for proprietary reasons." When asked about the actual size of
the PTFE particles used in QMI, he claimed they were measured as
"sub-micron in size" by a "major motor laboratory" which he couldn't
identify - you guessed it - for "proprietary reasons."
    <p> After about an hour of listening to "don't quote me on this,"
"I'll have to deny that if you print it," and "I can't reveal that,"
we asked Mr. Heatwole if there was something we could print.
"Certainly," he said, "Here's a good quote for you: 'The radical
growth in technology has overcome the problem areas associated with
PTFE in the I980s'"
     <p>"Not bad," we said. Then we asked to whom we might attribute
this gem of wisdom. DuPont Chemical, perhaps?
     <p>"Me," said Mr. Heatwole. "I said that."
    <p> QMI's press releases like to quote the Guinness Book Of Records
in saying that PTFE is "The slickest substance known to man." Far be
it from us to take exception to the Guinness Book, but we doubt that
PTFE is much slicker than some of the people marketing it.

<h4>The Zinc Question</h4>
     <p>The latest "miracle ingredient" in oil additives, attempting to
usurp PTFE's cure-all throne, is zinc dialkyldithiophosphate, which
we will refer to here after as simply "zinc."
     <p>Purveyors of the new zinc-related products claim they can prove
absolute superiority over the PTFE-related products. Naturally, the
PTFE crowd claim exactly the same, in reverse.
    <p> Zinc is contained as part of the standard additive package in
virtually every major brand of engine oil sold today, varying from a
low volume of 0.10 per cent in brands such as Valvoline All Climate
and Chevron l5W-50, to a high  volume of 0.20 percent in brands such
as Valvoline  Race  and  Pennzoil GT Performance.
     <p>Organic zinc compounds are used as extreme pressure, anti-wear
additives, and are therefore found in larger amounts in oils
specifically blended for high-revving, turbocharged or racing
applications. The zinc in your oil comes into play only when there is
actual metal-to-metal con tact within your engine, which should never
occur under normal operating conditions. However, if you race your
bike, or occasionally play tag with the redline on the tach, the zinc
is your last line of defense. Under extreme conditions, the zinc
compounds react with the metal to prevent scuffing, particularly
between cylinder bores and piston rings.
     <p>However - and this is the important part to remember - available
research shows that more zinc does not give you more protection, it
merely prolongs the protection if the rate of metal-to-metal contact
is abnormally high or extended. So unless you plan on spending a
couple of hours dragging your knee at Laguna Seca, adding extra zinc
compounds to your oil is usually a waste. Also, keep in mind that
high zinc content can lead to deposit formation on your valves, and
spark plug fouling.
     <p>Among the products we found containing zinc
dialkyldithiophosphate were Mechanics Brand Engine Tune Up, K Mart
Super Oil Treatment, and STP Engine Treatment With XEP2. The only
reason we can easily identify the additives with the new zinc
compounds is that they are required to carry a Federally mandated
warning label indicating they contain a hazardous substance. The zinc
phosphate they contain is a known eye irritant, capable of inflicting
severe harm if it comes in contact with your eyes. If you insist on
using one of these products, please wear protective goggles and
exercise extreme caution.
     <p>As we mentioned, organic zinc compounds are already found in
virtually every major brand of oil, both automotive and motorcycle.
However, in recent years the oil companies voluntarily reduced the
amount of zinc content in most of their products after research
indicated the zinc was responsible for premature deterioration and
damage to catalytic converters. Obviously this situation would not
affect 99 percent of all  the motorcycles on the road - however, it
could have been a factor with the newer BMW converter - equipped
bikes.
     <p>Since the reduction in zinc content was implemented solely for
the protection of catalytic converters, it is possible that some
motorcycles might benefit from a slight increase in zinc content in
their oils. This has been taken into account by at least one oil
company, Spectro, which offers 0.02 to 0.03 percent more zinc
compounds in its motorcycle oils than in its automotive oils.
     <p>Since Spectro (Golden 4 brand, in this case) is a synthetic
blend lubricant designed for extended drain intervals, this increase
seems to be wholly justified. Also, available research indicates that
Spectro has, in this case, achieved a sensible balance for extended
application without increasing the zinc content to the point that it
is likely to cause spark plug fouling or present a threat to
converter- equipped BMW models.
     <p>It would appear that someone at Spectro did their homework.

<h4>Increased Standard Additives, (More Is Not Necessarily Better)</h4>
     <p>Though some additives may not contain anything harmful to your
engine, and even some things that could be beneficial, most experts
still recommend that you avoid their use. The reason for this is that
your oil, as purchased from one of the major oil companies, already
contains a very extensive additive package.
     <p>This package is made up of numerous, specific additive
components, blended to achieve a specific formula that will meet the
requirements of your engine. Usually, at least several of these
additives will be synergistic. That is, they react mutually, in
groups of two or more, to create an effect that none of them could
attain individually. Changing or adding to this formula can upset the
balance and negate the protective effect the formula was meant to
achieve, even if you are only adding more of something that was
already included in the initial package.
     <p>If it helps, try to think of your oil like a cake recipe. Just
because the original recipe calls for two eggs (which makes for a
very moist and tasty cake), do you think adding four more eggs is
going to make the cake better? Of course not. You're going to upset
the carefully calculated balance of ingredients and magnify the
effect the eggs have on the recipe to the point that it ruins the
entire cake. Adding more of a specific additive already contained in
your oil is likely to produce similar results.
     <p>This information should also be taken into account when adding
to the oil already in your bike or when mixing oils for any reason,
such as synthetic with petroleum. In these cases, always make sure
the oils you are putting together have the same rating (SA, SE, SC,
etc.). This tells you their additive packages are basically the same,
or at least compatible, and are less likely to upset the balance or
counteract each other.

<h4>Detergents And Solvents</h4>
    <p> Many of the older, better-known oil treatments on the market do
not make claims nearly so lavish as the new upstarts. Old standbys
like Bardahl, Rislone and Marvel Mystery Oil, instead offer  things
like  "quieter  lifters," "reduced oil burning" and a "cleaner
engine."
     <p>Most of these products are made up of solvents and detergents
designed to dissolve sludge and carbon deposits inside your engine so
they can be flushed or burned out. Wynn's Friction Proofing Oil, for
example, is 83 percent kerosene. Other brands use naphthalene,
xylene,  acetone and isopropanol. Usually, these ingredients will be
found in a base of standard mineral oil.
     <p>In general, these products are designed to do just the opposite
of what the PTFE and zinc phosphate additives claim to do. Instead of
leaving behind a "coating" or a "plating" on your engine surfaces,
they are designed to strip away such things.
     <p>All of these products will strip sludge and deposits out and
clean up your engine, particularly if it is an older, abused one. The
problem is, unless you have some way of determining just how much is
needed to remove your deposits without going any further, such
solvents also can strip away the boundary lubrication layer provided
by your oil. Overuse of solvents is an easy trap to fall into, and
one which can promote harmful metal-to-metal contact within your
engine.
     <p>As a general rule of thumb these products had their place and
were at least moderately useful on older automobile and motorcycle
engines of the Fifties and Sixties, but are basically unneeded on the
more efficient engine designs of the past two decades.

<h4>The Infamous "No Oil" Demo</h4>
     <p>At at least three major motorcycle rallies this past year, we
have witnessed live demonstrations put on to demonstrate the
effectiveness of certain oil additives. The demonstrators  would
have  a bench- mounted engine which they would fill with oil and a
prescribed dose of their "miracle additive." After running the engine
for a while they would stop it, drain out the oil and start it up
again. Instant magic! The engine would run perfectly well for hours
on end, seemingly proving the effectiveness of the additive which had
supposedly "coated" the inside of the engine so well it didn't even
need the oil to run. In one case, we saw this done with an actual
motorcycle, which would be rid den around the parking lot after
having its oil drained. A pretty convincing demonstration - until you
know the facts.
     <p>Since some of these demonstrations were conducted using Briggs
and Stratton engines,  the  Briggs  and   Stratton Company itself
decided to run a similar, but somewhat more scientific, experiment.
Taking two brand-new, identical engines straight off their assembly
line, they set them up for bench-testing. The only difference was
that one had the special additive included with its oil and the other
did not. Both were operated for 20 hours before being shut down and
having the oil drained from them. Then both were started up again and
allowed to run for another 20 straight hours. Neither engine seemed
to have any problem performing this "minor miracle."
     <p>After the second 20-hour run, both engines were completely torn
down and inspected by the company's engineers. What they found was
that both engines suffered from scored crankpin bearings, but the
engine treated with the additive also suffered from heavy cylinder
bore damage that was not evident on the untreated engine.
     <p>This points out once again the inherent problem with particulate
oil additives: They can cause oil starvation. This is particularly
true in the area of piston rings, where there is a critical need for
adequate oil flow. In practically all of the reports and studies on
oil additives, and particularly those involving suspended solids like
PTFE, this has been reported as a major area of engine damage.

<h4>The Racing Perspective</h4>
    <p> Among the most convincing testimonials in favor of oil additives
are those that come from professional racers or racing teams. As
noted previously, some of the oil additive products actually are
capable of producing less engine friction, better gas mileage and
higher horsepower out put. In the world of professional racing, the
split-second advantage that might be gained from using such a product
could be the difference between victory and defeat.
    <p> Virtually all of the downside or detrimental effects attached to
these products are related to extended, long-term usage. For
short-life, high-revving, ultra-high performance engines designed to
last no longer than one racing season (or in some cases, one single
race), the long-term effects of oil additives need not even be
considered.
    <p> Racers also use special high-adhesion tires that give much
better traction and control than our normal street tires, but you
certainly wouldn't want to go touring on them, since they're designed
to wear out in several hundred (or less) miles. Just because certain
oil additives may be beneficial in a competitive context is no reason
to believe they would be equally beneficial in a touring context.

<h4>The Best of The Worst</h4>
     <p>Not all engine oil additives are as potentially harmful as some
of those we have described here. However, the best that can be said
of those that have not proved to be harmful is that they haven't been
proved to offer any real benefits, either. In some cases, introducing
an additive with a compatible package of components to your oil in
the right proportion and at the right time can conceivably extend the
life of your oil. However, in every case we have studied it proves
out that it would actually have been cheaper to simply change the
engine oil instead.
     <p>In addition, recent new evidence has come to light that makes
using almost any additive a game of Russian Roulette. Since the
additive distributors do not list the ingredients contained within
their products, you never know for sure just what you are putting in
your engine.
     <p>Recent tests have shown that even some of the most inoffensive
additives contain products which, though harmless in their initial
state, convert to hydrofluoric acid when exposed to the temperatures
inside a firing cylinder. This acid is formed as part of the exhaust
gases, and though it is instantly expelled from your engine and seems
to do it no harm, the gases collect inside your exhaust system and
eat away at your mufflers from the inside out.

<h4>Whatever The Market Will Bear</h4>
     <p>The pricing of oil additives seems to follow no particular
pattern whatsoever. Even among those products that seem to be almost
identical, chemically, retail prices covered an extremely wide range.
For example:
<ul>
     <p>One 32-ounce bottle of Slick 50 (with PTFE) cost us $29.95 at a
discount house that listed the retail price as $59.95, while a
32-ounce bottle of T-Plus (which claims to carry twice as much PTFE
as the Slick 50) cost us only $15.88.
     <p>A 32-ounce bottle of STP Engine Treatment (containing what they
call XEP2), which they claim they can prove "outperforms leading PTFE
engine treatments," cost us $17.97. Yet a can of K Mart Super Oil
Treatment, which listed the same zinc-derivative ingredient as that
listed for the XEP2, cost us a paltry $2.67.
</ul>
     <p>Industry experts estimate that the actual cost of producing most
oil additives is from one-tenth to one-twentieth of the  asking
retail price. Certainly no additive manufacturer has come forward
with any exotic, high-cost ingredient or list of ingredients to
dispute this claim. As an interesting note along with this, back
before there was so much competition in the field to drive prices
down, Petrolon (Slick 50) was selling their PTFE products for as much
as $400 per treatment! The words "buyer beware" seem to take on very
real significance when talking about oil additives.

<h4>The Psychological Placebo</h4>
<p>You have to wonder, with the volume of evidence accumulating against
oil additives, why so many of us still buy them. That's the
million-dollar question, and it's just as difficult to answer as why
so many of us smoke cigarettes, drink hard liquor or engage in any
other number of questionable activities. We know they aren't good for
us - but we go ahead and do them anyway.
    <p> Part of the answer may lie in what some psychiatrists call the
"psychological placebo effect." Simply put, that means that many of
us hunger for that peace of mind that comes with believing we have
purchased the absolute best or most protection we can possibly get.
    <p> Even better, there's that wonderfully smug feeling that comes
with thinking we might be a step ahead of the pack, possessing
knowledge of something just a bit better than everyone else.
    <p> Then again, perhaps it comes from an ancient, deep-seated need
we all seem to have to believe in magic. There has never been any
shortage of unscrupulous types ready to cash in on our willingness to
believe that there's some magical mystery potion we can buy to help
us lose weight, grow hair, attract the opposite sex or make our
engines run longer and better. I doubt that there's a one of us who
hasn't fallen for one of these at least once in our lifetimes. We
just want it to be true so bad that we can't help ourselves.

<h4>Testimonial Hype vs. Scientific Analysis</h4>
    <p> In general, most producers of oil additives rely on personal
"testimonials" to advertise and promote their products. A typical
print advertisement will be one or more letters from a satisfied
customer stating something like, "1 have used Brand X in my engine
for 2 years and  50,000 miles and it runs smoother and gets better
gas mileage than ever before. I love this product and would recommend
it to anyone."
     <p>Such evidence is referred to as "anecdotal" and is most commonly
used to pro mote such things as miracle weight loss diets and
astrology.
    <p> Whenever I see one of these ads I am reminded of a stunt played
out several years ago by Allen Funt of "Candid Camera" that clearly
demonstrated the side of human nature that makes such advertising
possible.
     <p>With cameras in full view, fake "product demonstrators" would
offer people passing through a grocery store the opportunity to
taste-test a "new soft drink." What the victims didn't know was that
they were being given a horrendous concoction of castor oil, garlic
juice, tabasco sauce and several other foul-tasting ingredients.
After taking a nice, big swallow, as instructed by the demonstrators,
the unwitting victims provided huge laughs for the audience by
desperately trying to conceal their anguish and disgust. Some
literally turned away from the cameras and spit the offending potion
on the floor.
     <p>The fascinating part came when about one out of four of the
victims would actu ally turn back to the cameras and proclaim the new
drink was "Great" or "Unique" or, in several cases, "One of the best
things I've ever tasted!" Go figure.
     <p>The point is, compiling "personal testimonials" for a product is
one of the easiest things an advertising company can do - and one of
the safest, too. You see, as long as they are only expressing some
one else's personal opinion, they don't have to prove a thing! It's
just an opinion, and needs no basis in fact whatsoever.
        <p>On the other hand, there has been documented, careful
scientific analysis done on numerous oil additives by accredited
institutions and researchers.
       <p> For example:
<ul>
       <p> Avco Lycoming, a major manufacturer of aircraft engines,
states, "We have tried every additive we could find on the market,
and they are all worthless."
        <p>Briggs and Stratton, renowned builders of some of the most
durable engines in the world, says in their report on engine oil
additives, "They do not appear to offer any benefits."
        <p>North Dakota State University conducted tests on oil
additives and said in their report, "The theory sounds good- the only
problem is that the products simply don't work."
        <p>And finally, Ed Hackett, chemist at the University of Nevada
Desert Research Center, says, "Oil additives should not be used. The
oil companies have gone to great lengths to develop an additive pack
age that meets the vehicle's requirements. If you add anything to
this oil you may upset the balance and prevent the oil from
performing to specification."
        <p>Petrolon, Inc., of Houston, Texas, makers of Petrolon and
producers of at least a dozen other lubrication products containing
PTFE, including Slick 50 and Slick 30 Motorcycle Formula, claim that,
"Multiple tests by independent laboratories have shown that when
properly applied to an automotive engine, Slick 50 Engine Formula
reduces wear on engine parts. Test results have shown that Slick 50
treated engines sustained 50 percent less wear than test engines run
with premium motor oil alone."
</ul>

<h4>Sounds pretty convincing, doesn't it?</h4>

        <p>The problem is, Petrolon and the other oil additive companies
that claim "scientific evidence" from "independent laboratories,"
all refuse to identify the laboratories that conducted the tests or
the criteria under which the tests were conducted. They claim they
are "contractually bound" by the laboratories to not reveal their
identities.
        <p>In addition, the claim of "50 percent less wear" has never
been proven on anything approaching a long-term basis. Typical
examples used to support the additive makers' claims involve engines
run from 100 to 200 hours after treatment, during which time the
amount of wear  particles in the oil decreased. While this has proven
to be true in some cases, it has also been proven that after 400 to
500 hours of running the test engines invariably reverted to
producing just as many wear particles as before treatment, and in
some cases, even more.
    <p> No matter what the additive makers would like you to believe,
nothing has been proven to stop normal engine wear.
    <p> You will note that all of the research facilities quoted in this
article are clearly identified. They have no problem with making
their findings public. You will also note that virtually all of their
findings about oil additives are negative. That's not because we
wanted to give a biased report against oil additives - it's because
we couldn't find a single laboratory, engine manufacturer or
independent research facility who would make a public claim, with
their name attached to it, that any of the additives were actually
beneficial to an engine. The conclusion seems inescapable.
     <p>As a final note on advertising hype versus the real world, we
saw a television ad the other night for Slick 50 oil additive. The ad
encouraged people to buy their product on the basis of the fact that,
"Over 14 million Americans have tried Slick 50!" Great. We're sure
you could just as easily say, "Over 14 million Americans have smoked
cigarettes!"-but is that really any reason for you to try it? Of
course not, because you've seen the scientific evidence of the harm
it can do. The exact same principle applies here.

<h4>In Conclusion</h4>
     <p>The major oil companies are some of the richest, most powerful
and aggressive corporations in world. They own multi- million dollar
research facilities manned by some of the best chemical engineers
money can hire. It is probably safe to say that any one of them has
the capabilities and resources at hand in marketing, distribution,
advertising, research and product development equal to 20 times that
of any of the independent additive companies. It therefore stands to
reason that if any of these additive products were actu ally capable
of improving the capabilities of engine lubricants, the major oil
companies would have been able to determine that and to find some way
to cash in on it.
     <p>Yet of all the oil additives we found, none carried the name or
endorsement of  any of the major oil producers.
      <p>In addition, all of the major vehicle and engine manufacturers
spend millions of dollars each year trying to increase the longevity
of their products, and millions more paying off warranty claims when
their products fail. Again, it only stands to reason that if they
thought any of these additives would increase the life or improve the
performance of their engines, they would be actively using and
selling them - or at least endorsing their use.
      <p>Instead, many of them advise against the use of these additives
and, in some cases, threaten to void their warranty coverage if such
things are found to be used in their products.
     <p> In any story of this nature, absolute "facts" are virtually
impossible to come by.  Opinions abound.  Evidence that points one
direction or the other is avail able, but has to be carefully
ferreted out, and is not always totally reliable or completely
verifiable.
     <p> In this environment,  conclusions reached  by  known,
knowledgeable experts in the field must be given a certain amount of
weight. Conclusions reached by unknown, unidentifiable sources must
be discounted almost totally. That which is left must be weighed, one
side against the other, in an attempt to reach a "reasonable"
conclusion.
     <p>In the case of oil additives, there is a considerable volume of
evidence against their effectiveness. This evidence comes from
well-known and identifiable expert sources, including independent
research laboratories, state universities, major engine
manufacturers, and even NASA.
    <p> Against this rather formidable barrage of scientific research,
additive makers offer not much more than their own claims of
effectiveness, plus questionable and totally unscientific personal
testimonials. Though the purveyors of these products state they have
studies from other independent laboratories supporting their claims,
they refuse to identify the labs or provide copies of the research.
The only test results they will share are those from their own
testing departments, which must, by their very nature, be taken with
a rather large grain of salt.

<h2>TR6 Oil Pressures</h2>
<i>by Scott Paisley</i>
</center>
<HR size=10>

I thought I would relate my experiences with TR6 Oil Presure, based on
my engine before and after my engine rebuild of a few years ago:

<p>

A fresh TR6 engine Oil pressure values:

<pre>
	Cold Idle	90+
	Cold Running   100
	Warm Idle	40
	Warm Running    70
</pre>

<p>
A worn TR6 engine might look like this, based on my engine before rebuild:
<pre>
	Cold Idle      50
	Cold Running   70
	Warm Idle      15
	Warm Running   50
</pre>

<p>
In some cases, replacing the big-end bearings on the connecting rods
will help low idle oil pressure.  The low pressure can be an indicator
to the fact that there is slop there, and oil leaks out falling back
into the oil pan.  Removal of the pan and replacement of these
bearings is a simple fix if a rebuild is not possible.  Some manuals
even recommend replacing these bearings every 50,000 miles!  (Bentley, I
think...)  By the way, 20w50 will raise oil pressure values, but not too
significantly after the car becomes completely warm.

<h1>  MODERN <a name="top">SYNTHETIC LUBRICANTS</a> FOR ENGINE OIL APPLICATIONS</h1>

<p><i>Edited to HTML by Kyle Hamar, who would like to thank Clint
Chamberlin,cac@mtmis1.mis.semi.harris.com for finding and making this
information available on the Internet!</i>

<p>
       MILWAUKEE, WI - RIS - There's been a great deal of inter-
est, of late, in the performance of synthetic lubricants. Manu-
facturers have enticed the motoring public for a number of years
now, with claims for increased fuel economy, reductions in fric-
tion and wear, decreased oil consumption, better cold cranking
performance, and extended drain intervals. Many motorists howev-
er, remain skeptical, as the price of synthetics is usually much
higher than conventional petroleum based oils. In addition, a
great deal if misinformation has circulated regarding them. Are
these claims simply hype, or is there something here that the
average motorist can be interested in? Let's take a look.

  <p>     Synthetic lubricants have been around for a long time.
Synthesized compounds are the only thing that will continue to
flow at the low temperatures found in the arctic or in outer
space. During the past twenty years, some of these same benefits
have been made available to the general public. In order to
properly examine the role synthetic lubricants play, and their
performance, we need to first look at the fundamentals of hydro-
dynamic lubrication and lubricant properties and production.


<p><b>     Fundamentals of Hydrodynamic Lubrication:
</b>
    <p>   As usually stated in engineering texts, and intuitively
grasped by most laymen, a lubricant is inserted between two
moving surfaces to reduce friction, and the resultant generation
of heat and wear.

      <p> "Hydrodynamic" lubrication exists when two surfaces are
separated by a relatively thick film of lubricant. A high pres-
sure is not required to separate the surfaces. In a typical
engine, plain or grooved journal bearings are used to hold the
crankshaft, piston rods, camshafts, and other machine components.

     <p>  Take out a deck of cards. Place the deck on a table, and
with your hand, move the deck horizontally. Notice how the bottom
card does not move, while the top card moves the most. Those in
between move too, with the amount of motion dependant on the
height from the table.

      <p> What's happening here is that the friction between the
table and the bottom card keeps it from moving. In fluid mechan-
ics, we refer to the layer that doesn't move as the boundary
layer. The type of stress you applied to the cards is called a
"shear stress", and is equal to the horizontal force you applied
divided by the flat area of a card. This shear stress also af-
fects the velocity of each card. This relationship is directly
proportional to the shear stress, and the distance from the
table, and inversely proportional to a quantity we will call the
"viscosity". (Actually, it's a bit more complicated than this,
but it's a suitable simplification for our purposes.)

      <p> What this simply means is that for a given distance from
one surface, the velocity will be lower if the lubricant has a
higher viscosity, and a constant shear stress is applied. Hence,
the viscosity is a measurement of the internal friction of the
fluid, and its resistance to motion.

      <p> Our example used cards, but fluids are often modeled as
infinitely thin layers. Thus if you drop a steel ball into a
glass of molasses (a high viscosity fluid) it will drop slowly
because of the internal friction of the fluid. Likewise, dropping
the same steel ball in a glass of water, will cause it to drop
rapidly because the fluid does not have a particularly high
viscosity.

      <p> We will not consider the methods used to measure viscosi-
ty, but rest assured that standard methods have been developed.

      <p> One of the problems with this internal friction is that it
produces heat. If we model the fluid molecules as a series of
balls connected by springs, transfer of momentum takes place
between the molecules and the amplitude of vibration becomes
greater. This means that it takes longer for one molecule to
randomly strike another, reducing the internal friction, and
hence the viscosity.

    <p>   This means that the viscosity of a fluid generally de-
creases with temperature, and increases as the temperature drops.
If a fluid's viscosity is a function only of temperature, then it
is characterized as "Newtonian" after Isaac Newton. Unfortunate-
ly, the viscosity of many fluids, engine oils among them, drop
with high shear rates. Such fluids are termed non-Newtonian.

    <p>   OK, so what's the fluid's internal friction got to do with
the friction between a pair of parts, such as a crankshaft and a
bearing? Plenty!

       <p>First, we need to differentiate between thin-film and
thick-film lubrication. Thin films are a problem. as the viscosi-
ty decreases, the lubricant is less able to withstand the loads
placed on it. Heat is generated, reducing the viscosity even
further. Surface-to-surface contact may occur. In thin films, the
coefficient of friction between the two surfaces actually goes up
as the viscosity decreases. Such films are termed "unstable". It
is essential then to provide a film which is sufficiently thick
to provide proper lubrication.

       <p>If the film is thick enough, however, the coefficient of
friction between the mating surfaces actually goes down as the
viscosity of the lubricant drops. The temperature drops, and the
viscosity of the fluid rises slightly. This acts as a stabilizing
effect, and prevents loss of film thickness.

       <p>The designer then, needs to specify the bearing/journal
design and lubricant viscosity (for a given speed) in such a way
as to prevent the formation of a thin film. This means that the
viscosity has to be high enough even at high temperatures. Howev-
er, the fluid still needs to flow at lower temperatures, and
there is enough reduction in friction between mating surfaces at
moderately low viscosities to warrant their selection.

       <p>As an aside, the temperature rise can be controlled some-
what by providing a constant flow of oil to and from the bear-
ings. While the temperature in the sump (where we usually measure
it) seems high, it's significantly lower than at the contact
surfaces themselves, and enough heat can be transferred to make a
recirculating flow system desirable. If temperatures become too
high, then an additional cooler can be added.
<p><b>
     Lubricating Oil Fundamentals:
</b>
       <p>So what about the lubricant itself? What kind of specifi-
cations does it have to meet? The American Petroleum Institute
(API), the American Society for Testing Materials (ASTM), and the
Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) have cooperatively de-
veloped specifications for lubricating oils.

       <p>If you take a look at the top of a motor oil can, you'll
find the following: SAE viscosity specification (such as 5W-30,
which means that it is a multi-vis oil that meets both the 5W and
30 specifications.), an API service classification (such as
SF/CD), and perhaps an "energy conserving" designation.

       <p>The SAE viscosity designation, means that the oil meets
SAE J300 specifications for cold cranking (if a "W" rated oil)
and at 100 degrees Celsius (if without a "W" rating), when proper
ASTM testing procedures are followed.

       <p>The API service classification is a bit more complex. You
see, an oil may initially meet the SAE viscosity specification,
but when run at high temperatures for a period of time, its
performance may deteriorate. The API classifications for most
engine oils are set for spark-ignition engines (such as SF, where
the "F" is a chronological designation), and compression-ignition
(diesel) engines (such as CD). Several test sequences are run
using a standard engine. For instance, rust and number of stuck
lifters are rated, the viscosity increase over time (we'll talk
about why this happens later) at, say 100 degrees F is measured,
and the amount of sludge, varnish, oil screen clogging, and cam
lobe wear is estimated or measured.

       <p>These classifications are getting tougher. For instance,
the SE rating for 1972 model cars allowed a maximum of 400%
increase in the oil's viscosity when measured at 100 degrees F
after 40 hours. However, the SF classification for 1980 model
cars, allowed a maximum of 375% increase in the viscosity when
measured at 40 degrees C after 64 hours, with subsequent reduc-
tions in the other categories. The new SG rating is even tougher.

       <p>An engine may be designated as "energy saving" if they
demonstrate reduced fuel consumption when compared to an SAE 20W-
30 Newtonian reference oil. With the coming of federally mandated
CAFE requirements, most manufacturers are designating this type
of oil for use in late model engines, and the EPA allows their
use.

       <p>Just what does an oil consist of, and how can it be com-
pounded to meet these specifications?

       <p>Let's look first at conventional oils.

       <p>Crude oil as it comes from the ground is made up of a
number of hydrocarbon compounds - primarily paraffins, but it
also includes other compounds. Often, these compounds are sepa-
rated by viscosity through a distillation process. Since differ-
ent fractions of the crude have different boiling points as well
as different viscosities, progressive boiling is used. Those
fractions with lower boiling points are allowed to vaporize, and
are collected and then cooled. These neutral fractions typically
have lower viscosities, while the bright stocks (those with
higher boiling points) generally have higher viscosities.

       <p>As such, we can separate oils by viscosity.

       <p>But here's a problem. If we compound an oil to have a
relatively low viscosity (or a multi-vis oil with a significant
amount of these lower boiling point/lower viscosity stocks) some
of them will vaporize at high temperatures, resulting in higher
oil consumption. What's left behind has a higher viscosity.
Varnish and sludge are also present. If the decrease in viscosi-
ty, amount of sludge, varnish, and cam lobe wear are too high, it
fails the API service test.

       <p>That's why a 5W-30 oil that meets the SF rating represents
a major step. Those oils are said to be "energy saving" since
their lower viscosity at lower temperatures (with thick-film
lubrication. Remember, if the viscosity is too low, surface-to-
surface contact may occur resulting in increased friction and
wear!) results in lower part-to-part friction. Yet by passing the
SF rating, it shows that it's still pretty good.

       <p>Now, there are many things in the average motor oil than
various refined fractions of crude. Included are various addi-
tives, such as anti-wear agents, extreme pressure (EP) additives,
anti-rust agents, corrosion inhibitors, detergents, dispersants,
and friction modifiers.

       <p>Most of these are self-explanitory. They are added to
enhance the performance of an oil. The EP additives are put in to
help the oil hold up between surfaces which feature high contact
stresses such as those between the cam lobes and followers.
Detergents and dispersants are put in to help remove dirt and
sludge and hold it in suspension, until it's either removed in
the filter, or the oil is changed.

       <p>Also included are various oil modifiers such as pour point
depressants, viscosity index (VI) improvers, and seal swell
agents.

       <p>Pour point depressants are added to inhibit wax crystal
growth at low temperatures. This gives the oil better cold crank-
ing performance.

       <p>VI improvers are designed to help an oil's
viscosity/temperature performance. Remember that at high tempera-
tures, an oil's viscosity drops. If it drops too low, we lose
film thickness, and are in big trouble! The viscosity index (VI)
is a measurement of how an oil's viscosity changes with tempera-
ture, compared to reference oils. The higher the number, the
better. VI improvers are polymer compounds with interlocking
structures (polymers are long chain molecules). Because these
chains are interlocked, they don't move as easily at high temper-
atures and resist viscosity loss. Unfortunately, they don't
necessarily contribute anything to lubricity, and in fact begin
to wear out under shear stresses. As they wear, the oil's VI
deteriorates, and we're left with the old VI improver, which has
to be held in suspension. This is another reason to change your
oil frequently! The VI improver's sensitivity to high shear
stress is significant in that if the shear stress is high enough,
the oil may experience either a temporary or permanent loss of
viscosity!

       <p>Finally, an oil company may add various compounds which
help protect the base stock, such as anti-foam agents, antioxi-
dants, and metal deactivators. The antioxidants are important as
they prevent the oil from reacting with oxygen at high tempera-
tures and forming sludge, varnish, and lacquer.

       <p>So where do synthetics fit in? What are they? The term
"synthesize" means to put together from small bits. Rather than
separating crude into various fractions as is done with conven-
tional oils, synthetic base stocks are made by reacting various
organic chemicals together. For instance, if an acid an an alco-
hol are allowed to react, a compound known as an ester is pro-
duced. (As an aside, the aroma present in flowers is generally
produced by an ester. Others include butter, lard, tallow, lin-
seed, cottonseed, and olive oils - although I wouldn't substitute
my favorite engine oil for any of them in my cooking, or vice-
versa!) Other synthetic hydrocarbon compounds are also suitable
for lubricating oils, and manufacturers may blend two or more
compounds together to arrive at suitable properties.

       <p>It should be noted that many additives are also made of
synthesized compounds.

       <p>First, though, let's compare a conventional oil to a
synthetic. A synthetic may require considerably less VI improver
to have the same viscosity index. Remember that the VI improver
wears out. Synthetic's are also more thermally stable.

       <p>Synthetic base stocks also have lower pour points - often
below -50 degrees F, and require little or no pour point depres-
sant. In contrast, bright stocks may stop pouring at 25-30 de-
grees F, and need it.

       <p>Still, synthetics are a bit more expensive, so compounding
one to compete directly with a conventional oil may not make
economic sense. That's why they are usually made to have superior
properties. The extra performance is often worth the cost penal-
ty.

       <p>For instance, synthetics can be compounded with very low
pour points. This gives good cold-cranking performance. They may
also be compounded with slightly lower viscosities at lower
temperatures (while still meeting SAE specifications). This helps
to reduce friction, and results in less wear, and better fuel
economy.

       <p>Now the 5W-30 "energy saving" oils will do the same thing,
but as we've discussed before, to lower the viscosity, these oils
may be compounded with fractions which have a higher volatility.
After a period of time, they begin to boil off or oxidize, leav-
ing behind an oil of higher viscosity. Now, that same oil may
meet API SF specifications, but a synthetic may remain stable for
a LONGER period of time. (Esters exhibit excellent performance in
the API test. Other compounds are very, very good also.) That
means that longer drain intervals are possible.

       <p>A word on use. Some synthetic compounds are not compatible
with conventional oils. However, most manufacturers, have recog-
nized that one may add a quart of their product to someone
else's, and have compounded them to be. To do otherwise would be
to pass up their intended market! (As an aside, I try to avoid
having to mix conventional oil, if I can help it. While they are
also compounded to be compatible, the performance may not be the
same when mixed together. It's ok in a pinch, but I don't make a
habit of it.) Also, the lower friction resulting from the use of
a synthetic lubricant makes them unsuitable for break-in.

       <p>To sum up, synthetics provide an excellent alternative to
conventional oils - especially if better performance is required.
It's your choice!

<h2>Adjusting Your Carburetors</h2>

<i>Extracted from earlier articles by <br>
Scott Fisher, Roger Garnett, Ken Streeter,<br>
and other contributors.</i>
</center>
<HR size=10>

<h3>1. Basic Adjustment Strategy</h3>

The trick to tuning Skinners Union (SU) or Zenith Stromberg (ZS) carbs
is to understand that there are two things you need to get right: the
air flow, and the fuel mixture.  While they are interconnected, they
are also independent, and need to be measured and adjusted
independently.  SU carbs were used on the early Triumphs, while ZS
carbs were used on the later ones.  Either type of carb can be found
on <a href="/TR4/TR4.html">TR4s</a>.  The design of each is quite
similar; thus adjustment is performed in the same manner for either
type.

If you would like to read more detailed information about how your SU
or ZS carbs work, there are excellent Haynes manuals for each of these
carburetors.

<h4>Special Tools</h4>

<ul>

<li>You will probably need to arrange to buy or borrow a Unisyn flow meter.
The Unisyn is the usual gauge for getting the air flow balanced between
the two carbs.  This costs about $20 and is simple to use.  It consists
of an adjustable opening (same size circumference, but with a disc on a
threaded rod that you can screw tighter or looser) that you use to
set the level of a little float that rises or falls in a glass tube at
the side of the gauge.

<p><li>
For the fuel mixture, one helpful device is called the Gunson 
ColorTune (maybe ColourTune, as it's a British co.).  This is a spark 
plug with a crystal pressure- and heat-resistant window in it that lets 
you see into the combustion chamber while the motor is running.  The 
color of the flame indicates the mixture richness.  It costs about $40, 
and while it's not absolutely essential, it makes life so much easier 
that it's worth the cost.  

<P>
If you don't have a Gunson, the standard directions are included here
for determining correct mixture (step 4 of the Adjusting Mixture 
procedure).

<p><li>
For some ZS carbs, you will need a special mixture adjusting tool.
This is a special two-part wrench that is inserted through the top of
the carburetor to adjust the metering needle while preventing the air
valve from rotating within the carburetor.

</ul>

<h4>Terminology</h4>

<P>
To tune SU or ZS carbs, first locate the following components:
<UL>

<P>
<li>Throttle linkage nuts.  These are the things that connect the
    throttle linkage (the bar connected to your foot through whatever
    means your car uses, cables or rods) to the carburetors' throttle 
    levers.

<P>
<li>Throttle stop screws.  These set the idle speed for each carb,
    and are located typically behind the dashpot, near the connection
    of the throttle linkage.

<P>
<LI>Mixture adjusting nut.  On early SU carbs, this is the lower of
    the two nuts at the very bottom of the carburetor.  Later SU
    carburetors of the HIF type have integral float chambers, on which
    the mixture is adjusted by turning a screw.  Some ZS carbs do not
    have adjustable mixture.  ZS carbs that do allow mixture
    adjustment either  You'll need to
    experiment (and I explain how) to see which way makes this richer
    and which way makes it leaner.

<P><LI>Lifting pins.  (SU carbs only) These are little wobbly metal
    pins under the dashpot.  When you push up on the pin, it raises
    the piston in the dashpot.  Find these; they're crucial if you
    don't have a Colortune.  If you don't have them, can't find them,
    or have a ZS carb, you can raise the piston with a flat-bladed
    screwdriver pushed down the throat of the carb and twisted or
    levered to lift the piston.

<P><LI>The bridge.  This is the part inside the carburetor, where the 
    gas jet opens into the airstream.  You'll see a needle inside
    the jet, and the jet itself should be a few fractions of an inch
    down from the bridge itself.  The jet is the brass tube that sits
    in the center of the bridge, with a tapered needle poking down 
    into it.  

<P><LI>The choke linkage nuts.  Comparable to the throttle linkage nuts
    (and usually the same size), but on the linkage that goes between
    the choke cable and the mixture adjustment mechanism.  They make
    sure that both carbs are enriched when you pull on the choke.
    Your car may have no choke linkage, but a split choke cable which
    connects to each carb, in which you can forget about these...

</UL>

<P>
<h3>2. Before You Even Touch the Carbs!</h3>

<P> Start with the engine warmed up to operating temperature and
perform your standard ignition tune-up (points gap, timing, spark plug
gap, new condenser, etc.) first.  All of these things can affect the
setting of the carbs, which should be adjusted last, if at all!  After
being properly set, the carbs should rarely need further adjustment.
If you've got a timing light and a dwell meter, you can verify the
ignition components independent of the way the car is running.  When
it's warm, shut the motor off and remove the air filters.

<p> Of course, it helps if the carbs are in good mechanical condition
as well. But you can consider a rebuild once you have gotten things
working first!

<h3>3. Balancing The Air Flow</h3>
<P>

If your car has multiple carburetors, the air flow needs to be
balanced amongst all carbs before the mixture is adjusted.  If you
have only one carb on your car, you can proceed directly to mixture
adjustment!

<P>
1.  Begin by balancing the air flow.  To do this, first loosen
the throttle linkage nuts.  Leave them connected, just loosen them
half a turn or so.

<P>
2.  Back out the throttle stop screws till you can see that they 
are just touching the throttle stop.  Then open each carburetor
(that is, lower the throttle stop screw) 1-1/2 turns of the throttle 
stop screw and start the engine.  It will probably idle at about 
2000 RPM; don't worry.

<P>
3.  Put the Unisyn over either carb and adjust the orifice in the
Unisyn till the little float at the side rests at the middle of its
graduated tube.  (Pre-diagnostics: if the idle drops and the car
wants to die when you slap on the Unisyn, the carb is too rich; if
the idle soars upwards, it's too lean.)  Hold the Unisyn over the
carb for only long enough to see the level of the float, then 
remove it.

<P>
4.  Place the Unisyn on each carburetor in turn to check its flow,
adjusting the throttle stop screws until all carburetors register
the same position on the graduated tube of the Unisyn.  (The float
will probably move either up or down in the tube, which is why you
want to center it in Step 3.)  When both carburetors flow the same
amount of air, tighten the throttle linkage nuts, adjusting for
the amount of free-play between the linkage and the throttle stops
that your manual calls for (probably about 0.006").  Your goal
should be to achieve the lowest possible idle with both carbs
balanced and the engine running smoothly.  (Note that the idle speed
will very probably rise as you get the mixture correct.)

<P>
If you've taken more than five minutes to do this, rev the engine
to over 2500 RPM (assuming the idle isn't already that high) for
thirty seconds or so to clear the spark plugs.  Then adjust the
mixture.
<P>

<h3>4. Adjusting The Mixture:</h3>
<P>
Note: in the following procedure, one "flat" is the basic increment of
adjustment, and refers to 1/6 of a turn of the mixture adjusting nut.
This corresponds to the flat faces on the nut.  

<P> These instructions are for ZS carbs or SUs with separate float
chambers.  You will need to check in your shop manual to see whether
you turn the mixture screw to the right or the left to make it richer
or leaner.  (We may add the information here some day...)

<P> 1.  Shut the car off and loosen the choke linkage nuts, if you
have any to loosen!

<P> 2.  Adjust the mixture nuts (screws) fully lean.  Check your shop
manual to make sure you are adjusting them the right way!

<p> 3.  Now enrichen each carb an equal amount -- two full turns of
the adjustment nuts (screws). Then start the car.

<P> Note: In the following step, you might want to consider adjusting
the carburetors one-half a flat too lean, as the mixture will be
enriched when you put the air filters (which restrict air flow) on at
the end of the tuning process.

<P> 4. Raise the lifting pin (or use a screwdriver if you don't have
the pins) so that the piston rises no more than 1/16".  Listen to the
engine's exhaust note and compare it to the following conditions:

<UL><P><li>
  If the exhaust note rises and stays high until you drop the piston,
    this carburetor is adjusted too rich.  Adjust the mixture one flat
    leaner, then repeat Step 4.

<P><LI>
  If the exhaust note falls and the car sounds as though it is going
    to stall, this carburetor is adjusted too lean.  Adjust the
    mixture one flat richer, then repeat Step 4.

  <P><li>If the exhaust note rises briefly and then settles back down to
    something like the original RPM level, this carburetor is set
    correctly.  When you have achieved this setting for all
    carburetors, continue with Step 5.

</ul>

<p> 5.  Tighten the choke linkage nuts, if applicable, so that the
choke cable will pull an equal amount on both mixture nuts when you
pull the knob.

<P> 6.  At this time, I find I usually have to adjust the idle again
because getting the fuel mixture right usually changes the idle speed.
Since you know you have the throttles synchronized, I normally just
adjust the idle without loosening the throttle linkage.  The easiest
way is to screw one of the screws out till it doesnt' even touch the
throttle stop, then use the other to get the idle speed right.  When
that's done, you can screw the other stop screw down till it just
touches the stop on that carb and you're set.

<P>
7.  Replace the air filters and go for a test drive!
<P>

<h3>5. Special Notes</h3>

<P> SU and ZS carburetors are most fuel-efficient when slightly
lean, and provide the most power when they are slightly rich.  You can
use this knowledge to provide a certain amount of tuning for the kind
of driving you do.  If you learn to read spark plugs, you can get a
basic idea of what your engine's condition is and make fine
adjustments to the mixture nuts accordingly.

<P>
If you have a ColorTune, you simply install it in place of one of the
plugs, then adjust the carburetor that feeds that cylinder (the front
carburetor for 1 & 2, the rear for 3 & 4).  The ColorTune will let you
see the color of the flame.  White flashes mean too lean; yellow flame
means too rich.  Blue (like a Bunsen burner) is correct, and blue with
a faint orangish tinge is the best for power.

<P> You can also modify your car's throttle response characteristics
slightly by adjusting the viscosity of the oil in the dashpot damper.
SU and ZS carbs are set up so that a thicker oil will resist the
piston's attempt to rise in the dashpot for just long enough that the
engine's increased load (when the throttle is opened) will pull more
fuel across the bridge; this enriches the mixture and temporarily
bumps power up to help the engine achieve higher speed more readily.
For light damping, Marvel Mystery Oil is excellent, engine oil can be
used for heavier damping.

<P> If you modify your engine, you will probably need to modify your
needles, as it is the needle profile that determines the mixture curve
for different air-fuel loads.

<P> If you experience uneven idle, hunting, or an idle that changes
(rises or falls) as the engine's temperature climbs or drops, you
probably have vacuum leaks.  The most serious fault on most old carbs
is wear in the throttle shaft area.  To test for this, spray some
carburetor cleaner on the outside of the throttle shaft; carburetor
cleaner is non-combustible, and if the engine speed drops, it means
some of this is getting into the air stream from outside the
carburetor.  You may also have leaks from the manifolds, from tubing
such as the vacuum advance line to the distributor (if fitted), or
from other places; the carb cleaner trick works well for locating
those leaks as well.

<P> Other problems that SU and ZS carbs experience involve dirt in the
dashpot and occasionally in the float chamber.  The dashpot is a
precision piece of machining that involves very close tolerances so
that the piston doesn't stick or bind when it rises and falls.  A
little grit between the piston and the dashpot can make the car jerk
and sputter.  Take the dashpot off, wipe the insides down with carb
cleaner and a lint-free, clean rag, then reinstall it, getting the
screws down tight.  Also, don't swap the pistons between dashpots;
they're matched to one another so that the clearance between the
piston and the wall of the dashpot makes a tight seal but permits easy
rising and falling.  

<P> Dirt in the float bowl basically shuts off that carburetor (or can
make it flood open, depending on whether the dirt is wedging the valve
open or closed).  You can try rapping on the float bowl with the
handle of a screwdriver, but your best bet is to take the cover off,
clean out the valve fittings, and reinstall everything, with a new
fuel filter for good measure.

<P> Some older SU models also have adjustable floats, in which you
need to set the float height (which basically equals the fuel level in
the float chamber) by bending a brass rod.  These carburetors were
replaced in the mid-1960s with carburetors that had fixed, plastic
floats which are basically trouble-free unless abused.  The stop at
the back of the floats can break if they are installed badly, and the
brass pin that holds them in place can wear an oval hole in the float
pivot.  New floats are fairly inexpensive and aren't a bad idea if
you're doing a rebuild.

<P> Grose-Jets are very popular with some people and a big pain for
others.  It appears -- and this is just conjecture -- that Grose-Jets
work best in cars with adjustable floats.  The standard failure for
Grose-Jets is to flood the carburetor.

<h3>Subject: 1. Introduction and Intent
</h3>
The intent of this FAQ is to provide some basic information on gasolines and
other fuels for spark ignition engines used in automobiles. The toxicity and
environmental reasons for recent and planned future changes to gasoline are
discussed, along with recent and proposed changes in composition of gasoline.
This FAQ intended to help readers choose the most appropriate fuel for
vehicles, assist with the diagnosis of fuel-related problems, and to
understand the significance of most gasoline properties listed in fuel
specifications. I make no apologies for the fairly heavy emphasis on
chemistry, it is the  only sensible way to describe the oxidation of
hydrocarbon fuels to produce energy, water, and carbon dioxide.<p>

Subject: 3. What Advantage will I gain from reading this FAQ?
</h3>
This FAQ is intended to provide a fairly technical description of what
gasoline contains, how it is specified, and how the properties affect the
performance in your vehicle. The regulations governing gasoline have
changed, and are continuing to change. These changes have made much of the
traditional lore about gasoline obsolete. Motorists may wish to understand
a little more about gasoline to ensure they obtain the best value, and the
most appropriate fuel for their vehicle. There is no point in prematurely
destroying your second most expensive purchase by using unsuitable fuel,
just as there is no point in wasting hard-earned money on higher octane
fuel that your automobile can not utilize. Note that this FAQ does not
discuss the relative advantages of specific brands of gasolines, it is
only intended to discuss the generic properties of gasolines.

Subject: 4. What is Gasoline?
<p>
<b>4.1  Where does crude oil come from?.
</b>
</h3>
The generally-accepted origin of crude oil is from plant life up to 3
billion years ago, but predominantly from 100 to 600 million years ago [1].
"Dead vegetarian dino dinner" is more correct than "dead dinos".
The molecular structure of the hydrocarbons and other compounds present
in fossil fuels can be linked to the leaf waxes and other plant molecules of
marine and terrestrial plants believed to exist during that era. There are
various biogenic marker chemicals such as isoprenoids from terpenes,
porphyrins and aromatics from natural pigments, pristane and phytane from
the hydrolysis of chlorophyll, and normal alkanes from waxes, whose size
and shape can not be explained by known geological processes [2]. The
presence of optical activity and the carbon isotopic ratios also indicate a
biological origin [3]. There is another hypothesis that suggests crude oil
is derived from methane from the earth's interior. The current main
proponent of this abiotic theory is Thomas Gold, however abiotic and
extraterrestrial origins for fossil fuels were also considered at the turn
of the century, and were discarded then.
<p>
<h3>
4.2  When will we run out of crude oil?
</h3>
It has been estimated that the planet contains over 1.4 x 10^15 tonnes of
petroleum, however much of this is too dilute or inaccessible for current
technology to recover [4]. The petroleum industry uses a measure called
the Reserves/Production ratio (R/P) to monitor how production and
exploration are linked. This is based on the concept of "proved" reserves
of crude oil, which are generally taken to be those quantities which
geological and engineering information indicate with reasonable certainty
can be recovered in the future from known reservoirs under existing economic
and operating conditions. The Reserves/Production ratio is the above
reserves divided by the production in the last year, and the result is the
length of time that those remaining reserves would last if production were
to continue at the current level [5]. It is important to note those
definitions, as the price of oil increases, marginal fields become "proved
reserves", thus we are unlikely to "run out" of oil, as more fields will
become economic as the price rises. If the price exceeds $30/bbl then
alternative fuels may become competitive, and at $50-60/bbl coal-derived
liquid fuels are economic, as are many biomass-derived fuels and other
energy sources [6]. One barrel of oil equals 0.158987 m3. The current price
for Brent Crude is approx. $18/bbl. The R/P ratio has increased from 27
years (1979) to 43.1 years (1993) [5]. Now, some numbers. <p>

<h3>
4.3  What is the history of gasoline?
</h3>
In the late 19th Century the most suitable fuels for the automobile
were coal tar distillates and the lighter fractions from the distillation
of crude oil. During the early 20th Century the oil companies were
producing gasoline as a simple distillate from petroleum, but the
automotive engines were rapidly being improved and required a more
suitable fuel. During the 1910s, laws prohibited the storage of gasolines
on residential properties, so Charles F. Kettering ( yes - he of ignition
system fame ) modified an IC engine to run on kerosine. However the
kerosine-fuelled engine would "knock" and crack the cylinder head and
pistons. He assigned Thomas Midgley Jr. to confirm that the cause was
from the kerosine droplets vaporising on combustion as they presumed .
Midgley demonstrated that the knock was caused by a rapid rise in
pressure after ignition, not during preignition as believed [7]. This
then lead to the long search for anti-knock agents, culminating in
tetra ethyl lead [8]. Typical mid-1920s gasolines were 40 - 60 Octane [9].
<p>
Because sulfur in gasoline inhibited the octane-enhancing effect
of the alkyl lead, the sulfur content of the thermally-cracked refinery
streams for gasolines was restricted. By the 1930s, the petroleum
industry had determined that the larger hydrocarbon molecules (kerosine)
had major adverse effects on the octane of gasoline, and were developing
consistent specifications for desired properties. By the 1940s catalytic
cracking was introduced, and gasoline compositions became fairly consistent
between brands during the various seasons.
<p>
The 1950s saw the start of the increase of the compression ratio, requiring
higher octane fuels. Lead levels were increased, and some new refining
processes ( such as hydrocracking ), specifically designed to provide
hydrocarbons components with good lead response and octane, were introduced.
Minor improvements were made to gasoline formulations to improve yields and
octane until the 1970s - when unleaded fuels were introduced to protect
the exhaust catalysts that were also being introduced for environmental
reasons. From 1970 until 1990 gasolines were slowly changed as lead was
phased out. In 1990 the Clean Air Act started forcing major compositional
changes on gasoline, and these changes will continue into the 21st Century
because gasoline is a major pollution source.

<h3>
4.4  What are the hydrocarbons in gasoline?
</h3>
Hydrocarbons ( HCs ) are any molecules that just contain hydrogen and
carbon, both of which are fuel molecules that can be burnt ( oxidised )
to form water ( H2O ) or carbon dioxide ( CO2 ). If the combustion is
not complete, carbon monoxide ( CO ) may be formed. As CO can be burnt
to produce CO2, it is also a fuel.
<p>
The way the hydrogen and carbons hold hands determines which hydrocarbon
family they belong to. If they only hold one hand they are called
"saturated hydrocarbons" because they can not absorb additional hydrogen.
If the carbons hold two hands they are called "unsaturated hydrocarbons"
because they can be converted into "saturated hydrocarbons" by the
addition of hydrogen to the double bond. Hydrogens are omitted from the
following, but if you remember C = 4 hands, H = 1 hand, and O = 2 hands,
you can draw the full structures of most HCs.
<p>
Gasoline contains over 500 hydrocarbons that may have between 3 to 12
carbons, and gasoline used to have a boiling range from 30C to 220C at
atmospheric pressure. The boiling range is narrowing as the initial boiling
point is increasing, and the final boiling point is decreasing, both
changes are for environmental reasons. Detailed descriptions of structures
can be found in any chemical or petroleum text discussing gasolines [10].

<h3>
4.5  What are oxygenates?
</h3>
Oxygenates are just preused hydrocarbons :-). They contain oxygen, which
can not provide energy, but their structure provides a reasonable
anti-knock value, thus they are good substitutes for aromatics, and
they may also reduce the smog-forming tendencies of the exhaust gases [11].

</pre>

They can be produced from fossil fuels eg methanol (MeOH), methyl tertiary
butyl ether (MTBE), tertiary amyl methyl ether (TAME), or from biomass, eg
ethanol(EtOH), ethyl tertiary butyl ether (ETBE)). Most oxygenates used in
gasolines are either alcohols ( Cx-O-H ) or ethers (Cx-O-Cy), and contain
1 to 6 carbons. MTBE is produced by reacting methanol ( from natural gas )
with isobutylene in the liquid phase over an acidic ion-exchange resin
catalyst at 100C. The isobutylene was initially from refinery catalytic
crackers or petrochemical olefin plants, but these days larger plants
produce it from butanes. Production has increased at the rate of 10 to 20%
per year, and the spot market price in June 1993 was around $270/tonne [11].
The  "ether" starting fluids for vehicles are usually diethyl ether
( liquid ) or dimethyl ether ( aerosol ). Note that " petroleum ether " is
actually a volatile hydrocarbon fraction, it is not a Cx-O-Cy compound.
<p>
Oxygenates are added to gasolines to reduce the reactivity of emissions,
but they are only effective if the hydrocarbon fractions are carefully
modified to utilise the octane and volatility properties of the oxygenates.
If the hydrocarbon fraction is not correctly modified, oxygenates can
increase the undesirable smog-forming and toxic emissions. The major
reduction in the reactivity of exhaust and evaporative emissions will occur
with reformulated gasolines, due to be introduced in January 1995, which
have oxygenates and major composition changes to the hydrocarbon component.
Oxygenates do not necessarily reduce all individual exhaust toxins, nor
are they intended to.
<p>
Oxygenates have significantly different physical properties to hydrocarbons,
and the levels that can be added to gasolines are controlled by the EPA in
the US, with waivers being granted for some combinations. The change to
reformulated gasoline requires oxygenates, but also that the hydrocarbon
composition must be significantly more modified than the existing
oxygenated gasolines to reduce unsaturates, volatility, benzene, and the
reactivity of emissions.
<p>
Oxygenates that are added to gasoline function in two ways. Firstly they
have high blending octane, and so can replace high octane aromatics
in the fuel. These aromatics are responsible for disproportionate amounts
of CO and HC exhaust emissions. This is called the "aromatic substitution
effect". Oxygenates also cause engines without sophisticated engine
management systems to move to the lean side of stoichiometry, thus reducing
emissions of CO ( 2% oxygen can reduce CO by 16% ) and HC ( 2% oxygen
can reduce HC by 10%). However, on vehicles with engine management systems,
the fuel volume will be increased to bring the stoichiometry back to
the preferred optimum setting. Oxygen in the fuel can not contribute
energy, consequently the fuel has less energy content. For the same
efficiency and power output, more fuel has to be burnt, and the slight
improvements in efficiency that oxygenates provide on some engines usually
do not completely compensate for the oxygen [12].
<p>
There are huge number of chemical mechanisms involved in the pre-flame
reactions of gasoline combustion. Although both alkyl leads and oxygenates
are effective at suppressing knock, the chemical modes through which they
act are entirely different. MTBE works by retarding the progress of the low
temperature or cool-flame reactions, consuming radical species, particularly
OH radicals and producing isobutene. The isobutene in turn consumes
additional OH radicals and produces unreactive, resonantly stabilised
radicals such as allyl and methyl allyl, as well as stable species such as
allene, which resist further oxidation [13,14].
<p>
<h3>
4.6  Why were alkyl lead compounds added?
</h3>
The efficiency of a spark-ignited gasoline engine can be related to the
compression ratio up to at least compression ratio 17:1 [15]. However any
"knock" caused by the fuel will rapidly mechanically destroy an engine, and
General Motors was having major problems trying to improve engines without
inducing knock. The problem was to identify economic additives that could
be added to gasoline or kerosine to prevent knock, as it was apparent that
engine development was being hindered. The kerosine for home fuels soon
became a secondary issue, as the magnitude of the automotive knock problem
increased throughout the 1910s, and so more resources were poured into the
quest for an effective "anti-knock". A higher octane aviation gasoline was
required urgently once the US entered WWI, and almost every possible
chemical ( including melted butter ) was tested for anti-knock ability [16].
<p>
Originally, iodine was the best anti-knock available, but was not a practical
gasoline additive, and was used as the benchmark. In 1919 aniline was found
to have superior antiknock ability to iodine, but also was not a practical
additive, however aniline became the benchmark anti-knock, and various
compounds were compared to it. The discovery of tetra ethyl lead, and the
scavengers required to remove it from the engine were made by teams lead by
Thomas Midgley Jr. in 1922 [7,8,16]. They tried selenium oxychloride which
was an excellent antiknock, however it reacted with iron and "dissolved" the
engine. Midgley was able to predict that other organometallics would work,
and slowly focused on organoleads. They then had to remove the lead, which
would otherwise accumulate and coat the engine and exhaust system with lead.
They discovered and developed the halogenated lead scavengers that are still
used in leaded fuels. The scavengers, ( ethylene dibromide and ethylene
dichloride ), function by providing halogen atoms that react with the lead
to form volatile lead halide salts that can escape out the exhaust. The
quantity of scavengers added to the alkyl lead concentrate is calculated
according to the amount of lead present. If sufficient scavenger is added
to theoretically react with all the lead present, the amount is called one
"theory". Typically, 1.0 to 1.5 theories are used, but aviation gasolines
must only use one theory. This ensures there is no excess bromine that could
react with the engine. The alkyl leads rapidly became the most cost-effective
method of enhancing octane.
<p>
The development of the alkyl leads ( tetra methyl lead, tetra ethyl lead )
and the toxic halogenated scavengers meant that petroleum refiners could
then configure refineries to produce hydrocarbon  streams that would
increase octane with small quantities of alkyl lead. If you keep adding
alkyl lead compounds, the lead response of the gasoline decreases, and so
there are economic limits to how much lead should be added.
<p>
Up until the late 1960s, alkyl leads were added to gasolines in increasing
concentrations to obtain octane. The limit was 1.14g Pb/l, which is well
above the diminishing returns part of the lead response curve for most
refinery streams, thus it is unlikely that much fuel was ever made at that
level. I believe 1.05 was about the maximum, and articles suggest that 1970
100 RON premiums were about 0.7-0.8 g Pb/l and 94 RON regulars 0.6-0.7 g
Pb/l, which matches published lead response data [17] eg.

The alkyl lead anti-knocks work in a different stage of the pre-combustion
reaction to oxygenates. In contrast to oxygenates, the alkyl lead interferes
with hydrocarbon chain branching in the intermediate temperature range
where HO2 is the most important radical species. Lead oxide, either as
solid particles, or in the gas phase, reacts with HO2 and removes it from
the available radical pool, thereby deactivating the major chain branching
reaction sequence that results in undesirable, easily-autoignitable
hydrocarbons [13,14].
<p>
<h3>
4.7  Why not use other organometallic compounds?
</h3>
As the toxicity of the alkyl lead and the halogenated scavengers became of
concern, alternatives were considered. The most famous of these is
methylcyclopentadienyl manganese tricarbonyl (MMT), which was used in the
USA until banned by the EPA from 27 Oct 1978 [18], but is approved for use
in Canada and Australia. It is more expensive than alkyl leads and has been
reported to increase unburned hydrocarbon emissions and block exhaust
catalysts [19]. Other compounds that enhance octane have been suggested,
but usually have significant problems such as toxicity, cost, increased
engine wear etc.. Examples include dicyclopentadienyl iron and nickel
carbonyl.
<p>
<h3>
4.8  What do the refining processes do?
</h3>
Crude oil contains a wide range of hydrocarbons, organometallics and other
compounds containing sulfur, nitrogen etc. The HCs contain between 1 and 60
carbon atoms. Gasoline requires hydrocarbons with carbon atoms between 3 and
12, arranged in specific ways to provide the desirable properties. Obviously,
a refinery has to either sell the remainder as marketable products, or
convert the larger molecules into smaller gasoline molecules.
<p>
A refinery will distill crude oil into various fractions and, depending on
the desired final products, will further process and blend those fractions.
Typical final products could be:- gases for chemical synthesis and fuel
(CNG), liquified gases (LPG), butane, aviation and automotive gasolines,
aviation and lighting kerosines, diesels, distillate and residual fuel oils,
lubricating oil base grades, paraffin oils and waxes. Many of the common
processes are intended to increase the yield of blending feedstocks for
gasolines.
<p>
Typical modern refinery processes for gasoline components include<p>
<UL>
<LI>Catalytic cracking - breaks larger, higher-boiling, hydrocarbons into
  gasoline range product that contains 30% aromatics and 20-30% olefins.
<LI>Hydrocracking - cracks and adds hydrogen to molecules, producing a
  more saturated, stable, gasoline fraction.
<LI>Isomerisation - raises gasoline fraction octane by converting straight
  chain hydrocarbons into branched isomers.
<LI>Reforming - converts saturated, low octane, hydrocarbons into higher octane
  product containing about 60% aromatics.
<LI>Alkylation - reacts gaseous olefin streams with isobutane to produce liquid
  high octane iso-alkanes.
</UL>
The changes that the Clean Air Act and other legislation ensures that the
refineries will continue to modify their processes to produce a less
volatile gasoline with fewer toxins and toxic emissions. Options include:-<P>
<UL>
<LI>Reducing the "severity" of reforming to reduce aromatic production.
<LI>Distilling the C5/C6 fraction from reformer feeds and treating that
  stream to produce non-aromatic high octane components.
<LI>Distilling the higher boiling fraction ( which contains 80-100% of
  aromatics that can be hydrocracked ) from catalytic cracker product [20].
<LI>Convert butane to isobutane or isobutylene for alkylation or MTBE feed.
</UL>
<h3>
4.9  What energy is released when gasoline is burned?
</h3>
It is important to note that the theoretical energy content of gasoline
when burned in air is only related to the hydrogen and carbon contents.
Octane rating is not fundamentally related to the energy content, and the
actual hydrocarbon and oxygenate components used in the gasoline will
determine both the energy release and the anti-knock rating.
<P>
Two important reactions are:-<P>
<OL>
<LI>          C + O2 = CO2
<LI>          H + O2 = H2O
</OL>
The mass or volume of air required to provide sufficient oxygen to achieve
this complete combustion is the "stoichiometric" mass or volume of air.
Insufficient air = "rich", and excess air = "lean", and the stoichiometric
mass of air is related to the carbon:hydrogen ratio of the fuel. The
procedures for calculation of stoichiometric air/fuel ratios are fully
documented in an SAE standard [21].
<P>
Atomic masses used are:- Hydrogen = 1.00794, Carbon = 12.011,
Oxygen = 15.994, Nitrogen = 14.0067, and Sulfur = 32.066.

For normal heptane C7H16 with a molecular weight = 100.204 <p>
<pre>           C7H16 + 11O2 = 7CO2 + 8H2O</pre>
thus 1.000 kg of C7H16 required 3.513 kg of O2 = 15.179 kg air.<p>

The chemical stoichiometric combustion of hydrocarbons with oxygen
can be written as:-
<p>
<pre>CxHy + (x + (y/4))O2  ->  xCO2 + (y/2)H2O</pre>
Often, for simplicity, the remainder of air is assumed to be nitrogen,
which can be added to the equation when exhaust compositions are required.
As a general rule, maximum power is achieved at slightly rich, whereas
maximum fuel economy is achieved at slightly lean. <p>

The energy content of the gasoline is obtained by burning all the fuel
inside a bomb calorimeter and measuring the temperature increase.
The energy available depends on what happens to the water produced from the
combustion of the hydrogen. If the water remains as a gas, then it cannot
release the heat of vaporisation, thus producing the Nett Calorific Value.
If the water were condensed back to the original fuel temperature, then
Gross Calorific Value of the fuel, which will be larger, is obtained.<p>

The calorific values are fairly constant for families of HCs, which is not
surprising, given their fairly consistent carbon/hydrogen ratios. For liquid
( l ) or gaseous ( g ) fuel converted to gaseous products - except for the
2-methylbutene-2, where only gaseous is reported. * = Blending Octane Number<p>

Because all the data is available, the calorific value of fuels can be
estimated quite accurately from hydrocarbon fuel properties such as the
density, sulfur content, and aniline point ( which indicates the aromatics
content ).<p>

It should be noted that because oxygenates contain oxygen that can
not provide energy, they will have significantly lower energy contents.
They are added to provide octane, not energy. For an engine that can be
optimised for oxygenates, more fuel is required to obtain the same power,
but they can burn slightly more efficiently, thus the power ratio is not
identical to the energy content ratio. They also require more energy to
vaporise.<p>

Obviously, for automobiles, the nett calorific value is appropriate. The
calorific value is the maximum energy that can be obtained from the fuel,
but the reality of modern SI engines is that efficiencies of 20-40% may be
obtained, this limit being due to engineering and material constraints
that prevent optimum combustion conditions being used. The CI engine can
achieve higher efficiencies, usually over a wider operating range as well.

<h3>
4.10  What are the gasoline specifications?
</h3>
Gasolines are usually defined by government regulation, where properties and
test methods are clearly defined. In the US, several government and state
bodies can specify gasoline properties. The US gasoline specifications and
test methods are listed in several readily available publications, including
the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) [24], and the American Society for
Testing Materials (ASTM) [25]. The 1994 ASTM edition has:-<p>

D4814-93a Specification for Automotive Spark-Ignition Engine Fuel.<p>

This specification lists various properties that all fuels have to comply
with, and may be updated throughout the year. Typical properties are:- <p>
<h4>
4.10.1	Vapour Pressure and Distillation Classes.
</h4>
<i>6 different classes according to location and/or season.</i><p>
As gasoline is distilled, the temperatures at which various fractions are
evaporated are calculated. Specifications define the temperatures at which
various percentages of the fuel are evaporated. Distillation limits
include maximum temperatures that 10% is evaporated (50-70C), 50% is
evaporated (110-121C), 90% is evaporated (185-190C), and the final boiling
point (225C). A minimum temperature for 50% evaporated (77C), and a maximum
amount of Residue (2%) after distillation.  Vapour pressure limits for
each class ( 54, 62, 69, 79, 93, 103 kPa ) are also specified. Note that the
EPA has issued a waiver that does not require gasoline/ethanol blends to
meet the required specifications.<p>
<h4>
4.10.2 Vapour Lock Protection Classes
</h4>
5 classes for vapour lock protection, according to location and/or season.
The limit is a maximum Vapour/Liquid ratio of 20 at test temperatures of
41, 47, 51, 56, 60C.<p>
<h4>
4.10.3 Antiknock Index   ( aka (RON+MON)/2, "Pump Octane" )
</h4>
<i>The ( Research Octane Number + Motor Octane Number ) divided by two.</i> Limits
are not specified, but changes in engine requirements according season and
location are discussed. Fuels with an Antiknock index of 87, 89, 91
( Unleaded), and 88 ( Leaded ) are listed as typical for the US.<p>

<h4>4.10.4 Lead Content</h4>
Leaded = 1.1 g Pb / L maximum, and Unleaded = 0.013 g Pb / L maximum.
<p>
<h4>
4.10.5 Copper strip corrosion
</h4>
<i>Ability to tarnish clean copper, indicating the presence of any corrosive
sulfur compounds </i>
<p>
<h4>
4.10.6 Maximum Sulfur content
</h4>
Sulfur adversely affects exhaust catalysts and fuel hydrocarbon lead
response, and also may be emitted as polluting sulfur oxides.
<p>
Leaded = 0.15 %mass maximum, and Unleaded = 0.10 %mass maximum.
<p>
Typical US gasoline levels are 0.03 %mass.
<p>
<h4>
4.10.7 Maximum Existent Gum
</h4>
<i>Limits the amount of gums present in fuel at the time of testing to
5 mg/100mls.</i> The results do not correlate well with actual engine deposits
caused by fuel vaporisation [26].
<p>
<h4>
4.10.8 Minimum Oxidation Stability
</h4>
This ensures the fuel remains chemically stable, and does not form additional
gums during periods in distribution systems, which can be up to 3-6 months.
The sample is heated with oxygen inside a pressure vessel, and the delay
until significant oxygen uptake is measured.
 <p>
<h4>
4.10.9 Water Tolerance
</h4>
<i>Highest temperature that causes phase separation of oxygenated fuels.</i>
The limits vary according to location and month. For Alaska - North of 62
latitude, it changes from -41C in Dec/Jan to 9C in July, but remains 10C all
year in Hawaii.<p>

As well as the above, there are various restrictions introduced by the Clean
Air Act and state bodies such as California's Air Resources Board (CARB) that
often have more stringent limits for the above properties, as well as
additional limits. The Clean Air Act also specifies some regions that exceed
air quality standards have to use reformulated gasolines (RFGs) all year,
starting January 1995. Other regions are required to use oxygenated
gasolines for four winter months, beginning November 1992. The RFGs also
contain oxygenates. Metropolitan regions with severe ozone air quality
problems must use reformulated gasolines in 1995 that;- contain at least
2.0 wt% oxygen, reduce 1990 volatile organic carbon compounds by 15%, and
reduce specified toxic emissions by 15% (1995) and 25% (2000). Metropolitan
regions that exceeded carbon monoxide limits were required to use gasolines
with 2.7 wt% oxygen during winter months, starting in 1992. <p>

Because phosphorus adversely affects exhaust catalysts, the EPA limits
phosphorus in all gasolines to 0.0013 gP/L.<p>

The 1990 Clean Air Act (CAA) amendments and CARB phase 2 (1996)
specifications for reformulated gasoline establish the following limits,
compared with typical 1990 gasoline. Because of a lack of data, the EPA
were unable to define the CAA required parameters , so they instituted
a two-stage system. The first stage, the "Simple Model" is an interim
stage that run from 1/Jan/1995 to 1/May/1997. The second stage, the
"Complex Model" would be developed, with the following parameters likely
to be controlled - reid vapour pressure, benzene, oxygen, sulfur, olefins
distillation ( 90% Evaporated ), and aromatics. Each refiner must have
their RFG recertified using the Complex model by 1/May/1997 [27].<p>

90% evaporated        170 C              -              149 C
</pre>
These regulations also specify emissions criteria. eg CAA specifies no
increase in nitric oxides (NOx) emissions, reductions in VOC by 15% during
the ozone season, and specified toxins by 15% all year. These criteria
indirectly establish vapour pressure and composition limits that refiners
have to meet. Note that the EPA also can issue CAA Section 211 waivers that
allow refiners to choose which oxygenates they use. In 1981, the EPA also
decided that fuels with up to 2% alcohols and ethers (except methanol) were
"substantially similar" to 1974 unleaded gasoline, and thus were not "new"
gasoline additives. That level was increased to 2.7 wt% in 1991. Some other
oxygenates have also been granted waivers, eg ethanol to 3.5 wt% in
1979/1982, and tert-butyl alcohol to 3.5 wt% in 1981. <p>
<h3>
4.11 What are the effects of the specified fuel properties?
</h3>
<i>Volatility</i> <p>
This affects evaporative emissions and driveability, it is the property that
must change with location and season. Fuel for mid-summer Arizona would be
difficult to use in mid-winter Alaska. The US is divided into zones,
according to altitude and seasonal temperatures, and the fuel volatility is
adjusted accordingly. Incorrect fuel may result in difficult starting in
cold weather, carburetter icing, vapour lock in hot weather, and crankcase
oil dilution. Volatility is controlled by distillation and vapour pressure
specifications. The higher boiling fractions of the gasoline have significant
effects on the emission levels of undesirable hydrocarbons and aldehydes,
and a reduction of 40C in the final boiling point will reduce the levels of
benzene, butadiene, formaldehyde and acetaldehyde by 25%, and will reduce
HC emissions by 20% [28].<p>

<i>Combustion Characteristics
</i><p>
As gasolines contain mainly hydrocarbons, the only significant variable
between different grades is the octane rating of the fuel, as most other
properties are similar. Octane is discussed in detail in Section 6. There
are only slight differences in combustion temperatures ( most are around
2000C in isobaric adiabatic combustion [29]). Note that the actual
temperature in the combustion chamber is also determined by other factors,
such as load and engine design. The addition of oxygenates changes the
pre-flame reaction pathways, and also reduces the energy content of the fuel.
The levels of oxygen in the fuel is regulated according to regional air
quality standards.<p>

<i>Stability<p>
</i>Motor gasolines may be stored up to six months, consequently they must not
form gums which may precipitate. Gums are usually the result of
copper-catalysed reactions of the unsaturated HCs, so antioxidants and metal
deactivators are added. Existent Gum is used to measure the gum in the fuel
at the time tested, whereas the Oxidation Stability measures the time it
takes for the gasoline to break down at 100C with 100psi of oxygen. A 240
minutes test period has been found to be sufficient for most storage and
distribution systems.<p>

<i>Corrosiveness<p>
</i>Sulfur in the fuel creates corrosion, and when combusted will form corrosive
gases that attack the engine, exhaust and environment. Sulfur also adversely
affects the alkyl lead octane response and may poison exhaust catalysts. The
copper strip corrosion test and the sulfur specification are used to ensure
fuel quality. The copper strip test measures active sulfur, whereas the
sulfur content reports the total sulfur present.<p>

<h3>4.12 Are brands different?
</h3>
Yes. The above specifications are intended to ensure minimal quality
standards are maintained, however as well as the fuel hydrocarbons, the
manufacturers add their own special ingredients to provide additional
benefits. A quality gasoline additive package would include:-<p>
<UL>
<LI>octane-enhancing additives ( improve octane ratings )
<LI>anti-oxidants ( inhibit gum formation, improve stability )
<LI>metal deactivators ( inhibit gum formation, improve stability )
<LI>deposit modifiers ( reduce deposits, spark-plug fouling and
  preignition )
<LI>surfactants ( prevent icing, improve vaporisation, inhibit deposits,
  reduce NOx emissions )
<LI>freezing point depressants ( prevent icing )
<LI>corrosion inhibitors ( prevent gasoline corroding storage tanks )
<LI>dyes ( product colour for safety or regulatory purposes ).
</UL>
During the 1980s significant problems with deposits accumulating on intake
valve surfaces occurred as new fuel injections systems were introduced.
These intake valve deposits (IVD) were different to the injector deposits,
in part because the valve can reach 300C. Engine design changes that prevent
deposits usually consist of ensuring the valve is flushed with liquid
gasoline, and provision of adequate valve rotation. Gasoline factors that
cause deposits are the presence of alcohols or olefins. Gasoline
manufacturers now routinely use additives that prevent IVD and also maintain
the cleanliness of injectors. These usually include a surfactant and light
oil to maintain the wetting of important surfaces. A more detailed
description of additives is provided in Section 9.1.<p>

Texaco demonstrated that a well-formulated package could improve fuel
economy, reduce NOx emissions, and restore engine performance because, as
well as the traditional liquid-phase deposit removal, some additives can
work in the vapour phase to remove existing engine deposits without
adversely affecting performance ( as happens when water is poured into a
running engine to remove carbon deposits:-) )[30]. Most suppliers of quality
gasolines will formulate similar additives into their products, and cheaper
lines are less like to have such additives added. As different brands use
different additives and oxygenates, it is probable that important parameters,
such as octane distribution, are different, even though the pump octane
ratings are the same. <p>

So, if you know your car is well-tuned, and in good condition, but the
driveability is pathetic on the correct octane, try another brand. Remember
that the composition will change with the season, so if you lose
driveability, try yet another brand. As various Clean Air Act changes are
introduced over the next few years, gasoline will continue to change.
<h3>
4.13 What is a typical composition?

There seems to be a perception that all gasolines of one octane grade are
chemically similar, and thus general rules can be promulgated about "energy
content ", "flame speed", "combustion temperature" etc. etc.. Nothing is
further from the truth. The behaviour of manufactured gasolines in octane
rating engines can be predicted, using previous octane ratings of special
blends intended to determine how a particular refinery stream responds to an
octane-enhancing additive. Refiners can design and reconfigure refineries to
efficiently produce a wide range of gasolines feedstocks, depending on
market and regulatory requirements.<p>

The last 10 years of various compositional changes to gasolines for
environmental and health reasons have resulted in fuels that do not follow
historical rules, and the regulations mapped out for the next decade also
ensure the composition will remain in a state of flux. The reformulated
gasoline specifications, especially the 1/May/1997 Complex model, will
probably introduce major reductions in the distillation range, as well as
the various limits on composition and emissions.<p>

I'm not going to list all 500+ HCs in gasolines, but the following are
representative of the various classes typically present in a gasoline. The
numbers after each chemical are:- Research Blending Octane : Motor Blending
Octane : Boiling Point (C): Density (g/ml @ 15C) : Minimum Autoignition
Temperature (C). It is important to realise that the Blending Octanes are
derived from a 20% mix of the HC with a 60:40 iC8:nC7 base, and the
extrapolation of this 20% to 100%. This is different from rating the pure
fuel, which often requires adjustment of the test engine conditions outside
the acceptable limits of the rating methods. Generally the actual octanes of
the pure fuel are similar for the alkanes, but are up to 30 octane numbers
lower than the blending octanes for the aromatics and olefins [31].  <p>

A traditional composition I have dreamed up would be like the following,
whereas newer oxygenated fuels reduce the aromatics and olefins, narrow the
boiling range, and add oxygenates up to about 12-15% to provide the octane.<p>

There are some other properties of oxygenates that have to be considered
when they are going to be used as fuels, particularly their ability to
form very volatile azeotropes that cause the fuel's vapour pressure to
increase, the chemical nature of the emissions, and their tendency to
separate into a separate water/oxygenate phase when water is present.
The reformulated gasolines address these problems more successfully than
the original oxygenated gasolines.<p>

Before you rush out to make a highly aromatic or olefinic gasoline to
produce a high octane fuel, remember they have other adverse properties,
eg the aromatics attack elastomers and generate smoke, and the olefins are
unstable ( besides smelling foul ) and form gums. The art of correctly
formulating a gasoline that does not cause engines to knock apart, does not
cause vapour lock in summer - but is easy to start in winter, does not form
gums and deposits, burns cleanly without soot/residues, and does not dissolve
or poison the car catalyst or owner, is based on knowledge of the gasoline
composition.<p>
<h3>
4.14 Is gasoline toxic or carcinogenic?
</h3>
There are several known toxins in gasoline, some of which are confirmed
human carcinogens. The most famous of these toxins are lead and benzene, and
both are regulated. The other aromatics and some toxic olefins are also
controlled. Lead alkyls also require ethylene dibromide and/or ethylene
dichloride scavengers to be added to the gasoline, both of which are
suspected human carcinogens. In 1993 an International Symposium on the Health
Effects of Gasoline was held [32]. Major review papers on the carcinogenic,
neurotoxic, reproductive and developmental toxicity of gasoline, additives,
and oxygenates were presented. The oxygenates are also being evaluated for
carcinogenicity, and even ethanol and ETBE may be carcinogens. It should
be noted that the oxygenated gasolines were not expected to reduce the
toxicity of the emissions, however the reformulated gasolines will produce
different emissions, and specific toxins must be reduced by 15% all year.<p>

There is little doubt that gasoline is full of toxic chemicals, and should
therefore be treated with respect. However the biggest danger remains the
flammability, and the relative hazards should always be kept in perspective.
The major toxic risk from gasolines comes from breathing the tailpipe,
evaporative, and refuelling emissions, rather than occasional skin contact
from spills. Breathing vapours and skin contact should always be minimised.<p>
<h3>
4.15 Is unleaded gasoline more toxic than leaded?
</h3>
The short answer is no. However that answer is not global, as some countries
have replaced the lead compound octane-improvers with aromatic or olefin
octane-improvers without introducing exhaust catalysts. Some aromatics are
more toxic that paraffins. Unfortunately, the manufacturers of alkyl lead
compounds have embarked on a worldwide misinformation campaign in countries
considering emulating the lead-free US. The use of lead precludes the use of
exhaust catalysts, thus the emissions of aromatics are only slightly
diminished, and other pollutants can not reduced by exhaust catalysts. <p>

The use of unleaded on modern vehicles with engine management systems and
catalysts can reduce aromatic emissions to 10% of the level of vehicles
without catalysts [33]. Alkyl lead additives can only substitute for some of
the aromatics in gasoline, consequently they do not eliminate aromatics,
which will produce benzene emissions [34]. Alkyl lead additives also require
toxic organohalogen scavengers, which also react in the engine to form and
emit other organohalogens, including highly toxic dioxin [35]. Leaded fuels
emit lead, organohalogens, and much higher levels of regulated toxins
because they preclude the use of exhaust catalysts. In the USA the gasoline
composition is being changed to reduce fuel toxins ( olefins, aromatics )
as well as emissions of specific toxins. <p>

Subject: 5. Why is Gasoline Composition Changing?</b><p>
5.1  Why pick on cars and gasoline?
</h3>
Cars emit several pollutants as combustion products out the tailpipe,
(tailpipe emissions), and as losses due to evaporation (evaporative
emissions, refuelling emissions). The volatile organic carbon (VOC)
emissions from these sources, along with nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions
from the tailpipe, will react in the presence of ultraviolet light
(wavelengths of less than 430nm) to form ground-level (tropospheric) ozone,
which is one of the major components of photochemical smog [36]. Smog has
been a major pollution problem ever since coal-fired power stations were
developed in urban areas, but their emissions are being cleaned up. Now it's
the turn of the automobile.<p>

Cars currently use gasoline that is derived from fossil fuels, thus when
gasoline is burned to completion, it produces additional CO2 that is added
to the atmospheric burden. The effect of the additional CO2 on the global
environment is not known, but the quantity of man-made emissions of fossil
fuels must cause the system to move to a new equilibrium. Even if current
research doubles the efficiency of the IC engine/gasoline combination, and
reduces HC, CO, NOx, SOx, VOCs, particulates, and carbonyls, the amount of
carbon dioxide from the use of fossil fuels may still cause global warming.
More and more scientific evidence is accumulating that warming is occurring
[37]. The issue is whether it is natural, or induced by human activities.
There are international agreements to limit CO2 emissions to 1990 levels,
a target that will require more efficient, lighter, or appropriately-sized
vehicles, - if we are to maintain the current usage. One option is to use
"renewable" fuels in place of fossil fuels. Consider the amount of
energy-related CO2 emissions for selected countries in 1990 [38].<p>

The number of new vehicles provides an indication of the magnitude of the

then dipped to 324.2 (1991), and has continued to rise since then to reach
335.6 million tonnes in 1993. In 1993 the total world production of crude oil
was 3164.8 million tonnes, of which the USA consumed 787.5 million tonnes
[40]. Transport is a very significant user of crude oil products, thus
improving the efficiency of utilisation, and minimising pollution from
vehicles, can produce immediate reductions in emissions of CO2, HCs, VOCs,
CO, NOx, carbonyls, and other chemicals. <p>
<h3>
5.2  Why are there seasonal changes?
</h3>
Only gaseous hydrocarbons burn, consequently if the air is cold, then the
fuel has to be very volatile. But when summer comes, a volatile fuel can
boil and cause vapour lock, as well as producing high levels of evaporative
emissions. The solution was to adjust the volatility of the fuel according
to altitude and ambient temperature. This volatility change has been
automatically performed for decades by the oil companies without informing
the public of the changes. It is one reason why storage of gasoline through
seasons is not a good idea. Gasoline volatility is being reduced as modern
engines, with their fuel injection and management systems, can automatically
compensate for some of the changes in ambient conditions - such as altitude
and air temperature, resulting in acceptable driveability using less volatile
fuel.<p>
<h3>
5.3  Why were alkyl lead compounds removed?
</h3>
" With the exception of one premium gasoline marketed on the east coast
and southern areas of the US, all automotive gasolines from the mid-1920s
until 1970 contained lead antiknock compounds to increase antiknock quality.
Because lead antiknock compounds were found to be detrimental to the
performance of catalytic emission control system then under development,
U.S. passenger car manufacturers in 1971 began to build engines designed to
operate satisfactorily on gasolines of nominal 91 Research Octane Number.
Some of these engines were designed to operate on unleaded fuel while others
required leaded fuel or the occasional use of leaded fuel. The 91 RON was
chosen in the belief that unleaded gasoline at this level could be made
available in quantities required using then current refinery processing
equipment. Accordingly, unleaded and low-lead gasolines were introduced
during 1970 to supplement the conventional gasolines already available.<p>

Beginning with the 1975 model year, most new car models were equipped
with catalytic exhaust treatment devices as one means of compliance with
the 1975 legal restrictions in the U.S. on automobile emissions. The need
for gasolines that would not adversely affect such catalytic devices has
led to the large scale availability and growing use of unleaded gasolines,
with all late-model cars requiring unleaded gasoline."[41].<p>

There was a further reason why alkyl lead compounds were subsequently
reduced, and that was the growing recognition of the highly toxic nature of
the emissions from a leaded-gasoline fuelled engine. Not only were toxic
lead emissions produced, but the added toxic lead scavengers ( ethylene
dibromide and ethylene dichloride ) could react with hydrocarbons to produce
highly toxic organohalogen emissions such as dioxin. Even if catalysts were
removed, or lead-tolerant catalysts discovered, alkyl lead compounds would
remain banned because of their toxicity and toxic emissions [42].
<h3>
5.4  Why are evaporative emissions a problem?
</h3>
As tailpipe emissions are reduced due to improved exhaust emission control
systems, the hydrocarbons produced by evaporation of the gasoline during
distribution, vehicle refuelling, and from the vehicle, become more and
more significant. A recent European study found that 40% of man-made
volatile organic compounds came from vehicles [43]. Many of the problem
hydrocarbons are the aromatics and olefins that have relatively high octane
values. Any sensible strategy to reduce smog and toxic emissions will attack
evaporative and tailpipe emissions. <p>

The health risks to service station workers, who are continuously exposed
to refuelling emissions remain a concern [44]. Vehicles will soon be
required to trap the refuelling emissions in larger carbon canisters, as
well as the normal evaporative emissions that they already capture. This
recent decision went in favour of the oil companies, who were opposed by the
auto companies. The automobile manufacturers felt the service station
should trap the emissions. The activated carbon canisters adsorb organic
vapours, and these are subsequently desorbed from the canister and burnt in
the engine during normal operation, once certain vehicle speeds and coolant
temperatures are reached. A few activated carbons used in older vehicles
do not function efficiently with oxygenates.<p>
<h3>
5.5  Why control tailpipe emissions?
</h3>
Tailpipe emissions were responsible for the majority of pollutants in the
late 1960s after the crankcase emissions had been controlled. Ozone levels
in the Los Angeles basin reached 450-500ppb in the early 1970s, well above
the typical background of 30-50ppb [45].<p>

Tuning a carburetted engine can only have a marginal effect on pollutant
levels, and there still had to be some frequent, but long-term, assessment
of the state of tuning. Exhaust catalysts offered a post-engine solution
that could ensure pollutants were converted to more benign compounds. As
engine management systems and fuel injection systems have developed, the
volatility properties of the gasoline have been tuned to minimise
evaporative emissions, and yet maintain low exhaust emissions.<p>

The design of the engine can have very significant effects on the type and
quantity of pollutants, eg unburned hydrocarbons in the exhaust originate
mainly from combustion chamber crevices, such as the gap between the piston
and cylinder wall, where the combustion flame can not completely use the HCs.
The type and amount of unburned hydrocarbons are related to the fuel
composition (volatility, olefins, aromatics, final boiling point), as well
as state of tune, engine condition, and age/condition of the engine
lubricating oil [46]. Particulate emissions, especially the size fraction
smaller than ten micrometres, are a serious health concern. The current
major source is from compression ignition ( CI = diesel ) engines, and the
modern SI engine system has no problem meeting regulatory requirements.<p>

The ability of reformulated gasolines to actually reduce smog has not yet
been confirmed. The composition changes will reduce some compounds, and
increase others, making predictions of environmental consequences extremely
difficult. Planned future changes, such as the CAA 1997 Complex model
specifications, that are based on several major ongoing government/industry
gasoline and emission research programmes, are more likely to provide
unambiguous environmental improvements. The rules for tailpipe emissions
will continue to become more stringent as countries try to minimise local
problems ( smog, toxins etc.) and global problems ( CO2 ). Reformulation
does not always lower all emissions, as evidenced by the following aldehydes
from an engine with an adaptive learning management
system [33]. <p>

There are several bodies responsible for establishing standards, and they
promulgate test cycles, analysis procedures, and the % of new vehicles that
must comply each year. The test cycles and procedures do change ( usually

It's also worth noting that exhaust catalysts also emit platinum, and the
soluble platinum salts are some of the most potent sensitizers known.
Early research [49] reported the presence of 10% water-soluble platinum in
the emissions, however later work on monolithic catalysts has determined the
quantities of water soluble platinum emissions are negligible [50]. The
particle size of the emissions has also been determined, and the emissions
have been correlated with increasing vehicle speed. Increasing speed also
increases the exhaust gas temperature and velocity, indicating the emissions
are probably a consequence of physical attrition.<p>

Using the estimated fuel consumption, and about 10m3 of exhaust gas per
litre of gasoline, the emissions are 2-40ng/km. These are 2-3 orders
of magnitude lower than earlier reported work on pelletised catalysts.
These emissions may be controlled directly in the future. They are currently
indirectly controlled by the cost of platinum, and the new requirement for
the catalyst to have an operational life of at least 100,000 miles.<p>
<h3>
5.6  Why do exhaust catalysts influence fuel composition?
</h3>
Modern adaptive learning engine management systems control the combustion
stoichiometry by monitoring various ambient and engine parameters, including
exhaust gas recirculation rates, the air flow sensor, and exhaust oxygen
sensor outputs, This closed loop system using the oxygen sensor can
compensate for changes in fuel content and air density. The oxygen sensor
is also known as the lambda sensor, because the stoichiometric mass Air/Fuel
ratio is known as lambda. Typical stoichiometric air/fuel ratios are [51]:- <p>
<pre>
 6.4  methanol
 9.0  ethanol
11.7  MTBE
12.1  ETBE, TAME
14.6  gasoline without oxygenates
</pre>
The engine management system rapidly switches the stoichiometry between
slightly rich and slightly lean, except under wide open throttle conditions
- when the system runs open loop. The  response of the oxygen sensor to
composition changes is about 3 ms, and closed loop switching is typically
1-3 times a second, going between 50mV ( lambda = 1.05 (Lean)) to  900mV
(lambda = 0.99 ( Rich)). The catalyst oxidises about 80% of the H2, CO,
and HCs, and reduces the NOx [47]. <p>
<pre>
Typical reactions that occur in a modern 3-way catalyst are:-
                2H2 + O2  ->  2H2O
                2CO + O2  ->  2CO2
    CxHy + (x + (y/4))O2  ->  xCO2 + (y/2)H2O
               2CO + 2NO  ->  N2 + 2CO2
   CxHy + 2(x + (y/4))NO  ->  (x + (y/4))N2 + (y/2)H2O + xCO2
               2H2 + 2NO  ->  N2 + 2H2O
                CO + H20  ->  CO2 + H2
             CxHy + xH2O  ->  xCO + (x + (y/2))H2
</pre>
The use of exhaust catalysts have resulted in reaction pathways that can
accidentally be responsible for increased pollution. An example is the
CARB-mandated reduction of fuel sulfur. A change from 450ppm to 50ppm, which
will reduce HC & CO emissions by 20%, may increase formaldehyde by 45% [19]. <p>

The requirement that the exhaust catalysts must now endure for 10 years or
100,000 miles will also encourage automakers to push for lower levels of
known catalyst "poisons" such as sulfur and phosphorus in both the gasoline
and lubricant. Modern catalysts are unable to reduce the relatively high
levels of NOx that are produced during lean operation down to approved
levels, thus preventing the application of lean-burn engine technology.
Recently Mazda has announced they have developed a "lean burn" catalyst,
which may enable automakers to move the fuel combustion towards the lean
side, and different gasoline properties may be required to optimise the
combustion and reduce pollution. Mazda claim that fuel efficiency is
improved by 5-8% while meeting all emission regulations [52] . <p>

Catalysts also inhibit the selection of gasoline octane-improving and
cleanliness additives ( such as MMT and phosphorus-containing additives )
that may result in refractory compounds known to physically coat the
catalyst and increase pollution. <p>
<h3>
5.7  Why are "cold start" emissions so important?
</h3>
The catalyst requires heat to reach the temperature ( >300-350C ) where it
functions most efficiently, and the delay until it reaches operating
temperature can produce more hydrocarbons than would be produced during
the remainder of many typical urban short trips. It has been estimated that
70-80% of the non-methane HCs that escape conversion by the catalysts
are emitted during the first two minutes after a cold start. As exhaust
emissions have been reduced, the significance of the evaporative emissions
increases. Several engineering techniques are being developed, including the
Ford Exhaust Gas Igniter ( uses a flame to heat the catalyst - lots of
potential problems ), zeolite hydrocarbon traps, and relocation of the
catalyst closer to the engine [47]. <p>

Reduced gasoline volatility and composition changes, along with cleanliness
additives and engine management systems, can help minimise cold start
emissions, but currently the most effective technique appears to be rapid,
deliberate heating of the catalyst, and the new generation of low thermal
inertia  "fast light-up" catalysts reduce the problem, but further research
is necessary [53].<p>

As the evaporative emissions are also starting to be reduced, the emphasis
has shifted to the refuelling emissions. These will be mainly controlled
on the vehicle, and larger canisters may be used to trap the vapours emitted
during refuelling. <p>
<h3>
5.8  When will the emissions be "clean enough"?
</h3>
The California ZEV regulations effectively preclude IC vehicles, because
they stipulate zero emissions. However, the concept of regulatory forcing
of alternative vehicle propulsion technology may have to be modified to
include hybrid or fuel-cell vehicles, as the major failing of EVs remains
the lack of a cheap, light, safe, and  easily-rechargeable electrical
storage device [54,55]. There are several major projects intending to
further reduce emissions from automobiles, mainly focusing on vehicle mass
and engine fuel efficiency, but gasoline specifications and alternative
fuels are also being investigated. It may be that changes to IC engines and
gasolines will enable the IC engine to continue well into the 21st century
as the prime motive force for personal transportation. <p>
<h3>
5.9  Why are only some gasoline compounds restricted?
</h3>
The less volatile hydrocarbons in gasoline are not released in significant
quantities during normal use, and the more volatile alkanes are considerably
less toxic than many other chemicals encountered daily. The newer gasoline
additives also have potentially undesirable properties before they are even
combusted. Most hydrocarbons are very insoluble in water, with the lower
aromatics being the most soluble, however the addition of oxygen to
hydrocarbons significantly increases the mutual solubility with water.<p>

</pre>
The concentrations and ratios of benzene, toluene, ethyl benzene, and xylenes
( BTEX ) in water are often used to monitor groundwater contamination from
gasoline storage tanks or pipelines. The oxygenates and other new additives
may increase the extent of water and soil pollution by acting as co-solvents
for HCs. <p>

Various government bodies ( EPA, OSHA, NIOSH ) are charged with ensuring
people are not exposed to unacceptable chemical hazards, and maintain
ongoing research into the toxicity of liquid gasoline contact, water and soil
pollution, evaporative emissions, and tailpipe emissions [56]. As toxicity
is found, the quantities in gasoline of the specific chemical ( benzene ),
or family of chemicals ( alkyl leads, aromatics, olefins ) are regulated.<p>

The recent dramatic changes caused by the need to reduce alkyl leads,
halogens, olefins, aromatics has resulted in whole new families of compounds
( ethers, alcohols ) being introduced into fuels without prior detailed
toxicity studies being completed. If adverse results appear, these compounds
are also likely to be regulated to protect people and the environment. <p>

Also, as the chemistry of emissions is unravelled, the chemical precursors
to toxic tailpipe emissions ( such as higher aromatics that produce benzene
emissions ) are also controlled, even if they are not toxic.<p>
<h3>
5.10 What does "renewable" fuel/oxygenate mean?
</h3>
The general definition of "renewable" is that the carbon originates from
recent biomass, and thus does not contribute to the increased CO2 emissions.
A truly "long-term" view could claim that fossil fuels are "renewable" on a
100 million year timescale :-). There is currently a major battle between
the ethanol/ETBE lobby ( agricultural, corn growing ), and the methanol/MTBE
lobby ( oil company, petrochemical ) over an EPA mandate demanding that a
specific percentage of the oxygenates in gasoline are produced from
"renewable" sources [57].  <p>

Unfortunately, "renewable" ethanol is not cost competitive when crude oil
is $18/bbl, so a federal subsidy ( $0.54/US Gallon ) and additional state
subsidies ( 11 states - from $0.08(Michigan) to $0.66(Tenn.)/US Gal.) are
provided. A judgement on the use of "renewable" oxygenates is expected in
early 1995.<p>
<h3>
5.11 Will oxygenated gasoline damage my vehicle?
</h3>
The following comments assume that your vehicle was designed to operate on
unleaded, if not, then damage like valve seat recession may also occur.
Damage should not occur if the gasoline is correctly formulated, and you
select the appropriate octane, but oxygenated gasoline will hurt your pocket.
In the first year of mandated oxygenates, it appears some refiners did not
carefully formulate their oxygenated gasoline, and driveability and emissions
problems occurred. Most reputable brands are now carefully formulated.
Some older activated carbon canisters may not function efficiently with
oxygenated gasolines, but this is a function of the type of carbon used.
How your vehicle responds to oxygenated gasoline depends on the engine
management system and state of tune. A modern system will automatically
compensate for all of the currently-permitted oxygenate levels, thus your
fuel consumption will increase. Older, poorly-maintained, engines may
require a tune up to maintain acceptable driveability.<p>

Be prepared to try several different brands of reformulated gasolines to
identify the most suitable brand for your vehicle, and be prepared to change
again with the seasons. This is because the refiners can choose the
oxygenate they use to meet the regulations, and may choose to set some fuel
properties, such as volatility, differently to their competitors. <p>

Most stories of corrosion etc, are derived from anhydrous methanol corrosion
of light metals (aluminum, magnesium), however the addition of either 0.5%
water to pure methanol, or corrosion inhibitors to methanol/gasoline blends
will prevent this. If you observe corrosion, talk to your gasoline supplier.
Oxygenated fuels may either swell or shrink some elastomers on older cars,
depending on the aromatic and olefin content of the fuels. Cars later than
1990 should not experience compatibility problems, and cars later than 1994
should not experience driveability problems, but they will experience
increased fuel consumption, depending on the state of tune and engine
management system.  <p>
<h3>
5.12 What does "reactivity" of emissions mean?
</h3>
The traditional method of exhaust regulations was to specify the actual HC,
CO, NOx, and particulate contents. With the introduction of oxygenates and
reformulated gasolines, the volatile organic carbon (VOC) species in the
exhaust also changed. The "reactivity" refers to the ozone-forming potential
of the VOC emissions when they react with NOx, and is being introduced as a
regulatory means of ensuring that automobile emissions do actually reduce
smog formation. The ozone-forming potential of chemicals is defined as the
number of molecules of ozone formed per VOC carbon atom, and this is called
the Incremental Reactivity. Typical values ( big is bad :-) ) are [45]:<p>

<h3>
5.13 What are "carbonyl" compounds?
</h3>
Carbonyls are produced in large amounts under lean operating conditions,
especially when oxygenated fuels are used. Most carbonyls are toxic, and the
carboxylic acids can corrode metals. The emission of carbonyls can be
controlled by combustion stoichiometry and exhaust catalysts.  <p>
Typical carbonyls are:-<p>
<UL>
<LI>aldehydes ( containing -CHO ),
  <UL>
	<LI>formaldehyde (HCHO) - which is formed in large amounts during lean
                          combustion of methanol [58].
	<LI>acetaldehyde (CH2CHO) - which is formed during ethanol combustion.
	<LI>acrolein (CH2=CHCHO) - a very potent irritant.
  </UL>
<LI>ketones ( containing C=0 ),
<LI>acetone (CH3COCH3)
<LI>carboxylic acids ( containing -COOH ),
  <UL>
	<LI>formic acid (HCOOH) - formed during lean methanol combustion.
	<LI>acetic acid (CH3COOH).

<h3>
5.14 What are "gross polluters"?
</h3>
It has always been known that the EPA emissions tests do not reflect real
world conditions. There have been several attempts to identify vehicles on
the road that do not comply with emissions standards. Recent remote sensing
surveys have demonstrated that the highest 10% of CO emitters produce over
50% of the pollution, and the same ratio applies for the HC emitters - which
may not be the same vehicles [59,60,61]. 20% of the CO emitters are
responsible for 80% of the CO emissions, consequently modifying gasoline
composition is only one aspect of pollution reduction. The new additives can
help maintain engine condition, but they can not compensate for out-of-tune,
worn, or tampered-with engines.<p>

The most famous of these remote sensing systems is the FEAT ( Fuel Efficiency
Automobile Test ) team from the University of Denver [62]. This team is
probably the world leader in remote sensing of auto emissions to identify
grossly polluting vehicles. The system measures CO/CO2 ratio, and the
HC/CO2 ratio in the exhaust of vehicles passing through an infra-red light
beam crossing the road 25cm above the surface. The system also includes a

CO, CO2, and HC. The system is effective for traffic lanes up to 18 metres
wide, however rain, snow, and water spray can cause scattering of the beam.
Reference signals monitor such effects and, if possible, compensate. The
system has been comprehensively validated, including using vehicles with
on-board emissions monitoring instruments.<p>

They can monitor up to 1000 vehicles an hour and, as an example,they were
invited to Provo, Utah to monitor vehicles, and gross polluters would be
offered free repairs [63]. They monitored over 10,000 vehicles and mailed
114 letters to owners of vehicles newer than 1965 that had demonstrated high
CO levels. They received 52 responses and repairs started in Dec 1991, and
continued to Mar 1992. They offered to purchase two vehicles at blue book
price.  They were declined, and so attempted to modify those vehicles, even
though their condition did not justify the expense. <p>

As observed elsewhere, over half the CO was emitted by about 10% of the
vehicles. If the 47 worst polluting vehicles were removed, that achieves
more than removing the 2,500 lowest emitting vehicles from the total tested
fleet.<p>

Surveys of vehicle populations have demonstrated that emissions systems had
been tampered with on over 40% of the gross polluters, and an additional 20%
had defective emission control equipment [64]. No matter what changes are
made to gasoline, if owners "tune" their engines for power, then the majority
of such "tuned" vehicle will become gross polluters. Professional repairs to
gross polluters usually improves fuel consumption, resulting in a low cost to
owners ( $32/pa/Ton CO year ). The removal of CO in the Provo example above
was costed at $200/Ton CO, compared to Inspection and Maintenance programs
($780/Ton CO ), and oxygenates ( $1034-$1264/Ton CO in Colorado 1991-2 ), and
UNOCALs vehicle scrapping programme ( $1025/Ton of all pollutants ).<p>

Thus, identifying and repairing or removing gross polluters can be far more
cost-effective than playing around with reformulated gasolines and
oxygenates.

<h2>Subject: 6. What do Fuel Octane ratings really indicate?</h2>
<h3>
6.1  Who invented Octane Ratings?
</h3>
Since 1912 the spark ignition internal combustion engine's compression ratio
had been constrained by the unwanted "knock" that could rapidly destroy
engines. "Knocking" is a very good description of the sound heard from an
engine using fuel of too low octane. The engineers had blamed the "knock"
on the battery ignition system that was added to cars along with the
electric self-starter. The engine developers knew that they could improve
power and efficiency if knock could be overcome. <p>

Kettering assigned Thomas Midgley, Jr. to the task of finding the exact
cause of knock [16]. They used a Dobbie-McInnes manograph to demonstrate
that the knock did not arise from preignition, as was commonly supposed, but
arose from a violent pressure rise _after_ ignition. The manograph was not
suitable for further research, so Midgley and Boyd developed a high-speed
camera to see what was happening. They also developed a "bouncing pin"
indicator that measured the amount of knock [7]. Ricardo had developed an
alternative concept of HUCF ( Highest Useful Compression Ratio ) using a
variable-compression engine. His numbers were not absolute, as there were
many variables, such as ignition timing, cleanliness, spark plug position,
engine temperature. etc.<p>

In 1926 Graham Edgar suggested using two hydrocarbons that could be produced
in sufficient purity and quantity [9]. These were "normal heptane", that
was already obtainable in sufficient purity from the distillation of Jeffrey
pine oil, and " an octane, named 2,4,4-trimethyl pentane " that he first
synthesized. Today we call it " iso-octane " or 2,2,4-trimethyl pentane. The
octane had a high anti-knock value, and he suggested using the ratio of the
two as a reference fuel number. He demonstrated that all the commercially-
available gasolines could be bracketed between 60:40 and 40:60 parts by
volume heptane:iso-octane.<p>

The reason for using normal heptane and iso-octane was because they both
have similar volatility properties, specifically boiling point, thus the
varying ratios 0:100 to 100:0 should not exhibit large differences in
volatility that could affect the rating test.<p>

</pre>
Having decided on standard reference fuels, a whole range of engines and
test conditions appeared, but today the most common are the Research Octane
Number ( RON ), and the Motor Octane Number ( MON ).<p>
<h3>
6.2  Why do we need Octane Ratings?
</h3>
To obtain the maximum energy from the gasoline, the compressed fuel/air
mixture inside the combustion chamber needs to burn evenly, propagating out
from the spark plug until all the fuel is consumed. This would deliver an
optimum power stroke. In real life, a series of pre-flame reactions will
occur in the unburnt "end gases" in the combustion chamber before the flame
front arrives. If these reactions form molecules or species that can
autoignite before the flame front arrives, knock will occur [13,14].<p>

Simply put, the octane rating of the fuel reflects the ability of the
unburnt end gases to resist spontaneous autoignition under the engine test
conditions used. If autoignition occurs, it results in an extremely rapid
pressure rise, as both the desired spark-initiated flame front, and the
undesired autoignited end gas flames are expanding. The combined pressure
peak arrives slightly ahead of the normal operating pressure peak, leading
to a loss of power and eventual overheating. The end gas pressure waves are
superimposed on the main pressure wave, leading to a sawtooth pattern of
pressure oscillations that create the "knocking" sound.<p>

The combination of intense pressure waves and overheating can induce piston
failure in a few minutes. Knock and preignition are both favoured by high
temperatures, so one may lead to the other. Under high-speed conditions
knock can lead to preignition, which then accelerates engine destruction
[17].<p>
<h3>
6.3  What fuel property does the Octane Rating measure?
</h3>
The fuel property the octane ratings measure is the ability of the unburnt
end gases to spontaneously ignite under the specified test conditions.
Within the chemical structure of the fuel is the ability to withstand
pre-flame conditions without decomposing into species that will autoignite
before the flame-front arrives. Different reaction mechanisms, occurring at
various stages of the pre-flame compression stroke, are responsible for the
undesirable, easily-autoignitable, end gases.<p>

During the oxidation of a hydrocarbon fuel, the hydrogen atoms are removed
one at a time from the molecule by reactions with small radical species
(such as OH and HO2), and O and H atoms. The strength of carbon-hydrogen
bonds depends on what the carbon is connected to. Straight chain HCs such as
normal heptane have secondary C-H bonds that are significantly weaker than
the primary C-H bonds present in branched chain HCs like iso-octane [13,14].   <p>

The octane rating of hydrocarbons is determined by the structure of the
molecule, with long, straight hydrocarbon chains producing large amounts of
easily-autoignitable pre-flame decomposition species, while branched and
aromatic hydrocarbons are more resistant. This also explains why the octane
ratings of paraffins consistently decrease with carbon number. In real life,
the unburnt "end gases" ahead of the flame front encounter temperatures up
to about 700C due to piston motion and radiant and conductive heating, and
commence a series of pre-flame reactions. These reactions occur at different
thermal stages, with the initial stage ( below 400C ) commencing with the
addition of molecular oxygen to alkyl radicals, followed by the internal
transfer of hydrogen atoms within the new radical to form an unsaturated,
oxygen-containing species. These new species are susceptible to chain
branching involving the HO2 radical during the intermediate temperature
stage (400-600C), mainly through the production of OH radicals. Above 600C,
the most important reaction that produces chain branching is the reaction of
one hydrogen atom radical with molecular oxygen to form O and OH radicals.<p>

The addition of additives such as alkyl lead and oxygenates can
significantly affect the pre-flame reaction pathways. Anti-knock additives
work by interfering at different points in the pre-flame reactions, with
the oxygenates retarding undesirable low temperature reactions, and the
alkyl lead compounds react in the intermediate temperature region to
deactivate the major undesirable chain branching sequence [13,14]. <p>

The antiknock ability is related to the "autoignition temperature" of the
hydrocarbons. Antiknock ability is _not_ substantially related to:-<p>
<OL>
<LI>The energy content of fuel, this should be obvious, as oxygenates have
   lower energy contents, but high octanes.
<LI>The flame speed of the conventionally ignited mixture, this should be
   evident from the similarities of the two reference hydrocarbons.
   Although flame speed does play a minor part, there are many other factors
   that are far more important. ( such as compression ratio, stoichiometry,
   combustion chamber shape, chemical structure of the fuel, presence of
   antiknock additives, number and position of spark plugs, turbulence etc.)
   Flame speed does not correlate with octane.
</OL>
<h3>
6.4  Why are two ratings used to obtain the pump rating?
</h3>
The correct name for the (RON+MON)/2 formula is the "antiknock index",
and it remains the most important quality criteria for motorists [25].<p>

The initial octane method developed in the 1920s was the Motor Octane method
and, over several decades, a large number of octane test methods appeared.
These were variations to either the engine design, or the specified operating
conditions [65]. During the 1950-1960s attempts were made to internationally
standardise and reduce the number of Octane Rating test procedures.<p>

During the late 1930s - mid 1960s, the Research method became the important
rating because it more closely represented the octane requirements of the
motorist using the fuels/vehicles/roads then available. In the late 1960s
German automakers discovered their engines were destroying themselves on
long Autobahn runs, even though the Research Octane was within specification.
They discovered that either the MON or the Sensitivity ( the numerical
difference between the RON and MON numbers ) also had to be specified. Today
it is accepted that no one octane rating covers all use. In fact, during
1994, there have been increasing concerns in Europe about the high
Sensitivity of some commercially-available unleaded fuels.<p>

The design of the engine and car significantly affect the fuel octane
requirement for both RON and MON. In the 1930s, most vehicles would run on
the specified Research Octane fuel, almost regardless of the Motor Octane,
whereas most 1990s engines have a 'severity" of one, which means the engine
is unlikely to knock if a changes of one RON is matched by an equal and
opposite change of MON [19].<p>
<h3>
6.5  What does the Motor Octane rating measure?
</h3>
The conditions of the Motor method represent severe, sustained high speed,
high load driving. For most hydrocarbon fuels, including those with either
lead or oxygenates, the motor octane number (MON) will be lower than the
research octane number (RON).<p>

</pre>
<h3>
6.7  Why is the difference called "sensitivity"?
</h3>
RON - MON = Sensitivity. Because the two test methods use different test
conditions, especially the intake mixture temperatures and engine speeds,
then a fuel that is sensitive to changes in operating conditions will have
a larger difference between the two rating methods. Modern fuels typically
have sensitivities around 10. The US 87 (RON+MON/2) unleaded gasoline is
required to have a 82+ MON, thus preventing very high sensitivity fuels [25]. <p>
<h3>
6.8  What sort of engine is used to rate fuels?
</h3>
Automotive octane ratings are determined in a special single-cylinder engine
with a variable compression ratio ( CR 4:1 to 18:1 ) known as a Cooperative
Fuels Research ( CFR ) engine. The cylinder bore is 82.5mm, the stroke is
114.3mm, giving a displacement of 612 cm3. The piston has four compression
rings, and one oil control ring. The intake valve is shrouded. The head and
cylinder are one piece, and can be moved up and down to obtain the desired
compression ratio.  The engines have a special four-bowl carburettor that
can adjust individual bowl air/fuel ratios. This facilitates rapid switching
between reference fuels and samples. A magnetorestrictive detonation sensor
in the combustion chamber measures the rapid changes in combustion chamber
pressure caused by knock, and the amplified signal is measured on a
"knockmeter" with a 0-100 scale [66,67]. A complete Octane Rating engine
system costs about $200,000 with all the services installed. Only one
company manufactures these engines, the Waukesha Engine Division of Dresser
Industries, Waukesha. WI 53186.<p>
<h3>
6.9  How is the Octane rating determined?
</h3>
To rate a fuel, the engine is set to an appropriate compression ratio that
will produce a knock of about 50 on the knockmeter for the sample when the
air/fuel ratio is adjusted on the carburettor bowl to obtain maximum knock.
Normal heptane and iso-octane are known as primary reference fuels. Two
blends of these are made, one that is one octane number above the expected
rating, and another that is one octane number below the expected rating.
These are placed in different bowls, and are also rated with each air/fuel
ratio being adjusted for maximum knock. The higher octane reference fuel
should produce a reading around 30-40, and the lower reference fuel should
produce a reading of 60-70. The sample is again tested, and if it does not
fit between the reference fuels, further reference fuels are prepared, and
the engine readjusted to obtain the required knock. The actual fuel rating
is interpolated from the knockmeter readings [66,67].  <p>
<h3>
6.10 What is the Octane Distribution of the fuel?
</h3>
The combination of vehicle and engine can result in specific requirements
for octane that depend on the fuel. If the octane is distributed differently
throughout the boiling range of a fuel, then engines can knock on one brand
of 87 (RON+MON/2), but not on another brand. This "octane distribution" is
especially important when sudden changes in load occur, such as high load,
full throttle, acceleration. The fuel can segregate in the manifold, with
the very volatile fraction reaching the combustion chamber first and, if
that fraction is deficient in octane, then knock will occur until the less
volatile, higher octane fractions arrive [17]. <p>

Some fuel specifications include delta RONs, to ensure octane distribution
throughout the fuel boiling range was consistent. Octane distribution was
seldom a problem with the alkyl lead compounds, as the tetra methyl lead
and tetra ethyl lead octane volatility profiles were well characterised, but
it can be a major problem for the new, reformulated, low aromatic gasolines,
as MTBE boils at 55C, whereas ethanol boils at 78C. Drivers have discovered
that an 87 (RON+MON/2) from one brand has to be substituted with an 89
(RON+MON/2) of another, and that is because of the combination of their
driving style, engine design, vehicle mass, fuel octane distribution, fuel
volatility, and the octane-enhancers used.<p>
<h3>
6.11 What is a "delta Research Octane number"?
</h3>
To obtain an indication of behaviour of a gasoline during any manifold
segregation, an octane rating procedure called the Distribution Octane
Number was used. The rating engine had a special manifold that allowed
the heavier fractions to be separated before they reached the combustion
chamber [17]. That method has been replaced by the "delta" RON procedure. <p>

The fuel is carefully distilled to obtain a distillate fraction that boils
to the specified temperature, which is usually 100C. Both the parent fuel
and the distillate fraction are rated on the  octane engine using the
Research Octane method [68]. The difference between these is the delta
RON(100C), usually just called the delta RON.<p>
<h3>
6.12 How do other fuel properties affect octane?
</h3>
Several other properties affect knock. The most significant determinant of
octane is the chemical structure of the hydrocarbons and their response to
the addition of octane enhancing additives. Other factors include:-<p>
<UL>
<LI><b>Front End Volatility - </b>Paraffins are the major component in gasoline, and
  the octane number decreases with increasing chain length or ring size, but
  increases with chain branching. Overall, the effect is a significant
  reduction in octane if front end volatility is lost, as can happen with
  improper or long term storage. Fuel economy on short trips can be improved
  by using a more volatile fuel, at the risk of carburettor icing and
  increased evaporative emissions.
<LI><b>Final Boiling Point.- </b>Decreases in the final boiling point increase fuel
  octane. Aviation gasolines have much lower final boiling points than
  automotive gasolines. Note that final boiling points are being reduced
  because the higher boiling fractions are responsible for disproportionate
  quantities of pollutants and toxins.

<LI><b>Preignition tendency - </b>both knock and preignition can induce each other.
</UL>
<h3>
6.13 Can higher octane fuels give me more power?
</h3>
Not if you are already using the proper octane fuel. The engine will be
already operating at optimum settings, and a higher octane should have no
effect on the management system. Your driveability and fuel economy will
remain the same. The higher octane fuel costs more, so you are just throwing
money away. If you are already using a fuel with an octane rating slightly
below the optimum, then using a higher octane fuel will cause the engine
management system to move to the optimum settings, possibly resulting in
both increased power and improved fuel economy. You may be able to change
octanes between seasons ( reduce octane in winter ) to obtain the most
cost-effective fuel without loss of driveability. <p>

Once you have identified the fuel that keeps the engine at optimum settings,
there is no advantage in moving to an even higher octane fuel. The
manufacturer's recommendation is conservative, so you may be able to
carefully reduce the fuel octane. The penalty for getting it badly wrong,
and not realising that you have, could be expensive engine damage. <p>
<h3>
6.14 Does low octane fuel increase engine wear?
</h3>
Not if you are meeting the octane requirement of the engine. If you are not
meeting the octane requirement, the engine will rapidly suffer major damage
due to knock. You must not use fuels that produce sustained audible knock,
engine damage will occur. If the octane is just sufficient, the engine
management system will move settings to a less optimal position, and the
only major penalty will be increased costs due to poor fuel economy.
Whenever possible, engines should be operated at the optimum position for
long-term reliability. Engine wear is mainly related to design,
manufacturing, maintenance and lubrication factors. Once the octane and
run-on requirements of the engine are satisfied, increased octane will have
no beneficial effect on the engine. The quality of gasoline, and the
additive package used, would be more likely to affect the rate of engine
wear, rather than the octane rating. <p>
<h3>
6.15 Can I mix different octane fuel grades?
</h3>
Yes, however attempts to blend in your fuel tank should be carefully
planned. You should not allow the tank to become empty, and then add 50% of
lower octane, followed by 50% of higher octane. The fuels may not completely
mix immediately, especially if there is a density difference. You may get a
slug of low octane that causes severe knock. You should refill when your
tank is half full. In general the octane response will be linear for most
hydrocarbon and oxygenated fuels eg 50:50 of 87 and 91 will give 89. <p>

Attempts to mix leaded high octane to unleaded high octane to obtain higher
octane are useless. The lead response of the unleaded fuel does not overcome
the dilution effect, thus 50:50 of 96 leaded and 91 unleaded will give 94.
Some blends of oxygenated fuels with ordinary gasoline can result in
undesirable increases in volatility due to volatile azeotropes, and that
some oxygenates can have negative lead responses. Also note that the octane
requirement of some engines is determined by the need to avoid run-on, not
to avoid knock.<p>
<h3>
6.16 What happens if I use the wrong octane fuel?
</h3>
If you use a fuel with an octane rating below the requirement of the engine,
the management system may move the engine settings into an area of less
efficient combustion, resulting in reduced power and reduced fuel economy.
You will be losing both money and driveability. If you use a fuel with an
octane rating higher than what the engine can use, you are just wasting
money by paying for octane that you can not utilise. Forget the stories
about higher octanes having superior additive packages - they do not. If
your vehicle does not have a knock sensor, then using an octane significantly
below the requirement means that the little men with hammers will gleefully
pummel your engine to pieces. <p>

You should initially be guided by the vehicle manufacturer's recommendations,
however you can experiment, as the variations in vehicle tolerances can
mean that Octane Number Requirement for a given vehicle model can range
over 6 Octane Numbers. Caution should be used, and remember to compensate
if the conditions change, such as carrying more people or driving in
different ambient conditions. You can often reduce the octane of the fuel
you use in winter because the temperature decrease and possible humidity
changes may significantly reduce the octane requirement of the engine.<p>

Use the octane that provides cost-effective driveability and performance,
using anything more is waste of money, and anything less could result in
an unscheduled, expensive visit to your mechanic.<p>
<h3>
6.17 Can I tune the engine to use another octane fuel?
</h3>
In general, modern engine management systems will compensate for fuel octane,
and once you have satisfied the optimum octane requirement, you are at the
optimum overall performance area of the engine map. Tuning changes to obtain
more power will probably adversely affect both fuel economy and emissions.
Unless you have access to good diagnostic equipment that can ensure
regulatory limits are complied with, it is likely that adjustments may be
regarded as illegal tampering by your local regulation enforcers. If you are
skilled, you will be able to legally wring slightly more performance from
your engine by using a dynamometer in conjunction with engine and exhaust gas
analyzers and a well-designed, retrofitted, performance engine management
chip.<p>
<h3>
6.18 How can I increase the fuel octane?
</h3>
Not simply, you can purchase additives, however these are not cost-effective
and a survey in 1989 showed the cost of increasing the octane rating of one
US gallon by one unit ranged from 10 cents ( methanol ), 50 cents (MMT),
$1.00 ( TEL ), to $3.25 ( xylenes ) [69]. It is preferable to purchase a
higher octane fuel such as racing fuel, aviation gasolines, or methanol.
Sadly, the price of chemical grade methanol has almost doubled during 1994.
If you plan to use alcohol blends, ensure your fuel handling system is
compatible, and that you only use dry gasoline by filling up early in the
morning when the storage tanks are cool. Also ensure that the service station
storage tank has not been refilled recently. Retailers are supposed to wait
several hours before bringing a refilled tank online, to allow suspended
undissolved water to settle out, but they do not always wait the full period. <p>
<h3>
6.19 Are aviation gasoline octane numbers comparable?
</h3>
Aviation gasolines were all highly leaded and graded using two numbers, with
common grades being 80/87, 100/130, and 115/145 [70]. The first number is the
Aviation rating ( aka Lean Mixture rating ), and the second number is the
Supercharge rating ( aka Rich Mixture rating ). In the 1970s a new grade,
100LL ( low lead = 0.53mlTEL/L instead of 1.06mlTEL/L) was introduced to
replace the 80/87 and 100/130. Soon after the introduction, there was a
spate of plug fouling, and high cylinder head temperatures resulting in
cracked cylinder heads [71]. The old 80/87 grade was reintroduced on a
limited scale.  The Aviation rating is determined using the automotive Motor
Octane test procedure, and then corrected to an Aviation number using a
table in the method - it's usually only 1 - 2 Octane units different to the
Motor value up to 100, but varies significant above that eg 110MON = 128AN.<p>

The second Avgas number is the Rich Mixture method Performance Number ( PN
- they are not commonly called octane numbers when they are above 100 ), and
is determined on a supercharged version of the CFR engine which has a fixed
compression ratio. The method determines the dependence of the highest
permissible power ( in terms of indicated mean effective pressure ) on
mixture strength and boost for a specific light knocking setting. The
Performance Number indicates the maximum knock-free power obtainable from a
fuel compared to iso-octane = 100. Thus, a PN = 150 indicates that an engine
designed to utilise the fuel can obtain 150% of the knock-limited power of
iso-octane at the same mixture ratio. This is an arbitrary scale based on
iso-octane + varying amounts of TEL, derived from a survey of engines
performed decades ago. Aviation gasoline PNs are rated using variations of
mixture strength to obtain the maximum knock-limited power in a supercharged
engine. This can be extended to provide mixture response curves which define
the maximum boost ( rich - about 11:1 stoichiometry ) and minimum boost
( weak about 16:1 stoichiometry ) before knock [71].<p>

The 115/145 grade is being phased out, but even the 100LL has more octane
than any automotive gasoline. <p>

<h3><b>
Subject: 7. What parameters determine octane requirement?
</b>
7.1  What is the effect of Compression ratio?
</h3>
Most people know that an increase in Compression Ratio will require an
increase in fuel octane for the same engine design. Increasing the
compression ratio increases the theoretical thermodynamic efficiency of an
engine according to the standard equation<p>
<pre>
Efficiency = 1 - (1/compression ratio)^gamma-1
</pre>
where gamma = ratio of specific heats at constant pressure and constant
volume of the working fluid ( for most purposes air is the working fluid,
and is treated as an ideal gas ). There are indications that thermal
efficiency reaches a maximum at a compression ratio of about 17:1 [15].<p>

The efficiency gains are best when the engine is at incipient knock, that's
why knock sensors ( actually vibration sensors ) are used. Low compression
ratio engines are less efficient because they can not deliver as much of the
ideal combustion power to the flywheel. For a typical carburetted engine,
without engine management [17,24]:-<p>
<pre>
   Compression       Octane Number    Brake Thermal Efficiency
     Ratio            Requirement         ( Full Throttle )
      5:1                 72                      -
      6:1                 81                     25 %
      7:1                 87                     28 %
      8:1                 92                     30 %
      9:1                 96                     32 %
     10:1                100                     33 %
     11:1                104                     34 %
     12:1                108                     35 %
</pre>
Modern engines have improved significantly on this, and the changing fuel
specifications and engine design should see more improvements, but
significant gains may have to await improved engine materials and fuels.<p>
<h3>
7.2  What is the effect of changing the air/fuel ratio?
</h3>
Traditionally, the greatest tendency to knock was near 13.5:1 air/fuel
ratio, but was very engine specific. Modern engines, with engine management
systems, now have their maximum octane requirement near to 14.5:1. For a
given engine using gasoline, the relationship between thermal efficiency,
air/fuel ratio, and power is complex. Stoichiometric combustion ( Air/Fuel
Ratio = 14.7:1 for a typical non-oxygenated gasoline ) is neither maximum
power - which occurs around A/F 12-13:1 (Rich), nor maximum thermal
efficiency - which occurs around A/F 16-18:1 (Lean). The air-fuel ratio is
controlled at part throttle by a closed loop system using the oxygen sensor
in the exhaust. Conventionally, enrichment for maximum power air/fuel ratio
is used during full throttle operation to reduce knocking while providing
better driveability [24]. If the mixture is weakened, the flame speed is
reduced, consequently less heat is converted to mechanical energy, leaving
heat in the cylinder walls and head, potentially inducing knock. It is
possible to weaken the mixture sufficiently that the flame is still present
when the inlet valve opens again, resulting in backfiring.<p>
<h3>
7.3  What is the effect of changing the ignition timing
</h3>
The tendency to knock increases as spark advance is increased, eg 2 degrees
BTDC requires 91 octane, whereas 14 degrees BTDC requires 96 octane.
If you advance the spark, the flame front starts earlier, and the end gases
start forming earlier in the cycle, providing more time for the autoigniting
species to form before the piston reaches the optimum position for power
delivery, as determined by the normal flame front propagation. It becomes a
race between the flame front and decomposition of the increasingly-squashed
end gases. High octane fuels produce end gases that take longer to
autoignite, so the good flame front reaches and consumes them properly. <p>

The ignition advance map is partly determined by the fuel the engine is
intended to use. The timing of the spark is advanced sufficiently to ensure
that the fuel/air mixture burns in such a way that maximum pressure of the
burning charge is about 15-20 degree after TDC. Knock will occur before
this point, usually in the late compression/early power stroke period.
The engine management system uses ignition timing as one of the major
variables that is adjusted if knock is detected. If very low octane fuels
are used ( several octane numbers below the vehicle's requirement at optimal
settings ), both performance and fuel economy will decrease.<p>

The actual Octane Number Requirement depends on the engine design, but for
some 1978 vehicles using standard fuels, the following (R+M)/2 Octane
Requirements were measured. "Standard" is the recommended ignition timing
for the engine, probably a few degrees before Top Dead Centre [24].<p>
<pre>
     <b>                     Basic Ignition Timing</b>
Vehicle   Retarded 5 degrees    Standard     Advanced 5 degrees
  A              88                91               93
  B              86                90.5             94.5
  C              85.5              88               90
  D              84                87.5             91
  E              82.5              87               90
</pre>
The actual ignition timing to achieve the maximum pressure from normal
combustion of gasoline will depend mainly on the speed of the engine and the
flame propagation rates in the engine. Knock increases the rate of the
pressure rise, thus superimposing additional pressure on the normal
combustion pressure rise. The knock actually rapidly resonates around the
chamber, creating a series of abnormal sharp spikes on the pressure diagram.
The normal flame speed is fairly consistent for most gasoline HCs, regardless
of octane rating, but the flame speed is affected by stoichiometry. Note that
the flame speeds in this FAQ are not the actual engine flame speeds. A 12:1
CR gasoline engine at 1500 rpm would have a flame speed of about 16.5 m/s,
and a similar hydrogen engine yields 48.3 m/s, but such engine flame speeds
are also very dependent on stoichiometry.  <p>
<h3>
7.4  What is the effect of engine management systems?
</h3>
Engine management systems are now an important part of the strategy to
reduce automotive pollution. The good news for the consumer is their ability
to maintain the efficiency of gasoline combustion, thus improving fuel
economy. The bad news is their tendency to hinder tuning for power. A very
basic modern engine system could monitor and control:- mass air flow, fuel
flow, ignition timing, exhaust oxygen ( lambda oxygen sensor ), knock
( vibration sensor ), EGR, exhaust gas temperature, coolant temperature, and
intake air temperature. The knock sensor can be either a nonresonant type
installed in the engine block and capable of measuring a wide range of knock
vibrations ( 5-15 kHz ) with minimal change in frequency, or a resonant type
that has excellent signal-to-noise ratio between 1000 and 5000 rpm [72].<p>

A modern engine management system can compensate for altitude, ambient air
temperature, and fuel octane. The management system will also control cold
start settings, and other operational parameters. There is a new requirement
that the engine management system also contain an on-board diagnostic
function that warns of malfunctions such as engine misfire, exhaust catalyst
failure, and evaporative emissions failure. The use of fuels with alcohols
such as methanol can confuse the engine management system as they generate
more hydrogen which can fool the oxygen sensor [47] .<p>

The use of fuel of too low octane can actually result in both a loss of fuel
economy and power, as the management system may have to move the engine
settings to a less efficient part of the performance map. The system retards
the ignition timing until only trace knock is detected, as engine damage
from knock is of more consequence than power and fuel economy. <p>
<h3>
7.5  What is the effect of temperature and load?
</h3>
Increasing the engine temperature, particularly the air/fuel charge
temperature, increases the tendency to knock. The Sensitivity of a fuel can
indicate how it is affected by charge temperature variations. Increasing
load increases both the engine temperature, and the end-gas pressure, thus
the likelihood of knock increases as load increases.<p>
<h3>
7.6  What is the effect of engine speed?.
</h3>
Faster engine speed means there is less time for the pre-flame reactions
in the end gases to occur, thus reducing the tendency to knock. On engines
with management systems, the ignition timing may be advanced with engine
speed and load, to obtain optimum efficiency at incipient knock. In such
cases, both high and low engines speeds may be critical.<p>
<h3>
7.7  What is the effect of engine deposits?
</h3>
A new engine may only require a fuel of 6-9 octane numbers lower than the
same engine after 25,000 km. This Octane Requirement Increase (ORI) is due to
the formation of a mixture of organic and inorganic deposits resulting from
both the fuel and the lubricant. They reach an equilibrium amount because
of flaking, however dramatic changes in driving styles can also result in
dramatic changes of the equilibrium position. When the engine starts to burn
more oil, the octane requirement can increase again. ORIs up to 12 are not
uncommon, depending on driving style [17,19]. The deposits produce the ORI
by several mechanisms:- <p>
 - they reduce the combustion chamber volume, effectively increasing the
   compression ratio.
 - they also reduce thermal conductivity, thus increasing the combustion
   chamber temperatures.
 - they catalyse undesirable pre-flame reactions that produce end gases with
   low autoignition temperatures.
<h3>
7.8  What is the Road Octane requirement of an vehicle?
</h3>
The actual octane requirements of a vehicle is called the Octane Number
Requirement ( ONR ), and is determined by using standard octane fuels that
can be blends of iso-octane and normal heptane, or commercial gasolines.
The vehicle is tested under a wide range of conditions and loads, using
different octane fuels until trace knock is detected. The conditions that
require maximum octane are not consistent, but often are full-throttle
acceleration from low starting speeds using the highest gear available. They
can even be at constant speed conditions [17]. Engine management systems
that adjust the octane requirement may also reduce the power output on low
octane fuel, resulting in increased fuel consumption. The maximum ONR is of
most interest, as that usually defines the recommended fuel.<p>

The octane rating engines do not reflect actual conditions in a vehicle,
consequently there are standard procedures for evaluating the performance
of the gasoline in an engine. The most common are:-
1. The Modified Uniontown Procedure. Full throttle accelerations are made
   from low speed using primary reference fuels. The ignition timing is
   adjusted until trace knock is detected at some stage. Several reference
   fuels are used, and a Road Octane Number v Basic Ignition timing graph is
   obtained. The fuel sample is tested, and the ignition timing setting is
   read from the graph to provide the Road Octane Number. This is a rapid
   procedure but provides minimal information.
2. The Modified Borderline Knock Procedure. The automatic spark advance is
   disabled, and a manual adjustment facility added. Accelerations are
   performed as in the Modified Uniontown Procedure, however trace knock is
   maintained throughout the run. A map of ignition advance v engine speed
   is made for several reference fuels and the sample fuels. This procedure
   can show the variation of road octane with engine speed. <p>
<h3>
7.9  What is the effect of air temperature?
</h3>
An increase in ambient air temperature of 5.6C increases the octane
requirement of an engine by 0.44 - 0.54 MON [17,24]. When the combined effects
of air temperature and humidity are considered, it is often possible to use
one octane grade in summer, and use a lower octane rating in winter. The
Motor octane rating has a higher charge temperature, and increasing charge
temperature increases the tendency to knock, so fuels with low Sensitivity
( the difference between RON and MON numbers ) are less affected by air
temperature.<p>
<h3>
7.10  What is the effect of altitude?
</h3>
The effect of increasing altitude may be nonlinear, with one study reporting
a decrease of the octane requirement of 1.4 RON/300m from sea level to 1800m
and 2.5 RON/300m from 1800m to 3600m [17]. Other studies report the octane
number requirement decreased by 1.0 - 1.9 RON/300m without specifying
altitude [24]. Modern engine management systems can accommodate this
adjustment, and in some recent studies, the octane number requirement was
0.2 - 0.5 Antiknock Index/300m. The reduction on older engines was due to:-<p>
 - reduced air density provides lower combustion temperature and pressure.
 - fuel is metered according to air volume, consequently as density decreases
   the stoichiometry moves to rich, with a lower octane number requirement.
 - manifold vacuum controlled spark advance, and reduced manifold vacuum
   results in less spark advance.
<h3>
7.11  What is the effect of humidity?.
</h3>
An increase of absolute humidity of 1.0 g water/ kg of dry air lowers the
octane requirement of an engine by 0.25 - 0.32 MON [17,24].<p>
<h3>
7.12  What does water injection achieve?.
</h3>
Water injection was used in WWII aviation engine to provide a large increase
in available power for very short periods. The injection of water does
decrease the dew point of the exhaust gases. This has potential corrosion
problems. The very high specific heat and heat of vaporisation of water
means that the combustion temperature will decrease. It has been shown that
a 10% water addition to methanol reduces the power and efficiency by about
3%, and doubles the unburnt fuel emissions, but does reduce NOx by 25% [73].
A decrease in combustion temperature will reduce the theoretical maximum
possible efficiency of an otto cycle engine that is operating correctly,
but may improve efficiency in engines that are experiencing abnormal
combustion on existing fuels.<p>

Some aviation SI engines still use boost fluids. The water/methanol mixtures
are used to provide increased power for short periods, up to 40% more -
assuming adequate mechanical strength of the engine. The 40/60 or 45/55
water/methanol mixtures are used as boost fluids for aviation engines because
water would freeze. Methanol is just "preburnt" methane, consequently it only
has about half the energy content of gasoline, but it does have a higher heat
of vaporisation, which has a significant cooling effect on the charge.
Water/methanol blends are more cost-effective than gasoline for combustion
cooling. The high Sensitivity of alcohol fuels has to be considered in the
engine design and settings.<p>

Boost fluids are used because they are far more economical than using the
fuel. When a supercharged engine has to be operated at high boost, the
mixture has to be enriched to keep the engine operating without knock. The
extra fuel cools the cylinder walls and the charge, thus delaying the onset
of knock which would otherwise occur at the associated higher temperatures.<p>

The overall effect of boost fluid injection is to permit a considerable
increase in knock-free engine power for the same combustion chamber
temperature. The power increase is obtained from the higher allowable boost.
In practice, the fuel mixture is usually weakened when using boost fluid
injection, and the ratio of the two fuel fluids is approximately 100 parts
of avgas to 25 parts of boost fluid. With that ratio, the resulting
performance corresponds to an effective uprating of the fuel of about 25%,
irrespective of its original value. Trying to increase power boosting above
40% is difficult, as the engine can drown because of excessive liquid [71].<p>

Note that for water injection to provide useful power gains, the engine
management and fuel systems must be able to monitor the knock and adjust
both stoichiometry and ignition to obtain significant benefits. Aviation
engines are designed to accommodate water injection, most automobile engines
are not. Returns on investment are usually harder to achieve on engines that
do not normal extend their performance envelope into those regions. Water
injection has been used by some engine manufacturers - usually as an
expedient way to maintain acceptable power after regulatory emissions
baggage was added to the engine, but usually the manufacturer quickly
produces a modified engine that does not require water injection.<p>

8.1  What causes an empty fuel tank?

<UL>
<LI>You forgot to refill it.

  one took the vehicle.
<LI>The fuel tank leaked.
<LI>Your darling child/wife/husband/partner/mother/father used the car.
<LI>The most likely reason is that your local garage switched to an oxygenated
  gasoline, and the engine management system compensated for the oxygen
  content, causing the fuel consumption to increase significantly.
</UL>
<h3>
8.2  Is knock the only abnormal combustion problem?
</h3>
No. Many of the abnormal combustion problems are induced by the same
conditions, and so one can lead to another.<p>

Preignition occurs when the air/fuel mixture is ignited prematurely by
glowing deposits or hot surfaces - such as exhaust valves and spark plugs.
If it continues, it can increase in severity and become Run-away Surface
Ignition (RSI) which prevents the combustion heat being converted into
mechanical energy, thus rapidly melting pistons. The Ricardo method uses an
electrically-heated wire in the engine to measure preignition tendency. The
scale uses iso-octane as 100 and cyclohexane as 0. <p>
Some common fuel components:-<p>
<pre>
             paraffins       50-100
             benzene           26
             toluene           93
             xylene          >100
             cyclopentane      70
             di-isobutylene    64
             hexene-2         -26
</pre>
There is no direct correlation between anti-knock ability and preignition
tendency, however high combustion chamber temperatures favour both, and so
one may lead to the other. An engine knocking during high-speed operation
will increase in temperature and that can induce preignition, and conversely
any preignition will result in higher temperatures than may induce knock.<p>

Misfire is commonly caused by either a failure in the ignition system, or
fouling of the spark plug by deposits. The most common cause of deposits
was the alkyl lead additives in gasoline, and the yellow glaze of various
lead salts was used by mechanics to assess engine tune. From the upper
recess to the tip, the composition changed, but typical compounds ( going
from cold to hot ) were PbClBr; 2PbO.PbClBr; PbO.PbSO4; 3Pb3(PO4)2.PbClBr.<p>

Run-on is the tendency of an engine to continue running after the ignition
has been switched off. It is usually caused by the spontaneous ignition of
the fuel/air mixture, rather than by surface ignition from hotspots or
deposits, as commonly believed. The narrow range of conditions for
spontaneous ignition of the fuel/air mixture ( engine speed, charge
temperature, cylinder pressure ) may be created when the engine is switched
off. The engine may refire, thus taking the conditions out of the critical
range for a couple of cycles, and then refire again, until overall cooling
of the engine drops it out of the critical region. The octane rating of the
fuel is the appropriate parameter, and it is not rare for an engine to
require a higher Octane fuel to prevent run-on than to avoid knock [17]. <p>
<h3>
8.3  Can I prevent carburetter icing?
</h3>
Yes, carburettor icing is caused by the combination of highly volatile fuel,
high humidity and low ambient temperature. The extent of cooling, caused by
the latent heat of the vaporised gasoline in the carburettor, can be as much
as 20C, perhaps dropping below the dew point of the charge. If this happens,
water will condense on the cooler carburettor surfaces, and will freeze if
the temperature is low enough. The fuel volatility can not always be reduced
to eliminate icing, so anti-icing additives are used.<p>

Two types of additive are added to gasoline to inhibit icing:- <p>
- surfactants that form a monomolecular layer over the metal parts that
  inhibits ice crystal formation. These are usually added at concentrations
  of 30-150 ppm.
- cryoscopic additives that depress the freezing point of the condensed water
  so that it does not turn to ice. Alcohols ( methanol, ethanol, iso-propanol,
  etc. ) and glycols ( hexylene glycol, dipropylene glycol ) are used at
  concentrations of 0.03% - 1%.

If you have icing problems, the addition of 100-200mls of methanol to a full
tank of dry gasoline will prevent icing under most conditions. If you believe
there is a small amount of water in the fuel tank, add 500mls of isopropanol
as the first treatment. Oxygenated gasolines using alcohols can also be used.<p>
<h3>
8.4  Should I store fuel to avoid the oxygenate season?
</h3>
No. The fuel will be from a different season, and will have significantly
different volatility properties that may induce driveability problems. You
can tune your engine to perform on oxygenated gasoline as well as it did on
traditional gasoline, however you will have increased fuel consumption due
to the useless oxygen in the oxygenates. Some engines may not initially
perform well on some oxygenated fuels, usually because of the slightly
different volatility and combustion characteristics. A good mechanic should
be able to recover any lost performance or driveability, providing the engine
is in reasonable condition. <p>
<h3>
8.5  Can I improve fuel economy by using quality gasolines?
</h3>
Yes, several manufacturers have demonstrated that their new gasoline additive
packages are more effective than traditional gasoline formulations. Texaco
claim their new vapour phase fuel additive can reduce existing deposits by
up to 30%, improve fuel economy, and reduce NOx tailpipe emissions by 15%,
when compared to other advanced liquid phase additives. These claims appear
to have been verified in independent tests [30]. Other reputable gasoline
brands will have similar additive packages in their quality products.
Quality gasolines, of whatever octane ratings, will include a full range of
gasoline additives designed to provide consistent fuel quality.<p>

Note that oxygenated gasolines must decrease fuel economy for the same power.
If your engine is initially well-tuned on hydrocarbon gasolines, the
stoichiometry will move to lean, and maximum power is slightly rich, so
either the management system ( if you have one ) or your mechanic has to
increase the fuel flow. The minor improvements in combustion efficiency that
oxygenates may provide, can not compensate for 2+% of oxygen in the fuel
that will not provide energy.         <p>
<h3>
8.6  What is "stale" fuel, and should I use it?
</h3>
"Stale" fuel is caused by improper storage, and usually smells sour. The
gasoline has been allowed to get warm, thus catalysing olefin decomposition
reactions, and perhaps also losing volatile material in unsealed containers.
Such fuel will tend to rapidly form gums, and will usually have a significant
reduction in octane rating. The fuel can be used by blending with twice the
volume of new gasoline. Some stale fuels can drop several octane numbers, so
be generous with the dilution.<p>
<h3>
8.7  How can I remove water in the fuel tank?
</h3>
If you only have a small quantity of water, then the addition of 500mls of
dry isopropanol (IPA) to a near-full 30-40 litre tank will absorb the water,
and will not significantly affect combustion. Once you have mopped up the
water with IPA. Small, regular doses of any anhydrous alcohol will help
keep the tank dry. This technique will not work if you have very large
amounts of water, and the addition of greater amounts of IPA may result in
poor driveability. <p>

Water in fuel tanks can be minimised by keeping the fuel tank near full, and
filling in the morning from a service station that allows storage tanks to
stand for several hours after refilling before using the fuel. Note that
oxygenated gasolines have greater water solubility, and should cope with
small quantities of water.<p>
<h3>
8.8  Can I used unleaded on older vehicles?
</h3>
Yes, providing the octane is appropriate. There are some older engines that
cut the valve seats directly into the cylinder head ( eg BMC minis ). The
absence of lead, which lubricated the valve seat, causes the very hard
oxidation products of the valve to wear down the seat. This valve seat
recession is usually corrected by installing seat inserts. Most other
problems arise because the fuels have different volatility, or the reduction
of combustion chamber deposits. These can usually be cured by reference to
the vehicle manufacturer, who will probably have a publication with the
changes. Some vehicles will perform as well on unleaded with a slightly
lower octane than recommended leaded fuel, due to the significant reduction
in deposits from modern unleaded gasolines.<p>

<b>
Section: 9. Alternative Fuels and Additives
</b>
9.1  Do fuel additives work?
</h3>
Most aftermarket fuel additives are not cost-effective. These include the
octane-enhancer solutions discussed in section 6.18. There are various other
pills, tablets, magnets, filters, etc. that all claim to improve either fuel
economy or performance. Some of these have perfectly sound scientific
mechanisms, unfortunately they are not cost-effective. Some do not even have
sound scientific mechanisms. Because the same model production vehicles can
vary significantly, it's expensive to unambiguously demonstrate these
additives are not cost-effective. If you wish to try them, remember the
biggest gain is likely to be caused by the lower mass of your wallet/purse.<p>

There is one aftermarket additive that may be cost-effective, the lubricity
additive used with unleaded gasolines to combat valve seat recession on
engines that do not have seat inserts. The long-term solution is to install
inserts at the next top overhaul.<p>

Some other fuel additives work, especially those that are carefully
formulated into the gasoline by the manufacturer at the refinery.<p>
A typical gasoline may contain [17,19,24]:-<p>
* Oil-soluble Dye, initially added to leaded gasoline at about 10 ppm to
        prevent its misuse as an industrial solvent
* Antioxidants, typically phenylene diamines or hindered phenols, are
        added to prevent oxidation of unsaturated hydrocarbons.
* Metal Deactivators, typically about 10ppm of chelating agent such as
        N,N'-disalicylidene-1,2-propanediamine is added to inhibit copper,
        which can rapidly catalyze oxidation of unsaturated hydrocarbons.
* Corrosion Inhibitors, about 5ppm of oil-soluble surfactants are added
        to prevent corrosion caused either by water condensing from cooling,
        water-saturated gasoline, or from condensation from air onto the
        walls of almost-empty gasoline tanks that drop below the dew point.
        If your gasoline travels along a pipeline, it's possible the pipeline
        owner will add additional corrosion inhibitor to the fuel.
* Anti-icing Additives, used mainly with carburetted cars, and usually either
        a surfactant, alcohol or glycol.
* Anti-wear Additives, these are used to control wear in the upper cylinder
        and piston ring area that the gasoline contacts, and are usually
        very light hydrocarbon oils. Phosphorus additives can also be used
        on engines without exhaust catalyst systems.
* Deposit-modifying Additives, usually surfactants.
  1. Carburettor Deposits, additives to prevent these were required when
        crankcase blow-by (PCV) and exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) controls
        were introduced. Some fuel components reacted with these gas streams
        to form deposits on the throat and throttle plate of carburettors.
  2. Fuel Injector tips operate about 100C, and deposits form in the
        annulus during hot soak, mainly from the oxidation and polymerisation
        of the larger unsaturated hydrocarbons. The additives that prevent
        and unclog these tips are usually polybutene succinimides or
        polyether amines.
  3. Intake Valve Deposits caused major problems in the mid-1980s when
        some engines had reduced driveability when fully warmed, even though
        the amount of deposit was below previously acceptable limits. It is
        believed that the new fuels and engine designs were producing a more
        absorbent deposit that grabbed some passing fuel vapour, causing lean
        hesitation. Intake valves operate about 300C, and if the valve is
        is kept wet deposits tend not to form, thus intermittent injectors
        tend to promote deposits. Oil leaking through the valve guides can be
        either harmful or beneficial, depending on the type and quantity.
        Gasoline factors implicated in these deposits include unsaturates and
        alcohols. Additives to prevent these deposits contain a detergent
        and/or dispersant in a higher molecular weight solvent or light oil
        whose low volatility keeps the valve surface wetted.
  4. Combustion Chamber Deposits have been targeted in the 1990s, as they
        are responsible for significant increases in emissions. Recent
        detergent-dispersant additives have the ability to function in both
        the liquid and vapour phases to remove existing carbon and prevent
        deposit formation.
* Octane Enhancers, these are usually formulated blends of alkyl lead
        or MMT compounds in a solvent such as toluene, and added at the
        100-1000  ppm levels. They have been replaced by hydrocarbons with
        higher octanes such as aromatics and olefins. These hydrocarbons
        are now being replaced by a mixture of saturated hydrocarbons and
        and oxygenates.

If you wish to play with different fuels and additives, be aware that
some parts of your engine management systems, such as the oxygen sensor,
can be confused by different exhaust gas compositions. An example is
increased quantities of hydrogen from methanol combustion.<p>
<h3>
9.2  Can a quality fuel help a sick engine?
</h3>
It depends on the ailment. Nothing can compensate for poor tuning and wear.
If the problem is caused by deposits or combustion quality, then modern
premium quality gasolines have been shown to improve engine performance
significantly. The new generation of additive packages for gasolines include
components that will dissolve existing carbon deposits, and have been shown
to improve fuel economy, NOx emissions, and driveability.<p>
<h3>
9.3  What are the advantages of alcohols and ethers?
</h3>
This section discusses only the use of high ( >80% ) alcohol or ether fuels.
Alcohol fuels can be made from sources other than imported crude oil, and the
nations that have researched/used alcohol fuels have mainly based their
choice on import substitution. Alcohol fuels can burn more efficiently, and
can reduce photochemically-active emissions. Most vehicle manufacturers
favoured the use of liquid fuels over compressed or liquified gases. The
alcohol fuels have high research octane ratings, but also high sensitivity
and high latent heats [6,17,51,74].<p>

The major advantages are gained when pure fuels ( M100, and E100 ) are used,
as the addition of hydrocarbons to overcome the cold start problems also
significantly reduces, if not totally eliminates, any emission benefits.
Methanol will produce significant amounts of formaldehyde, a suspected
human carcinogen, until the exhaust catalyst reaches operating temperature.
Ethanol produces acetaldehyde. The cold-start problems have been addressed,
and alcohol fuels are technically viable, however with crude oil at
<$30/bbl they are not economically viable, especially as the demand for then
as precursors for gasoline oxygenates has elevated the world prices.
Methanol almost doubled in price during 1994. There have also been trials
of pure MTBE as a fuel, however there are no unique or significant advantages
that would outweigh the poor economic viability [11].<p>
<h3>
9.4  Why are CNG and LPG considered "cleaner" fuels.
</h3>
CNG ( Compressed Natural Gas ) is usually around 70-90% methane with 10-20%
ethane, 2-8% propanes, and decreasing quantities of the higher HCs up to
butane. The fuel has a high octane and usually only trace quantities of
unsaturates. The emissions from CNG have lower concentrations of the
hydrocarbons responsible for photochemical smog, reduced CO, SOx, and NOx,
and the lean misfire limit is extended [75]. There are no technical
disadvantages, providing the installation is performed correctly. The major
disadvantage of compressed gas is the reduced range. Vehicles may have
between one to three cylinders ( 25 MPa, 90-120 litre capacity), and they
usually represent about 50% of the gasoline range. As natural gas pipelines
do not go everywhere, most conversions are dual-fuel with gasoline. The
ignition timing and stoichiometry are significantly different, but good
conversions will provide about 85% of the gasoline power over the full
operating range, with easy switching between the two fuels [76].<p>

CNG has been extensively used in Italy and New Zealand ( NZ had 130,000
dual-fuelled vehicles with 380 refuelling stations in 1987 ). The conversion
costs are usually around US$1000, so the economics are very dependent on the
natural gas price. The typical 15% power loss means that driveability of
retrofitted CNG-fuelled vehicles is easily impaired, consequently it is not
recommended for vehicles of less than 1.5l engine capacity, or retrofitted
onto engine/vehicle combinations that have marginal driveability on gasoline.
The low price of crude oil, along with installation and ongoing CNG
tank-testing costs, have reduced the number of CNG vehicles in NZ. The US
CNG fleet continues to increase in size ( 60,000 in 1994 ).<p>

LPG ( Liquified Petroleum Gas ) is predominantly propane with iso-butane
and n-butane. It has one major advantage over CNG, the tanks do not have
to be high pressure, and the fuel is stored as a liquid. The fuel offers
most of the environmental benefits of CNG, including high octane.
Approximately 20-25% more fuel is required, unless the engine is optimised
( CR 12:1 ) for LPG, in which case there is no decrease in power or increase
in fuel consumption [17,76].<p>

9.5  Why are hydrogen-powered cars not available?
</h3>
<b>
The Hindenburg.
</b>
The technology to operate IC engines on hydrogen has been investigated in
depth since before the turn of the century. One attraction was to
use the hydrogen in airships to fuel the engines instead of venting it.
Hydrogen has a very high flame speed ( 3.24 - 4.40 m/s ), wide flammability
limits ( 4.0 - 75 vol% ), low ignition energy ( 0.017 mJ ), high autoignition
temperature ( 520C ), and flame temperature of 2050 C. Hydrogen has a very
high specific energy ( 120.0 MJ/kg ), making it very desirable as a
transportation fuel.  The problem has been to develop a storage system that
will pass all safety concerns, and yet still be light enough for automotive
use. Although hydrogen can be mixed with oxygen and combusted more
efficiently, most proposals use air [73,77].<p>

Unfortunately the flame temperature is sufficiently high to dissociate
atmospheric nitrogen and form undesirable NOx emissions. The high flame
speeds mean that ignition timing is at TDC, except when running lean, when
the ignition timing is advanced 10 degrees. The high flame speed, coupled
with a very small quenching distance mean that the flame can sneak past
inlet narrow inlet valve openings and cause backfiring. The advantage of a
wide range of mixture strengths and high thermal efficiencies are matched
by the disadvantages of pre-ignition and knock unless weak mixtures, clean
engines, and cool operation are used.<p>

Interested readers are referred to the group sci.energy.hydrogen for details
about this fuel.<p>
<h3>
9.6  What are "fuel cells" ?
</h3>
Fuel cells are electrochemical cells that directly oxidise the fuel at
electrodes producing electrical and thermal energy. The oxidant is usually
oxygen from the air and the fuel is usually gaseous, with hydrogen
preferred. There has, so far, been little success using low temperature fuel
cells ( < 200C ) to perform the direct oxidation of hydrocarbon-based liquids
or gases. Methanol can be used as a source for the hydrogen by adding an
on-board reformer. The main advantage of fuel cells is their high fuel-to-
electricity efficiency of about 40-60% of the nett calorific value of the
fuel. As fuel cells also produce heat that can be used for vehicle climate
control. Fuel Cells are the most likely candidate to replace the IC engine
as a primary energy source. Fuel cells are quiet and produce virtually no
toxic emissions, but they do require a clean fuel ( no halogens, CO, S, or
ammonia ) to avoid poisoning. They currently are expensive to produce, and
have a short operational lifetime, when compared to an IC engine [78,79].<p>
<h3>
9.7  What is a "hybrid" vehicle?
</h3>
A hybrid vehicle has three major systems [80].<p>
<OL>
<LI>A primary power source, either an IC engine driven generator where the
   IC engine only operates in the most efficient part of it's performance
   map, or alternatives such as fuel cells and turbines.
<LI>A power storage unit, which can be a flywheel, battery, or ultracapacitor.
<LI>A drive unit, almost always now an electric motor that can used as a
   generator during braking. Regenerative braking may increase the
   operational range about 8-13%.
</OL>
Battery technology has not yet advanced sufficiently to economically
substitute for an IC engine, while retaining the carrying capacity, range,
performance, and driveability of the vehicle. Hybrid vehicles may enable
this problem to be at least partially overcome, but they remain expensive,
and the current ZEV proposals exclude fuel cells and hybrids systems, but
this is being re-evaluated.
<p>
<h3>
9.8  What about other alternative fuels?
</h3>
<h4>
9.8.1 Ammonia
</h4>
Anhydrous ammonia has been researched because it does not contain any carbon,
and so would not release any CO2. The high heat of vaporisation requires
a pre-vaporisation step, preferably also with high jacket temperatures
( 180C ) to assist decomposition. Power outputs of about 70% of that of
gasoline under the same conditions have been achieved [73].<p>
<h4>
9.8.2 Water
</h4>
Mr Gunnerman has been promoting his patents that claim mixing one part of
gasoline with 2 parts water can provide as much power from an IC engine as
the same flow rate of gasoline. He claims the increased efficiency is from
catalysed dissociation of water to H2 and 02, as the combustion chamber of
the test engine contained a catalyst. It takes the same amount of energy to
dissociate water, as you reclaim when you burn the H2 with 02. So he has to
use heat energy that is normally lost. He appears to have modified his
claims a little with his new A55 fuel.  A recent article claims a 29%
increase in fuel economy for a test bus in Reno, but also claims that his
fuel combusts so efficiently that it can pass an emissions test without
requiring a catalytic converter [81]. Caterpillar are working with
Gunnerman to evaluate his claims and develop the product.<p>
<h3>
9.9  What about alternative oxidants?
</h3>
<h4>
9.9.1 Nitrous Oxide
</h4>
Nitrous oxide ( N2O ) contains 33 vol% of oxygen, consequently the combustion
chamber is filled with less useless nitrogen. It is also metered in as a
liquid, with can cool the incoming charge further, thus effectively
increasing the charge density. With all that oxygen, a lot more fuel can
be squashed into the combustion chamber. The advantage of nitrous oxide is
that it has a flame speed, when burned with hydrocarbon and alcohol fuels,
that can be handled by current IC engines, consequently the power is
delivered in an orderly fashion, but rapidly. The same is not true for
pure oxygen combustion with hydrocarbons, so leave that oxygen cylinder on
the gas axe alone :-). The following are for common premixed flames [82].<p>

Nitrous oxide is not yet routinely used on standard vehicles, but the
technology is well understood.<p>
<h4>
9.9.2 Membrane Enrichment of Air
</h4>
Over the last two decades, extensive research has been performed on the
use of membranes to enrich the oxygen content of air. Increasing the oxygen
content can make combustion more efficient due to the higher flame
temperature and less nitrogen. The optimum oxygen concentration for existing
automotive engine materials is around 30 - 40%. There are several commercial
membranes that can provide that level of enrichment. The problem is that the
surface area required to produce the necessary amount of enriched air for an
SI engine is very large. The membranes have to be laid close together, or
wound in a spiral, and significant amounts of power are required to force
the air along the membrane surface for sufficient enriched air to run a
slightly modified engine. Most research to date has centred on CI engines,
with their higher efficiencies. Several systems have been tried on research
engines and vehicles, however the higher NOx emissions remain a problem
[83,84].<p>

Subject: 10. Historical Legends
</b>
10.1  The myth of Triptane
</h4>
<blockquote><i>
  This post is an edited version of some posted after JdA posted some claims
  from a hot-rod enthusiast reporting that triptane + 4cc TEL had a rich
  power octane rating of 270. This was followed by another that claimed the
  unleaded octane was 150.</i>
</blockquote>
In WWII there was a major effort to increase the power of the aviation
engines continuously, rather than just for short periods using boost fluids.
Increasing the octane of the fuel had dramatic effects on engines that could
be adjusted to utilise the fuel ( by changing boost pressure ). There was a
12% increase in cruising speed, 40% increase in rate of climb, 20% increase
in ceiling, and 40% increase in payload for a DC-3, if the fuel went from 87
to 100 Octane, and further increases if the engine could handle 100+ PN fuel
[85]. A 12 cylinder allison aircraft engine was operated on a 60% blend of
triptane ( 2,2,3-trimethylbutane ) in 100 octane leaded gasoline to produce
2500hp when the rated take-off horsepower with 100 octane leaded was 1500hp
[10].<p>

Triptane was first shown to have high octane in 1926 as part of the General
Motors Research Laboratories investigations [86]. As further interest
developed, gallon quantities were made in 1938, and a full size production
plant was completed in late 1943. The fuel was tested, and the high lead
sensitivity resulted in power outputs up to 4 times that of iso-octane, and
as much as 25% improvement in fuel economy over iso-octane [10].<p>

All of this sounds incredibly good, but then, as now, the cost of octane
enhancement has to be considered, and the plant producing triptane was not
really viable. the fuel was fully evaluated in the aviation test engines,
and it was under the aviation test conditions - where mixture strength is
varied, that the high power levels were observed over a narrow range of
engine adjustment. If turbine engines had not appeared, then maybe triptane
would have been used as an octane agent in leaded aviation gasolines.
Significant design changes would have been required for engines to utilise
the high anti-knock rating.<p>

As an unleaded additive, it was not that much different to other isoalkanes,
consequently the modern manufacturing processes for aviation gasolines are
alkylation of unsaturated C4 HCs with isobutane, to produce a highly
iso-paraffinic product, and/or aromatization of naphthenic fractions to
produce aromatic hydrocarbons possessing excellent rich-mixture antiknock
properties.<p>

So, the myth that triptane was the wonder anti-knock agent that would provide
heaps of power arose. In reality, it was one of the best of the iso-alkanes
( remember we are comparing it to iso-octane which just happened to be worse
than most other iso-alkanes), but it was not _that_ different from other
members. It was targeted, and produced, for supercharged aviation engines
that could adjust their mixture strength, used highly leaded fuel, and wanted
short period of high power for takeoff, regardless of economy.<p>

The blending octane number, which is what we are discussing, of triptane
is designated by the American Petroleum Institute Research Project 45 survey
as 112 Motor and 112 Research [31]. Triptane does not have a significantly
different blending number for MON or RON, when compared to iso-octane.
When TEL is added, the lead response of a large number of paraffins is well
above that of iso-octane ( about +45 for 3ml TEL/US Gal ), and this can lead
to Performance Numbers that can not be used in conventional automotive
engines [10].<p>
<h3>
10.2  From Honda Civic to Formula 1 winner.
</h3>
<blockquote><i>
The following is edited from a post in a debate over the advantages of
water injection. I tried to demonstrate what modifications would be required
to convert my own 1500cc Honda Civic into something worthwhile :-).</i>
</blockquote>

There are many variables that will determine the power output of an engine.
High on the list will be the ability of the fuel to burn evenly without
knock. No matter how clever the engine, the engine power output limit is
determined by the fuel it is designed to use, not the amount of oxygen
stuffed into the cylinder and compressed. Modern engines designs and
gasolines are intended to reduce the emission of undesirable exhaust
pollutants, consequently engine performance is mainly constrained by the
fuel available.<p>

My Honda Civic uses 91 RON fuel, but the Honda Formula 1 turbocharged 1.5
litre engine was only permitted to operate on 102 Research Octane fuel, and
had limits placed on the amount of fuel it could use during a race, the
maximum boost of the turbochargers was specified, as was an additional
40kg penalty weight. Standard 102 RON gasoline would be about 96 R+M/2 if
sold as a pump gasoline. The normally-aspirated 3.0 litre engines could use
unlimited amounts of 102RON fuel. The F1 race duration is 305 km or 2 hours,
and it's perhaps worth remembering that Indy cars run at 7.3 psi boost.<p>

For subsequent years the restrictions were even more severe, 150 litres
and 36.3 maximum boost, in a still vain attempt to give the 3 litre,
normally-aspirated engines a chance. Obviously Honda took advantage
of the reduced boost by increasing CR to 9.4:1, and only going to 15%
rich air/fuel ratio. They then developed an economy mode that involved
heating the liquid fuel to 180F to improve vaporisation, and increased
the air temp to 158F, and leaned out the air-fuel ratio to just 2% rich.
The engine output dropped to 610hp @ 12,500 ( from  685hp @ 12,500 and
about 312 lbs-ft of torque @ 10,000 rpm ), but 32% of the energy in
the fuel was converted to mechanical work. The engine still had crisp
throttle response, and still beat the normally aspirated engines that
did not have the fuel limitation. So turbos were banned. No other
F1 racing engine has ever come close to converting 32% of the fuel
energy into work [87].<p>

<h3>Formula #1 - Toulene </h3>
<ul>
<ul>
	R+M/2.........114<br>
	Cost...........$2.50/gal
</ul>


<h4>Mixtures with 92 Octane Premium</h4>

<ul>
10%...........94.2 Octane<br>

20%...........96.4 Octane<br>

30%...........98.6 Octane
</ul>

<p>
Notes: Common ingredient in Octane Boosters in a can.  12-16 ounces will only
raise octane 2-3 *points*, i.e. from 92 to 92.3.  Often costs $3-5 for 12-16
ounces, when it can be purchased for less than $3/gal at chemical supply houses
or paint stores.

</ul>


<h3>Formula #2 - Xylene</h3>

<ul>
<ul>
	R+M/2.........117<br>
	Cost...........$2.75/gal
</ul>


<h4>Mixtures with 92 Octane Premium</h4>

<ul>
10%...........94.5 Octane<br>

20%...........97.0 Octane<br>

30%...........99.5 Octane
</ul>

<p>
Notes: Similar to Toulene.  12-16 ounces will only raise octane 2-3 *points*,
i.e. from 92 to 92.3.  Usually mixed with Toulene and advertised as *race
formula*.

</ul>

<h3>Formula #3 - Methyl-tertiary-butyl-ether (MTBE)</h3>

<ul>
<ul>
	R+M/2.........118<br>
	Cost...........$3.50/gal
</ul>


<h4>Mixtures with 92 Octane Premium</h4>


<ul>
10%...........94.6 Octane<br>
20%...........97.2 Octane<br>
30%...........99.8 Octane
</ul>

<p>
Notes: Oxygenate.  Very common in octane booster products.  Has lower BTU
content than toulene or xylene, but oxygenate effect makes the gasoline burn
better and produce more energy.

</ul>

<h3>Formula #4 - Methanol or Ethanol</h3>

<ul>
<ul>
	R+M/2.........101<br>
	Cost...........$0.60 - $1.75/gal
</ul>


<h4>Mixtures with 92 Octane Premium</h4>

<ul>
10%...........94.3 Octane (Methanol)<br>
10%...........94.7 Octane (Ethanol)<br>
20%...........Not Recommended

Notes: Methanol is wood alcohol.  Ethanol is grain alcohol and found in Gasohol
in 10% ratios.  Both alcohols are mildly corrosive and will eat gas tank
linings, rubber and aluminum if used in excessive ratios.  Main ingredient in
"Gas Dryers", combine with water.

To make your own octane booster, it is easiest to make up a large
batch, and then bottle it up in "dosage-size" uses.

<p> Below is the basic formula of one of the popular octane booster
products.  To make eight 16 ounce bottles (128 oz = 1 gal):


<ul>

<li>100 oz of toulene for octane boost

<li> 25 oz of mineral spirits (cleaning agent)

<li> 3 oz of transmission fluid (lubricating agent)
</ul>

<p>
This product is advertised as "octane booster with cleaning agent *and*
lubricating agent!".  Diesel fuel or kerosene can be substituted for mineral
spirits and light turbine oil can be substituted for transmission fluid.  Color
can be added with petroleum dyes.

<h2>TR2 Axle Seal Replacement</h2>
<i> by Mark Gendron</i>
</center>
<HR size=10>


I have replaced both seals on my TR2, and I wasted hours attempting to
remove the outer hub with a screw-type extractor.  My TR2 has a later
Girling axle, rather than the original Lockheed axle fitted to the TR2.

<p>
To remove the outer hub from the axle shaft (to access the outer
seals), you will require the services of a hydraulic press. I suggest
the following procedure: 

<ol>

<li>Loosen the large axle nut. This is best accomplished with the road
wheel still in place, to help prevent the axle from rotating. This nut
is tightened to 120 lb-ft as I recall, so it is often tough to remove. 

<li>Remove the complete hub/axle assembly by removing the six bolts
from the brake backing plate. 

<li>Take the hub/axle assembly to your friendly machine shop, and ask
the proprietor to put it on his biggest, baddest hydraulic press.
Separating these components usually takes several tons of pressure,
and is announced by a very loud noise. 
</ol>

<h2>Do-It-Yourself Alignment</h2>
<i>by Calvin Sanders</i>
</center>
<HR size=10>



I received a lot of interest from fellow British Car owners when I
mentioned doing my own alignemnts with homemade tools, so I took a
couple of days and put together this explination of how I do it, and
what tools I use. If everyone understands this, then I'll give horror
stories of aligning a Spec Racer (Sports Renault) or Formula Car.

<h4>The Do-it-yourself Alignment</h4>

When I first said it took $20 in tools I made a quick guess off the
top of my head, but here is what you need and a guess of the cost.

<pre>
15' of clear vinyl tubing about 5/16" diameter               $3.00
2  12" rulers - swipe from office supply at work :-)         $0.00
10-20 pieces of fairly stiff floor tiles 12X12"
    left over from the last time you replaced kitchen floor  $2.00
16" bubble level from Roses on sale                          $3.00
Piece of wood long enough to span one wheel from lip to lip  $0.00
6" machinists ruler with 1/32" or better markings            $4.00
Carpenters Plumbob on sale at Sears                          $2.00
Some kind of fixture for measuring Caster                    $????
Fishing line - about 40 feet                                 $1.00
4 jack stands - should already have                          $0.00
Magnetic base carpenters Protractor                          $4.00
</pre>

I didn't miss the $20 guess by much.
These are the minimum you need.

<p>
There are some other ones that may help. A Lucas or similiar digital
protractor is a great tool. If I were to spend much money on any one
tool it would be one of these. I think they are about $90, but if anything
is worth the money they are. They will just make the job much easier.

<p>
OK first make sure your tires all have proper air preassures in them.
First you will need to find a level spot. For this I use clear tape
and attach the two rulers to the ends of the clear vinyl tubing.
then you fill the tubing with water. I usually use the tubing like
a straw and draw the water up into the tubing. You need two people
to use this as a water level. The idea is the water will be level at
both ends of the tubing when the tubing is held upright. You can then
stand one ruler where one wheel will be and the other ruler where another
tire will be and if the water is at the same level on the two rulers
then those two spots are level. You can then adjust the "pads" where
the tires will be by making stacks of tile. Each tile is usually about
1/8" thick so it takes a few tiles to bring up all the low spots up
to the highest spot. In your garage you may want to mark these spots
and take notes of how many tiles each place needs.

<p>
Next you need to find out how true your rims are. I jack up each wheel
and sit the jack stand next to the wheel and sit the machinists ruler
on the jack stand with it extending just to the rim. Then rotate the
wheel one turn and see how much runout you have. On most alloy wheels
they will have less than 1/32" which is just fine. On factory steel
wheels some wheels may have as much as 1/4" which will ruin your
measurements. Find 2 places on your wheel that are 180 degrees apart
and have the same runout measurement. On almost all wheels there is 2
places you can use to measure on, though you may have to search for 
the spot. I then mark the spots with a pencil or magic marker. 

<p>
Alternatively you can either check the tire for trueness and use the
tire for measuring, or you can make chalk marks around the tire on the 
edge of the tread and use a nail or something sharp to make a scribe
line around the tread surface near the outside and make all measurements
to the scribe line. To do this jack the wheel up so it can spin
freely and drive a nail through a piece of wood. Lay the piece of wood
on the floor so that the point of the nail just touches the tire tread.
When the tire is spun around you will have a true line scratched around
the tire. I have found this method of measuring to not be as convenient
as using the rim, so use the rim if it is possible. If your rims are
true you can assume them to always be true unless you run over a curb
or something. This means you don't have to check them every time you 
align your car. 

<p>
Next I like to find the centerline of my car. I do this by using the
plumbob draped over my inner suspension mounting points and measuring
half way between them and finding the center-line. This of course
does not work on all cars. Some cars don't have suspensions that are
mirrors of each other, but most do. I will drop the
plumbob to the floor and make pencil marks on the floor.
Then I will measure on the floor. I found a friends Corvette to have a
perfectly straight frame, but to body of the car to be about 1/2" 
crooked on the frame. You can't go by the center of the bumper or
anything like this. Once you have found the C/L carry the mark
up to the chassis or body. I made a fine white line on the front of the
frame and the rear of the body under the bumper on my Mustang GT
with a paint marker. Now I measure from the centerline for all
measurements. 

<p>
Now put the car on the leveled pads. It is best to have rolled the
car back and forth a few times to get the suspension settled. Also
I should mention that I have made pads out of one square foot cuts
of 2"X12" boards with small angled ramps on the fronts of them. This
lifts the car up 2" making suspension parts easier to get to. I then
level with the tiles on top of these pads. It works fairly well making
the suspension parts easier to reach. 

<p>
First I like to check the castor. I seldom make any chages to this
adjustment. It is also not that critical to have exaclty to some
spec, but it is important to have each side even. For this I use the
Magnetic base protractor. It is accurate to .5 degrees which I think
is adequate for castor measurement. On a Strut car I simply place it
on the strut and measure the angle of the strut. This may be off
slightly from the spec books, bit the error is correct from side
to side and it is fairly close. If you have a car with upper ball
joints first check your spindles for a machined flat spot that is
parallel with the ball joint axis. If this exists then you can simply
place the protractor on this surface and measure castor. Many cars
have this machined surface for various reasons. If it doesn't then
all is not lost. You will need to make some sort of fixture that 
will "reach in" to the ball joints. You will need a vertical flat
surface with two "arms" extending to the ball joints. A 2X4 with 
2 long bolts through it may work. You want a vertical surface parallel
with the ball joint axis. You can measure this with the surface
with the protractor again. You can also measure this in a similiar
method to how I will measure camber later for more accuracy.
This is of course only necessary if your car has some way to
adjust castor, which many do not.

<p>
Next I like to measure camber. This is the most important measurement
in autocrossing in most people's opinion. I use the short level attached
to a piece of wood and the machinists ruler for this. I cut the piece
of wood so that it will span across from the top wheel lip to the
bottom one. I then attach the level to the piece of wood. I use the
wood for a couple of reasons. First I can shim between the wood and
the level to correct for errors that may occur  in the cheap level.
I have found most of them to have some small inaccuracies in them.
Also you may need to notch the wood to clear the wheel in the center
for the hub or something. I also have different lengths of wood for the
different wheel diameters I work with. To correct for errors I use the
plumbob. It will hang vertical. I then shim between the wood and the
level until it is indicating level when the board is completely
vertical. 

<p>
Now you must have the two places on your wheel you found to be true
to each other, vertical (straight up and down). If your entire wheel
is true then it is a great benefit at this point. Take the piece of
wood and the level and span across your rim with the level vertical.
Now use the bubble and pull out from the top of the wheel until you
are holding the level vertical. Now measure from the piece of wood to
the top of your rim. It will be a distance of about 1/4" or so (assuming
you have negative camber. Take this measurement with the machinists ruler.
Be as accurate as you can. Then you need to take that distance and divide
it by the span distance of the piece of wood. For a 15" wheel you can
just use 15" and a 16" wheel 16" etc. Then look up this number in your
old Trig table in your high school trig book. You will need to find the
arc tangent of the number you have. The degrees of this will be the
camber angle. 

<p>
I have a 10 line basic program that will print a chart for converting these
angles I have included in the end of this. I have also included a chart
that will convert this measurement without dividing and looking up the
measurement. I now prefer to keep my measurements in inches of gap at
the top of the wheel rather than converting them to degrees. I keep
my log books in this measurement rather than degrees for each car. It
only causes a problem if I change the rim diameters of any one car I
am working with.

<p>
For toe in measurement I need to reference the centerline of the car.
First you need to get the measuring points on your wheels at 9 and
3 o'clock. This is where it is helpful to have true wheels, then you
don't have to move the car. You will need the jack stands and fishing
line for this, plus the machinists ruler. you want to set up the fishing
line outside the sides of the car an equal distance from the centerline
of the car. I tie the fishing line to the jackstands so that the line
when streched will be about equal height to the center of the wheel hubs.
This does not have to be exact, but close to the wheel hub center. 
measure out from the centerline to about 3" outside the wheels. The
setup will look like this when viewed from above:

                         Fishing line/

</pre>

<p> It is important to get the fishing line parallel to the centerline
of the car. You can't measure to the rocker pannel or the wheel hubs
or anything initially because they may or maynot be parallel to the
centerline. So the first time measure from the centerline that you
found before. Now it is good to then measure from the bottom corners
of the door or the rocker pannel or something and record the
measurement in your log book. It will make the setup much faster of
you want to change your toe quickly at an event. It should be noted
that a prefectly level pad is not necessary for toe setting. It is
good to get the car on a fairly level spot but exactly level is not
important.

<p>Then to measure the toe measure at the front edge of the rim and
the rear edge of the rim and subtract the difference.  That will give
you the toe measurement. Obviously for toe in the measurement at the
rear of the wheel (from the fishing line to the edge of the rim) will
be less than the measurement at the front of the wheel. The reverse is
true for toe out and the two measurements will be equal for zero toe.
The measurements you will be working with will actually be less than
what is usually referenced in spec books because the diameter you are
working with is the rim diameter, the measurement most cars use is
taken at the tread surface, so you may need to make some conversions
depending on the specs for your car. Find out how the specs you are
working with are measured. Some cars give angles of toe in degrees,
some are inches of toe on each side, and some are total toe added
together between the sides.  Make sure you are working with apples and
apples not apples and oranges.

<p>
Each time you make a toe adjustment recheck your steering wheel if you
have not locked it. When you adjust one side the steering wheel usually
moves and must be re-centered before you take new measurements. Locking
the wheel some way will make the job easier.

<p>
As you are making changes take a note of what one shim here and one turn
of the tie rod there changes and how much. You will notice that a camber
change changes the toe drastically, but as toe change does very little
to the camber, etc. When you get used to these things then changing your
toe settings as you are changing your tires at an event is a rather simple
matter and changing it back to the original toe setting when it is time
to drive home is easy if you have made a few marks. On my Mustang GT
I have marked the strut tops as to what change is what camber and I have
2 makrs on each tie rod end. I used to change the camber and toe at 
each event, but I now leave the negative camber in and dial in a little
extra toe-out before an event and can feel confident about resetting
it correctly before I drive home. I check it occasionally just to make 
sure the frame hasn't changed.

<p>
It takes a couple of hours the first time, but once you have done this
a couple of times you can do a complete check of your alingnment in a 
couple of minutes in your garage and at an event you can locate a flat
spot and check a car completely before you run. It is really fairly easy
to do once you get used to it.

<p>
Here is the chart I promised. It goes up to 6 degrees of camber. The way
you use it is to look up the gap between the level and the rim at the
top on the diameter rim you are using and look on the left column and find
the number of degrees. I have included the tangent of the angle just for
good measure.

<p>
This is a hard process to explain without hands on aids. I taught
a seminar for our sports car club on how to do this and evryone
thought it was easy after they did it a few times. I got several
phone calls the day after the seminar as everyone went home to do
it for the first time themselves, but they were all able to align
their own cars correctly.
<p>
It is realy easy to do and it gives you a great deal of confidence
in how your car was set up. I will try to answer all questions. I'm
sure I was not as clear as I would have hoped to be in some places.

<h2>The Triumph TR6 Tires Fact Sheet</h2>
</center>
<HR size=10>

Replacing the tires on your car as they wear out is a necessity of car
ownership.  What type of tires to put on a TR6 seems to be a common
question among TR6 owners.  This page is intended to provide some
information, both statistical, and anecdotal, to help guide you in
deciding what tires are right for you and your car.

<p>

Below is a recent account of this issue, recounted by Bob Lang:

<blockquote>

<p>
First, I'm assuming that you have stock steel disc rims. If you have wires
or Mags, you might have different choices.

<p>
<b>Redlines:</b> There are apparently three sources for red-lines. Michelin, Avon and
Commander. They are are 185/80-15 tires. The Michelins requires tubes, I don't
know about the others. Bottom line: Michelins are roughly $220 per corner.
That's a lot. The Avons were pricey too, and the Commanders were around $100
each, but they are only "s" speed rated. You can find dealers for these listed
in Hemmings.

<p>
<b>Others:</b> The 80 series tires are pretty much passe' if you're into driving.
However, the 185/80-15 tire was used quite a bit by British cars. Thus, there
are some equivalent tires available from any of the tire manufacturers. The
only problem that I saw was that a lot of the offerings in the "correct"
size are white-walls... too tacky IMHO for a TR6.  (Of course,
whitewalls can be mounted with the black side out.)

<p>At any rate, I bought a set of Michelin XGT4 tires in the 215/70-15 size. These
tires work out to be less than 1% larger overall diameter than the original.
I have driven quite a bit on them already this year (over 1000 miles so far)
and they are pretty nice. I paid roughly $91 each installed. And if I have a
tire problem almost anywhere in the US, I can get one new tire from the any
local Michelin dealer. That's a plus for me, because I drive a lot of long-
distance runs with my car. 

<p>
Now, I had a set of Pirelli P5 215VR70-15's on the Six last year, and those are
really cool, but they cost >$160 per tire. The ones I had were used,
theyworked for a season, but I would not recommend used tires. It costs too much
to keep installing and balancing them.

<p>
I would stay away from the 205/70-15 or shorter profiles (like 60 series) unless
you don't care about how accurate your speedometer is. If you're into autox
you might want the 205/70 because they are roughly 2% smaller diameter. If you
have TR250 4 inch wires, this is the biggest tire that they recommend.

<p>
Whatever you decide, good luck. -- rml

<p>
p.s. when you get the tires mounted, try to get them to use the MAG machine,
not the regular unit. If they have to use the regular machine, have them
mount from the inside of the rim, not the outside. If they try to mount the
"normal" way, they might bend your rims!!!!

  Maximum Air Pressure - This is the max pressure the tire is designed to hold 
                         (note this is more than the recommended inflation
                         pressure)

  Maximum Load         - Weight the tire can support

  Load Index           - A code that indicates the maximum weight the tire can
                         carry at its speed indicated by its speed rating

  Construction         - Tells the number and type of plies used in the
                         construction of the tread and sidewall

  DOT Serial Number    - Identifies the plant, manufacturer, and date of
                         production

  Tread Wear Index     - A rating of the tire's resistance to wear.  100 is the
                         reference.  A 250 rating indicates 2.5 times the wear
                         resistance of the reference tire.  This number cannot
                         be accurately translated to mileage.

  Traction Index       - A rating of the tire's ability to stop on wet pavement.
                         There are three grades, A, B, and C, with A being the
                         best.  This index does not reflect the tire's traction
                         performance on dry, snowy, or icy pavement.

  Temperature Index    - A rating of the tire's ability to dissipate and resist
                         heat.  There are three grades, A, B, and C, with A
                         being the best.

<h2>Storing Your Triumph</h2>

<i>by Ken Streeter, <br>
Extracted from various Internet articles,<br>
including items from British and Z-car mailing lists</i>
</center>
<HR size=10>

One of the most frequently asked questions every October is that of
"How do I store my Triumph for the winter?"  This article is intended
to help in answering that very question.  


<p>
<b>Q: What is the *minimum* I should do before storing my car?
 <p>

A: </b>Just run the car until thoroughly hot, drive it into the
storage area, kill the engine, drain the carbs (if any), remove the
battery and take it inside, make sure the antifreeze is good, put the
vehicle up on jackstands, and fit a quality car cover

<p>
<b>Q: Anything else I should do for more protection?
<p>

A: </b> For added protection for the engine, you can unscrew the
plugs, drip a few drops of engine oil in the cylinders, crank the
engine around a couple of revs to distribute the oil on the cylinder
walls, then put the plugs back.  Yes, the exhaust will smoke some at
startup, but no damage should result from the smoke.  <p><p>

<b>Q: Any common "car storage" myths?
<p>

A: </b>Running the engine while on jackstands is a bad myth.  You
won't be able to run it long enough to fully warm the oil which means
corrosive combustion products will condense and mix with the oil.
You'd be setting up the same conditions as exist in cars "driven by
little old ladies to the store and back", ie, ideal conditions for
sludge to form.  Engines can be stored for years with no more
precautions than making sure it was good and hot when turned off.  If
you're really paranoid, pull the plugs and hose each cylinder with
something like CLP Breakfree or LPS.  You could even replace the plugs
with some of those anti-corrosive vapor emitters sold out of some
catalogs. 

<p>
<b>Q: Should I use a car cover?  Any disadvantages or precautions?
<p>

A: </b> Generally, car covers are good things.  Two precautions are to
avoid moisture condensation (get a cover that breathes, or make sure
there is plenty of ventilation, or store in a dry environment), and
watch for cover flutter if stored outdoors in the wind (this will dull
the paint).

<p>

<b>Q: What about using the car a minimum amount while in storage,
          rather than completely shutting it down?  Is that good or bad?

-<p>
A: </b>-- The following was sent in by a reader of "The Shelby American" magazine.
--- The qualifications of the author are unknown.
--- For an alternative set of directions, see the subsequent article
    (immediately following this one)

<h4>MINIMUM USE OR STORAGE</h4>
<p>

We'll break it down into two types of storage: long term and short
term.  Short term storage is essentially a lengthened period of
inactivity.  The main question, here, seems to be how long can you go
without starting a car before you begin to risk damaging it?  And the
answer is about 4 weeks.  If you let your car sit longer than that
without taking special precautions (outlined in 'Long Term Storage',
below) you're courting disaster.  The internals of your engine,
transmission and rear end are bare metal surfaces which are highly
susceptible to rust.  In fact, they can cease operating effectively if
they begin to get even a slight amount of surface rust.  They are
bathed in oil during normal operation and oil prevents rust.  When the
car sits, the oil drains off of some of these surfaces.  Moisture is
the key ingredient necessary for the rusting process and when the bare
metal encounter moisture the result is...  rust.  The less moisture in
the air, the less the tendency for rust to occur; dry weather in the
southwest and colder temperatures in the northern climes help to ward
off rust.  High humidity accelerates it.  Some so-called 'experts'
advise people who don't drive their cars throughout the year to start
them up periodically to circulate the fluids and, thus, keep the
internal bare metal surfaces coated with oil.  While this might seem
reasonable, it is the automotive equivalent of the 'old wives tale'.
It is exactly the WRONG thing to do.  A car in short term storage
needs to be driven at least once a month.  It requires more than just
getting the water temperature gauge off of the peg.  The oil
temperature should also be brought up to normal operating conditions -
and this isn't possible if the car just sits in the garage - no matter
how much you rev the engine.  You need to take the car out for a drive
for about 20 miles or a half an hour.  When you go out to the garage
to just warm the car up, what you're doing is raising the temperature
inside the block - but the engine doesn't run long enough for the
engine block to get entirely heated.  As a result, when you shut the
car off the difference in temperatures (hot inside but cold outside)
causes condensation on the inside.  Condensation is moisture - and
moisture causes rust.  A car sitting too long without being run also
invites fuel in the carburetor and fuel pump to evaporate, leaving
behind a gummy residue.  Gaskets dry out are then prone to cracking
and disintegrating...  more things you don't want happening to your
car's engine!  So Dr.  Hipo recommends a half hour of exercise once a
month, every month.  On the way back home you should stop off at the
gas station and top the fuel tank off...  because condensation can
also form on the inside of a partially empty gas tank.  The oil change
interval isn't effected too much by inactivity.  Moisture can be
collected in motor oil and if it is, it reduces the oil's lubricating
ability.  Don't be pennywise and pound foolish thinking that you don't
have to change oil just because you've only driven the car 250 miles
in the past year.  Under those condition, an oil change once a year is
warranted (although changing the filter probably isn't - you can
stretch that to every other year).

<h4> Long Term Storage</h4>

<p>

Long term storage is another story entirely.  Here, instead of
breaking that annual 250 miles into twelve 20-mile drives once a
month, you're using the car 250 miles all at once and then putting it
away for the next eleven months.  Or longer.  The way to prepare a car
for this kind of storage is to drive it long enough to heat the block
(about 20 miles or so) and then change the oil.  With the car idling
at about 3000 RPM, slowly pour about a half a quart of oil down the
carburetor.  Be careful not to dump it in all at once - pour it in a
slow, steady stream.  The exhaust will begin to smoke and the engine
may even stall.  If it does, do not attempt to restart it.  What
you've done is to coat the intake and exhaust ports, the valve steams
and guides, combustion chambers, piston surfaces and cylinder wall
with oil - the very surfaces which are most exposed to moisture - and
rusting - during storage.  You should then seal the carburetor and oil
breathers and back off the valve adjustments until all the valves are
closed.  This buttons the engine up so that moisture-laden air doesn't
get inside the engine - where it would come in contact with with bare
metal surfaces.  Hit all the nipples with a grease gun (don't forget
those hard to-get-to ones on the universals!)  and top-off the master
cylinder, steering box, transmission, rear end, radiator and fuel tank
(and throw in a can of dry gas while you're at it).  Remove the
battery and move it inside (do not store it on concrete; if you put it
on the floor sit it on a piece of wood).  Raising the car up on
jackstands or blocks relieves the constant pressure on the coil/and or
leaf springs and helps keep the tires from dry-rotting and
flat-spotting.  It also allows you to turn the rear wheels by hand
every once and a while to keep the transmission and rear end gears
coated with oil.  Finally, a coat of wax and maybe a quick once-over
for the interior with protectant or moistureizer and you're ready to
say 'so long' to your friend before you put the car cover on.  Now,
you're probably asking yourself one final question: How short can
'Long Term Storage' be?  In those parts of the country where winter
driving means ice, snow, sand and salt, most Shelby and Cobra are put
away around Thanksgiving - or at the first sign of freezing weather.
They are brought back out in the spring - after the rains have washed
the residual sand and salt from the roads.  Four months isn't too
short a time for the oil down the carburetor treatment (but you may
not want to mess with the valves).  -Ed

<h4>LONG TERM STORAGE TIPS</h4>

I feel the advice given to your readers on the proper method to store
autos for the winter needs clarification.

1.  Gasoline tank condensation and water contamination is not a big
    problem as long as you fill the tank completely with gasoline.  Just by
    limiting the volume of vapor space above the gasoline, in the tank, you
    will eliminate condensation related damage in the fuel tank.

2.  Additives to eliminate water contamination in gasoline should be
    chosen very carefully as most additive that advertise themselves
    as removing water from fuel are alcohol-type products.  It is true
    that alcohol will put vagrant water molecules into a solution that
    will inhibit rust formation in the gas tank as well as making the
    gas/water/alcohol mixture suitable for burning.  What people
    generally don't realize is alcohol is corrosive to white metals
    and can do damage to fuel gauge sensors, line couplings and
    carburetors.

3.  The best method of preparing your fuel system for storage is to
    add upper cylinder oil to your gas tank prior to filling the car
    and allowing it to mix thoroughly by filling the tank.  Pouring
    oil down the carburetor is not a recommended practice in that most
    oils' additive package will not burn properly and will foul both
    your carburetor and your spark plugs.  If you feel strongly about
    providing sufficient lubrication inside the carburetor system, I
    recommend you increase the quantity of upper cylinder lubricant in
    the gas tank, and spray the throat and exterior of the carburetor
    with a light machine oil like WD-40 or a similar protectant after
    the car has been placed on storage blocks.

4.  The most important part of storing the car for a long period is to
    protect the _cooling system_ from unnecessary corrosion by doing
    the following: 1) drain and flush the cooling system (including
    the heater); 2) replace coolant with 50/50 water/antifreeze
    solution (straight antifreeze is also corrosive and should never
    be used straight); 3) add 4-8 oz.  of water soluble oil to the
    coolant and run the car until it reaches operating temperature.
    The water soluble oil will turn milky in the coolant and will
    inhibit the formation of rust and deposits on the surfaces of the
    water jackets.  Treatment with this type of oil will also inhibit
    dissimilar metal corrosion that occurs naturally in most engines.
    If you have trouble finding water soluble oil in convenient
    package sizes, products such as "Bars-Leaks" are a good source of
    this type of oil.  Regular oil will not do.

5.  An oil change to API classification SG motor oil is also
    recommended.  The formulation of SG will keep sludge deposits from
    forming in engines subject to condensation such as infrequently
    run engines.

I think you will find that your car will come through a long period of
storage in much better condition if you try the above techniques.

Q: Are there any good corrosion preventive sprays I can use for a very
          long term storage item?

<p>
A: </b>
WD-40 is good for a light film treatment of bare metal surfaces (carburettors,
etc).  For a heavier soft waxy film, LPS-3 is fantastic.  CLP Breakfree is
also reputed to be good.

<p><b>

Q: What about putting the whole car in a giant baggie, or sealing it
          into a container of some sort?  Is anything commercially available?

<p>
A: </b>There is a new product designed specifically for the purpose of long term
auto storage.  The name of this product is OMNIBAG and it's sold by Ridge
Enterprises of Bath MI.  It's a special storage bag that fits completely over
your car and seals hermetically.  The bag comes with a desiccant (moisture
absorber) and slips over the entire car like a sock.  The bag is made of
triple laminated polyethelene and is air and moisture tight.  According to
customers who have used the bag, car emerges form storage virtually in the
same condition they were in when first stored.  No dust settles on the car,
metal surfaces are still polished and uncorroded and carpets and upholstery
are free of moisture and mildew.  OMNIBAG is designed for inside use only and
sells for $89.95<p>

I put my Jag in an 'Omnibag' last winter.  The bag is basically a huge
garbage bag.  It was a little bit of work getting the car into the bag
(required three people).  And the "chip clips" that they supplied with
the bag weren't too good.  They wouldn't hold the bag shut so I
resorted to clamping the end down with blocks of wood.  I was
disappointed enough with the clips that I complained about them in
response to a survey letter I received from the owner of Pine Ridge
Enterprises.  He apologized and sent me a new kind of clip that he
will be sending out in future.  The new clip looks strong enough to
hold the bag shut. When I took the Jag out of the bag this spring the
car was indeed in as good condition as when I put it away.  - Robert

<TITLE>Mail Order Rights and Privileges</TITLE>
</head>
<BODY BGCOLOR="c0d0c0">


<HR size=10>

<h2>Mail Order Rights and Privileges</h2>
<i>by Bill Sohl,<br>
electronic copy by T.J. Higgins</i>
</center>
<HR size=10>

<ul>
<font size=-1>
This article is reprinted from a 1986 issue of <i> The English
Channel</i>, a Newsletter Supplement to <i>The Vintage Triumph</i>
</font>
</ul>

<p>This issue of <i>The English Channel</i> (TEC) is devoted to what your
rights and privileges are when you order parts and services by mail.
But before you panic at the thought that things are rotten in Triumph
land, we would like to set your concerns at ease by stating that: with
very rare exception, the business practices, response to customers
problems and general day to day operation of the vendors of Triumph
parts and services are excellent.

<p>If that is so, then why, you ask, is this TEC covering the subject?
Unfortunately, not everything that always goes on is as excellent as
it should be.  Recently VTR was contacted by two members that had
problems with one particular vendor.  We are happy to report that both
member's problems were reconciled to their satisfaction, albeit after a
protracted time period and only after VTR assisted in bringing the
problems to a head.  Much of the ability to bring these two member's
problems to a satisfactory conclusion was the result of good
supporting documentation and information with regard to the
correspondence and phone calls that transpired prior to VTR being
asked to help.

<p>The purpose then of this issue's focus is to equip you with the 
knowledge of what your rights and privileges are and also what the 
vendor is expected to do to live up to his obligations towards 
satisfactorily completing your order.  By so doing, you will be in a 
much stronger position to effectively deal with a problem should one 
arise.

<h4> When are you entitled to a refund? </h4>

<p>Most people, VTR members included, generally believe that if they 
don't like something they bought, they are or should be entitled to 
return the item and receive a refund.  As it turns out, there is no 
legal rule that makes that so.  As long as you got what you ordered, 
and it wasn't defective, stores or mail order vendors are under no 
obligation to take the item back and give you a refund.  Those stores/
vendors that do are doing so as an internal business practice, usually
to maintain a good image with their customers.

<p>On the other hand, if you don't get what you ordered, you are
always entitled to get your money back.  If, for example, you ordered
a new set of black TR-3 seat covers with white piping and the vendor
can no longer supply them that way, you do not have to accept a
substitute.  Nor do you need to accept a credit towards other
purchases.  You are entitled to and should receive a refund.  An
important point in this example is to be explicit when you order
certain items.  If you want black seats with the white piping, then be
specific on your order form.

<h4> What is the Mail Order Rule </h4>

<p>The Mail Order Rule was issued by the Federal Trade Commission 
(FTC) to correct growing problems with late or undelivered mail order 
merchandise.  Under this Rule, the vendor has a duty to ship 
merchandise on time.  He also must follow procedures that the rule 
requires if he cannot ship ordered merchandise on time.

<p>When there is a shipping delay, the Rule requires that the vendor
notify customers of the delay and provide them with an option either
to agree to the delay or to cancel the order and receive a prompt
refund.  For each additional delay, customers must be notified that
they must send in a signed consent to a further delay or a refund
will be given.

<p>Although most members of the mail order industry adhere to the 
Rule's requirements, there are some who do not.  The FTC's Bureau of 
Consumer Protection monitors consumer complaints to ensure that 
businesses comply with the Rule.  The FTC also provides compliance 
information and assistance to all industry members.

<p>When a vendor offers to sell merchandise by mail, the Rule requires
him to have a "reasonable basis" for expecting to ship within the time
stated in his solicitation.

<p>For example, if the vendor knows before advertising some products 
that suppliers are on strike and are likely to remain on strike for 
several months, he does not have a "reasonable basis" for expecting to
ship within a month.

<p>The shipping date, when provided in the ad offer, must be clearly 
and conspicuously stated.

<pre>
                        ADVERTISEMENT
                       Triumph Sweaters
                    S,M,L -- Beige or Blue
                       $29.95 plus tax
                  Allow 5 weeks for shipment.
</pre>

<p>If the ad does not provide a shipping date, the vendor must ship 
the merchandise within 30 days of receiving a "properly completed" 
order.  An order is properly completed when you send payment 
accompanied by all information needed to fill the order:  Payment may 
be made by cash, money order, check, or credit card, according to the 
vendor's policy.  If a credit card is used for a purchase, the order 
is properly completed when the vendor charges your account.

<p>When a vendor cannot ship on time, he must provide the customer
with an "option" notice.  The notice must provide an option to cancel
the order and receive a prompt refund, or to agree to a delay in
shipping. And, as with the original date, the vendor must have a
reasonable basis for setting that shipping date.

<p>A vendor must also have a reasonable basis for telling customers 
that he does not know when he can ship merchandise.  In that case, he 
must provide the specific reasons for the shipping problem.  For 
example, that a fire destroyed the warehouse holding the goods and he 
is unable to provide a revised shipping date because he does not know 
how long it will take to replace the merchandise.

<h4>When you should receive a first notice</h4>

<p>If a shipment is delayed, the Rule requires that the vendor give 
customers an option:

<ul>
<li>to consent to a delay; or
<li>to cancel the order and receive a prompt refund.
</ul>

<p>People in the trade often refer to the notice as a "delay" notice. 
More accurately, it should be called an "option" notice.  The Rule is 
violated if the vendor only provides a notice of delay without also 
providing an option to cancel the order.

<p>Remember, the vendor must send the notice after first becoming 
aware that there will be a shipping delay.  The notice must be sent:
<ul>
<li>  before the promised shipping date; or
<li>  within 30 days after receipt of the order (if no date was 
     provided in the solicitation).
</ul>

<h4>What a first notice must say</h4>

<p>If the vendor provides a revised shipping date of 30 days or less, 
he must have a reasonable basis for making the change.  The notice 
must inform you that non-response is considered consent to a delay of 
30 days or less.

<p>If the vendor is unable to provide a revised shipping date, the 
notice must state that he cannot determine when the merchandise will 
be shipped.  It must also state that the order will be automatically 
canceled unless:
<ul>
<li>  the merchandise is shipped within 30 days of the original 
     shipping date and the vendor has not received your cancellation 
     before shipment; or
<li>  the vendor receives within 30 days of the original date your 
     consent to the delay.
</ul>

<p>The notice must provide this information if the definite revised 
shipping date is more than 30 days after the original date.

<p>When the vendor is unable to provide a revised shipping date, he 
must inform customers of their continuing right to cancel the order by
notifying him prior to actual shipment.

<h4>What later notices must say</h4>

<p>If he is unable to ship the merchandise on or before the revised 
shipping date, the vendor must notify customers again.  This is called
a "renewed option" notice.  This notice must inform customers of their
right to consent to a further delay, or to cancel the order and 
receive a prompt refund.

<p>The renewed option notice must inform customers that if they do not
agree in writing to this delay, their order will be canceled.  Unless 
the vendor receives the customer's express written consent to the 
second delay before the first delay period ends, he must cancel the 
order and provide a full refund.

<p>Keep in mind that he does not have to offer a "renewed option" to 
customers who consent to an indefinite delay in response to the first 
option notice.  But any customer who agrees to an indefinite delay has
the continuing right to cancel the order at any time before the 
merchandise is shipped.

<h4>How the vendor should send notices</h4>

<p>The vendor should send any option notice by first class mail, and 
his notice should provide a written means for customers to respond.  A
prepaid business mail reply or prepaid postage card meets this 
requirement.

<p>The notice is most advantageous for him if at some point he has to
prove that he complied with the Rule.  If the FTC takes action against
a company, the firm must be able to show that any other form of notice
it used was equal to or better that the written form described in the
Rule.  For example, an "800" telephone number for customers' use in
canceling orders is an adequate substitute, if the vendor can prove
that the system met the Rule's requirements.  This would include being
able to show that the 800 number could readily and consistently be
used to cancel an order because he provided adequate and competent
staff to take cancellations.  He should keep records of all
cancellations.

<h4>When the vendor may cancel an order</h4>

<p>In some cases the vendor can have an option to cancel an order or 
to send out another notice.  He may make this decision when he is 
unable to ship merchandise on time or within the delay period to which
the customer agreed.  But if he decides to cancel the order, he must 
inform the customer of this decision and provide a prompt refund.

<p>Whether he cancels or sends another notice, he must inform the 
customer about it within a reasonable time after he knows he cannot 
ship the merchandise.

<h4>When the vendor must cancel an order</h4>

   The vendor must cancel an order and provide a prompt refund:
<ul>
<li>  when the customer does not agree to a delay and exercises the 
     option to cancel and order before it has been shipped;
<li>  when he notifies the customer of his inability to ship the 
     merchandise and of his decision to cancel the order;
<li>  when he is unable to ship merchandise before the revised shipping
     date and he has not received the customer's consent to a further 
     delay;
<li>  when the delay is indefinite and he has not shipped the 
     merchandise or received the customer's consent to an indefinite
     delay;
<li>  when the definite revised shipping date in the first option 
     notice is more than 30 days after the original shipping date, and
     he has not shipped the merchandise, no received the customer's 
     consent to the delay within 30 days of the original shipping 
     date; or
<li>  when he cannot ship on time and does not notify customers of 
     their options.
</ul>

<p>All refunds must be sent to the buyer by first class mail.  If the 
buyer paid by cash, check, or money order, the vendor must refund 
payment within seven (7) days after the order is canceled.  For credit
card sales, he must make refunds within one billing cycle after the 
order is canceled.  UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES IS HE TO SUBSTITUTE CREDIT 
VOUCHERS OR SCRIPT FOR A REFUND.  If for some reason the vendor's 
company has problems in shipping on time, customers may begin to file 
complaints with him, and with local, state, or federal law enforcement
agencies.  Because the Federal Trade Commission has enforcement 
jurisdiction under the Mail Order Rule, many complaints are forwarded 
to the FTC from other agencies.

<p>When the FTC takes action against a company and alleges that it 
violated the Rule, the company must have records or other documentary 
proof that will show the steps it took to comply.  Systems and 
procedures for complying with the Rule are carefully reviewed.  Lack 
of such proof creates a rebuttable presumption that the company failed
to comply.  This means that the seller must be able to show that it 
used reasonable systems and procedures to comply with the Rule.  
Consequently, it is in his best interest to establish an accurate, 
up-to-date record-keeping system.

<h4>What the Rule does not cover</h4>

<p>The following mail order sales are exempt from the Rule:

<ul>  
<li>  orders made on a collect-on-delivery basis (C.O.D.);
  
<li>  orders made by telephone and charged to a credit card account.
     (While not a true legal opinion, I believe that if you order
     something by telephone and specifically instruct the vendor
     NOT to charge your account for anything unless it is being
     shipped, you would have a cause of action against the vendor if
     your account WAS charged for a back-ordered item.)
</ul>

<font size=+2><b>The legend that may yet Triumph</b></font size><br>

<p>
<!-- story start --><p>
<p>
<font size="+1"><summary>As this weekend's Classic Car Show celebrates the famous marque, <b>Giles Chapman</b> wonders if the name might make another comeback</summary></font><p>

<p>If I had hoped for an afternoon of rose-tinted nostalgia with Harry
Webster, I was to be disappointed. The man who masterminded some of
the best-loved British cars of all time declared himself strictly a
pragmatist.<p>

 "If you're in business, whether you're making furniture or selling
fish and chips, you're doing it to make money, to make a profit," he
said. "If you don't, you go to the wall. If Rover thinks reviving the
Triumph name will help it sell more motor cars, then fine, let's do
it. Otherwise, forget it. I'm not sentimental about cars in that
way."<p>

 I had asked the man who created the Triumph Herald, Vitesse,
Spitfire, GT6, 2000, 1300, many TR sports cars and the Stag to cast
his eye over a sheaf of press reports speculating on the return of
Triumph. It appeared that a mole at Rover, now the domain of Germany's
BMW, had been eavesdropping at one of the company planners'
brain-storming sessions. The focus, not unnaturally, was "bums on
seats" - how to sell more cars and take up the slack in Rover's
under-utilised factories. Yet chatter had turned, tangentially, to
what might be stored away in the company's attic.<p>

 The planners knew Rover possessed a trunk somewhere in which old
vestments of empire had been packed away. Once located, the heirlooms
were passed round the table - a sort of antiques roadshow, you might
say.<p>

 Among the hallowed marques, some, like Morris and Austin, would never
be fashionable again and needed to be sent straight to the nearest
charity shop. Others - Wolseley, Riley, Vanden Plas - had touches of
splendour but fell apart when touched; you could never sell them to
anyone again. Odds and ends such as Austin-Healey were sexy but
frayed.<p>

 At the bottom of the trunk, though, was a real treasure: unfaded,
much loved, universally appreciated as sporting and attractive. Out of
its tissue paper and paraded with pride, it was agreed that Triumph
could be fashionable once more.<p>

 The mole scribbled down the excited conversation: we could relaunch
our mid-range Rover 200 and 400 cars as Triumphs, said one chap. We
could use the name to conquer America, blurted another. More sports
cars, more sports cars, squeaked one more.<p>

 At present, such talk is no more than conjecture. The nearest things
that exist to new Triumph cars are the Rover bosses' doodles on their
fag packets. Yes, everything is possible, say the company's spokesmen,
but, no, we can't confirm anything. After all, Triumph disappeared in
a whimper of shame in 1984 when the name was unceremoniously dumped
after 61 years.<p>

Originally an offshoot of the eponymous motorbikes, the company went
bust in the late 1930s, and its Coventry factory was blown to
smithereens during the Second World War. By rights, when peace
returned, Triumph cars should have been just a pleasant, if clouding,
memory. Triumph was a non-entity.<p>

 But, even then, one bright spark realised what a great name it
was. The hot-tempered boss of Standard, Sir John Black, picked up the
Triumph name for 77,000 in 1944, and two years on Triumph cars
returned. They weren't strictly Triumphs - the new models were based
on the same running gear as the Standard Vanguard. But it was a shrewd
buy. The flag-waving Standard name sounded increasingly bottom-rung
and basic. Triumph, however, evoked flourish, victory, winning. By
1963 the latter had totally usurped the former.<p>

 Triumph's speciality was reasonably priced sporting cars, lots of
flash for your cash, with a neat line in innovations - metallic paint,
electric windscreen washers and fuel injection were all Triumph
firsts. In the 1960s and early 1970s the company's bigger saloons were
seen as BMW competitors (indeed, their Italian stylist, Giovanni
Michelotti, was also responsible for the shark-nosed lines of the new
generation of BMWs that emerged with the 2000 of 1963).<p>

 Fifty years on from its post-war reincarnation, Triumph is back at
square one. BMW, of course, has done rather better. But if BMW/Rover's
idle thoughts come to fruition, Triumph could be reborn yet again,
spawning a new range of cars based on Rover's proven hardware but with
added Triumph vigour. It could give the company an entirely new string
to its bow.<p>

 Harry Webster's memories of Triumph have many parallels with the
Rover of today. "Our rivals were always enormously bigger than we
were," recalls Webster, who started as an apprentice at Standard in
1932 and was in charge of all Triumph engineering by 1968; he then
became technical director of BL, a position he held until 1974, when
he left to join AP. "We had to spot niches in the market and say,
'This is where a car will sell for a little bit more than the
others'. We always looked for the difference between what they were
doing and what we could do. We couldn't compete head-on."<p>

 Webster says he'd have loved to be a brain surgeon. Instead, he made
a name for himself by producing a series of cleverly engineered,
low-cost cars, all bar the TR6 (revamped by Karmann in Germany)
prettily styled by Michelotti.<p>

 The last Triumph, however, was a far cry from the stylish cars that
made the company's name. The Acclaim was a rebadged Honda, made in
England as a hasty attempt to rescue an ailing British Leyland. Tom
Blackett, a director of the Interbrand Group, which helps companies
find names for their products, was one of those who advised BL to
ditch Triumph.<p>

 "The company had a dilemma: two 'premium' brands competing with each
other," he says. "Rover was more appropriate for the way BL was going
then, although Triumph was always more sporty. We helped to steer BL
towards Rover, and I'm afraid that left Triumph to wither on the
bough."<p>

 Interbrand is adept at naming things, especially cars. It came up
with Vitara for Suzuki, Primera for Nissan, and Discovery for Land
Rover. Now Blackett thinks the time could be right for a Triumph
revival. "It's a great name," he says. "It's very hard to establish
new names in the market, so why not use this one again? Car brands
like this tend to linger in people's minds; cars are emotive objects
because they touch everyone's lives."<p>

 Sportiness, good performance, a saloon car character, aimed at the
slightly above-average motorist: these are what Blackett cites as
Triumph "brand values". But he says it shouldn't clash with MG, which
is more widely perceived as an out-and-out sports car marque.<p>

 When pressed, Blackett picks the BMW 5-series as the sort of car a
modern Triumph might be: "A sporty saloon that's not too small." So
renaming the Escort-size Rovers as Triumphs is not on, then? "I have
to say I can't really see how that would work," he says.<p>

 However, Graham Robson, motoring historian and president of the
8,000-member TR Register, would like to see a return to the days of
Triumph two-seaters. "I fervently hope the badge won't be used
cynically," he says.<p>

 "We can all hope new Triumphs will have the character of 1970s
Triumphs: sporting, well styled, well equipped and technologically
advanced. We can also hope there will be one outright sports car."<p>

 Rover's contemplation of a Triumph revival is a "modern miracle", he
says. "Today's young planners were still at school when the last
modern Triumphs were designed and built." He also advances the theory
that Triumph's premature death was the result of political in-fighting
at BL in the 1970s, rather than commercial logic.<p>

 One advantage of the Triumph name is that it is roughly the same in
most languages - triomphe, for example, in French - and already has a
proven record as the comeback kid. Starting from virtually nothing in
1991, Triumph Motorcycles now has an annual turnover of 100
million. As Bruno Tagliferri, Triumph's sales and marketing manager
says of the company name: "I don't believe we would have had the
reaction we've had without it." A similar response to the return of
Triumph cars would be a dream scenario for Rover.<p>

 Owners of old cars, of course, don't necessarily buy new ones. Harry
Webster declares himself "flabbergasted" when he sees the cars he
designed being given the "classic" treatment.<p>

 Nevertheless, he must secretly be proud of the fact that he helped to
create a motoring legend. There are at least 14 Triumph owners' clubs
in Britain, and plenty more overseas. Webster must have realised he'd
achieved immortality when the world's biggest club, the 18,000-strong
Triumph Sports Six Club, which caters for fans of the Herald-based
cars (Herald, Vitesse, Spitfire, GT6, Bond Equipe and specials),
invited him to open its new HQ at Lubenham, Leics. He noticed one of
its walkways was named "Webster Way".<p>

 With the Triumph name still held in such esteem, a rebirth could be
more a question of when rather than if.<p>

<hr size=10><center>
<h1>1958 Triumph TR2, $2800 <br>(South Bend, IN)</h1>
</center><hr size=10>


<h3>Description:</h3>
<ul>
Exterior: Powder Blue<br>
Interior: Black<br>
Mileage: 75000K<p>
The car is in the early stages of restoration.  The frame and suspension has been stripped and painted.  The body tub has been dipped at Redi Strip in Indianapolis, and currently has epoxy primer on it.  I have purchased new inner and outer sils, floors and end peices which are included.  The rest of the tub is solid.  All outer sheet metal is in good condition but needs refinishing, no rust through.  The interior needs re-doing.  The steering box was missing when I bought it.  Engine and components are well preserved.  The car was driven until 1972 and has been stored since.  Has never been restored before.  The reason I'm selling it?  I've got a 1958 Austin Healey that also needs restoring and just don't have time for both right now.

<h3>Description:</h3>
<ul>
Exterior: Any<br>
Interior: Any<br>
Mileage: ???K<p>
I'm looking for a complete, corrosion-free TR4. I'd prefer a 4A with SU's, 
overdrive, wires, and non-IRS, but if it's not rusty, any '61-67 TR4
might work.

The car is in good shape.  It began as a project to restore but
time and money was not on my side.  The body is off the chasis but
all the parts are there.  It has not been driven or ran in a long
time.  The differential needs replacing and driver side floor pan
needs replaced and put the car together and it should be fine.

<h3>Description:</h3>
<ul>
Exterior: N/A<br>

Mileage: 10K<p>
This is the fuel injection assy. off of my TR6 racecar (former factory car #8 as seen in the Kastner comp. prep manual)
It was removed in the mid seventies and has been stored in boxes ever since.  It includes manifold w/injectors & feed tubes
Mechanical (racing) and vacuum metering units,fuel pumps,(dual racing) & stock, stock fuel filter, PRV, some stock hoses
and fittings, distributor,drive pedistal and related parts.  No air cleaner or air cleaner parts as this came off a race 
car and had velocity stacks.  Most of the parts were purchased directly from Kas Kastner when the Kastner effort was reduced to 
a single car. The various components are of 1969 or 1970 vintage but will work on any TR6 with the correct cyl. head. (i.e.TR6 P.I. or 
72 and later cyl.heads.  I will accept reasonable offers.

Brand new (never installed) side curtains, & new Robbins top. Collection of misc. spares: extra dash with some extra guages, rollbar (never installed) Extra generator (works) starter (core). 
Hate to sell car, but I just don't have the time/inclination/space anymore. (Sigh)

The GT6 mk II I am selling began restoration 15 years ago, I aquired 
it along with my mk III and I just don't have space to store it all.
The parts listed below have negligible rust and have been stored well.
The restoration went as far as the frame complete and body work. The
parts I'm selling are: Hood, Grill, Valence below grill, Body (right 
rear fender still needs some work), Chrome trim, Doors, Frame, All 
Glass, Lights with rubber, and Bumpers.

I'm the club liaison for the Capital Triumph Register (VTR chapter).   I own a near-pristine 1976 TR6.   I'd like to add a near-pristine or trailer-queen GT6 Mk. III  (late 1970 - late 1973).  Any color/combo O.K. with overdrive.   I want an original GT6, not a ground-up restoration.   Let's talk; only TR motorheads need call (evenings after 7:30 PM EST) or e-mail me.  Thanks.

Mileage: 80K<p>
I'm in a situation where I have to sell three TR-4's before the end of
December. The cars can all be catagorized as basket cases. Two have titles
and one has a running drivetrain. All need total restoration. I have a
multitude of parts collected over the last ten years. My choice is to
sell the whole lot for $1000.00--but because of the time constraint,I
may have to strip the best parts off--and send the shells to the bone-
yard. If anyone has a interest, please call me. These cars will be gone
by January 1st-one way or the other..

Thanks, Mike McLaughlin

This is a very solid car. Body was taken off frame two years ago for sandblasting and POR. All rust was cut from body and new panels from Roadster Factort welded (floors, trunk floor, rockers, etc.). Suspension has been totally rebuilt. New hydraulic cylinders for brakes and clutch. New interios and top from Moss. Will take a solid TR4 with good body, indifferent mechanicals in partial trade.

<h3>Description:</h3>
<ul>
Exterior: Damson/Maroon<br>
Interior: Black<br>
Mileage: 130K<p>
The car was purchased by me in 1988 after being wrecked.
I spent two and a half years completing a ground up restoration
to its original condition.  restoration included; a rebuilt engine,
suspension,  transmission linkage, new differential, all bodywork,
anything rubber or felt.   It was used as a daily driver for the next
four years.  It now has typical salt spray body rust, sills,
wheelarches, floor pan.  I also have a second engine, transmission,
set of doors, an countless other parts from another fully
dissassembled parts car.  I have full pictures to document the
restoration, which I can send to you.

<h3>Description:</h3>
<ul>
Exterior: Inca Yellow<br>
Interior: Black<br>
Mileage: 64K<p>
This is a beautiful fully optioned (A/C, OD, Hardtop) car.  Commission 
number is CF 57199UO.  Paint is new PPG basecoat/clearcoat in original 
color.  New Michelin Redlines
Interior, engine bay, and undercarriage are highly detailed.  Front
and rear suspension have been completely dismantled, restored, and 
reassembled with new bushings, springs, and ball joints/tie rod ends.
This car had absolutely no body rust prior to repainting...just 20
year old paint that needed refreshing.  If you're looking for a good
driver that can show (and win) against the best...this car is for you!

NOTE:  Will take Herald or Vitesse Driver as partial trade!

<h3>Description:</h3>
<ul>
Exterior: No Body<br>
Interior: Restored Chasis<br>
Mileage: 75K<p>
This Chasis is in mint restored condition.  I have over $5,000 in new parts
Everything is included except the body and the bumpers.  If anyone is 
taking on a TR6 restoration, this is the way to go.  I have two years of 
labour in this car and I am forced to sell.  I am trying to raise money
to go back to school.

If you are serious give me a call I would love to discuss how we might 
work out a deal.  

I certainly will be sad to see this go.

<P>
<A NAME="Query Basics"></A><H2>Query Basics</H2>
A query is simply a description of an information need. Unlike Boolean
systems that search for just those documents containing <I>all</I> the
words in your query, Excite for Web Servers will search for documents that are a
best match for the words in your query. Excite for Web Servers will also search for
documents that are about the same concepts that your query describes,
so sometimes Excite for Web Servers will bring back articles that don't mention
<I>any</I> of the words in your original query.
<P>
What this means is that your query -- the description of your
information need -- can be as detailed as you like. Don't worry about
providing too many words; the more words, the better. Additional words
in your query will help Excite for Web Servers figure out what concepts you're
really interested in. On the other hand, Excite for Web Servers will do a pretty
good job of figuring out what documents are interesting to you even if
your query is vague.
<P>
For example, let's say you're searching a web site for documents about
customer support for the Widget2000 product you're using. A good
starting point would be
<P>
<PRE>
        customer support for the Widget2000
</PRE>

If you have a question about a particular feature of the Widget2000,
for example the Blurfl upgrade package, you might choose a query like
<P>
<PRE>
        customer support for the Blurfl upgrade package
        of the Widget2000
</PRE>

Even if there are no documents that are actually about the Blurfl
upgrade, Excite for Web Servers will still show you documents about Widget2000
customer support.
<P>
<A NAME="Advanced Query Tips"></A><H2>Advanced Query Tips</H2>
Here are some suggestions for getting the best results out of
Excite for Web Servers.
<P>
<DL>
<DT><B>Only use words that are relevant to your query</B><DD>
If you're looking for documents about the Widget2000, don't enter a
query like "<CODE>Find me all documents about the Widget2000</CODE>". Excite for Web Servers
considers <I>all</I> the words in your query to be part of your
information need, so queries like the previous example will find all
documents about <I>finding all documents about</I> the Widget2000, which
may not be exactly what you want.
<P>
<DT><B>Specify multiple forms of the same phrases</B><DD>
Excite for Web Servers distinguishes between hyphenated and un-hyphenated words. So,
sometimes it might be necessary to explicitly say that you want both
versions, for example "<CODE>CDROM CD-ROM</CODE>". Excite for Web Servers will try to figure
out that <CODE>CDROM</CODE> and <CODE>CD-ROM</CODE> are the same, but it never hurts to
explicitly specify multiple forms.
<P>
<DT><B>Common words are ignored</B><DD>
Excite for Web Servers doesn't index common words like <I>a</I>, <I>and</I>, or <I>the</I>.
Consequently, those words in your query will be ignored. Excite for Web Servers also
ignores numbers; however, it can find strings that happen to contain a
number, for example <I>3Com</I>.

<STRONG>Guilt-Free Desserts</STRONG><br>
Air Date - 2.12.97  & 2.14.97<P>

Dessert has always been the phase of any meal we feel the most guilty
about.  If you are like me, this guilt is coupled by a strong desire for
something sweet.  This week I am going to introduce everyone to some
wonderful, low-fat desserts.  I thought easy to make desserts would be
ideal to present with Valentine's Day right around the corner.
<P>
Both of the recipes this week come out of a cookbook I picked up
recently called Streamlined Cooking for a Healthy Lifestyle by Cole's
Kitchen Arts Series.  It has great pictures of how many of the recipes
look when complete and each recipe has a nutritional analysis done at
the end.  The nutritional analysis for the book was done by MasterCook2,
by Arion Software Inc.

<LI>6 large bananas in the peel

<LI>1/2 cup apple juice
<LI>1/2 cup white rum
<LI>1/4 cup date sugar (ground, dried dates)

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.  Place unpeeled bananas on a baking
sheet. Prick the skin of each banana several times with the prongs of a
fork.  Cook bananas until they turn black, (about 10 minutes).  In a
large skillet, combine remaining ingredients and cook over medium-high
heat for 8 minutes, (to burn off the alcohol).  Carefully remove peel
from one side of each banana and place banana, open side down, in the
rum syrup.  Remove the remaining peel.  Cut each banana in half and
cook, turning once, until lightly golden, (about 2 minutes).

Air Date -- 2.14.97<P>
<STRONG>Children's Health Care Center:</STRONG>

Bensley Elementary School in Virginia has found a way to ensure the health needs of its students. The Health Department runs a health care center out of a trailer on the school grounds. The service is available to Bensley students and their siblings.
<P>
<STRONG>Services include:</STRONG>
<UL>
<li>physical examinations
<li>laboratory testing
<li>diagnosis
<li>treatment
<li>health education
<li>vision and hearing screenings
<li>immunizations
<li>delivery of medications whenever possible
</UL>
<STRONG>The Need:</STRONG>
Bensley is a small, very poor community south of Richmond, Virginia. The median family income is $7,024. Seventy-five percent of the children are eligible to receive the free or reduced fee school lunch. Over 300 families in the community don't have automobiles. In 1993, 125 children came to school without the proper immunizations and physicals.  
<P>
<STRONG>Community Effort:</STRONG>
The Children's Health Care Center is a community effort linking public and private donations. Area hospitals, businesses, and the Community Development Block Grant Office, have joined forces with the Health Department and the Virginia Health Care Foundation to make the center possible.
<P> 
<STRONG>Operations:</STRONG>
The Health Department runs the center during school hours with a full time public health nurse and volunteer doctors. In order to offer full service medical coverage, an area hospital offers their Pediatric staff physicians at night, on weekends and holidays for a reduced fee.
<P>
<STRONG>Success:</STRONG>
The project is considered a major success by the Health Department, the school and the community. Two years ago there were 125 children without the proper immunizations, last year, there were only five. Absenteeism is down as well.  In the past two years, the number of students who have been absent less than ten days increased from 59% to 71%...an increase of 12%. The community has affordable health care for the first time and parents and students are very appreciative.

<B>The Latest In Mobile Communications</B><BR>

<IMG ALIGN="LEFT" SRC="ce021397b.jpg" WIDTH="178" HEIGHT="133"  VSPACE="5" HSPACE="10" ALT=" PCS Phone"><BR>



      It is the latest breakthrough in mobile communications. And some say it
will make the cellular phone obsolete.
In today's computer tips we explore the new technology and find out that it's
more than meets the ear.
     <P>
      Cellular phone technology allows us to make calls pretty much wherever
we go. The latest discovery, which offers more features than ever before, is
PCS digital. 
<P>
	"It's one of the most exciting technologies to come in this century, I
believe", says Sprint's Don McGuire.
Mcguire's company is an early leader in what's being called PCS, or personal
communication service.
	
	"I push my envelope, it dials directly into my voice mail", McGuire points
out.
<P>
	Digital is the language of computers. while you talk, your voice is
converted into numbers. This coding makes it virtually impossible, unlike
cellular, for someone to listen in, or even worse, steal your phone number.
 
	"In most of the current ads for these PCS phones, we're seeing words such as
pure and clear. we put it to a quick test", Adam Klarer, Computer Tips
reporter.
<IMG ALIGN="RIGHT" SRC="ce021397.jpg" WIDTH="178" HEIGHT="133"  VSPACE="5" HSPACE="10" ALT=" PCS Phone"><BR>

	We find two people shopping and ask them to make some calls. turns out one
of them already owns a digital phone.

     "The only drawback is you lose the signal sometimes when you're talking
to somebody. other than that, it's great", says Sean Heinen. He owns a
digital phone.

      Ben Bullington is a first time-user, "It sounded good, real clear, no
real interference that I could tell".
<P>
	 San Diego based Qualcomm developed the digital technology for commercial
use. They also build the phones right here in town, in partnership with Sony.
Over one million phones have been shipped so far.
	 Cox Communications is also a major partner in the Sprint venture, providing
fiber optic access. This means fewer of those giant towers spoiling the view.
	And future phone technology will allow you to access your home computer from
wherever you happen to be, all with the touch of a few buttons.
<P>
	Currently not all of San Diego County is covered for these new phones.
Sprint plans to have countywide service available by the end of this summer.
Nationwide service is expected by the end of  1997.
<P>

<STRONG>"That Darn Cat"</STRONG><br>
<EM>Air Date -- 2.14.97</EM><P>

<IMG SRC="reelfull.GIF"> <IMG SRC="reelfull.GIF">
  <STRONG>-2 out of 4 reels-</STRONG> <P>

The year was 1965. A simpler time.  San Diego was not arguing over a Super Bowl.  There wasn't even a Super Bowl to argue over yet.  And you were six...and playing at the theater in your neighborhood...maybe in La Mesa..."That Darn Cat"...with the man who's in every Disney movie, Dean Jones.
<P>
Well, 32 years later "That Darn Cat" is back, complete with Dean Jones.  It begins on a quiet night, too quiet, when mysterious kidnappers grab a woman.  The FBI is quickly on the case, but the inept agents, led by comic Doug E. Doug are stumped.  The only witness to the crime is one-foot tall, loves seafood and gives up the occasional hairball.
<P>
<STRONG>Who could it be???</STRONG><P>
<IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC="cat.jpg" WIDTH="178" HEIGHT="133" ALT="Cat"><P>
Of course...it's that darned car.  And that sets up the adolescent hijinks.  Silly adults versus D.C...short for Darned Cat.  Again, our bumbling agent is at work looking for clues to the kidnapping mystery.
<P>
You may not laugh, but trust me, the scenes of adults acting like a cat, or getting their boxer shorts nipped by a nasty dog are as hoot for anyone under the age of seven.
<P>
Off goes our agent to pursue his case.  Kids think this movie is very funny.  So did you when you were nine.  But if you're an adult, there's not much in this movie that is new or particularly funny.
<P>
Which rates it a disappointment.  In most of it's other recent films, Disney has usually done a better job entertaining parents along with the kids.
<P>
Earlier I mentioned Dean Jones.  You didn't see him, but he's in this movie along with other big names...Dyan Cannon, Peter Boyle, Estelle Parsons, John Ratzenberger from Cheers, and Christina Ricci.
<br><IMG ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="cat2.jpg" WIDTH="178" HEIGHT="133" ALT="Cat with Co-Stars"><br>
Wish I could say they add up to something more fun. But I have to give "That Darned Cat" just two mediocre reels out of four.  Your kids under about the age of 10 will like it but this is not one of Disney's better efforts.
<P>
Put simply, "That Darn Cat" doesn't fit into that darn category.

<STRONG>TroubleShooter Column:  Nigerian Shuffle</STRONG><BR>
<STRONG><EM>2.14.97</EM></STRONG><P>

They're baaaaaack.  Our wiley cons from Nigeria are back in action.  Like they ever stopped. The newest version of the old Lagos Shuffle is now hitting mailboxes in the United States.  These letters are usually sent to businesses, addressed to "The President" or "Chief Executive."
<P>
The letter opens with, "Sir, Request for urgent business relationship...  Top Secret," it says.  Then the letter goes on to weave a tale of intrigue.  "We are top officials of the Federal Government Contract Review Panel," interested in importing goods into your country.  But their funds are trapped in Nigeria.  $21,320,000 trapped, and only you can free their money.  Please transfer, "Your Banker's name & Banker's address, Account number, fax; preferably...This transaction is 100% safe", the writer goes on to say.
<P>
And in exchange for this tremendous favor these Nigerian officials will share their money.  They promise 30%, just for letting them deposit their $21 million into your account.  Signed Ahaji M. Dauda.
<P>
How generous of  Mr. Dauda.  Of course, the scam is simple.  Once they have your bank account number they clean you out.  And there is nothing, absolutely nothing you can do about it.
<P>
Another letter comes from a Dr. Kalu A. Kalu, an accountant in the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, in Lagos.
<P>
Same basic pitch, only he has $36.5 million to deposit into your account, offering 25% of the transaction sum.
<P>
Our viewers forward these letters to us, asking, "Why me?  How did these guys get my name?"  Good question.  It could be they were, "recommended by an associate", who says you're reliable, and can keep a secret, as the letter says.
<P>
U.S. Postal inspectors have a more plausible explanation, however.  The brains behind these scams build data bases using computers here in the United States.  Students are hired to pull information off university computers.  Workers are paid to retrieve commercial data bases, which are fed back to Nigeria.
<P>
The Postal Service and other federal agencies now have a special task force in place to investigate this con.  But, they admit there is little they can do. if you fall for this scam. 
Just warn prospective victims to beware the Nigerian Shuffle.
<P>
If you receive one of these letters we recommend you send it on to the Postal Inspector in your area.

<P>

With this column the 10News Troubleshooter launches into cyberspace, taking our consumer advocacy service "where it has never gone before."
For the past eight years TroubleShooter has provided a write-in service for
consumers in trouble, solving problems and broadcasting a daily consumer segment that is both
entertaining and educational.
We go to bat for consumers who think they've been wronged by business.
We often mediate disputes.
We investigate unscrupulous schemes:  pyramids, telephone boilerrooms, mailers and that claim "you've won a prize."<P>
We follow the twisted trails of cons hoping to hide from us and authorities:
Charity scams, bogus churches, investment fraud, and too-good-to-be-true
vacation deals--Scams that often ignore state and national boundaries.
Over the years we've built an impressive network of consumers and journalists
across the country, who collaborate in our investigations.
And now by tapping into the World Wide Web, this collaboration can be even more
effective in putting scammers out of business.
Each week this TroubleShooter column will feature the hottest new scam or
timely consumer issues important to you, your family, or your business.<P>

For example, we're now investigating the common law court movement.
These people say our court system has failed, and have set up their own court.
Our one supreme court, it's called.
Some are even creating their monetary system, passing millions of dollars in warrants they claim are issued against liens they've filed against state and federal governments.
This is the scheme for which the Montana Freemen were recently arrested. 
If you have any information on these warrants or this movement we would like to
hear from you.<P>

So, save the TroubleShooter address on your E-mail rolodex in case you have a
consumer problem, or run across a new scam you'd like us to investigate.

<FONT color="#000080"><STRONG>TroubleShooter Column:  Freemen</STRONG><BR></FONT>
<FONT size=2>
<STRONG><EM>4/12/96</EM></STRONG><P>They call themselves Freemen, free of government and court
constraints and free to create their own "system."
Free perhaps, as well, to rip off
unwary followers.
That's our concern.<P>
You may have seen headlines these past
few weeks about the standoff in
Montana between FBI agents and
devotees of the Freemen movement.
The pictures and updates give the
nation a peek at this group of
government resisters.
But only a peek, a scratch at the surface.
Let me tell you a little more about
this grassroots organization and it's
offshoots, offshoots and disciples running their
own lucrative scams.<P>
The TroubleShooter has been
investigating the Freemen and
broadcasting stories about them since
February.
The Freemen claim the federal
government is illegal.
The court system they say has no
jurisdiction over citizens.
So, they are creating their own courts
and their own funny money.<P>
Leroy Schweitzer, the best known of the
Montana Freemen says he sued the
federal government for $70 trillion
dollars.
When the justice department did not
respond to his suit, Schweitzer filed a
lien, and began issuing comptroller's
warrants.
He began selling packets of blank warrants to
his followers saying, "they're as good
as U.S. currency...buy anything with
them."
This scheme has put Leroy Schweitzer
behind bars, accused of fraud, a seductive scheme with copycats.<P>
Among them, M. Elizabeth Broderick, in
Los Angeles.
She sued the state of California for
$180 million, and has been selling
warrants at seminars throughout
Southern California.
So far, federal investigators say she's
sold warrants with a face value of $30
million.
At last report, Broderick is wanted by
the FBI, and has gone undercover.
But, this scheme is still on a roll in
at least thirty states, we're told.
Helping to justify this phony money,
trade is a common law court system.<P>
Another offshoot of the Freemen
movement is called "Our One Supreme Court,"
hearing mostly property title issues.
They publish public notices in small
community newspapers, announcing liens
by authority of "organic law," or
scripture, liens that could generate even more
worthless warrants.
We're now hearing from victims across
the country.
People who bought warrants, only to
find they are stuck with worthless
paper.<P>
If you know about this movement or you
are a victim, we'd like to hear from
