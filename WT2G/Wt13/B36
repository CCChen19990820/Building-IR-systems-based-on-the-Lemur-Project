<P><B>Objective:</B> Develop novel microorganisms that can rapidly and
efficiently coferment the hexose and pentose sugars in lignocellulosic
hydrolysates to ethanol.</P>
<P><B>Approach/Background:</B> Sensitivity analysis of the base case
biomass-to-ethanol process indicates substantial savings in capital and
operating costs associated with advanced process designs in which hexose and
pentose sugars are simultaneously cofermented to ethanol. There are
microorganisms that can efficiently ferment the glucose component in cellulose
to ethanol; however, because there is no suitable biocatalyst, converting the
pentose sugars such as xylose and arabinose in the hemicellulose fraction is
more difficult.</P>
<P>Simultaneously cofermenting these sugars is further hindered by the
repressive effect of the glucose liberated during enzymatic hydrolysis of
cellulose. A comprehensive survey identified the bacteria<I> Zymomonas mobilis</I>
and <I>Lactobacillus</I> as promising microorganisms for further development as
cofermentation biocatalysts.</P>
<P><B>Status/Accomplishments:</B> A new strain of <I>Z. mobilis</I> has been
metabolically engineered to simultaneously coferment the glucose and xylose&#151;prominent
in many lignocellulosic feedstocks&#151;to ethanol. Engineered strains that
demonstrate the best cofermentation performance in sawdust hydrolysate were
identified for scaleup to the PDU. The substrate utilization range of this new
biocatalyst has been further expanded for fermenting the arabinose commonly
found in agricultural residues such as corn fiber and in herbaceous energy crops
such as switchgrass. In a first step to develop a thermotolerant ethanologenic
cofermentation biocatalyst, a strain of <I>Lactobacillus</I> with superior
resistance to dilute-acid hydrolysates at elevated temperatures and the ability
to ferment many other sugars commonly found in lignocellulosic feedstocks,
including glucose, cellobiose, mannose, and arabinose, has been metabolically
engineered to produce lactate from xylose at near-theoretical yield.</P>

<P><B>Objective:</B> Perform a screening study to investigate the technical
and economic feasibility of processing hardwood sawmill waste into ethanol at a
large-scale biomass-to-ethanol facility in the tri-state area of Kentucky, West
Virginia, and Ohio.</P>
<P><B>Approach/Background:</B> DOE and NREL are interested in applying
biomass-to ethanol (BTE) conversion technology to convert lignocellulosic wastes&#151;currently
a burden to local and regional hardwood sawmills and businesses&#151; into
transportation fuels, thereby strengthening the economy in multiple ways. A
subcontract was commissioned for a screening study to identify and evaluate a
site or sites in the Kentucky, West Virginia, and Ohio area that would support
the long-term operation of a financially attractive sawmill waste BTE facility.</P>
<P><B>Status/Accomplishments:</B> The subcontract is complete. Belcan
Engineering screened and ultimately selected two sites from the target region
for the BTE facility, one a &quot;greenfield&quot; or grassroots facility and
the other an &quot;add on&quot; or expansion to an existing corn ethanol
facility. Belcan then estimated the construction and operation costs, developed
business pro formas to evaluate economic viability or solicit business
investors, and outlined a schedule for construction, additional testing, and
startup for each site. This work was compiled and forwarded to NREL in the
subcontract final report issued in September 1995.</P>

<P><B>Objective: </B>Analyze complex samples and develop and validate methods
in response to new analytical needs to support ethanol project activities.</P>
<P><B>Approach/Background:</B> Ethanol project researchers require reliable
analytical data to evaluate feedstocks, process intermediates, and end products
from biomass conversion and assess the effectiveness of each stage of the
process. By analyzing complex samples to develop standard analytical methods and
produce precise and accurate data, we provide a certified analytical service to
meet project research goals. High-quality analytical data are acquired via
analytical measurements and protocols that meet the QC principles established in
the quality assurance plan. Submitted samples are analyzed by a highly trained
team that uses Laboratory Analytical Procedures (LAPs) and methods developed and
validated specifically in response to a new analytical need. This information is
used to meet the technical objectives of the research groups within the project.</P>
<P><B>Status/Accomplishments:</B> During FY 1994, we processed 134 chemical
analysis work orders, which represented more than 1600 samples from project
researchers, subcontractors, and CRADA partners. To date in FY 1995, more than
100 work orders and almost 1400 samples have been processed. The work requests
involved a wide range of analyses that used LAPs and newly developed and
validated methods. Because of stringent QA/QC criteria, the analytical results
are considered to be of the highest quality.</P>
<P>Changing project needs and new problems often require that we develop
innovative analytical approaches, procure new instruments (and concurrently
develop instrumental procedures), and enhance procedures. Such efforts have
enabled us to validate a series of new or enhanced methods for analyzing
samples. We developed methods that use high-performance anion exchange
chromatography with pulsed amperometric detection to analyze carbohydrates,
sugar reversion products, and degradation products. An instrumental technique
was developed to determine carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen in biomass samples,
which can be directly applied to the determination of the protein content of
feedstock and process samples. An advanced method for analyzing ethanol in
fermentation samples with complex matrices has been developed using a gas
chromatograph equipped with a head-space analyzer. A laser diffraction
instrumental technique was developed to determine the particle sizes of various
biomass samples.</P>
<P>We have also tried to enhance the scope of standard methods and verify
methods for use with new biomass samples. For any protocol that has potential
for becoming a routine analytical test, the final step is to document the
procedure in LAP format. Six new procedures and six enhanced or expanded
procedures were validated, documented, and distributed as additions to the CAT
Task LAP Manual. Five standardized analytical methods have been incorporated as
standard test methods by the American Society for Testing and Materials.</P>

<P><B>Objective:</B> Develop, implement, and monitor a project-wide QA/ QC
program that will result in the highest possible level of work quality,
reproducibility, and utility. </P>
<P><B>Approach/Background:</B> The goal of a strong research program to
produce high-quality data via well- designed experimental protocols and
analytical measurements is usually reached when the experimental work is
conducted within the confines of good QC practices. The ethanol project quality
assurance program was developed and implemented with this goal in mind. The
program is based on a detailed quality assurance plan (QAP) designed to be the
foundation for the quality assurance program.</P>
<P><B>Status/Accomplishments:</B> A major step in developing the quality
assurance program was designing and writing the QAP, which guides research and
analytical activities by describing policies, goals, areas of responsibility,
specific QC activities, standard analytical procedures, a system of quality
experimental planning, and the means to document these activities. The concepts,
protocols, and tools contained in the QAP are purposely flexible so they can be
tailored to meet the needs of each experimental group. </P>
<P>A multistep implementation strategy for the quality assurance program was
initiated to assimilate the plan into daily activities of the project, both
in-house and subcontract. Established analytical procedures have been updated to
include rigorous QC criteria, and, as new methods have been developed, they have
undergone a stringent validation and documentation process. New conformance
evaluation and method verification standards have been identified and validated
as tools for assessing the quality of generated analytical results. Current
efforts are being directed toward helping individual research groups with issues
or problems they may have encountered when implementing their procedures.</P>

<P><B>Objective:</B> Use an outside analytical testing laboratory to provide
precise and accurate compositional analysis of routine lignocellulosic samples
of interest to the ethanol project. This analytical information will supplement
the more complex and nonroutine analyses conducted by the Chemical Analysis and
Testing (CAT) Task. The data will be used by ethanol project research groups to
meet specific technical objectives defined in the annual operating plan.</P>
<P><B>Approach/Background:</B> Routine feedstock, pretreated biomass, and the
solid fraction of fermentation residues are to be analyzed for total solids,
acid-insoluble and acid-soluble lignin, cellulose (as glucose), hemicellulosic
sugars, starch, and ash. Pretreatment liquors and the liquid fraction of
fermentation samples are to be analyzed for total and total dissolved solids,
cellobiose, monomeric and total sugars, organic acids, glycerol, hydroxyl-methyl
furfural, and furfural. During the course of these analyses, established CAT
Task Laboratory Analytical Procedures and the QC protocols described in the
ethanol project quality assurance program must be followed. The results of each
group of analyses are reported to the CAT Task for evaluation and data
reduction.</P>
<P><B>Status/Accomplishments:</B> Two hundred eleven samples were analyzed
during the first year. Assay reproducibility and analysis turnaround time
consistently met or exceeded expectations. The overall sample load for the
second year is expected to be significantly higher, but improvements made to
methods and reporting requirements have streamlined the process and reduced the
overall analysis cost per sample.</P>

<P><B>Objectives:</B> Purify, characterize, and compare cellulases from a
variety of organisms to determine which have the highest specific activity, the
best match to anticipated process hydrolysis and fermentation conditions, and
the ability to act synergistically to enhance the rate of cellulose hydrolysis .
Develop cost-effective, highly productive, industrially acceptable, genetically
engineered organisms for the production of well balanced, multi-enzyme cellulase
systems to efficiently and completely hydrolyze cellulose. </P>
<P><B>Approach/Background:</B> Identifying extremely active cellulase enzymes
to depolymerize cellulose is an important first step in developing an economical
enzyme production process. Cloning selected cellulase genes from microorganisms
that produce high specific-activity cellulases at very high levels in
appropriate hosts will permit production of the most effective cellulase
systems. The ability to select and overproduce these cellulases will
significantly lower the cost of producing cellulases, significantly increase the
rate of lignocellulosic biomass hydrolysis, or both, thereby reducing the cost
of producing ethanol. </P>
<P><B>Status/Accomplishments:</B> Purified enzymes supplied by subcontractors
associated with this activity, and our own work, have permitted extensive
comparative biochemical studies to be carried out, resulting in the ability to
rationalize which genetic constructions should be built. Several endoand
exoglucanase, and b-glucosidase genes cloned at NREL and elsewhere function in
heterologous host bacteria, such as<I> Escherichia coli, Streptomyces lividans,</I>
and <I>Bacillus subtilis</I>. The gene for the highly active, thermotolerant
<I>Acidothermus cellulolyticus</I> E1 endoglucanase has been completely
sequenced, permitting the construction of several expression vectors for this
endoglucanase in <I>E. coli</I> , <I>S. lividans,</I> and <I>Pichia pastoris</I>.
The <I>P. pastoris</I> system can produce more than 1 gram of the E1
endoglucanase per liter of culture. </P>

<P><B>Objectives: </B> Assess the relative efficacy of commercially available
cellulase preparations on programmatic feedstock materials, including pretreated
hardwood sawdusts and agricultural residues. Establish relationships with
cellulase manufacturers and make them aware of the need for developing
inexpensive and effective sources of cellulase for converting biomass to
ethanol. Furnish guidance to cellulase manufacturers willing to devote resources
to developing effective and cost-efficient cellulase preparations customized for
use in biomass conversion processes. 
</P>
<P><B>Approach/Background:</B> The technology for producing an effective and
economical cellulase for use in first-generation biomass conversion technology
will approximate that used by commercial enzyme manufacturers. The filamentous
fungus, <I>Trichoderma reesei</I>, is the production organism for most
cellulase manufacturers, although cellulases from other fungi are also
available. The many cellulase preparations available commercially differ in
terms of the organism, the fermentation conditions, and the downstream
processing steps used to concentrate, stabilize, and package the preparation.
Whether any of these variables significantly affect the quality of these
preparations for use in biomass conversion processes is not known. However, the
cellulose component of feedstock materials derived from different sources is not
equally digestible after equivalent pretreatments. </P>
<P><B>Status/Accomplishments:</B> An apparatus has been designed and tested
with cellulosic substrates that permits nearly complete saccharification while
eliminating reaction products from the reactor to minimize the effects of
product feedback inhibition, thus maximizing reaction kinetics. This apparatus
has been used with various combinations of purified endoand exoglucanases and
shows clear differences in the relative performance of different enzyme
cocktails. </P>
<P>High-level contacts have been made with each major cellulase manufacturer in
North America. The need for large quantities of effective and inexpensive
cellulase preparations in the near term has been made clear to each of them. We
are continuing to develop these relationships. </P>

Design and construct recombinant microbial overexpression systems for selected

also one of the few known bacterial systems that expresses active, highly
synergistic exo-b-1,4-glucanases. Proteins are purified by classical

<P><B>Approach/Background:</B> <I>C. thermocellum</I> produces a cellulase
system that consists of more than a dozen polypeptides, which function together
as a tightly associated particulate system (cellulosome) at the bacterial cell
surface. This strategy for cellulose degradation is common to many anaerobic
cellulolytic organisms and provides an important alternative to the freely
soluble cellulases being investigated by other subcontractors. </P>
<P><B>Status/Accomplishments:</B> A genomic library of <I>C. thermocellum</I>
DNA has been constructed in<I> Escherichia coli.</I> Genes for the anchorage
and scaffolding protein, CelL, and a key catalytic subunit, CelS, have been
cloned and sequenced. Recombinant CelS has been characterized, and represents a
novel class of exoglucanase. An important endoglucanase gene, <I>celD</I>, has
been cloned and expressed in a recombinant system to purify large quantities of
the CelD protein for biochemical characterization at NREL. An expression system
has also been developed for the <I>celS</I> gene. </P>

<P><B>Objective:</B> Evaluate the transport of pentose sugars in wild-type and
xylose-fermenting strains of<I> Zymomonas mobilis</I>.</P>
<P><B>Approach/Background:</B> Sensitivity analysis of the base-case
biomass-to-ethanol process indicates substantial savings in capital and
operating cost associated with advanced process designs in which the hexose and
pentose sugars in lignocellulosic feedstocks are simultaneously cofermented to
ethanol. Recently, NREL scientists metabolically engineered a new strain of the
bacterium <I>Z. mobilis</I> that can simultaneously coferment the glucose and
xylose&#151;prominent in many lignocellulosic feedstocks&#151;to ethanol.
Information on pentose sugar transport in this strain is essential to further
develop superior biocatalysts and processes to simultaneously coferment these
sugars to ethanol.</P>
<P><B>Status/Accomplishments:</B> Research is being conducted to determine the
kinetics of xylose and arabinose transport in wild-type and metabolically
engineered strains of <I>Z. mobilis</I> in the presence and absence of glucose,
and to evaluate the substrate specificity of individual <I>Z. mobilis</I>
transport systems. This research will identify the primary systems responsible
for pentose sugar transport and determine the conditions under which these
transporters are most active. Research may also suggest strategies by which
pentose transport systems can be altered to maximize the rate of pentose
transport. Research conducted during the first year will provide the foundation
for attempts to improve the efficiency of pentose transport in recombinant <I>Z.
mobilis</I>, which will be the focus of the second year of research.</P>

<P><B>Objective: </B>To develop an improved ethanologenic yeast that can
efficiently ferment xylose when genetic engineering techniques are applied.</P>
<P><B>Approach/Background:</B> Efficiently converting the xylose in the
hemicellulose fraction to ethanol remains one of the economic bottlenecks in the
current conversion scheme. <I>Candida shehatae</I> and<I> Pichia stipitis</I>
can ferment xylose, but at rates and yields less than required for commercial
production. This work is directed toward increasing the ethanol yield and
productivity of these yeasts by overexpressing and deleting selected genes,
evaluating their xylose fermentation performance, and implementing strategies
that maximize anaerobic fermentation yield.</P>
<P><B>Status/Accomplishments:</B> Using a genetic transformation system based
on complementing a uracil- requiring mutant, the <I>P. stipitis</I> xylose
reductase (XYL1) gene, the<I> Zymomonas mobilis</I> alcohol dehydrogenase
(ADH2) gene<I>,</I> and the <I>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</I> pyruvate
decarboxylase (PDC1) and alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH1) genes have been introduced
into <I>P. stipitis</I>.<I> P. stipitis</I> strains that carry XYL1, PDC, or
PDC and ADH genes demonstrated as much as a 22% increase in ethanol volumetric
productivity and a 32% increase in ethanol yield compared to the control strain.
Furthermore, genes have been successfully replaced in the <I>P. stipitis</I>
genome for the first time. This advance establishes the techniques necessary for
targeted inactivation of the PDH E1a (pyruvate dehydrogenase E1a subunit) and
CYC1 (cytochrome c) genes that are believed to adversely affect the ethanol
yield and anaerobic growth. Subsequent research will be directed toward
simultaneously expressing and inactivating selected genes to improve ethanol
productivity and maximize anaerobic fermentation yield.</P>

<P><B>Objective: </B>Demonstrate an integrated direct microbial conversion
(DMC) process on a relevant feedstock using a mixed culture of <I>Clostridium
thermosaccharolyticum</I> and <I>Clostridium thermocellum</I>.</P>
<P><B>Approach/Background:</B> The DMC process is considered a promising
advanced technology for biomass conversion because it consolidates all
bioprocessing steps into a single unit operation, with significant savings in
capital and operating costs; and it uses high temperatures, thus reducing
cooling requirements, product recovery costs, and the risk of contamination. The
DMC process utilizes a mixed culture of two thermophilic bacteria, <I>C.
thermocellum</I> and <I>C. thermosaccharolyticum</I>, to convert cellulosic
biomass to ethanol. The DMC process is not yet economically attractive, however,
because these bacteria conduct mixed-acid fermentations and exhibit low ethanol
selectivity. Also, biomass sugar conversion has yet to be demonstrated at
practical substrate concentrations using cost-effective nutrients and actual
pretreatment hydrolyzates.</P>
<P><B>Status/Accomplishments:</B> Research is being conducted to develop a
process medium based on the use of commercial components (e.g., corn steep
liquor, molasses, yeast extract) that supports xylose fermentation by <I>C.
thermosaccharolyticum</I> at moderate to high xylose feed concentrations and
demonstrates a reproducible continuous DMC process for wastepaper sludge
supplemented with D-xylose using a mixed culture of <I>C. thermocellum</I> and
<I>C. thermosaccharolyticum</I>. A steady-state continuous culture that
completely utilizes a 50 g/L xylose feed has been reproducibly demonstrated with
<I>C. thermosaccharolyticum</I>. Previous efforts to completely utilize 50 g/L
xylose were unsuccessful, so this represents a significant achievement. Complete
utilization of a 75 g/L xylose feed is now being pursued. Research on the second
objective is being directed at developing a feed delivery system that will
enable concentrated wastepaper feedstock slurry to be delivered to a continuous
reactor.</P>

<P><B>Objective:</B> Develop efficient, cost-effective pretreatment techniques
for preparing enzymatically digestible lignocellulosic biomass and fermentable
soluble sugar prehydrolyzates.</P>
<P><B>Approach/Background:</B> Cellulose in lignocellulosic biomass is not
readily digestible by cellulase enzymes; a pretreatment step is necessary to
render it digestible. Dilute acid pretreatment techniques also solubilize the
hemicellulose fraction of biomass to (primarily) pentose sugars, which are then
available for subsequent fermentation to ethanol. Preliminary results of a
two-stage, dilute-acid pretreatment scheme that use a percolation process show
that, in addition to generating more highly digestible pretreated solids
residues, yields of xylose equivalents are significantly increased. Further
information about the fermentability of the hemicellulose-based sugars in
prehydrolyzates, which may require toxic compounds to be removed from the
breakdown of other biomass components before fermentation, is needed. A firm
understanding of key reaction parameters and mass-transfer effects is necessary
to begin considering reactor design options for large-scale processes.</P>
<P><B>Status/Accomplishments:</B> Larger bench-scale percolation reactor
systems were brought on-line to generate larger quantities of pretreated
biomass.</P>
<P>The two-stage, dilute-acid percolation pretreatment work was expanded to
additional feedstocks, including hardwood sawdust. A factorial-design
experimental approach was used to collect data to develop improved reaction
conditions for maximizing the enzymatic digestibility of pretreated sawdust.
</P>
<P>Kinetic modeling studies identified the countercurrent contacting of solids
and liquor as the most efficient mode for optimizing dilute-acid, flow-through
pretreatment systems. Process engineering evaluations indicated which key
operating parameters of the flow-through pretreatment system need to be modified
to maximize the beneficial effects of this type of pretreatment in the context
of the overall biomass-to-ethanol process.</P>
<P>Initial contacts were made with prospective equipment vendors who can
provide large-scale countercurrent pretreatment reactors, and preliminary
equipment budget information has been obtained.</P>

the use of xylose-fermenting strains of<I> Zymomonas mobilis</I> to rapidly and
efficiently coferment the glucose and xylose in lignocellulosic feedstocks to
ethanol.</P>
<P><B>Approach/Background:</B> Sensitivity analysis of the base-case
biomass-to-ethanol process indicates substantial savings in capital and
operating costs associated with advanced process designs in which the hexose and
pentose sugars in lignocellulosic feedstocks are simultaneously cofermented to
ethanol. Several microorganisms can efficiently ferment the glucose component in
cellulose to ethanol, but converting pentose sugars, such as xylose, in the
hemicellulose fraction is more difficult. Recently, NREL scientists
metabolically engineered a new strain of the bacterium <I>Z. mobilis</I> that
can simultaneously coferment the glucose and xylose&#151;prominent in many
lignocellulosic feedstocks&#151;to ethanol.</P>
<P><B>Status/Accomplishments:</B> Research is being conducted to develop
advanced processes to coferment the predominant hexose and pentose sugars in
lignocellulosic feedstocks to ethanol. Using metabolically engineered strains of
<I>Z. mobilis </I>developed at NREL, cofermentation processes based on
simultaneous saccharification and cofermentation (SSCF), separate hydrolysis and
cofermentation (SHCF), and hybrid SSCF/SHCF configurations are being evaluated
using statistically designed experiments and response surface analysis.
Preliminary cofermentation processing conditions that maximize the ethanol yield
and concentration from dilute-acid pretreated hardwood sawdust and minimize the
fermentation time will be established for scaleup to the process development
unit. </P>

industry, is a particularly attractive ethanol feedstock because of negative
feedstock cost, much-simplified technology compared to a grass-roots plant, and
the availability of an extensive infrastructure that can provide utilities at
incremental cost. Continuous bioreactors generally, and the recently patented
continuous solids-retaining bioreactor in particular, may offer an effective

<P>Yellow poplar is the most abundant waste material from sawmill operation in
the Ohio valley region, and the techniques developed with it can be readily
transferred to other hardwood species and certain herbaceous materials;
therefore, its sawdust was chosen as a standard feedstock for evaluation.</P>
<P><B>Status/Accomplishments: </B>In addition to bench-scale testing conducted
under CRADAs, we worked on pretreatment and simultaneous saccharification and
fermentation of yellow poplar sawdust.</P>
<P>Through a series of pretreatment, enzymatic hydrolysis, and fermentation
experiments, standard methods were developed to store and handle feedstock and
pretreated material to ensure comparison testing is done on the same basis. A
quick method that uses epifluorescence was developed to monitor yeast cell
viability. We are evaluating various techniques for detoxifying the inhibitors
in wood prehydrolyzates. </P>
<P>Bench-scale fermentors, pretreatment equipment, and a batch prehydrolysis
system were set up, and commissioning is under way. This system will improve the
pretreatment capability and flexibility at bench scale.</P>
<P>A new and improved continuous stirred-tank bioreactor system was assembled.
It can handle high solid loading, is sterilizable in place, and has on-line data
acquisition and control. It will be integrated with the bench-scale pretreatment
equipment and the Sunds hydrolyzer, and used for long-term continuous runs.</P>

<P><B>Objectives:</B>Design, build, and operate a 1-ton-per-day
biomass-to-ethanol facility that will be used to collect scaleup data to design
a 40to 100-ton-per-day biomass-to-ethanol engineering demonstration unit (EDU).
Demonstrate the NREL-Amoco CRADA process in the pilot plant. Collect data for
Phase 4 of the CRADA (EDU construction). </P>
<P><B>Approach/Background:</B> NREL's integrated bench-scale research
investigates chemical interactions among the biomass-to-ethanol process steps to
determine overall process performance for small-scale equipment. However, this
equipment is not large enough to accurately model a large commercial or
near-commercial plant. This is especially true in technologies such as this one,
in which solids are processed and recycling is necessary. The equipment size
presents physical limitations on the range of operating conditions and physical
pneumonia that can be investigated. </P>
<P>With the PDU, individual process steps and overall process configuration can
be developed using equipment large enough to investigate a full range of
realistic operating conditions and observe the various equipment-size dependent

<P>Because the eventual goal is commercialization, new ethanol production
technology will be tested for NREL's industrial partners in the PDU.</P>
<P><B>Status/Accomplishments:</B> Phase II equipment, including a CRADA
pretreatment reactor, was installed. Startup activities and initial experimental
investigations are ongoing. Numerous modifications were made to improve
operability, reliability, and capability. These include steam, air, process
water, feedstock handling, pretreatment reactor, fermentor controls, and
passivating stainless steel vessels to increase their corrosion resistance to
the process fluid. Three experimental runs that incorporate pretreatment and SSF
were successfully completed using hardwood and Amoco CRADA feedstock. The
ethanol distillation was also tested successfully after an integrated run in
early September 1995. We are preparing for integrated CRADA runs.</P>
<P>Phase III equipment is being designed and procured. The Phase III equipment
will improve the operability and capability of the plant: aerobic capability for
enzyme production, added cooling capacity, automated feed system for the Amoco
CRADA pretreatment reactor, backup power system, fermentor exhaust condensers,
chiller, larger cooling water system, clean in place system, and kill system for
using recombinant organisms in the plant.</P>

<P><B>Objective:</B> Identify and develop pretreatment approaches that could
improve ethanol production performance over the observed NREL base-case dilute
sulfuric acid pretreatment process.</P>
<P><B>Approach/Background:</B> Pretreating lignocellulosic biomass is a key
step in a successful biomass-to-ethanol conversion process. Until 1993,
resources were focused on a dilute sulfuric acid pretreatment process, which has
become part of the NREL base-case ethanol process. Although technically
effective and economically promising, this process has several areas for
improvement, including reduced yields of furfural and hydroxyl-methyl furfural
from xylose and glucose, respectively, and reduced yields of other substances
that may be toxic to cellulase enzymes and ethanol-fermenting yeasts; reduced
levels of xylan remaining in pretreated solids; enhanced digestibility of
pretreated solids; and reducing or eliminating gypsum. This subcontract is one
of several established to conduct research and development on other promising
pretreatment processes. Lime pretreatment of milled switchgrass, whole-tree
hybrid poplar, and corn stover/corn cobs mixture was contracted to be studied.</P>
<P><B>Status/Accomplishments:</B> During the first year we studied lime
pretreatment of switchgrass. We conducted experiments that varied residence
time, temperature, lime loading, water loading, and biomass particle size to
determine the optimum or near optimum pretreatment conditions. The project is
now in its second year, and investigates lime pretreatment of milled hybrid
poplar and corn stover/corn cobs mixture.</P>

<P><B>Objective:</B> To conduct detailed compositional analyses of solid and
hydrolyzate fractions of a selected dilute-acid pretreated biomass feedstock and
identify the inhibitory compounds that adversely affect fermentation
performance. This information will be used to develop strategies to alleviate
inhibition of fermentation performance.</P>
<P><B>Approach/Background:</B> Relatively poor conversion of neutralized
dilute-acid pretreated hardwood feedstocks is attributed to the presence of
inhibitory compounds that deleteriously affect the microorganisms used to
ferment biomass sugars to ethanol. Suspected inhibitors include compounds
present in raw biomass and those formed or released during pretreatment. To
develop an economical biomass-to-ethanol process, the composition of dilute-
acid pretreated biomass feedstocks must be characterized, and inhibitory
compounds, their inhibition mechanisms, and their probable fates in an
integrated biomass-to-ethanol process identified.</P>
<P><B>Status/Accomplishments:</B> High-pressure liquid chromatography, gas
chromatography, and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry are being used to
identify and quantify suspected inhibitory compounds present in dilute-acid
pretreated mixed hardwood sawdust solids and hydrolyzate liquor. The first
year's work focused on analyzing the hydrolyzate liquor. In addition to acetic
acid, hydroxyl-methyl-furfural, and furfural, suspected inhibitors include
gallic acid, vanillin, protocatechuic acid, sinapic acid, coniferyl alcohol, and
syringaldehyde. Hydrolyzate liquor fractions and individual putative inhibitory
compounds are also being tested for toxicity to growth and xylose fermentation
using NREL's recombinant <I>Zymomonas</I>. The near-term goal is to develop a
list of putative inhibitory compounds ranked in order of their concentration in
pretreatment liquor and their relative toxicity. Second-year efforts will focus
on identifying additional inhibitory compounds and characterizing the toxicity
of previously identified inhibitory components to growth and fermentation using<I>Saccharomyces
cerevisiae</I>.</P>

<P><B>Objective:</B> Determine the conditions that maximize the rate and
extent of yeast cell mass production during seed preparation and the ethanol
production rate during simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF),
while minimizing seed fermentation energy needs and the lag phase in SSF.</P>
<P><B>Approach/Background:</B> Yeast seed cultivation techniques, including
those used at industrial scales, will be identified and evaluated to determine
their effect on SSF performance. The most promising techniques will be selected
for further optimization. The effects of nutrient composition, aeration, and
agitation during seed cultivation on SSF ethanol productivity will be
quantified. Strategies will be developed to minimize seed cultivation
requirements while maintaining optimal cell growth and product formation.
Aerobic and anaerobic batch, fed-batch, and continuous seed fermentations will
be considered.</P>
<P><B>Status/Accomplishments:</B> Parameters for yeast seed production and use
in SSF were investigated using<I> Saccharomyces cerevisiae</I> D5A. Results
indicate that 1% (w/v) glucose is adequate to produce the quantity of yeast seed
required for SSF, and that a 2.5% (v/v) seed inoculum is sufficient to produce
the required quantity of yeast cells in an 8-hour residence time. However, using
corn steep liquor (CSL) as the sole nutrient source for both seed production and
SSF, 7-day SSF yields on either pure Avicel cellulose or pretreated poplar were
less than 10% of theoretical. In contrast to the subcontractors findings,
research conducted at NREL has shown CSL to be an adequate sole nutrient source
for seed production and high-yield SSF. </P>

commercial nutrient sources that maximize cell yield in seed preparation and

xylose- fermenting strain of <I>Zymomonas mobilis</I>.</P>
<P><B>Approach/Background:</B> Sensitivity analysis of the base-case
biomass-to-ethanol process indicates substantial savings in capital and
operating cost associated with advanced process designs in which the hexose and
pentose sugars in lignocellulosic feedstocks are simultaneously cofermented to
ethanol. Recently, NREL scientists metabolically engineered a new strain of the
bacterium <I>Z. mobilis</I> that can simultaneously coferment glucose and
xylose&#151;prominent in many lignocellulosic feedstocks&#151;to ethanol.
Information on the commercial nutrient sources and process conditions that
maximize cell yield, ethanol yield, and productivity are essential to the

that maximize cell yield in seed preparation and ethanol yield and productivity

<P><B>Approach/Background:</B> This subcontract was undertaken to demonstrate
the feasibility of converting lignocellulosic biomass materials into ethanol and
electric power. WICO, a wood waste management, composting, and fuel supply
company, is interested in developing dedicated feedstock supply systems (DFSS)
that can be economically integrated with a liquid fuel conversion process and
existing biomass-to-energy combustion systems. To accomplish this, costs
associated with the conversion systems must be substantially reduced. </P>
<P>The study summarized here was commissioned to determine whether cost
reductions associated with an integrated community and regional planning
approach are adequate to make the project viable. The community and regional
planning approach would integrate DFSS, using the most productive indigenous
herbaceous and woody crops, with sewage treatment, municipal waste recycling and

<P><B>Objective:</B> Understand the effects of operating variables on yields
of xylose from hemicellulose in NREL's two-stage dilute sulfuric acid
pretreatment process and provide analytical support to NREL in-house and
subcontracted research staff to chemically analyze biomass samples.</P>
<P><B>Approach/Background:</B> When lignocellulosic biomass is pretreated,
hemicellulosic sugars (primarily xylose) are released. We can determine the
relationship between particle size, temperature, residence time, acid
concentration, and xylose yield by conducting experimental and modeling studies.
This study uses hybrid poplar, yellow poplar, switchgrass, and corn stover to
establish kinetic models that predict yields of xylose through dilute sulfuric
acid pretreatment. By incorporating the obtained kinetic models, process
operating models that describe a two-stage, reverse-flow percolation process can
be developed and simulated to give the optimum operating conditions. Up-flow
percolation reactor configurations that account for intraparticle and
interparticle mass and heat transfer phenomena, are being investigated. </P>
<P><B>Status/Accomplishments:</B> We developed kinetic models that describe
the release of xylose and oligomeric xylose during dilute-acid pretreatment.
These models, based on experimental data and theoretical kinetic analysis,
demonstrate that the use of a two-stage pretreatment scheme allows for variable
temperature profiles that greatly enhance the process performance. The models
dealt with four percolation reactor configurations, and gave the best performing
reactor configuration. </P>
<P>Work is ongoing to improve the process operating models by incorporating the
generation of oligomeric xylose as an intermediate product, mass and heat
diffusion factors, and nonideal flow characteristics to more accurately predict
dilute-acid pretreatment process performance. As oligomeric xylose is received
as an intermediate product, secondary hydrolysis of converting oligomer to its
monomer by temperature holdup and enzyme were investigated, and the best
conditions of the secondary hydrolysis determined. </P>
<P>The kinetic work on dilute-acid pretreatment and hydrolysis of yellow poplar
that employ extremely dilute acid is ongoing.</P>
<P>Analytical service to NREL in-house and subcontracted research personnel was
also provided. Liquid samples were analyzed for glucose, xylose, arabinose,
galactose, mannose, acetic acid, furfural, hydroxyl-methyl- furfural, and
solubilized lignin. Solid samples were analyzed for glucan, xylan, arabinan,
galactan, mannan, Klason lignin, acid-soluble lignin, and total ash. The
enzymatic digestibilities of certain samples were determined.</P>

<P><B>Objective:</B> Evaluate both a biomass gasification combined cycle
(BGCC) and a biomass-to-ethanol process that would use a specific mill site and
be sized to satisfy the mill's steam, power, and integration needs.</P>
<P><B>Approach/Background:</B> Weyerhaeuser's New Bern, North Carolina,
facility was selected for a high-efficiency, biomass-fueled power plant
primarily because it cannot burn residual hog fuel (primarily bark) generated at
the adjacent sawmill and chip export facility. To use the bark boiler, New Bern
would have to spend significant capital on flue gas treatment. It currently
purchases 470,000 bbl/year of fuel oil to meet process steam demands (natural
gas is not available).</P>
<P>Weyerhaeuser Company and its industrial partners (Amoco Corporation,
Carolina Power and Light, and Stone &amp; Webster Engineering Corporation)
determined the conditions under which biomass-derived power and liquid fuels
production can be practiced in an environmentally supportive and sound business
manner. The partners performed a project feasibility study on a 39-MWe BGCC
power facility to assess the economic merits of expanding biomass use to produce
electric power or liquid fuels, or both. In addition, the partners evaluated an
attending project that incorporated an ethanol plant to assess the relative
economic merits of liquid fuels and power.</P>
<P>The team evaluated alternatives at each stage and developed an integrated
program that resulted in the most cost- effective production of ethanol and
electricity from sustainable sources of biomass. A production concept and
detailed costs to define an engineering demonstration unit were formulated.</P>
<P><B>Status/Accomplishments:</B> Based on the information developed in this
study, and parallel evaluations performed by Weyerhaeuser and others, biomass
gasification for use in power production appears to be technically viable. At
the New Bern mill, options exist that would allow the technology to be tested at
the commercial scale while serving the practical energy requirements of the
mill. A staged project development plan provides for a low-risk and low-cost
demonstration of a biomass gasifier as an element of a boiler modification
program, then allows for timely expansion of power production by adding a
combined cycle cogeneration plant.</P>
<P>Ethanol technology is at an earlier stage of development, but there appears
to be a set of realizable site and market conditions that could provide for an
economically attractive woody-biomass-based ethanol facility. Ethanol's market
price, feedstock cost, and enzyme cost dramatically affect the projected
profitability of such a plant. Additional process and project development work
is required to reduce uncertainties and perceived risks before proceeding with
future work.</P>

<P><B>Objective:</B> Identify and develop pretreatment approaches that can
improve ethanol production process performance and cost over the NREL base-case
dilute sulfuric acid pretreatment process.</P>
<P><B>Approach/Background:</B> Pretreating lignocellulosic biomass is a key
step in a successful biomass-to-ethanol conversion process. Until 1992,
resources were focused on a dilute sulfuric acid pretreatment process, which has
become part of the NREL base-case ethanol process. The process has several areas
for improvement. This subcontract is one of several established to conduct
research and development on other promising pretreatment processes. Ammonia
recycled percolation (ARP) pretreatment has not yet been reported in the
literature.</P>
<P><B>Status/Accomplishments:</B> We studied the ARP pretreatment process and
established near-optimum conditions for milled whole-tree hybrid poplar,
switchgrass, and a corn stover/corn cobs mixture. Hybrid poplar delignified as
much as 50%, the corn stover/corn cobs mixture 80%, and switchgrass 85%.
Concomitantly, hemicellulose was removed by 50%&#150;60% for all three
feedstocks. Solids pretreated were highly digestible. The ARP process was
readily adaptable to SSF for ethanol production. Toxicity tests of the
pretreatment effluents, after removing ammonia and precipitating lignin, showed
that as much as 60% strength of the effluents could be used without significant
adverse fermentation effects. Material balance on ammonia showed that the
ammonia consumption was 0.02g NH3/g dry biomass. The process generated sulfurand
sodium-free lignin that could become a valuable by-product.</P>
<P>To increase the fractionation of xylan and lignin, a pretreatment scheme
that uses autohydrolysis (hot-water treatment), dilute-acid percolation, or
hydrogen peroxide treatment before the ARP, was explored. The additional
pretreatment step before the ARP process showed enhanced hemicellulose removal
and recovery, and increased the extent of delignification, which showed the
possibility of fractionating biomass almost completely.</P>

<P><B>Objective:</B> Prepare standardized dilute-acid pretreated biomass
solids and prehydrolyzates for NREL in-house research groups and subcontractors
and conduct pretreatment research runs.</P>
<P><B>Approach/Background:</B> Several NREL research groups and subcontractors
require pretreated biomass solids or liquors for research activities. Generating
consistent pretreated solids and liquors for use is desirable. To ensure large
quantities of consistent products are prepared, a 100-L (&quot;paddle&quot;) and
a 170-L (&quot;Jaygo&quot;) reactor were designed and fabricated. These
reactors, along with a laboratory-scale percolation reactor, are also used for
pretreatment research. Hazen Research, Inc., was selected to operate these
systems.</P>
<P><B>Status/Accomplishments:</B> The paddle and the percolation reactors have
been installed and shaken down. Switchgrass, milled hybrid poplar, yellow poplar
sawdust, mixed sawdust, and rice straw have been pretreated in the paddle
reactor. Pretreatment products have been supplied to NREL and to subcontractors
for evaluation. Preliminary pretreatment testing has begun using the percolation
reactor. The Jaygo reactor is being shaken down and installed.</P>

<P><B>Objective:</B> Identify and develop pretreatment approaches that can
improve ethanol production process performance and cost over the NREL base-case
dilute sulfuric acid pretreatment process.</P>
<P><B>Approach/Background:</B> Pretreating lignocellulosic biomass is a key
step in a successful biomass-to-ethanol conversion process. Until 1992,
resources were focused on a dilute sulfuric acid pretreatment process, which has
become part of the NREL base-case ethanol process. It is technically effective
and economically promising, but has several areas for improvement, including
reduced yields of furfural and hydroxyl-methyl furfural from, respectively,
xylose, glucose, and reduced yields of other substances that may be toxic to
cellulase enzymes and ethanol-fermenting yeasts; reduced levels of xylan
remaining in pretreated solids; enhanced enzymatic digestibility of pretreated
solids; and reduction or elimination of gypsum. This subcontract is one of
several established to conduct research and development on other promising
pretreatment processes. Phosphoric acid pretreatment and oxalic acid
pretreatment with or without the presence of methanol were contracted to be
studied.</P>
<P><B>Status/Accomplishments:</B> Pretreatment experiments of milled hybrid
poplar, switchgrass, and corn stover/corn cobs mixture using dilute phosphoric
acid and oxalic acid were conducted. Oxalic acid caused notable reactor
corrosion and so was excluded from further study. Prehydrolyzates from
organosolv runs using methanol showed high toxicity to yeast. Efforts are now
directed toward dilute phosphoric acid and phosphoric acid-catalyzed organosolv
pretreatments that use ethanol as the organic solvent.</P>

<P><B>Objective:</B> Establish optimal dilute sulfuric acid pretreatment
conditions for selected biomass feedstocks that will result in maximum yields of
ethanol equivalents (ethanol equivalents being proportional to the sum of the
fermentable sugars produced in the course of pretreatment and glucose produced
through enzymatic saccharification of the pretreated solids).</P>
<P><B>Approach/Background:</B> Previous research has shown that removing
hemicellulose by dilute sulfuric acid prehydrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass
renders cellulose accessible to cellulase enzymes. The extent of prehydrolysis
depends on temperature, time, and acid concentration, and the reaction can be
modeled as two parallel pseudo first-order reactions through which xylose is
produced and (partially) degraded to nonfermentable compounds. The enzymatic
digestibility of the remaining cellulose is, for a number of hardwoods,
agricultural residues, and herbaceous crops, directly related to the extent of
hemicellulose removal from the pretreated material. Potential ethanol yield
depends on both the yield of xylose from hemicellulose and the enzymatic digest
ibility of the cellulose. Thus, a high yield of xylose and a high cellulose
enzymatic digestibility are essential for economic viability. Milled hybrid
poplar, switchgrass, and a corn stover/corn cobs mixture were selected for this
study.</P>
<P><B>Status/Accomplishments:</B> Pretreatment experimental runs that varied
temperature (140&#183;&#150;180&#183;C), acid concentration (0.6&#150;1.2 wt %),
and time (0.5&#150;60 min) were conducted for milled hybrid poplar, switchgrass,
and a corn stover/corn cobs mixture. A matrix of 50&#150;60 data points was
generated for each feedstock. Kinetic models were developed and apparent optimum
conditions for maximum yields of xylose identified. Mass balances around the
pretreatment operation were established. Pretreated solids produced under
optimum conditions were tested in SSF studies for ethanol yields. The
prehydrolyzates produced under optimum conditions are being tested for their
fermentation toxicity.</P>

<P><B>Status/Accomplishments:</B> Using the optimal pretreatment conditions
known to the contractor, the alkaline peroxide extrusion pretreated hybrid
poplar, upon simultaneous saccharification and fermentation produced an ethanol
yield of 32% of theoretical conversion, based on cellulose available in the

<P><B>Objective:</B> Characterize and develop a pH-controlled hot-water
pretreatment process.</P>
<P><B>Approach/Background:</B> Pretreating lignocellulosic biomass is a key
step in a successful biomass-to-ethanol conversion process. Numerous
pretreatment techniques, including physical, chemical, and biological means,
have been studied, and many are effective. None, however, has been
commercialized. Currently, a number of pretreatment approaches, all of which
(except this project), involve the use of one or more chemicals as catalyst, are
supported for investigation by DOE through NREL. This project represents a
different approach, in that high-temperature water treatment is to be used. A
small amount of a chemical (a base) will be applied, only enough to control the
pretreatment environment to near neutral conditions (pH 5 to 7). Thus, the
chemical added is not to catalyze pretreatment reactions. Waste newsprint and
yellow poplar sawdust are contracted to be studied.</P>
<P><B>Status/Accomplishments:</B> After initially testing several reactor
configurations, a Parr Instrument stirred pressure reactor was found to be
suitable for the project and has been procured. A semiautomatic pH control
system is being installed. Concomitantly, experimental runs of newsprint and
sawdust are being conducted.</P>

<P><B>Objective:</B> Develop an integrated analysis of a dedicated feedstock
supply system, and determine its applicability to a specific region (central
Florida) and the available crops/conversion systems.</P>
<P><B>Approach/Background:</B> Reclaimed phosphate-mined land in central
Florida has been identified as an area with potential for growing biomass crops.
If fuel from biomass systems proves profitable, approximately 73,000 acres of
land could be available for biomass production. Reducing the buildup of
atmospheric CO2 by recycling CO2 is a major environmental benefit for
biomass/energy production. Using waste streams to produce ethanol may be further
exploited for producing methane or for direct combustion. Another possibility is
producing animal feed.</P>
<P><B>Status/Accomplishments:</B> The crops identified as having the most
potential for biomass production include the tall tropical grasses (sugar cane,
energy cane, and elephantgrass&#151;also called napiergrass); leucaena;
eucalyptus; and slash pine. Crop yields vary according to soil type and range
from a high of 22 dry tons per acre for sugar cane on phosphatic clay soil, to a
low of 9 tons per acre for two varieties of eucalyptus and slash pine. The crop
with the lowest estimated production cost per dry ton was leucaena on phosphatic
clay at $3.45 per dry ton. The largest single cost component for biomass
production was harvest costs. The most cost-effective harvest method appeared to
be a high-capacity forage chopper.</P>
<P>The potential ethanol yield per dry ton of sugar cane was estimated to be
119 gallons. The current cost for converting cellulose to ethanol was estimated
to be too high to be economically feasible. Further research has been proposed
to develop methods for reducing the associated costs. The subcontractor has
proposed that by finding multiple uses for a specific feedstock&#151; perhaps
sugar cane&#151;the costs for additional processes can be dramatically reduced.</P>

<P><B>Objective:</B> Determine whether an investment-worthy business could be
based on the conversion of a dedicated feedstock to ethanol and electricity at
the Ka'u sugar plantation on the Island of Hawaii.</P>
<P><B>Approach/Background:</B> The decline of the Hawaiian sugar industry,
including the closing of plantations and mills, has made large tracts of land
and infrastructure available for planting and evaluating selected crops. Warm
temperatures and abundant sunlight create an environment that is almost ideal
for cultivating biomass crops that might serve as dedicated feedstocks for
producing energy related products. A project team was established to develop
this effort. Team participants included PICHTR, Amoco Corporation, Cargill
Incorporated, C. Brewer and Company Ltd., Hawaii Electric Light Company,
Hawaiian Electric Company, the County of Hawaii, and the Hawaii State Department
of Business Economic Development and Tourism.</P>
<P>The Ka'u sugar plantation and mill are owned by C. Brewer and Company Ltd.
The primary focus of the subcontract was the use of the sugar crop or other
crops with sufficient carbohydrate content to produce ethanol and electricity.</P>
<P><B>Status/Accomplishments:</B> The biomass sources evaluated included sugar
cane, sorghum, napiergrass, leucaena, and eucalyptus. The focus was to identify
a crop or crops that could be used as feedstock for the production process, and
to determine whether it could be supplied at a cost consistent with providing
the final product, at a profit, to the marketplace. The preliminary economic
overview indicated, on the basis of yield per acre per year and projected
production costs, that energy cane and napiergrass were the most promising
biomass crops. A detailed analysis for producing these crops at the Ka'u site
was completed.</P>
<P>Several technologies for converting biomass to ethanol and electricity were
reviewed and compared. The most promising approaches were surveyed in detail,
using the costs and operational considerations for the Ka'u site. To date, the
evaluation and analysis, that PICHTR has performed, have not shown that
sufficient profits could be generated at the Ka'u site to justify investing
large amounts of capital in an emerging technology. Other sites in Hawaii might
promise a more profitable technology.</P>

<P><B>Objective: </B>Establish strategic and operational plans for biodiesel,
coordinate and support market development activities in the biodiesel industry
and DOE, and increase public awareness of and support for biodiesel technology.
</P>
<P><B>Approach/Background: </B>Biodiesel is a renewable diesel fuel substitute
produced by chemically reacting an alcohol with a natural oil. The approach to
DOE's biodiesel project has changed dramatically during the past 2 years. DOE's
focus was on long-term research for biodiesel produced via microalgal conversion
of waste CO2 from fossil- fueled power plants to natural oils. This research is
necessary in the long run to provide a resource base of natural oils sufficient
to meet the needs of the transportation sector. The current project has both a
short-term and a long- term focus. The near-term focus is on opportunities for
biodiesel made from vegetable oil and animal fats. 
</P>
<P><B>Status/Accomplishments:</B> We have made great strides in developing a
coordi- nated strategy for establishing a U.S. biodiesel indus- try. For the
first time, we have a strategic plan that identifies several critical paths for
biodiesel, and thus focuses our limited resources on activities most critical to
achieving our goals. 
</P>
<P>Public support for biodiesel is increasing exponentially. Two years ago,
biodiesel was virtually unheard of in the United States. Today, it is being
tested in environmentally sensitive areas, and in niche markets such as mining,
buses, government fleets, and marine use. Much of the increased interest is due
to the efforts of the National Biodiesel Board (NBB). NREL has developed a
working relationship with the NBB that allows each to leverage the other's
limited R&amp;D, market development, and outreach funds.

<P><B>Objective:</B> Determine technology options for producing and evaluating
biodiesel from low-cost feedstocks at the pilot scale.
</P>
<P><B>Approach/Background:</B> The cost of biodiesel produced from virgin
soybean oil in the United States is $2.50 to $3.50 per gallon. This high cost
remains the greatest obstacle to market penetration for biodiesel in blends or
as a neat fuel. Three-quarters of the production cost is associated with the
feedstock itself. Our work focuses on determining the feasibility of using
lower-cost feedstocks, such as recycled cooking oils and waste from animal
processing operations. We have joined forces with the Fats and Proteins Research
Foundation and the National Biodiesel Board to conduct a technoeconomic analysis
of conventional (off-the-shelf) technologies available today for processing
these low-cost feedstocks, which have special processing issues. The greatest
issue is the increased level of free fatty acids found in recycled materials.
Once we identify technologies that can handle higher levels of free fatty acids,
we will establish a plan to produce pilot-scale quantities of biodiesel made
from these feedstocks. We will also test to establish the fuel's physical and
chemical characteristics and their impact on engine and fuel performance.
</P>
<P><B>Status/Accomplishments:</B> Preliminary results indicate a variety of
technology options that can handle 10%&#150;15% levels of free fatty acids in
the feedstock. We would like to be able to handle higher levels of free fatty
acid, but these technologies offer the opportunity to process waste restaurant
grease and other materials. We have determined that pilot-scale operations,
which negating the need for constructing our pilot plant, are available for
producing biodiesel from these feedstocks. A final report from MARC-IV, which
will be the basis for negotiating a subcontract for the next phase of research,
is anticipated in early FY 1996. This will include producing and testing fuel.

<P><B>Objective:</B> Assess alternative process technologies for converting
natural oils to biodiesel and using the glycerol by- product.
</P>
<P><B>Approach/Background: </B>Biodiesel is a renewable diesel fuel substitute
produced by chemically reacting an alcohol with a natural oil. When the natural
oils are in the form of triglycerides, this reaction is known as
transesterification, and is carried out today using basic catalysts such as NaOH
or methoxide. Most transesterification processes do not work well with
feedstocks that contain high levels of free fatty acids. The intent of this work
is to identify processes that are more efficient than current conven- tional
catalyst processes, and less sensitive to free fatty acid content. A more
flexible process allows the use of a range of lower-cost feedstocks. The other
major economic factor in converting natural oils to biodiesel is using glycerol.
Even for niche applications, the volume of biodiesel production required to meet
these small markets will result in a level of glycerol production that far
exceeds current market demands. New, high-volume markets for glycerol are needed

<P><B>Status/Accomplishments:</B> We have focused on developing enzymatic
catalysts to improve the flexibility of the transesterification process. To this
end, we are putting in place a three-way CRADA with the USDA's Agricultural
Research Service and the Fats and Proteins Research Foundation (FPRF) to
collaborate on the initial evaluation of lipase enzymes as catalysts for
transesterification. Researchers at USDA's Eastern Regional Research Center are
conducting bench-scale experiments on biodiesel production using a variety of
commercial lipase preparations. They have demonstrated that lipases exhibit much
greater flexibility in handling a range of feedstocks that contain as much as
50% free fatty acids. FPRF, a nonprofit, private research organization, is
supplying expertise on and samples from waste restaurant grease collection
operations. NREL will use this information to establish the economic viability
of enzymatic esterification with current commercial lipases. 
</P>
<P>We have also established a partnership with ARCO Chemical to evaluate the
production of di-<I>tert</I>-butyl glycerol (DTBG) as a complementary fuel
additive product derived from the glycerol by-product. ARCO has tested DTBG as
an oxygenate for diesel fuel. We will analyze DTBG production, coupled with
biodiesel production.

<P><B>Objective:</B> Produce an analytical tool for evaluating the energy,
environmental, and economic benefits of producing biodiesel in the United States
from lipid sources.
</P>
<P><B>Approach/Background:</B> Life-cycle analysis (LCA) (first used by the
Coca Cola Company 20 years ago) is now gaining world-wide prominence as a
valuable tool for understanding the impacts of new products and processes on the
environment and on corporate bottom lines. Such an analysis forces an assessment
of the impacts of a given product from the extraction of any and all raw
materials from the earth to the processing, distribution, and use of the
product. 
</P>
<P>The definition of renewable fuels should be based on an LCA. The approach
for this study is based on an exciting new set of software tools for LCA
developed by Ecobalance. Thus, rather than simply producing a report on the
life-cycle benefits of biodiesel, we will produce licensable software tools that
companies and government entities can use to evaluate specific scenarios or
product and process improvements for biodiesel.
</P>
<P>Because of the near-term opportunities for biodiesel, this analysis will
first focus on producing biodiesel from sources of natural oils. In the future,
it will be expanded to include biodiesel via microalgal conversion of waste CO2
to natural oils.
</P>
<P><B>Status/Accomplishments:</B> To be worthwhile, an LCA must have
broad-based input from all stakeholders. Thus, we built a consortium of
biodiesel stakeholders to provide input on all assump- tions, approaches, and
system boundaries for the analysis. We have established a Biodiesel Working
Group, an unprecedented collection of private and government interests that
includes USDA, DOE, EPA, the City of Chicago, the National Biodiesel Board,
Exxon, ARCO Chemical, Cargill, Twin Rivers Technologies, the Energy and
Environmental Studies Institute, and the American Petroleum Institute. A scoping
document has been drafted. We encourage anyone interested in providing input to
contact the project manager.

<P><B>Objective:</B> Establish a technoeconomic model of microalgae technology
for CO2 mitigation with coproduction of biodiesel. 
</P>
<P><B>Approach/Background:</B> Microalgae are unique photosynthetic organisms
in that they accumulate high levels of natural oils, thrive in high-salinity
water, and use CO2 (an important green- house gas) as their sole carbon source.
Microalgae grown in ponds can be used to trap CO2 from power- plant flue gas
while producing a feedstock for biodiesel.
</P>
<P><B>Status/Accomplishments: </B>A spreadsheet-based economic model was
developed for microalgae production using CO2 from flue gases. This model
predicts costs within 2% of those predicted by an earlier FORTRAN model, but is
much easier to use. It has been used to assess targets for lipid content and
growth rate of genetically engineered algae.
</P>
<P>Because CO2 collection is the single largest cost factor, we developed a
model that predicts costs for recovering and delivering CO2 from flue gas, in
lieu of using market costs for CO2. The process steps include monothanolamine
(MEA) extraction, compression, dehydration, and transportation to the ponds.
This approach yields a delivered CO2 cost of $41/mt, versus a market price of
$66/mt of CO2. The model has also shown that MEA extraction is 40% less
expensive than the simpler route of direct flue gas utilization. 
</P>
<P>We have used our models to establish mid- and long-term targets for this
technology. An improved process in the mid-term will result in a net cost $20/mt
of CO2 mitigated. This is very competitive with other mitigation technologies.
In the long term, we hope to identify process goals that reduce mitigation costs
to zero, by reducing process costs and increasing biodiesel yields as a
by-product credit.

<P><B>Objective:</B> Develop genetic transformation systems for microalgae as
tools for creating genetically engineered microalgae capable of enhanced natural
oil production.
</P>
<P><B>Approach/Background:</B> When grown in mass culture, microalgae can
accumu- late storage oil. They may therefore be an excellent feedstock for
producing biodiesel fuel. The economics of producing biodiesel from microalgae
would be significantly improved if microalgal strains with improved oil
production characteristics could be developed. Genetic engineering can introduce
these desirable characteristics into microalgae, but genetic transformation
systems are not available for most microalgal species. 
</P>
<P><B>Status/Accomplishments:</B> We have developed a genetic transformation
system for diatoms, an abundant group of microalgae with excellent potential for
biodiesel production. This system is based on expressing a bacterial antibiotic
resistance marker gene under the control of regulatory regions from an algal
gene. Genetically transformed cells can be identified by their ability to grow
in the presence of certain antibiotics. We have used this system to introduce
additional native and foreign genes into the diatoms <I>Cyclotella </I>and <I>Navicula.</I>
This represents a major advance in the field of algal biotechnology.

<P><B>Objective:</B> Isolate an algal ubiquitin gene and assess the ability of
its regulatory regions to mediate foreign gene expression in microalgae.
</P>
<P><B>Approach/Background:</B> A major focus of the biodiesel project at NREL
is to investigate the use of microalgal lipids for producing biodiesel fuel. One
goal is to optimize lipid production in microalgae by manipulating the flow of
carbon into lipids via genetic engineering. The availability of promoters and
other regulatory regions from a variety of algal genes will enhance our ability
to accomplish this goal. Ubiquitin, a highly conserved protein, is expressed at
high levels in many kinds of cells. The focus of this project is to isolate and
characterize the regulatory regions from a microalgal ubiquitin gene and assess
the ability of these gene sequences to mediate the expression of foreign genes
in oil-producing microalgae.
</P>
<P><B>Status/Accomplishments: </B>We screened a gene library from the diatom
<I>Cyclotella cryptica</I> for the presence of ubiquitin gene sequences using a
maize ubiquitin gene as a probe. We isolated and characterized a clone via
restriction mapping and nucleotide sequencing. Preliminary results from the
sequence analysis confirm the presence of an algal ubiquitin gene. We will
analyze this clone to characterize the promoter and terminator regulatory
regions for use in microalgal gene expression systems.

carbohydrates, to provide more substrate for lipid synthesis.

<P></P>
<P><B>Objective:</B> Support syngas conditioning research by providing
information on the composition of raw gas produced in biomass gasification of
conditioned gas following hot-gas filtering and catalytic reforming.</P>
<P><B>Approach/Background:</B> Much research has been performed on biomass
gasification, but few studies have included comprehensive analyses of tars
generated in biomass gasification, the influence of catalytic reforming
conditions on gas composition, tar-conversion efficiency, or the evolution of
fuel nitrogen in biomass gasification. Parametric tests were performed on a
bench-scale biomass-syngas test system comprising a biomass gasifier, hot-gas
filter, and catalytic reformer. Input variables are equivalence ratio and
residence time; for the catalytic reformer they include temperature, space time,
and steam:biomass ratio.</P>
<P><B>Status/Accomplishments:</B> The parametric tests on biomass
gasification, using sawdust (a mixture of fir, poplar, oak, ash, and leucaena)
as feedstock, identified tar species varied from single-ring to five-ring
hydrocarbons. Under test conditions, tar yield and tar concentration in the
product gas ranged from 15 to 64 g/kg biomass and 15 to 86 g/SCM, respectively.
Lower temperatures favored greater numbers of aromatic tar species with
diversified substituent groups,and higher temperatures favored fewer aromatic
tar species without substituent groups. Higher temperature or equivalence ratio
favored polyaromatic compounds. Oxygen-containing compounds existed in
significant quantities only at temperatures lower than 800&#183;C; among such
compounds, phenol was most abundant.</P>
<P>Catalytic Reforming Tests. Under certain reforming conditions, 97% of the
gasification tars were cracked (benzene and naphthalene were virtually
eliminated) and gas yield and composition approached equilibrium. The commercial
nickel-based catalyst tested here performed very well, but such catalysts have
potential drawbacks vis-a-vis cost, intolerance to oxygen breakthrough, and
disposal; the same experimental system used here can be used to examine
alternative catalysts.</P>
<P>Parametric tests on the formation of nitrogenous compounds in biomass
gasification, which used leucena (a high- nitrogen content feedstock), showed
that of the gasification process parameters varied here, fuel nitrogen products
were most sensitive to gasification temperature, with ammonia (the prevalent
fuel nitrogen derivative), nitric oxide, and nitrogen-containing tar species
(collectively) decrease as gasification temperature increases, and hydrogen
cyanide increases with increasing temperature.</P>

<P><B>Objective:</B> Support thermochemical biofuels production research by
developing a catalytic process for the complete, oxygen-free gasification of
organic wastes in supercritical water.</P>
<P><B>Approach/Background:</B> Hydrogen-rich synthesis gas is produced from
the gasification of organic materials in supercritical water 600&#183;C, 34.5
MPa with carbon catalysts. Feedstocks investigated include glycerol (a waste
product of biodiesel production), organic waste streams (methanol, methyl ether
ketone, ethylene glycol, acetic acid, and phenol), sewage sludge, depithed
bagasse liquid extract, and banana <I>(Musa sp.&quot;Grand Main&quot;</I>) tree
stem. Most of these materials are available at low or negative cost, and some
represent waste constituents in biofuels production. Supercritical water (Tc&gt;374&#183;C,
Pc&gt;22 MPa) is an excellent solvent for organic materials and is used as the
reaction medium. Supercritical water reforms the organic feedstock over the
carbon catalyst and produces a synthesis gas rich in hydrogen and methane. These
can be used as fuel or to produce other biofuels such as methanol. These
experimental studies employ a continuous flow reactor with a packed bed or
catalyst.</P>
<P><B>Status/Accomplishments:</B> The carbon-based catalysts (including spruce
wood charcoal, Macadamia shell charcoal, coconut shell, activated carbon, and
coal activated carbon successfully gasified organic compounds in supercritical
water. The University of Hawaii at Manoa agreed to pay for a patent application
on the use of carbon catalysts as gasification agents in supercritical water.</P>
<P>Glycerol with a concentration as high as 2.0 M was completely gasified to
hydrogen-rich synthesis sludge at 600&#183;C, 34.5 MPa without carbon catalysts.
Sludge was completely converted at the same condition with the carbon catalyst.
The destruction efficiency for the organic wastes, including methanol, methyl
ethyl ketone, ethylene glycol, acetic acid, and phenol, was high.</P>
<P>The effects of temperature and pressure on gasification were investigated
systematically. A reaction temperature of 600&#183;C or higher was required for
complete gasification. Pressures higher than the critical pressure of water were
necessary, but increasing the pressure further did not improve gasification
efficiency.</P>

<P><B>Objectives:</B> Analyze the product streams that arise from operating
the thermochemical PDU over the range of operating conditions from pyrolysis to
gasification. Monitor full-scale unit operations, with the goal of achieving a
quantitative understanding of the chemistry of the entire process.Ultimately,
monitor key chemical species on-line for continuous process control. </P>
<P><B>Approach/Background:</B> The principal challenge of this project is
representative, real-time sampling and analysis of the various product streams.
No single analytical technique can provide the comprehensive detail required to
fully characterize the chemistry of the process; therefore, a battery of
analytical equipment with overlapping capabilities will be deployed for the
various unit operations. The transportable molecular beam mass spectrometer will
focus on continuous gas and vapor hydrocarbon determination from the raw and
chemically upgraded pyrolysis and gasification streams. A Nicolet Fourier
transform infrared spectrophotometer will enable major product gases and trace
products such as ammonia and hydrogen sulfide to be analyzed on-line. Dedicated
nondispersive infrared continuous chemical analyzers for CO, CO2, and total
hydrocarbons will also be used because they are industry standards and will
provide a benchmark for the other analytical instruments. Portable, rapid
analysis gas chromatographs (GCs) will perform other on-line gas analyses,
especially hydrogen. Still other GCs and a high-pressure liquid chromatograph
will be used for off-line condensed liquids analysis.</P>
<P><B>Status/Accomplishments:</B> All analytical equipment is either on hand
or procured and awaiting shipment. The sampling systems are in the design and
parts ordering phase, and required utilities are being installed. The sampling
systems will be constructed soon, and will proceed in parallel with the final
assembly of the process unit operations and interconnecting plumbing.</P>

<P><B>Objective:</B> The Thermochemical Process Development Unit (TCPDU),
located in the Field Test Laboratory Building high bay at NREL has been
renovated and modified to operate in both a gasification and a pyrolysis mode at
0.5 tons per day. The first year of operation will be used to characterize the
products produced at various operating conditions and to establish key operating
parameters for producing syngas and pyrolysis oils from biomass. These products
will be used by other tasks for additional experiments.</P>
<P><B>Approach/Background:</B> Gasifying biomass with oxygen or steam, or
both, is a well-known operation that produces a medium-energy gas containing
several products, including carbon monoxide, hydrogen, methane, and water. This
gas is commonly known as dirty syngas, as it contains entrained solids such as
char and other gas-phase contaminants such as high molecular weight products
known as tars that condense at relatively high temperatures and act as poisons
to catalysts used to make products from syngas, and vaporized alkali-containing
compounds that can foul process equipment.</P>
<P>This syngas, which is representative of gas produced in commercial
gasifiers, will be delivered to downstream unit operations intended to remove
tars and other potential poisons of catalysts used to make methanol or other
synthesis products. The TCPDU will be able to produce syngas, test char and tar
cleanup methods, and verify the effectiveness of the cleaning methods by using
the &quot;clean&quot; syngas with commercially available synthesis catalysts.</P>
<P>In the pyrolysis mode, the TCPDU will be used to make whole pyrolysis oils
from biomass; alternatively, the pyrolysis vapors can be directed through a
catalytic riser cracker to be modified.</P>
<P><B>Status/Accomplishments:</B> The ability to remove char from a hot gas
stream has been demonstrated during pyrolysis operations at NREL in FY 1994 and
early FY 1995. The old process development unit had difficulty producing mass-
balanced data and frequently had operational problems. These problems were
addressed in the renovated TCPDU in the following ways: a rotary valve and
accurate feeder control were added to the feeding system to improve feeding
stability; char will be removed using cyclones, baghouses, or other filter media
as experiments dictate; during pyrolysis operation, the pyrolysis vapors will be
condensed in a three-stage indirect condensation process followed by an
electrostatic precipitator, a coalescing filter, and a blower to remove any
residual aerosols.</P>
<P>A new control system, networked with the analytical equipment, is being
installed for improved data collection and reduction.</P>

<P><B>Objectives:</B> Help develop commercially viable fuels from the indirect
gasification of biomass. Extend the hot-gas conditioning system database.
Provide an environmentally acceptable gas stream to fuel an unmodified gas
turbine. </P>
<P><B>Approach/Background:</B> Biomass gasification produces a mediumto
high-Btu product gas (syngas) that contains primarily hydrogen and carbon
monoxide. The syngas is purified, then catalytically converted into methanol or
hydrocarbon fuels. Raw syngas is too rich in carbon monoxide for direct use in
fuels synthesis, which requires the hydrogen:carbon monoxide ratio to be
increased and the 1&#150;2 vol % of gasifier tar be removed. Conventional
technology for tar removal is water scrubbing, which cools the gas to near
ambient temperature. For interfacing indirect biomass gasification with the
current commercial gas-phase methanol synthesis processes, the syngas must be
reheated to 750&#183;C to steam reform methane. An alternative to scrubbing is
hot-gas conditioning. In syngas conditioning tar and methane are removed and the
hydrogen:carbon monoxide ratio adjusted at near gasification temperature (850&#183;C),
which saves significant energy for the overall biomass-to-methanol process.</P>
<P><B>Status/Accomplishments:</B> Five syngas conditioning catalysts similar
to DN34 were screened in slip-stream reactors at temperatures between 700&#183;C
and 870&#183;C. Most had tar destruction activity similar to DN34 and all
exhibited good to excellent water-gas shift activity. Methane destruction
activity was poor in all cases. DN34 appears to be best among the catalysts
tested to date.</P>
<P>Catalyst attrition is an important problem in the larger scale equipment.
This is solved by having DN34 made in the required size rather than ground and
screened as required now.</P>
<P>Initial gas turbine testing was successful. Small amounts of tar were
transported to the compressor by entrainment in aerosol water droplets from the
scrubber.</P>

<P><B>Objective:</B> The goal of the Synthesis Task is to evaluate methanol,
higher alcohols, and Fischer Tropsch catalysts for use with biosyngas in an
integrated system. System integration is required to determine syngas
conditioning performance, identify troublesome impurities and catalyst poisons,
and evaluate fuel synthesis catalyst performance for a wide variety of biosyngas
compositions. </P>
<P><B>Approach/Background:</B> Statistically designed experiments with bottled
syngas and commercial or experimental fuels synthesis catalysts are used to
explore the effects of hydrogen: carbon dioxide ratio, carbon dioxide, and
methane concentrations, and contamination by select tar compounds on catalyst
performance. Variable ranges span those encountered with biosyngas from
different gasifiers. Slurryand gas-phase processes are studied. Syngas
conditioning is performed and poisons and impurities unique to biosyngas are
determined by integrating a bench-scale synthesis reactor system with the
thermochemical process development unit (TPDU) gasifier. </P>
<P><B>Status/Accomplishments:</B> A high-pressure, bench-scale, synthesis
reactor system was built by TDA Research Inc. for NREL. It has a continuous
stirred tank reactor in parallel with a tubular plug flow reactor. One reactor
is used at a time with up to five gas and two liquid feed streams. The system is
pressure rated to more than 2500 psig and is under full computer process
control. A second computer controls the gas chromatograph and sampling valve and
collects data. A draft safe operating procedure supplied by TDA Research Inc. is
being reviewed. </P>
<P>A syngas compressor was ordered to compress conditioned syngas from the TPDU
gasifier. Three syngas conditioning methods will be available: water scrubbed,
water scrubbed + steam reformed to remove methane, and hot-catalytically
conditioned. The compressor outlet design pressure is 1600 psig and can be used
for on-line synthesis or to fill gas cylinders for later off-line work (e.g.,
synthesis catalyst lifetime tests for which running the PDU for extended periods
is impractical). </P>
<P>Designs have been started for the water scrubber and slip-stream catalytic
syngas conditioning reactors that will interface the TPDU with the bench-scale
synthesis unit. </P>
<P>NREL has signed confidentiality agreements with BASF and ICI-Katalco to test
their commercial methanol synthesis catalysts. Catalyst samples have been
obtained from BASF and United Catalysts Inc.; samples from ICI are forthcoming.</P>
<P>An extensive search of recent literature on higher alcohols synthesis
catalysts was conducted. This information will be used to make syngas to higher
alcohols catalysts at NREL for exploratory testing with biosyngas using the
bench unit.</P>

<P><B>Objective:</B> Develop a catalytic process that operates near
gasification temperatures, eliminates tar and methane, and shifts the
hydrogen:carbon monoxide ratio of biosyngas to make it suitable for methanol,
higher alcohols, or Fischer- Tropsch synthesis. </P>
<P><B>Approach/Background:</B> Biomass gasification produces primarily
hydrogen and carbon monoxide (syngas). Raw biosyngas must be purified and the
hydrogen:carbon monoxide ratio increased before it can be used. Impurities
include particulate matter, 1&#150;2 vol % of highly aromatic tar, methane, and
C2 hydrocarbons. Conventional technology uses water scrubbing to remove tar
followed by reheating to 750&#183;C to destroy methane by steam reforming.
Syngas conditioning removes tar and methane, and shifts the hydrogen:carbon
monoxide ratio at 700&#183;&#150;800&#183;C in one operation. Because syngas
conditioning operates near gasification temperature, significant energy is
saved. </P>
<P><B>Status/Accomplishments:</B> A baseline lifetime test with United
Catalysts Inc. (UCI) G90B nickel steam-reforming catalyst was performed using
model compound synthetic syngas with 50 vol % steam at 815&#183;C. The catalyst
remained active for 585 hours when the experiment was stopped.</P>
<P>A 24 full factorial experiment that varied temperature (750&#183;C and 800&#183;C),
steam content (30 and 40 vol %), nickel catalyst type (UCI G90B and
experimental), and with/without alumina bed is in progress. Less than 50% steam
was used to shorten the lifetime of the UCI G90B to test the effectiveness of
the alumina upstream catalyst. The results from a 22 subset of the above
experiment showed that when an alumina catalyst was used upstream of the
nickel-based steam-reforming catalyst, methane and tar were destroyed, the
hydrogen:carbon monoxide ratio was shifted from 0.6 to 2.5, and the lifetime of
the nickel catalyst was increased by 500%. The water-gas shift activity of the
alumina increases the hydrogen concentration of the syngas before it reaches the
nickel catalyst bed. This is thought to explain the improved lifetime. The
alumina bed is essentially inert to the hydrocarbons used in these experiments;
consequently, the alumina did not deactivate. </P>

<P><B>Objectives:</B> Identify contaminants (tar, light hydrocarbons, and
small quantities of nitrogen and sulfur compounds) in raw biosyngas. Determine
the effectiveness of catalytic conditioning.</P>

<LI> Microscale catalyst tests with model synthetic tar and syngas under
carefully controlled conditions
</LI>

</LI>
<LI> Analysis of condensed samples by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry
(GC/MS). The TMBMS can identify high molecular weight compounds not analyzed by
GC/MS.
</LI></UL>
<P><B>Status/Accomplishments:</B> The TMBMS was used to monitor raw and
filtered biosyngas from the Institute of Gas Technology (IGT) RenugasTM gasifier
in Chicago, Illinois. Hot-gas filtering using Westinghouse technology was also
monitored. Real-time quantitative concentration data on multiple chemical
species found in the gasifier, tar-cracker, and hot filtered product streams
were obtained. Tar produced by the IGT gasifier is principally tertiary in
nature, in contrast to tar from the Battelle Columbus Laboratory gasifier, which
is more secondary. The TMBMS data also provided real-time information that was
used to smooth operation of the IGT gasifier's feeder.</P>
<P>Tar samples were obtained from slip-stream tests of five catalysts similar
to DN34 using the Battelle Columbus Laboratory indirectly heated biomass
gasifier. GC/MS analysis at NREL found approximately 95 compounds in the tar, of
which 22 were quantified. All catalysts exhibited tar destruction activity.
GC/MS data from the 133-hour DN34 lifetime test samples indicated little
deactivation.</P>

<P><B>Objective:</B> Use the principles of pyrolysis and catalytic
deoxygenation to maximize the yield of hydrocarbon fuels from biomass.</P>
<P><B>Approach/Background:</B> The microactivity test (MAT) is a widely used
research tool for catalyst screening in the petroleum refining industry. It is
also an ASTM method. It has the advantage of allowing the collection of gaseous
and liquid products and achieving mass balances higher than 95%. Our approach
for screening catalysts, feedstocks, and operating conditions consists of rapid
prescreening on the molecular-beam mass spectrometer (MBMS) followed by
quantitative evaluation on the MAT unit.</P>
<P><B>Status/Accomplishments:</B> After successful completion of a MAT unit
customized for biomass, catalyst screening for upgrading biocrude vapors is in
progress. In the first phase of screening, several candidate catalysts,
identified from the MBMS prescreening, were evaluated. The catalysts were
compared under constant conditions of temperature and catalyst:biomass ratio.</P>
<P>We have identified two research catalysts that provided a significantly
higher extent of deoxygenation than the commercial ZSM-5, under similar test
conditions. These research catalysts showed about a 20%&#150;30% increase in the
yield of gaseous and liquid hydrocarbons. Upon severe steam treatment, however,
these catalysts lost significant deoxygenation activity. Once a catalyst with
acceptable activity and selectivity is developed, means to increase its
hydrothermal stability will be sought. </P>
<P>A commercial fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) catalyst was also evaluated on
the MAT to confirm and quantify previous results. The catalyst gave a poor
hydrocarbon yield and would likely need modifications or additives if biocrude
were to be cofed to a refinery FCC in significant portions.</P>
<P>Other catalyst formulations that are synthesized in-house will also be
evaluated. The results are then used by the Catalyst Synthesis Group for
designing improved catalysts.</P>

<P><B>Objective:</B> Provide improved deoxygenation catalysts and
understanding of the deoxygenation process that will lead to higher value fuel
products from biomass pyrolysis.</P>
<P><B>Approach/Background:</B> In previous work, NREL's molecular-beam mass
spectrometer (MBMS) was used to evaluate products from catalytic upgrading of
plastics, municipal solid waste (MSW), and lignocellulosic biomass feedstocks.
High yields of alkenes were produced by polyolefinic plastic, either pure or in
MSW. These alkenes can be used to produce ethers for use as fuel additives such
as methyl tertiary butyl ether. There is interest in exploring a wider range of
catalysts, feedstocks, and conditions to improve the production of the most
valuable fuel components from renewable feedstocks.</P>
<P><B>Status/Accomplishments:</B> About 30 metal-substituted zeolite catalysts
have been examined by the MBMS. These produced varying amounts of products when
used to upgrade biomass pyrolysis vapors. The relative amounts of alkanes,
alkenes, single ring aromatics, multiple ring aromatics, alkyl-substituted
aromatics, and oxides of carbon changed with the catalyst used. All these
hydrocarbons have potential use as fuels, and the more promising catalysts have
been identified for further testing on the microactivity test unit. Catalysts
that contain iron and cobalt gave higher overall yields of hydrocarbons than the
reference HZSM-5 under the conditions tested, and those that contain copper or
nickel, gave a more aromatic product slate. Many catalysts were much less active
for removing oxygen from wood pyrolysis vapors than HZSM-5.</P>
<P>Most of these catalysts were synthesized in-house by ion-exchange,
impregnation of organometallics, or surface modification of zeolites. New
catalysts were evaluated by ammonia thermogravimetric analysis and gas
chromatography analysis of reaction with model compounds and MBMS.</P>
<P>The workhorses of petroleum fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) are faujasite-Y
zeolites. An example of this type of catalyst was evaluated for its
effectiveness in upgrading wood pyrolysis vapors. Oxygen was only partially
removed under the conditions tested, casting doubt on the efficacy of co-feeding
raw biocrude to an FCC unit.</P>
<P>Hydrocarbon-rich feedstocks of various plant classes have been gathered. The
product slates and yields will be compared for these plants.</P>

<P><B>Objective:</B> Depolymerize lignin to low molecular weight aromatics,
then catalytically upgrade these cyclic compounds via hydrogenation, mild
hydrocracking, and alkylation.</P>
<P><B>Approach/Background:</B> Experience from earlier work with lignites has
shown that the latter can easily be converted into light liquid fuels via a
two-step procedure. The lignite is first subjected to a mild hydrotreatment,
followed by a base-catalyzed hydrolysis at high temperature. Work with lignin
required some modification of this process, but very promising fuel compounds
can be obtained.</P>
<P><B> Status/Accomplishments:</B> Numerous lignin feedstocks are subjected to
a hydrolytic depolymerization process that generates good yields of mixtures
composed of oxygenated aromatics with a high degree of ring alkylation. A new
class of heterogeneous catalysts was synthesized and shown to be very active
toward the hydrogenation of the aromatic compounds. A mixture of alkylated
cyclohexanes has been obtained in good yields.</P>

<P></P>
<P><B>Objective:</B> Convert the hemicellulose fraction of biomass into
furfurals, which are subsequently hydrogenated to form tetrahydrofurfuryl
alcohols (THFAs). The latter can be etherified to tetrahydrofurfuryl ethers
(THFEs). THFAs and THFEs are potentially useful as new oxygenates for fuels.</P>
<P><B>Approach/Background:</B> Hemicellulosic liquors are first converted into
furfurals (furfural and 5-hydroxyl methyl furfural) using acid catalysts. The
current commercial process for converting pentoses into furfural usually results
in low yields; therefore, new catalysts and catalytic systems are being
explored. The challenge is to minimize the formation of polymeric by-products
generated when furfural remains in contact with the acidic medium. The search
for methods to allow furfural to be rapidly separated from the acid catalyst is
receiving much attention. </P>
<P>The second step involves the search for efficient catalysts for
hydrogenating furfurals, with the goal of achieving quantitative conversion, and
to minimize hydrogenolysis of the newly formed THFAs. In parallel, alkylating
THFAs to THFEs is being studied under heterogeneous catalytic reaction condition
to obtain compounds with high octane numbers. The resulting substituted furan
rings comprise a new class of THFAs and THFEs with yet-unknown fuel properties.</P>
<P><B>Status/Accomplishments:</B> Using the NREL molecular beam mass
spectrometer, a new catalyst (which generates furfural very efficiently from
xylose at high temperature under dry conditions) was identified. This represents
an interesting variation on the currently used aqueous media that contain
sulfuric, hydrochloric, or phosphoric acid as catalyst. The nonaqueous reaction
conditions open new possibilities for processing saccharide-rich mixtures.
Because hemicellulose liquors cannot be dried to a solid material, the partial
or complete hydrolytic depolymerization of hemicellulose into its
monosaccharides will be attempted to obtain a crystallizable mixture.
Alternatively, because the acid catalyst is unstable in an aqueous medium, a
series of water- resistant catalysts (composed of organic and inorganic
moieties) is being designed that can be applied to aqueous hemicellulosic
liquors. </P>

<P><B>Objectives:</B> Continue to develop protective hardware to prevent
severe erosion at the entrance to the vortex reactor from tramp material in
realistic feedstocks. This includes developing hardware and methodology to
periodicaly purge this inert material from the reactor.  Produce significant
quantities of high-quality biocrude oils in relatively high yields for use in
other biocrude projects.
</P>
<P><B>Approach/Background:</B> Realistic biomass feedstocks can be expected to
have some amount of inert tramp material present (stones, dirt, etc.). This
material must be removed from the vortex reactor; otherwise, it will cause
severe erosion at the entrance to the reactor and upset the reactor fluid
dynamics. Our approach is to develop a hardened replaceable wear plate for the
reactor entrance to address the erosion and a diverter valve assembly that would
be able to periodically purge the system of inert solids. With these devices in
place, known amounts of tramp material will be introduced to the process while
it is at operating temperature. Wear and efficiency of inert solids recovery
will be measured to evaluate the designs.</P>
<P>The condensation train of the process will be modified to enable the rapid
collection and recycling of pyrolysis liquids to the quench zone of the venturi
scrubber instead of having to start up with water in the scrubber. This is
necessary to be able to produce a biocrude low in water.</P>
<P><B> Status/Accomplishments: </B>The condensation train has been modified.
The transfer lines from the various receiving vessels were completely replumbed,
and a gas recycle line and startup bypass line were added to the process flare
to enable the condensation train to remain cool during startup. This also
prevents the hot carrier gas from stripping volatiles from condensates when the
feed needs to be discontinued for any length of time. Additional cooling
capacity was also added to the venturi scrubber receiving vessel. These changes
have improved the rate at which condensates accumulate and how soon the
condensates can be recycled to the venturi throat.</P>
<P>Two pyrolysis experiments were conducted to produce biocrude oils. One used
a conventional baghouse filter to separate char fines from the oils, and the
other used a novel compact hot gas filter. Results will provide a comparison of
the two designs' ability to produce oils in relatively high yields and the char
separation efficiencies. Quantities of biocrude oils were also produced during
these experiments. The wear plate and diverter valve assembly were designed,
fabricated, and installed in the system, but have not yet been tested with
abrasive materials.</P>

<P><B>Objective:</B> To stabilize pyrolysis oils by reaction with methanol or
ethanol forming ethers, esters, and acetals.</P>
<P><B>Approach/Background:</B> Pyrolysis oil stabilization uses two
strategies:</P>
<OL>
<LI> Treatment with methanol or ethanol and catalytic amounts of sulfuric acid.
The reaction involves converting alcohols to ethers, carbonyls (aldehydes and
ketones) to acetals RC(OMe)2, and acids to esters. With the use of ethanol,
forming and removing the esters along with water/ethanol via azeotropic
distillation should be possible. This should leave an ether/acetal-enriched oil
and enhance water removal.
</LI>
<LI> Identical conversions as stated above with an additional conversion of the
acetal functionality to an ether. In the presence of acidic water, acetals can
be hydrolyzed back to the carbonyl. Therefore, using a known method, complete
conversion to an all ether oil via catalytic Pd/C should be feasible. The
reaction uses hydrogen, methanol, and Pd/C to form acetals from carbonyl groups,
then immediately transforms these to ethers.
</LI></OL>
<P><B>Status/Accomplishments:</B> The current approach tests the method on
commercial model compounds to obtain conversions and yields. It is then applied
the pyrolysis oil using identical conditions. The products are analyzed with gas
chromatography/mass spectroscopy and nuclear magnetic resonance. </P>
<P>For the first strategy, model compounds and pyrolysis oils were converted
with low to good yields. The structure of the pyrolysis products was determined
by comparison to the model compounds. The yields for the pyrolysis conversions
were low, presumably because the high molecular weight compounds did not react.</P>
<P>For the second strategy, neither mixtures of model compounds nor pyrolysis
oils were converted to the desired products. This failure can be attributed to
equipment failure at the desired temperature and pressure or incompatible
compounds in the pyrolysis mixtures.</P>

<P></P>
<P><B>Objective:</B> Thermochemically convert biomass via fast pyrolysis to
liquid biocrude fuels suitable for direct use in diesel engines, integration
into a petroleum refinery, or a stand-alone or satellite fuel plant. This
involves pyrolyzing biomass to oxygenated organic vapors, which can be condensed
to form a high yield of an acidic fuel oil having very low sulfur and ash.</P>
<P><B>Approach/Background:</B> The oxygenated organic vapors are being
upgraded by removing oxygen to form a hydrocarbon product slate. A riser reactor
and catalyst regenerator, with a commercially available zeolite catalysts, is
being uniquely close-coupled to the NREL 0.5 TPD, vortex pyrolysis reactor.
Alkali poisoning of the zeolite catalyst is prevented by hot-gas filtering to
remove the alkali-containing char from the process vapors prior to the catalytic
riser. A series of statistically designed experiments will map out the product
yields for the key process variables to determine the quantity and range of
products available. These data will be used as input to process technoeconomic
studies to determine the viability of this approach.</P>
<P>By participating in the IEA pyrolysis activity, we are developing
specifications for biocrude oil, including test methods and allowable values. An
international round-robin test series is being planned to validate the test
methods and specifications. The better grades of biocrude oils are expected to
require the high quality of biocrude made with NREL technologies and know-how,
such as hot-gas filtering. </P>
<P><B>Status/Accomplishments:</B> A series of experiments before the
renovation demonstrated that the char fines could be very effectively removed by
hot-gas filtration, but that there was a loss in biocrude yield to form gases in
the hot-gas filter. The clean biocrude met the ash specifications of even ASTM
#1 fuel oils. It also met the viscosity requirements of #4 fuel oil when new,
but not after aging. Additives have been found that dramatically decrease the
aging rate; this allows it to be stored for extended periods and still meet the
viscosity specifications and to be heated before being atomized and combusted,
e.g., in diesel engines.</P>

<P><B>Objectives: </B>Modify biomass pyrolysis oils to improve their
properties for cofeeding with heavyand light cycle oils in a fluid catalytic
cracking (FCC) unit .  Determine the minimum degree of upgrading (partial
hydrodeoxygenation, catalytic derivatization, and minimal deoxygenation) that
will permit biocrude to be used in minimally altered diesel engines used in the
transportation sector.
</P>
<P><B>Approach/Background:</B> Straight biomass pyrolysis oils (noncatalytic
and without hot gas filtering) are unstable, acidic, corrosive, viscous, and
have high water and ash contents. These oils do not lend themselves readily to
processing and upgrading in conventional petrochemical processes.</P>
<P>Using NREL's bench-scale fluidized bed reactor, which contains HZSM-5 and
modified zeolite catalysts, biomass feedstocks are catalytically pyrolyzed to
produce partially deoxygenated biocrude oils. In this approach, the pyrolysis
and catalysis are carried out simultaneously, reducing coke yield and partially
deoxygenating the pyrolysis products. The partially deoxygenated products can
either be catalytically derivatized to methyl aryl ethers or co-fed with
heavy-cycle oils to FCC units to produce oxygenated transportation fuels.</P>
<P><B>Status/Accomplishments:</B> Gram quantities of biocrude oils were
produced from HZSM-5 catalyzed pyrolysis of biomass. The oils were partially
deoxygenated and were miscible with heavy-cycle oils, but were immiscible with
light-cycle oils. Catalyst coking was less than that for post-pyrolysis
catalysis process. </P>
<P>Modified zeolite catalysts are being prepared for evaluation. They are
expected to improve on the partial deoxygenation of the biocrude oils.
Sulfate-impregnated g-alumina catalysts are also being prepared for the vapor
phase alkylation of the phenolics with methanol to produce methyl aryl ethers.</P>

<P><B>Objectives:</B> Determine the effects of storage on switchgrass
composition. Determine the effects of plant structure on drying rates.

<P><B>Approach/Background:</B> This subcontract is the last phase of a
three-phase study to determine storage and handling impacts on feedstock
quality. The first phase used several harvesting methods, the second focused on
sources of variation in feedstock quality, and this phase will provide climatic
information and supplemental handling data. 
</P>
<P><B>Status/Accomplishments:</B> The final report was accepted in June 1995.
The findings show that stem thickness significantly affect drying rates unless
the stems are conditioned. No significant differences were observed for the
outside storage methods. The average weathered layer observed in the bales
reached its maximum thickness of 18 cm within 4 months, and average dry matter
loss was about 3.7% after 12 months. Storage treatments had no affect on acid
and nondetergent fiber content.

<P><B>Objectives:</B> Evaluate rapid analysis methods for use in determining
biomass feedstock quality for conversion to liquid fuels by thermochemical and
biochemical procedures.  Develop accepted reproducible feedstock quality
measurement methods. Develop National Institute of Science and Technology
(NIST)-certified biomass materials.
</P>
<P><B>Approach/Background:</B> Any industry must have methodologies and
standard materials as baselines for comparing new methods and procedures.
Standard practices and materials are also necessary to transfer a technology.
</P>
<P>Rapid analysis techniques have near- and long-term applications. In the near
term, they can replace the expensive, time-consuming laboratory analysis
currently used to determine feedstock characteristics. In the long term, they
can help determine feedstock value, so a feedstock vendor can be credited
immediately for delivery. They can also monitor or control the quality of the
feedstock going into a conversion reactor.
</P>
<P><B>Status/Accomplishments:</B> Three rapid-analysis methods for quantifying
the structural components in biomass are promising: 
</P>
<UL>
<LI> Molecular beam mass spectroscopy, a very reliable analytical method at the
laboratory level, is currently used as a rapid analysis technique at NREL
</LI>
<LI> Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, coupled with partial least
squares analysis, is used in the pulp and paper industry, and early results
indicate that for woody biomass this system may work very well
</LI>
<LI> Near infrared (NIR) spectroscopy is used by the forage industry to measure
forage quality. Preliminary work with subcontractors indicates that this system
can work well with a wide variety of feedstocks. 
</LI></UL>
<P>The FTIR and NIR are scheduled for more rigorous evaluation.
</P>
<P>Four biomass feedstocks (a hardwood, a softwood, sugar cane bagasse, and
wheat straw) were established as standards and can be obtained from NIST. The
task is initiating the certification of a switchgrass NIST material.

<P><B>Objective:</B> Facilitate effective communications between the Biofuels
Program and external biomass stakeholders and customers.
</P>
<P><B>Approach/Background:</B> The Terrestrial Biomass Interface (TBFI)
project has aggressively developed working relationships with farmer and
forestry professional and industrial organizations that represent potential
biomass feedstock producers. Our participation with these organizations on
issues of common concern has increased awareness of the Biofuels Program goals
and objectives in the agricultural and forestry sectors. Awareness of the
technical progress has been maintained through publications and presentations of
research in scientific forums. 
</P>
<P>To obtain greater input from the private sector into the activities of the
TBFI project, a guidance committee was formed in May 1995. The committee
developed a charter and will meet biannually to provide input into research
quality and direction.
</P>
<P><B>Status/Accomplishments:</B> Invited presentations and articles for
farmer and forestry organizations have increased over the past year (National
Association of Conservation Districts, New Uses Council, American Alfalfa
Producers, California Urban Wood Waste Association, American Society of
Agricultural Engineers, American Society of Agronomy, Resource, Top Producers).
Invited to testify before the House of Representatives Subcommittee on
Conservation and Forestry. Organized an external guidance committee consisting
of representatives from private industry and academia.

<P><B>Objective:</B> Determine the impacts of proposed storage methods on
eucalyptus for the biomass-to-ethanol and thermochemical fuels research.
</P>
<P><B>Approach/Background:</B> Because biomass production is seasonal and
regional, there will be a need to store feedstocks for a certain length of time.
The length of storage will be affected by the size of the conversion facility,
its location, the number of feedstocks it will use, and the production
characteristics of the feedstocks. During storage, various feedstock may undergo
mass and compositional changes that affect the yield of the fuel produced. These
changes, as a function of season, harvest method, and storage time, are being
quantitatively assessed. Samples from these tests are being submitted to NREL
for analysis, and to test the pretreatability and suitability of the substrates
for conversion to ethanol or thermochemical- derived fuels.

<P><B>Objective:</B> Determine the importance of various sources of plant
variability (genetic, environmental, physiological, and storage) on the
composition of biomass feedstocks.
</P>
<P><B>Approach/Background:</B> We studied compositional variability in biomass
feedstocks relevant to the biofuels program. In addition to measuring the
compositions of different species, this work also assessed the compositional
differences between clones and varieties of the same species, as well as
compositional variation caused by the conditions and climate under which the
biomass was grown, harvested, and stored. The goal of this work was to obtain
summative analyses. Data will be correlated with data from biochemical and
thermochemical conversion processes and used to generate models that predict the
effects of external parameters, such as growth and storage conditions, on
biomass quality. This will improve our ability to quantitatively assess the cost
of feedstock production, and lead to more accurate assessments of the overall
cost of biofuels production.
</P>
<P><B>Status/Accomplishments:</B> Compositional data have been collected on
four woody and six herbaceous species, four of which were harvested at different
times. These feedstocks were also part of a storage experiment that has
generated data on the change in composition of feedstocks subjected to
unprotected storage for 26 to 52 weeks. Identified losses from the stored
feedstocks were quite small, particularly for the structural components. The
largest change observed across all species was loss of extractable materials
(often more than 50%). This is an important issue in using these feedstocks for
producing ethanol, particularly for herbaceous feedstocks where the extractives
can contain a large fraction of fermentable nonstructural carbohydrate. All
hardwoods were quite similar in composition, and changes in composition were
small. In contrast, the compositions of herbaceous feedstocks varied
substantially between harvests and species, and the effects of storage on
composition were generally larger and more species dependent. 
</P>
<P>Descriptive modeling was used to obtain a global view of the total biomass
database and to summarize the multivariable information collected. Predictive
modeling was used to demonstrate how the various measurements may be used to
predict the yields of fuels obtained from thermochemical and biochemical
conversion of the feedstocks.

<P><B>Objective:</B> Facilitate the interface between DOE-sponsored biomass
feedstock development and conversion research efforts.
</P>
<P><B>Approach/Background:</B> A biomass feedstock supply service was
developed to provide NREL conversion research efforts with well-defined biomass
feedstocks. A network of reliable feedstock producers and suppliers was
established to obtain samples of feedstock materials ranging in size from 1 kg
to 300 tons. Information on the samples is maintained by the project leader. Dry
and freezer-storage facilities were developed over the past 2 years and continue
to expand as NREL research efforts expand and change.
</P>
<P>Activities to improve the working relationship with the Biofuels Feedstock
Development Program at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) were outlined and
initiated. By facilitating collaboration between the Biofuels Program at NREL
and the Biofuels Feedstock Development Program at ORNL, overall research efforts
of both programs will be improved. Developing formalized communications,
collaboration on programmatic issues, and joint research efforts are being used
to promote a coordinated research effort.
</P>
<P><B>Status/Accomplishments:</B> The major users of the biomass feedstock
supplying service have been the Alternate Pretreatment Subcontractors, NREL
Chemical Analysis Testing Task, PDU vendor testing, various NREL thermochemical
research efforts, and NREL pretreatment and fermentation researchers.
Approximately 400 tons of biomass feedstocks were purchased and processed this
year. Seven tons of switchgrass, 6 tons of corn stover, 5 tons of aspen, 2 tons
of hybrid poplar, and 1 ton of paper have been obtained for research activities.
</P>
<P>During FY 1993, the Terrestrial Biomass Feedstock Interface (TBFI) project
and the Biofuels Feedstock Development Program have had representatives at their
respective external reviews. This has given each group the opportunity to
provide input to the other's operational and long-range planning efforts. Both
have been involved in developing the DOE Biofuels Systems Division strategic
planning efforts. Technical interactions include completion of a TBFI project
subcontract on sycamore storage by ORNL, presentations by both at the other's
reviews and workshops, having the same contact at the DOE Biofuels Systems
Division level, and developing a feedstock production modeling subcontract for
FY 1994.

<P><B>Objective:</B> Determine the importance of various sources of plant
variability (genetic, environmental, physiological, and storage) on the
thermochemical conversion of biomass feedstocks into fuel precursors.
</P>
<P><B>Approach/Background:</B> Study the variability in biomass feedstocks
using rapid pyrolysis. This is performed on two scales. At an analytical scale
using pyrolysis/mass spectrometry (Py/MS), large numbers of biomass samples can
be screened in a short time. Multivariate analysis of the mass spectrometric
data is then used to categorize the samples based on the chemical makeup of the
pyrolysis products. Selected samples can then be pyrolyzed on a preparative
scale in a fluidized-bed reactor, so enough product can be collected for
chemical characterization to distinguish differences in the feedstocks based on
their pyrolysis products. 
</P>
<P>A complementary effort is the development of rapid analysis techniques based
on data-rich spectroscopic measurements, such as Py/MS, coupled with data
reduction techniques such as multivariate analysis. In addition, standard
materials and analytical methods for biomass are being established.
</P>
<P><B>Status/Accomplishments:</B> Samples from the feedstock storage study,
including four woody and six herbaceous species, four of which were harvested at
different times, have been examined using Py/MS coupled with multivariate
analysis. Selected feedstocks were also pyrolyzed in the fluidized bed reactor.
Chemical characterization of the oils showed that pyrolysis on the bench scale
was very reproducible. Feedstock pyrolysis on both scales agreed that there were
significant differences in the oils and chars produced from different species.
However, there appeared to be little difference between the oils and chars from
fresh and stored samples, when the stored material came from the major fraction
of the stored biomass which had degraded to a limited extent. Analytical
pyrolysis identified small fractions of more degraded material that did behave
differently when pyrolyzed.
</P>
<P>Two rapid-analysis methods have shown promise for quantifying the structural
components in biomass. One is based on the analytical pyrolysis method used in
screening samples in the feedstock storage study. The other uses Fourier
transform infrared spectroscopy coupled with partial least squares analysis.
Four biomass feedstocks (a hardwood, a softwood, sugar cane bagasse, and wheat
straw) were established as standards and can be obtained from the National
Institute of Science and Technology.

</P>
<P><B>Status/Accomplishments: </B>The results of this work indicate that
losses of biomass during baling are about 1%&#150;5%, depending on moisture; dry
switchgrass has greater losses. There were no significant differences between
outside storage treatments for the variables of weathered layer thickness and
dry matter loss. Analysis of rain runoff from the bales indicated it does not
differ from rain runoff obtained from pasture land. NIRS was used as a rapid
analysis technique, and produced mixed results. The accuracy of NIR composition
predictions may be increased by developing separate curves for hardwoods and
grasses.

information and supplemental handling data. 
</P>
<P><B>Status/Accomplishments:</B> The study was completed in March 1995, and
pointed out how important equipment costs are to the production cost of biomass
crops. By maximizing equipment use, cost can be reduced approximately 40%. Other

matter loss and switchgrass quality.
</P>
<P>The amount of weathering that occurred in a bale was not affected by
wrapping material (string or net), and had reached maximum depth within the
first 4 months. However, string-wrapped bales lost significantly more dry
matter. Bales made with more than 22% moisture or wrapped with string had
significant changes in composition based on acid detergent fiber and
nondetergent fiber.

<P><B>Objective:</B> Determine the effects of proposed storage methods on
sorghum for biomass-to-ethanol re search.
</P>
<P><B>Approach/Background:</B> Sorghum produces more carbohydrates and biomass
per unit area of land than most crops. However, because of its short harvest
time and high moisture and sugar content, it is stored as silage. Silage has
several drawbacks as a storage method: anaerobic conditions need to be
maintained; more than 70% of the weight is water; effluent disposal is a
problem; and carbohydrates are lost. 
</P>
<P>To make sorghum a more attractive carbohydrate and biomass feedstock for
conversion to ethanol, alternative harvesting, handling, processing, and storage
systems need to be developed. An experiment designed to analyze the feasibility
of dry storage of sorghum and to minimize sugar loss will provide some answers
to the future feasibility of sorghum as an energy crop.
</P>
<P><B>Status/Accomplishments:</B> Sorghum has been harvested using two
methods: as piles of stocks and as bales of &quot;press cake.&quot; Sorghum and
sorghum extract samples were sent to NREL for analysis. Weather and storage
environment variables are being measured and analyzed.

<P><B>Objective:</B> Ensure timely analysis and interpretation of the changing
attitudes to biomass power and biofuels development from an environmental
perspective.
</P>
<P><B>Approach/Background:</B> The overall thrust of integrated bioenergy
systems has been viewed as a positive step for the environment, but there are
still concerns about wildlife habitat and biodiversity impacts. These are now
accepted as central to the debate about biomass energy development. A
subcontract was placed with the Audubon Society to identify and outline
potential points of conflict with the environmental community, and propose
solutions.

<P><B>Objective:</B> Produce a feedstock production model that will supply
direct input into liquid fuels process models developed by the Biofuels Program.
</P>
<P><B>Approach/Background:</B> NREL process engineers have developed process
spreadsheet models for producing ethanol from lignocellulosic feedstocks. These
models require certain inputs and assumptions about the feedstock material going
into the ethanol facility. Currently, many assumptions are educated guesses. To
better understand the interactions between the feedstock variables with the
conversion variables, we must create a model that includes all aspects of
feedstock delivery and conversion.
</P>
<P><B>Status/Accomplishments:</B> Tasks 1 through 3 are complete. Literature
resources were obtained and feedstock production and handling strategies
outlined. The remaining two tasks actually produce and test the model. An alpha
version of the model has been tested and evaluated. The beta version is under
development.

<P><B>Objectives:</B> Provide a reliable resource of feedstock materials for
Biofuels Program-sponsored research. Facilitate the interface between
DOE-sponsored biomass feedstock development and conversion research efforts.
</P>
<P><B>Approach/Background:</B> A biomass feedstock supply service was
developed to provide NREL conversion research efforts with well-defined biomass
feedstocks. A network of reliable feedstock producers and suppliers was
established to obtain samples of feedstock materials ranging in size from 1 kg
to 2,000 tons. Information on the samples is maintained by the project leader.
Dry and freezer-storage facilities have been developed during the past 4 years
and continue to expand as NREL research efforts expand and change. Activities to
facilitate the Biofuels Program's working relationship with the Biofuels
Feedstock Development Program at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) were
outlined and initiated. 
</P>
<P><B>Status/Accomplishments:</B> The major users of the biomass feedstock
supplying service have been the Alternate Pretreatment Subcontractors, NREL
Chemical Analysis Testing Task, PDU vendor testing, various NREL thermochemical
research efforts, and NREL pretreatment and fermentation researchers. 
</P>
<P>During FY 1995, the Terrestrial Biomass Feedstock Interface (TBFI) project
and the Biofuels Feedstock Development Program had representatives at their
respective external reviews. This has given each group the opportunity to
provide input to the other's operational and long-range planning efforts. Both
have been involved in developing the DOE Biofuels Systems Division strategic
planning efforts. Technical interactions include completing a TBFI project
subcontract on sycamore storage by ORNL, presentations by both at the other's
reviews and workshops, having the same contact at the DOE Biofuels Systems
Division level, and developing a feedstock production modeling subcontract.

<P><B>Objectives:</B> Provide a resource assessment (distribution,
availability, and cost) for near-term biomass feedstocks identified by Biofuels
Program leaders. Work on developing a biomass database.
</P>
<P><B>Approach/Background:</B> Develop a list of waste resources in
conjunction with Biofuels Program managers and scientists. Prioritize the list
based on near-term analytic needs of biofuels programs. Collect, evaluate, and
summarize resource assessment information about wastes quantities, qualities,
and values. Develop waste resource estimates for paper and pulp mills, crop
residues, and mixed waste. Construct a database of waste resources to determine
favorable locations for near-term biofuel facilities. Identify information to
help strategic planning and CRADA partners develop biofuels. Develop projections
for future waste avail ability given competition within the energy markets and
other markets for waste resources. Provide a report or a series of issue papers
that describe opportunities for near-term biofuels development. 
</P>
<P><B>Status/Accomplishments: </B>Developed a selected list of feedstocks by
meeting with program leaders. Began constructing a biomass database in
conjunction with the Resource Assessment Program's Biomass Resource Assessment
Task and ORNL. This database can be accessed through the Resource Assessment
home page. Presented program design and status to DOE/EE sector offices and the
Regional Biomass Energy Program. Made contacts at a number of organizations for
data collection and review. Developed draft report on supplies of paper and pulp
mill residues; awaiting comments. Solicited comments on strategic plan for this
project from program leaders.

<P><B>Objectives:</B> Determine the effects of storage on switchgrass
composition.  Produce some necessary data to construct an empirical model that
will provide information on feedstock quality.
</P>
<P><B>Approach/Background:</B> This task provides empirical data to be used in
developing a model that will help researchers, process engineers, and decision
makers understand how biomass feedstock quality and composition changes under
various handling strategies. Previous research has provided data on com position
variability caused by genetics, cultural techniques, comminution, and storage.
The work just completed looked at compositional differences between clones and
varieties of the same species, and at compositional variation caused by the
conditions and climate under which the biomass was grown, harvested, and stored.
Work for the upcoming year is centered around samples from a sophisticated
storage and handling experiment for switchgrass. The samples have been stored in
a freezer and will be analyzed using rapid analysis techniques.
</P>
<P><B>Status/Accomplishments:</B> Compositional data were collected on two
major experiments (feedstock storage and plant variability). These data, along
with environmental and thermochemical data, were put into a database. Samples
have been collected from a large switchgrass storage and handling experiment.
Data on pretreatment and simultaneous saccharification and fermentation
responses to various feedstock compositions are currently being obtained through
a subcontract with Tennessee Valley Authority. Descriptive modeling was used to
obtain a global view of the current biomass database. Predictive modeling was
used to demonstrate how the various measurements may be used to predict the
yields of fuels obtained from thermochemical and biochemical conversion of the
feedstocks.

<P><B>Objective:</B> Provide technical support to project cooperators (DOE,
Electric Power Research Institute, National Renewable Energy Laboratory,
industry, and research institutions) so they can determine the technical,
environmental, and economic viability of tree and grass crops as dedicated
feedstock supply systems (DFSS) for producing liquid fuels and electric power.
</P>
<P><B>Approach/Background:</B> Because of the strong feedstock component
inherent in the solicitation entitled &quot;Economic Development through Biomass
Systems Integration,&quot; BFDP was asked to provide expert advice and
consultation. BFDP's involvement began with review of responses to the proposal
and progressed to attendance at meetings and numerous phone conversations with
sponsoring organizations and cooperators who were awarded contracts.
</P>
<P><B>Status/Accomplishments:</B> Parameters were developed that fostered an
understanding of how potential users of energy crops were expected to evaluate
DFSS. Economic analyses of costs of producing, managing, and monitoring
production systems, and feedstock integration into local and regional
landscapes, were considered essential. These parameters also ensured feedstock
costs and feedstock availability were evaluated in a standard manner. By
providing the expertise of an agricultural economist familiar with the
development of supply curves for DFSS and knowledgeable about the difficulty and
necessity of developing markets for feedstocks ensured consistent assessment
tailored to each region or location. In addition, cooperators in each project
were strongly advised to adhere to the guidelines set by the National Biofuels
Roundtable when considering environmental effects from dedicated feedstock
production systems.

<P><B>Objectives:</B> Sample soils to characterize baseline physical and
chemical properties of the plantation sites. Permanently reference the sampling
points to allow later resampling to determine crop-induced changes in soil
characteristics. Calculate water-holding capacity of the upper 5 feet of soil
based on particle size distribution and organic matter content using relations
developed from similar soils throughout Minnesota. Rank the sites in terms of
anticipated productivity-based parameters such as available water-holding
capacity, organic matter, and total nitrogen.
</P>
<P><B>Approach/Background:</B> Because of widespread interest in the role tree
plantations may play in sequestering atmospheric carbon, we must establish
reliable baseline data to assess long-term changes in soil carbon and other
chemical characteristics that result from converting agricultural land to hybrid
poplar. We must also begin to develop reliable recommendations for selecting
future planting sites based on soils data. This project samples recently planted
hybrid poplar plantations and establishes permanent tree growth and soil
sampling plots to remeasure changes at the micro-site level. Particular
attention is given to quantifying the carbon content of surface soils.
</P>
<P>Data gathered as part of this project will be integrated with similar data
from other hybrid poplar plantations in Minnesota and Wisconsin to form a
regionwide database from which to develop soil- and climate- based growth
models. 
</P>
<P><B>Status/Accomplishments:</B> All 13 sites planted in 1994 were visited to
assess plantation condition and develop a detailed sampling plan for each site.
Tree growth on several sites was considered too variable to provide adequate
long-term yield information. Differences in tree growth are confounded with
differences in weed control that limit our ability to assess the response of
trees to soil and site characteristics. The list of sites to be included in the
sampling was modified. Sites to be measured now include a combination of sites
planted in 1994 and 1995 in the Alexandria area and four plantations in central
and northwestern Minnesota. The Alexandria project sites to be sampled now
include the Dittes, Sonstegard, Kreyer, Rogeske, Eskelson, Gimble, Durst, and
Stroot plantations. The remaining four plantations are located in central
Minnesota (1) and northwestern Minnesota (3). Soil sampling on these sites will
begin in November.

<P><B>Objectives:</B> Maintain and expand cutting orchards to propagate
genetically improved willow clones in nurseries for future scale-up. Continue to
develop strategies to establish hybrid willow bioenergy farms in the
northeastern United States.
</P>
<P><B>Approach/Background:</B> The first objective will be met by maintaining
an intensive field management program in willow cutting orchards established
during 1993, including fertilization, weed control (if necessary), and
irrigation (where possible). A willow cutting orchard was established during
1995 in cooperation with the New York State Energy Research and Development
Authority and the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation
(NYDEC) at the NYDEC Saratoga Tree Nursery, Saratoga, NY. The second objective
will be met by hosting and attending meetings with experts on renewable energy
from local, regional, and national organizations to form a consensus on how
dedicated willow plantations fit into the overall energy supply of the
northeastern United States.
</P>
<P><B>Status/Accomplishments:</B> Nursery stool beds at Orono, Ontario, and
Syracuse, NY, grew vigorously during 1995. Growth in the Tully, NY, cutting
orchard was not as good as anticipated because of the exceptionally dry 1995
growing season. The projected cutting yield during 1995 is conservatively
estimated at 10,000 cuttings from each of 15 willow clones. A willow cutting
orchard with an overhead irrigation system was planted with 15 willow clones in
the NYDEC Saratoga tree nursery at Saratoga, NY, during 1995. Initial growth and
survival appeared good. The clone-site trials planted during 1993 at Massena,
and Tully, NY, were not harvested for cuttings during Winter 1994&#150;1995
because enough cuttings were available from other sources.
</P>
<P>We continued to develop strategies for establishing hybrid willow farms in
the northeastern United States. Funding was approved from USDA CREES for
extension activities and a 60&#150;100-acre willow demonstration farm. A
proposal submitted to the DOE/USDA Biomass Power for Rural Development program
was favorably reviewed, and the negotiation process is expected to begin soon.
Local utility companies increased their involvement in the SUNY ESF willow
biomass program by funding field trials and a full-time researcher and helping
to develop commercialization strategies. The Salix Consortium increased its
membership to include utility companies from Pennsylvania, Vermont, and Ontario
(Canada), Resource Conservation and Development projects, other universities,
state and federal organizations, and a farm group.

<P><B>Objectives:</B> Determine the degree of genetic variability in and
limits of drought tolerance in poplar (<I>Populus</I>) clones. Characterize the
biochemical and molecular bases of drought tolerance in a poplar pedigree.
Develop biochemical and molecular screening procedures.
</P>
<P><B>Approach/Background:</B> After establishing a Cooperative Research and
Development Agreement with ORNL, Boise Cascade Corporation established a drought
stress facility at Boardman, OR, with the University of Washington <I>Populus
trichocarpa x deltoides</I> segregating F2 pedigree used to generate a molecular
map of the poplar genome. Water was turned off every other day in one of the
four replicate blocks to institute water stress. A survey of osmotic potential
at full turgor (&ETH;o) was conducted on well-watered and droughted trees. Some
plant species, and some individuals within a plant species, can tolerate
increasing stress associated with reduced moisture by accumulating solutes. The
biochemical matrix of such metabolites varies among species and individuals. The
study assesses drought stress under field conditions and characterizes changes
in osmotic constitution among operational clones across three moisture levels,
and experimental (segregating F2 pedigree) clones under two irrigation regimes.
</P>
<P><B>Status/Accomplishments:</B> The survey of osmotic potential at full
turgor (&ETH;o) of the F2 pedigree demonstrated tremendous variability among the
full-sib progeny with &ETH;o ranging from a high of -1.38 MPa (least tolerant)
for clone 331-1120 to a low of -2.35 MPa (most tolerant) for clone 331-1087
under well-watered conditions. Under dry conditions, &ETH;o ranged from a high
of -1.40 MPa for clone 331-1120 to a low of -2.15 MPa for clone 331-1075,
because of a 0.30 MPa adjustment. Having low &ETH;o under wet conditions was
advantageous at this site, with clones that had &ETH;o of &lt;-1.90 MPa under
wet or dry conditions generally displaying greater productivity than those with
&ETH;o that was &gt;-1.70 MPa. Of the eight clones that displayed statistically
significant adjustments of 0.16&#150;0.35 MPa, all were medium- to fast-growing.
Except for clone 331-1075, all clones that displayed osmotic adjustment to water
stress did so from high &ETH;o under well-watered conditions. Genetic linkage
mapping indicated several quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for &ETH;o, including
one on each of linkage groups O, M, and P, with each accounting for about 20% of
the phenotypic variation in &ETH;o under wet conditions. The same QTLs on M and
P were recapitulated for &ETH;o under dry conditions and an additional QTL on
linkage group A was found, with the three markers explaining 98.7% of the
phenotypic variation in &ETH;o. Additionally, a QTL for osmotic adjustment was
found on linkage group D, with overdominance indicated. When analyses of
metabolites constituting &ETH;o are complete, the maintenance and accumulation
of key stress solutes will also be mapped. The first-year results are promising
and suggest that biochemical and molecular markers for drought tolerance in
poplar will be identified.

<P><B>Objectives:</B> Evaluate the suitability of short-rotation hybrid poplar
plantations for breeding birds and small
</P>
<P>mammals. Assess the effects of plantation size and shape on breeding birds
within and adjacent to plantations. Conduct a similar survey on nearby land for
comparision.
</P>
<P><B>Approach/Background:</B> Because birds and small mammals differ in their
mobility and relationship to vegetation structure, these studies provide broader
insight into the quality of habitat provided by woody crop plantings than study
of one taxon alone. Breeding bird surveys were conducted on research-scale
plantings in Minnesota, North Dakota, and Wisconsin from 1992 to 1994 to compare
community and species composition between plantings, agricultural row crops,
pastures/haylands, and wildlands. Studies were expanded in 1994 and 1995 to
include large-scale plantings of 50 to 300 acres of hybrid poplar. Small mammals
were monitored on some of these plantings. Results from these studies can
provide comparisons of scale to address whether small-scale plantings can
accurately predict the effects on birds and small mammals of extensively
converting agricultural and CRP lands to biomass crop production.
</P>
<P><B>Status/Accomplishments:</B> Studies to date have shown considerable
variation in the density and species composition of birds and mammals that
inhabit plantations. These differences are consequences of the variations in
size, intensity of management, and landscape context of the various plantings.
The numbers of individuals and species of birds found in hybrid poplar plantings
were greater than in traditional row crop setting but less than in wildland
forest and shrub habitats. The structural characteristics of the individual
plantings and their location within the landscape also influenced the
composition of bird communities and were more important indicators of community
composition than changes in age (over 3 years) of the plantings. Small mammal
communities on hybrid poplar plantings differed markedly from those in wooded
and nonwooded wildland habitats, with the greatest differences between the
plantings and wooded habitats. Distribution of species that inhabit hybrid
poplar plantings indicates substantial interchange with adjacent grassland
habitat but not with forest habitats. The abundance of small mammals on
plantings also reflects the heterogeneity of the individual plantings. These
results to date reflect the importance of landscape-level interactions between
hybrid poplar plantings and the landscape and point to the need to further
address how these woody crops can be best located within the landscape to
increase habitat for bird and small mammal species.

<P><B>Objective:</B> Investigate the habitat value to migratory birds of
research and large-scale biomass plantings of hybrid poplars and switchgrass.
</P>
<P><B>Approach/Background:</B> Bird populations in hybrid poplar plantings in
eastern Ontario, Oregon, and Washington, and switchgrass plantings in Iowa have
been surveyed in the Spring during breeding season and during Fall migration to
determine the use of these plantings compared with natural forests and
grasslands.
</P>
<P><B>Status/Accomplishments:</B> The hybrid poplar plantings support
substantial bird populations during the breeding season. Species composition,
however, differed substantially with plantation age. Younger plantations
supported mostly edge and old-field species such as song sparrows, common
yellowthroats, yellow warblers, and American goldfinches, which were common in
the Ontario and western U.S. plantings. The older stands surveyed supported
significant numbers of forest-interior birds, including several species of
flycatchers, thrushes, vireos, and warblers. The edge and old-field species
tended to be absent from the interiors of the older plantations, but sometimes
persisted on the plantation edges and in brushy habitat inclusions. The presence
of forest-interior birds in these small plantings tended to be strongly
influenced by landscape context. Older plantings that abutted natural woodlands
had more forest-interior birds than those in more agricultural settings. Species
diversity was augmented by complementary habitat inclusions that provided
nesting habitat for several species that fed in the poplars. Densities in the
poplar plantings peaked before canopy closure, when structural diversity and
plant species diversity was highest. The same plantings supported far fewer
birds in the Fall than nearby natural deciduous woodlands. In the Fall, most
birds were not territorial and tended to congregate in the most attractive
habitat patches.
</P>
<P>Switchgrass plantings in Iowa provided significant habitat for several
prairie specialist birds, most notably the sedge wren, dickcissel, and
grasshopper sparrow. Bird use timing of these switchgrass plantings reflected
the later seasonal growth patterns of this warm-season grass, and use by some
species was influenced in two of the sampling periods by heavy rainfall and
flooding.
</P>
<P>Poplar and switchgrass plantings provided better breeding season habitat for
native birds than did agricultural crops, but not as good as natural forest or
prairie.

<P><B>Objectives:</B> Analyze the sensitivity of the Agricultural Non-Point
Source pollution model (AGNPS) to changes in scales of data inputs and changes
in grid size. Model the impact on surface water quality when biomass is
introduced into the landscape.
</P>
<P><B>Approach/Background:</B> The preparation of data sets for use with AGNPS
has included gathering information on soils (series and association units), land
uses (field surveys, TM, and USGS LUDA), and DEMs (1:24,000 and 1:250,000).
These data sets are being managed with the Geographical Analysis and Support
System (GRASS) 4.1 GIS. Three watersheds (325, 6,239, and 11,294 ha) near West
Lafayette, IN, were selected and proportioned at 100- and 200-m cell
resolutions. Rainfall amounts and energy intensities, which are representative
of 1-, 2-, 5-, 10-, 25-, 50-, and 100-year return period storms of 2- and 6-hour
durations, were also calculated.
</P>
<P>All possible permutations of these data inputs were defined for three
variations on the land use data. These included Phase I: Current Conditions;
Phase II: Economic Biomass (placed more frequently on soils on which it is most
productive); and Phase III: Water Quality Biomass (distributing biomass in the
watershed as buffers around bodies of surface water). This resulted in the
establishment of 2,352 model simulations to be completed. This was later reduced
to 2,016, as a result of the model's inability to process the largest watershed
at the finer resolution.
</P>
<P><B>Status/Accomplishments:</B> We focused on preparing data inputs during
1994. In addition to previously mentioned data sets, inputs for other parameters
required by the AGNPS-GRASS interface were developed. These include watershed
boundaries, flow routing networks, soil textures and other properties,
management practices, nutrient inputs, USLE C factors, and tillage passes.
</P>
<P>In 1995, modeling efforts for Phases I and II were completed. Phase III is
in progress. Results analysis is partially completed, and results are still
preliminary.

<P><B>Objective:</B> Develop efficient and repeatable regeneration systems
from cell and tissue cultures of switchgrass (<I>Panicum virgatum</I>).
</P>
<P><B>Approach/Background:</B> Research efforts to improve biomass production
of switchgrass through breeding, genetics, and physiology should logically
include the development of systems that can be used in the potential application
of biotechnology. Most, if not all, these applications require whole plants to
be regenerated from cells or tissues cultured <I>in vitro</I>.
</P>
<P><B>Status/Accomplishments:</B> Experiments were conducted with Alamo to
test the effect of regeneration cycle on regeneration frequency. Results showed
that regeneration increased more than fourfold between the first and second
cycles. There was no further increase with additional culture cycles.
</P>
<P>Mature caryopses, seedling segments from greenhouse plants, and seedling
segments from regenerated plantlets were used as explants to initiate cultures
of the cultivars Kanlow, Cave-in-Rock, and Trailblazer. Regeneration capacity of
the upland types was lower than that of Kanlow regardless of explant and medium
composition.
</P>
<P>Much emphasis during the past 2 years was placed on node cultures. There
were two objectives: (1) to develop a system for micropropagation in which
shoots or plantlets are produced directly from the explant and (2) to produce
inflorescences from the top node. Nodal segments were obtained from green house
grown plants of Alamo in the four- to six-node state, surface sterilized, split
longitudinally along the sheath edge, and plated with the cut edge in contact
with MS medium containing 22.5 M 2,4-D and 12.5 M BAP. Shoots emerged at 1 week
culture. Results indicated that under optimum conditions, approximately 500
plants could be produced from one parent plant in 12 weeks. The uppermost node
contains the shoot apical meristem. Splitting this node and plating onto medium
resulted in the production of inflorescences to a mature stage. Inflorescences
could be produced from both halves of the node if a portion of the inflorescence
was included in each half. Inflorescences developed on medium without BAP were
elongated and possessed between 50 and 200 florets. If BAP (5.0 to 25.0 M) was
included in the medium, the inflorescences were more compact and possessed
between 200 and 700 florets. Our procedures for both shoot and inflorescence
production from nodal segments is reliable and highly reproducible. Also, the
responses do not appear to be as cultivar dependent as other <I>in vitro</I>
procedures.

<P><B>Objective:</B> Investigate the effect of hybrid poplar plantations and
switchgrass on water quality and compare these effects to an agronomic crop
(wheat) managed under a typical fertilizer/herbicide regime. 
</P>
<P><B>Approach/Background:</B> A potential benefit associated with changing
land use from traditional agriculture to hybrid poplar or switchgrass is water
quality enhancement. Inputs of chemicals in managing most agronomic crops are
considerably greater than those required for producing hybrid poplar or
switchgrass. The purpose of this project is to test the hypothesis that water
quality is enhanced under energy crop management compared to agronomic crops, in
our case, wheat. This project selects sites and establishes crops, studies
groundwater quality and nutrient cycling, and estimates the water budget. Plans
are to establish the soil and groundwater monitoring system in the Spring and
Summer of 1996 and monitor water quality and quantity during the summer to
establish background levels. Water will be sampled using a combination of
zero-tension and ceramic cup samplers at three soil depths. A site will be
prepared during the Summer and Fall of 1995 and the crop will be planted in the
Spring of 1997.
</P>
<P><B>Status/Accomplishments:</B> A 13-acre site located in Red Lake County,
MN, has been selected for this study. Through the cooperation of a local farmer
involved in other hybrid poplar projects in the area, the site was summer-
fallowed before the project started. The site has been plowed and disked several
times to maintain a weed-free condition during the 1995 growing season. Staff
from the U.S. Geological Survey began a series of test borings to determine the
depth of the water table and direction of groundwater flow. These borings
indicated the presence of a flow-restricting layer at an average depth of 8
feet. Because of this, we changed the sampling design to concentrate water
sample collection within the top 8 feet of soil. We will not establish a series
of groundwater sampling tubes because water flowing downward through the soil
profile will be intercepted by the impeding layer and flow laterally to the
north of the site. Discussions are taking place with other researchers in the
state to determine the best design for constructing the zero-tension and porous
cup lysimeters. These samplers will be constructed during the Winter and
installed in the Spring of 1996.

<P><B>Objective:</B> Develop products and services to meet the information
needs of a diverse community of customers and stakeholders that includes
researchers, policymakers, entrepreneurs, utility companies, land owners, and
the general public.
</P>
<P><B>Approach/Background:</B> As the research efforts funded by BFDP have
matured and expanded into new areas, creating, maintaining, and keeping
information and data accessible have become increasingly important. Products and
services to anticipate and respond to the increased demands for these data and
information are needed. All other BFDP tasks contain strong information and
outreach elements that are funded directly by these tasks. These activities are
done by the task leaders and subcontractors and include presentations,
conference papers, posters, white papers, journal articles, and numerous
personal communications. These products, for the most part, are aimed at the
research community and technically inclined policymakers. This task makes the
materials available to a wider audience.
</P>
<P>This BFDP task is responsible for developing and distributing newsletters,
fact sheets, and visuals (slides and view graphs) and for responding to requests
for information about energy crops. Increased emphasis is being placed on
defining the audience for each information product. BFDP will continue to tap
into the power of the Internet to provide public access to information from DOE
and ORNL.
</P>
<P><B>Status/Accomplishments:</B> During FY 1995, work concentrated on tasks
to support the Biofuels Systems Division's (BSD's) Strategic Goal 4 to establish
an effective external and internal communications, education, and coordination
effort. The Biofuels Information Network, BSD's on-ramp to the Internet, was
expanded and enhanced. Two BSD and six BFDP reports and two handouts (precursors
to fact sheets) were converted for electronic dissemination. A bibliography of
program-sponsored research was published during this period and subsequently
converted for on- line access.
</P>
<P>Two issues of <I>The Energy Crops Forum</I>, the BFDP newsletter whose
purpose is to facilitate communications among a community of researchers,
policymakers, and potential users and producers of energy crops, were published.
The Biomass Interest Group database, BFDP's contacts file, was shared in various
formats with about five other organizations to facilitate their information
dissemination. Technical databases that contain the results of the energy crop
research efforts are in place. The herbaceous energy crops database was updated
during FY 1995. We continued to maintain BIOBIB, a bibliographic database for
program-sponsored publications, presentations, and related materials.
Information is presently disseminated as requested as ORNL staff respond to
inquiries from the public, media, government officials, universities, and other
research institutions. Staff members were encouraged to maintain a log to track
these requests. BFDP staff helped establish BSD's Communications Working Group
and provided support for the Southern Biofuels Roundtable and the Environmental
Effects of Energy Crop Production conference.

<P><B>Objective:</B> Provide a forum at which to present research results and
needs of the environmental effects of biomass crop production.
</P>
<P><B>Approach/Background:</B> The conference was cosponsored by BFDP, the
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Office of Global Climate Change, and the
American Forest and Paper Association. A framework within which to address
biomass crop development using a context of agricultural, forestry, and
industrial sustainability was established.
</P>
<P><B>Status/Accomplishments:</B> The conference provided the opportunity for
participants to exchange information and ideas. Questions about the
environmental benefits of biomass crop production were asked and answered.
Results of several site-specific studies showed that woody and herbaceous crops
increase carbon sequestration when land is converted from traditional row crops
to biomass crops because of their extensive rooting systems and annual turnover
of fine roothairs. These rooting systems also require lower nutrient input,
provide site stabilization, and reduce erosion compared with traditional row
crops. Biomass crops were easily incorporated into the landscape to provide
buffer strips along waterways and drainage areas and to serve as reclamation and
stabilization species for highly erodible lands. Several studies of herbaceous
and woody crops show that biomass crops can increase habitat for bird species.
Regional studies in the Tennessee Valley have identified several areas with
potential for producing these biomass crops. Conference speakers addressed a
number of research areas, including genetic development of crops with specific
traits to meet regional needs, where questions still need to be answered to
ensure successful development and deployment of biomass crops. These questions
include measures to increase the environmental benefits of biomass crop
production while meeting the economic needs of individual crop producers, local
agricultural communities, industrial consumers at both local and regional
scales.

<P><B>Objective:</B> Evaluate quantitative genetic selection criteria for <I>Populus</I>
clones for use in biomass plantations as a biofuels feedstock.
</P>
<P><B>Approach/Background:</B> Research studies performed under this
interagency agreement are part of an interdisciplinary program jointly funded by
DOE and the USDA Forest Service. Scientific information is being developed to
test physiological selection criteria for <I>Populus</I> clones grown under
short rotation for use in selecting and breeding biofuels feedstock. Process
models are used to help select clones and understand which traits are most
important for early selection.
</P>
<P><B>Status/Accomplishments:</B> Studies were conducted to determine the
genotypic and phenotypic variances among important traits in black cottonwood (<I>Populus
trichocarpa</I>) collections from British Columbia and Idaho. Tree height,
phenology, leaf morphology, and leaf diseases exhibited high heritability.
Relation of traits varied between collections, suggesting that selection
strategies for disease resistance need to be evaluated for each population. Leaf
size, number, and the number of sylleptic branches show promise for use in early
selection for increasing biomass productivity.
</P>
<P>An ecophysiological process model, ECOPHYS, was used to evaluate sampling
schemes for estimating whole tree photosynthesis during the season in <I>Populus</I>
clones. Clone growth was simulated under varying weather conditions and leaf
display patterns over the course of the entire growing season. Whole tree
photosynthesis was best estimated by sampling schemes that used physiologically
based approaches when compared to random or stratified random approaches for all
combinations of clone type, weather condition, and leaf orientation. A process
model that uses ECOPHYS is also being used to assess the environmental impact of
planting short-rotation poplars in a region with respect to soil erosion and
water runoff.

<P><B>Objectives:</B> Genetically improve black cottonwood (<I>Populus

productivity and how they can be manipulated genetically and environmentally.
Encourage industrial poplar culture in the Northwest.
</P>
<P><B>Approach/Background:</B> This project provides information on cultural
requirements and productivity of black cottonwood hybrids when grown under
short-rotation intensive culture.
</P>
<P><B>Status/Accomplishments:</B> More than 8,000 ha of the hybrid material
developed in the program is now being grown by forestry industry and farmland
owners in Oregon, Washington, and British Columbia. More than 2,000 selected
clones are under testing in 42 field trials located within the region.
</P>
<P>The quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping effort documented definite
interaction between QTL expression for growth in stem basal area and site/
environment. The three site/environments in the study were located at Puyallup,
WA, Clatskanie, OR, and Boardman, OR. Also revealed in the year's study was
allelic variation in QTLs in two families with different male <I>Populus
deltoides</I> grandparents. A Poplar Molecular Genetics Cooperative was formed
to increase understanding of poplar genetics and to use this information to aid
in poplar breeding and selection.
</P>
<P>Three new plantations were installed in 1994. One evaluates clone/spacing
interactions. The test contains three clones and three spacings from 1.2 m to
3.7 m. Another is a Phase I clone trial with new materials, and the third
evaluates the use of biosolids with method of irrigation (drip versus
minisprinklers). Results of clone testing showed poor correlation between height
at age 1 and production of bole volume at age 3, caused in part by the slowdown
in growth of TxM hybrids at age 3 versus the accelerating growth of TxN clones
at that age. Also evident after 3 years was the significantly superior
production of diploid F1 hybrids compared to related triploids.

<P><B>Objective:</B> Develop improved genetic information and strains, and
associated agronomic technology to develop switchgrass into a biomass fuel crop
for the midwestern states.
</P>
<P><B>Approach and Background:</B>
</P>
<P>The first phase of this research determined the genetic variation among
switchgrasses for biomass fuel production traits and their stability over
environments. In the second phase, research is being conducted to: develop
molecular genetic markers to classify switchgrasses, germplasm, and mapping
genes that control specific traits; determine the feasibility of producing F1
switchgrass hybrid cultivars; determine the optimum rate of nitrogen
fertilization and stage of maturity that will result in the largest economical
yields of extractable ethanol per acre in the midwestern states. Determine the
effectiveness of new herbicides in aiding switchgrass establishment and
determine whether vesicular-arbuscular micorrhizae improve the establishment of
switchgrass and the efficiency of nutrient utilization.
</P>
<P><B>Status and Accomplishments:</B> Phase I successfully demonstrated
significant differences among elite switchgrass strains for biomass production
in the midwestern states. Despite large genotype x environment interaction
effects, some strains consistently produced large biomass yields. Assumming a
conversion efficiency of 75%, the best strains can produce more than 5,000 L/ha
(500 gal/acre) of ethanol. This research provided documentation for releasing
the cultivar &quot;Shawnee&quot; to seed growers in 1995. An associated study
evaluated germplasm collected from remnant prairies and demonstrated significant
genetic variation among accessions. Some of the accessions will be valuable in
switchgrass breeding programs.
</P>
<P>Current research demonstrates two distinct types of switchgrasses based on
chloroplast RFLPs (a type of molecular genetics marker), which are directly
associated with the lowland and upland ecotypes. Nuclear DNA content of most
available switchgrass germplasms and cultivars was determined using flow
cytometry. Results indicate that tetraploid strains have DNA contents of
approximately 3 pg/nuclei, whereas previously reported &quot;hexaploid&quot;
strains contain 6 pg/ nuclei. A cytogenetic investigation demonstrated that
strains with 6 pg DNA/nuclei are octaploids.
</P>
<P>The research on developing F1 hybrids, new herbicides, and
vesicular-arbuscular micorrhizae were established and are in progress.

<P><B>Objective:</B> Initiate a coordinated and cooperative harvesting and
handling systems research agenda that involves the forest products industry,
equipment manufacturers, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Forest
Service, electric utilities through the Electric Power Research Institute
(EPRI), DOE, and its subcontractor, ORNL. Specific goals are to: review
harvesting/handling systems, including obstacles to developing specialized
equipment; identify and rank forest product industry and  other user needs;
outline a harvesting and handling (mechanization) systems research agenda; and
propose and initiate a means or action plan to carry out the agenda in full
cooperation with all interested partners.
</P>
<P><B>Approach/Background:</B> To realize the potential and to make short
rotation woody crop (SRWC) feedstocks more competitive in the marketplace, the
costs of harvesting and handling systems must be reduced. In a mutually
beneficial and collaborative fashion, the USDA Forest Service, ORNL, and EPRI
have established an SRWC Operations Working Group to consider the efficient
development of practices and equipment to culture, harvest, and handle
large-scale woody biomass plantations.
</P>
<P><B>Status/Accomplishments:</B> The major accomplishment of this initiative
was the organization of an SRWC Operations Steering Committee meeting in
cooperation with the USDA Forest Service (Southern Research Station, Auburn
University, AL) and EPRI (Palo Alto, CA). The committee provides the basis for
promoting collaborative action and research and facilitating funding support for
equipment and systems development. A major workshop is planned for FY 1996. With
funding from EPRI, ORNL will also work with the University of California (Davis)
to develop a status report on SRWC operations technologies and systems.

<P><B>Objectives:</B> Plant 2,000 acres of hybrid poplar on agricultural lands
with varying soils and adjacent land uses and  types. Develop a vendor system to
plant, tend, and monitor hybrid poplar plantations. Determine potential
environmental effects of hybrid poplar on small mammals and birds. Gather
specific economic, environmental, and  hybrid poplar production data. Offer
acceptable financial returns to landowners and farmers with alternative crops.
Take advantage of the USDA's Conservation Reserve Program 5-year extension
opportunity if the land is planted to hardwood trees.
</P>
<P><B>Approach/Background:</B> A multidisciplinary team, which includes
representatives from the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources Division of
Forestry, the USDA Forest Service, the USDA Natural Resources Conservation
Service, Natural Resources Research Institute, the University of Minnesota,
Duluth (Biology Department), and RC&amp;D was organized to direct and manage
project implementation. Contracts were placed with vendors to plant 2,000 acres
of hybrid poplar within a 50-mile radius of Alexandria, MN, and to maintain the
plantations. Weekly plantation visits to monitor plantation condition and growth
were conducted.
</P>
<P><B>Status/Accomplishments:</B> During the first phase, primary site
preparation (tillage) was begun. Hybrid poplar cuttings (10 hardwood
cuttings/sticks) were planted at a rate of 681 per acre during the Spring of
1994. Throughout the 1994 growing season, vendors completed weed control
operations. Thirteen sites were planted, the largest planting being 160 acres.
Several failed because of very wet conditions that saturated the soil and
prohibited maintenance. Four hundred fifty acres were replanted during the
Spring of 1995. Tree growth to date, after two growing seasons, approaches 15
feet on several plantations.
</P>
<P>The second phase expanded the planting project by 1,000 acres. Site
preparation began in 1994, and planting was completed during the Spring of 1995.
All Phase 2 acres were hand planted by local and professional planting crews.
The largest plantation is 300 acres. Vendors are cultivating, applying
herbicides to, and monitoring the five plantations. Tree growth on one
plantation, after one growing season, is nearly 8 feet.
</P>
<P>Approximately 400 acres will be replanted in 1996 because of extreme weather
conditions during the Summer of 1995. Nearly all acreage will be treated with
the herbicide Oust during the Fall of 1995 to help control weed growth during
the 1996 growing season.

<P><B>Objective:</B> Develop optimal establishment and cultural practices for
switchgrass as an energy crop in the southeastern United States.
</P>
<P><B>Approach/Background:</B> Switchgrass will be evaluated as an energy crop
in small plot studies to determine optimal methods of weed control at
establishment; evaluate effects of row spacing, subsoiling, fertilization and
legume companion crops for increasing yield; and identify and test alternative
varieties of switchgrass across several locations.
</P>
<P><B>Status/Accomplishments:</B> All plot studies were seeded and good stands
were obtained. Alamo continues to be the best variety at all locations in
Alabama. A wide row spacing (0.8 m) gave higher yields than the narrow (0.2 m)
row spacing. Yield increased with nitrogen fertilization up to 200 kg
nitrogen/ha, but this response was greater at the wide row spacing. Increasing
row spacing from 0.2 m to 0.8m and nitrogen fertilization from 112 kg/ha to 224
kg/ha increased yield by 68%. During the past 5 years, yields from Alamo
switchgrass in plots on a sandy loam soil in south central Alabama has provided
an average yield of 25.8 Mg/ha. However, there has been a general decreasing
trend in these yields, and production in commercial scale fields is expected to
be about 30% lower.

<P><B>Objectives:</B> Use molecular markers and genome maps to pinpoint
quantitative trait loci controlling tree growth, wood properties, stress
tolerance, and disease resistance to increase understanding of the molecular
genetic mechanisms that cause variation  in productivity and quality traits in
hybrid poplar. Use research results to accelerate progress in poplar breeding.
</P>
<P><B>Approach/Background:</B> The key to sustained genetic improvement in
<I>Populus</I> is a detailed understanding of the genetic architecture of
important phenotypic traits such as stem volume, wood quality, and disease
resistance. Such an understanding will accelerate progress in breeding by
providing improved methods to identify superior clones for immediate commercial
use and parents for the next generation of hybrids.
</P>
<P><B>Status/Accomplishments:</B> Ten private forest products companies have
joined DOE in supporting the PMGC financially, and additional support comes from
the USDA Forest Service and British Columbia Ministry of Forests. In the first
few months, more than 120 interspecific hybrid crosses were attempted, and more
than 2,000 new hybrid poplar clones were produced. Parental species were
collected over a wide latitudinal range and across moisture and climatic
gradients to provide genetically informative hybrids suited to a wide range of
growing conditions.

</P>
<P>Open-pollinated seeds from natural stands in three of six subregions in the
southeastern United States, and cuttings from tested clones in the other three
subregions, will be collected during the first 2 years. Crosses among the tested

six subregions during years 3&#150;6. Clone selection in these tests will be
based on rapid juvenile growth rate, <I>Melampsora</I> leaf rust resistance,
and high wood specific gravity.
</P>
<P><B>Status/Accomplishments:</B> Cuttings from 142 tested clones were planted
in a nursery and breeding orchard at Stoneville, MS. Fifteen forest industries
have agreed to help locate natural stands and provide flowers/cuttings or test

<P><B>Objective:</B> Detect physiological and molecular indicators of genetic
diversity, which relate variation in specific traits to biomass productivity, in
the herbaceous energy crop switchgrass.
</P>
<P><B>Approach/Background:</B> A combination of techniques is used to study
the interface between switchgrass physiology and genetics. Field studies
characterize process-level rates of photosynthesis, respiration, and water-use
efficiency, and DNA fingerprinting helps establish genetic relatedness among
released and experimental lines of switchgrass.
</P>
<P><B>Status/Accomplishments:</B> Physiological studies examine the extent of
genetic diversity in switchgrass. Photosynthesis, respiration, and whole-plant
water loss vary among released and experimental lines, although rates of carbon
and water exchange are not robust indicators of above-ground biomass
productivity. Below-ground processes such as carbon allocation, root turnover,
and nutrient cycling, however, is viewed as important contributors to high yield
in switchgrass.
</P>
<P>Polymorphisms among molecular markers produced from the amplification of
genomic DNA (RAPD-PCR) are also used to assess genetic differences within and
among ecotypes of switchgrass. This method quantifies genetic relatedness and
thus provides a rapid evaluation of germplasm within switchgrass breeding
programs. Relatively few markers are needed to distinguish individual genotypes,
and the ability to detect these differences seems high.
</P>
<P>Genetic variability in switchgrass revealed via physiological and molecular
techniques should enable researchers to screen for traits of interest to the
biofuels industry. These technologies may enhance biomass production in the
United States by identifying switchgrass cultivars better adapted to specific
climatic and edaphic conditions. The novel application of molecular techniques
could also provide a powerful tool for identifying and introducing new cultivars
into plant breeding programs.

<P><B>Objective:</B> Develop a Geographic Information System based modeling
system designed to provide geographically specific information on the probable
cost and supply of biomass feedstock from energy crops. The system is designed
to evaluate individual U.S. states.
</P>
<P><B>Approach/Background:</B> The system incorporates land use and road
network information, with transportation, economic, and environmental models to
predict where energy crops would be grown, the cost of supplying biomass from
energy crops to specific locations, and the environmental consequences of
providing that supply. As most information regarding energy crops has a high
degree of uncertainty, the modeling system has a modular design to permit quick
updating and flexibility. This flexibility is also essential for using the model
to evaluate various economic assumptions or the effects of uncertainty on the
underlying input data or algorithms.
</P>
<P>The system strives to capture the geographic variation in the factors that
will determine biomass availability (supply and cost). Producing economically
competitive bioenergy, be it electric power or liquid fuels, is strongly
dependent on the availability of low-cost feedstock. That availability will have
spatial variation, so it is critical to evaluating the real potential of
bioenergy for a region.
</P>
<P>The system can provide guidance for technology development by identifying
the optimal size for a conversion facility (ethanol or power plant); the model
results can define the relationships between conversion facility feedstock
demand, feedstock cost, and availability of locations that can meet specified
conversion facility demands. Locations with the greatest commercial potential
for bioenergy can also be identified by the system; that is, locations where
energy crop production could be economically competitive over large acreages at
low farmgate prices.
</P>
<P><B>Status/Accomplishments:</B> To date, system model parameters have been
developed for 11 states (Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Iowa, Minnesota, Missouri,
Nebraska, North Dakota, South Carolina, South Dakota, and Tennessee). The basic
algorithms and code for the model have been developed and are now being tested.
The modeling system has been presented at an international meeting.
Documentation of model code and algorithms and analysis of baseline runs for the
11 states will be complete by the end of September 1996.

<P><B>Objective: </B>Extend previous poplar breeding and selection in the
north central United States by implementing a regional testing system with four
test locations in Minnesota, Iowa, Wisconsin, and Michigan. Multiple traits will
be evaluated simultaneously and selection indices developed to improve height,
caliper, and resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses. Testing will focus on
Eastern cottonwood (<I>Populus deltoides</I>), which has potential as a
biofuels crop <I>per se</I> and has potential value as a parent in
interspecific hybridizations. Eastern cottonwood has been selected as the
primary species for woody biofuels development in the north central United
States because of its relative resistance to <I>Septoria</I> canker, which
limits deployment of many poplar hybrids in the region.
</P>
<P><B>Status/Accomplishments:</B> Administrative arrangements were made to
support all cooperators in the regional field test through federal assistance
agreements with NCFES. Agreements are now in force between NCFES and Pope County
Soil and Water Conservation District, the University of Minnesota, Iowa State
University, the University of Wisconsin, and Michigan State University.
</P>
<P>Clones were selected from nurseries at Iowa State University and the
University of Minnesota (Grand Rapids, MN) based on age, 2-year growth, and
resistance to leaf diseases. We selected 43 clones of <I>P. deltoides</I>, 10
clones of <I>P. deltoides x P. maximowiczii </I>F1 hybrids, three clones of
<I>P. deltoides x P. nigra</I> F1 hybrids, one clone of <I>P. nigra x P.
maximowiczii</I>, and four clones of aspen hybrids. Control clones in the
experiment include NM-6 (one of the most promising new commercial clones) and
DN-34 (currently the most widely planted commercial clone in the northeastern
United States).
</P>
<P>Rooted 1-year-old plants were lifted from nurseries in late April or early
May 1995. The current terminal shoot was pruned to approximately 10 cm and
plants were held in cold storage until delivery to the planting sites during the
week of May 15.  Tests were established at Westport, MN; Ames, IA; Madison, WI;
and East Lansing, MI, according to plan. In each case, the planting design was
10 randomized incomplete blocks with two tree plots. All plantings were
inspected several times during the first month after establishment, and survival
was near 100% in all cases. Measurements, including tree height, stem caliper,
leaf number, and incidence of <I>Melampsora</I> rust, were completed during
September at all test sites.
</P>
<P>A plan to expand the regional testing program to include northern Minnesota
was prepared in consultation with the Natural Resources Research Institute,
Duluth, MN, and the Agricultural Utilization Research Institute, Crookston, MN.
We will select new <I>P. deltoides </I>parental plants from high pH sites in
northwestern Minnesota to identify or develop clones that tolerate a combination
of high soil pH and severe northern winters.

<P><B>Objective:</B> Develop new clones of <I>Populus</I> for producing
biomass energy in the north central United States.
</P>
<P><B>Approach/Background:</B> Selecting and breeding for pest resistance, dry
weight yield potential, ease of propagation, and screening for pest resistance
in hybrid <I>Populus</I> populations is emphasized. Each year, new family
materials from natural and controlled populations are planted in nursery or
field progeny tests. At the end of the first and third growing seasons the most
promising individuals are identified and cloned. Cloned selections are then
evaluated for two more nursery seasons. Clones that continue to show promise are
then distributed to other programs in the region for long-term field testing.
</P>
<P><B>Status/Accomplishments:</B> In 1995 selections were made in one
3-year-old progeny test of hybrid aspen and in a 1-year-old test of <I>P.
deltoides</I> parents and offspring. The 1995 nursery test of new clones
includes 166 genotypes. All but seven are pure <I>P. deltoides</I> selections
from our work during the past 3 years. Two new progeny tests, one in southeast
Iowa, the other in northwest Tennessee, were established with 32 families of
<I>P. alba</I>.
</P>
<P>The project is now in its second year of large-scale release of new clones
for longer-term field tests. In 1994, three field trials were established in a
transect across Iowa using the same set of 50 new clones. In 1995, 60 new clones
were entered into regional field trials in Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota, and
Wisconsin. In all our trials, many clones or families are exceeding the
commercial clone Eugenei in initial growth potential.
</P>
<P>Disease evaluations show all <I>P. trichocarpa</I> hybrids are susceptible
to <I>Septoria</I> canker, and some <I>P. maximowiczii</I> hybrids seem
resistant. <I>Marssonina</I> leaf spot has been very heavy in our test
plantings for the past several years, with a particularly high incidence on the
Eugenei clone. We hypothesize the appearance of a new biotype of<I> Marssonina
brunnea</I> in central Iowa over the past few years. In our 1995 sreening for
Melampsora leaf rusts, we identified a parent that is carrying a single gene,
dominant trait for resistance.
</P>
<P>The clonal preferences of the cottonwood leaf beetle (<I>Chrysomela scripta</I>),
its impact on tree growth, and its seasonal population cycles are being
assessed. Egg mass infestations of 0.5 or higher per terminal cause significant
damage. There is high egg and larval mortality in firstand second-generation
field populations; a significant portion of this appears to be caused by natural
enemies. Artificial wounding studies indicate that when defoliation reaches 75%
on the critical LPI leaves, stems and roots incur significant growth losses,
even though most of the crown is still undamaged.

<P><B>Objectives:</B> Increase biomass yield potential in switchgrass
populations adapted to the south central and southeastern United States.
Characterize basic breeding behavior and determine phylogenetic relationships of
 ecotypic and/or polyploid forms of the species. Establish and evaluate a
comprehensive germplasm collection.
</P>
<P><B>Approach/Background:</B> Switchgrass is a polymorphic outcrossing
species composed of biotypes that differ in ploidy level or edaphic
requirements, or both. Ploidy levels in switchgrass reportedly range from 2x to
12x, and predominant levels are 4x, 6x, and 8x. Two broad ecotypes are
designated as &quot;upland&quot; and &quot;lowland&quot; based on edaphic
requirements. Biomass yield is being increased by applying recurrent restricted
phenotypic selection (RRPS) in four breeding populations designated southern
lowland, northern lowland, southern upland, and northern upland. The populations
were formulated from switchgrass germplasm from central and southern states and
are respectively adapted to regions or conditions in the south central and
southern United States. More than 100 switchgrass germplasm accessions are being
evaluated for standard descriptors. Basic breeding behavior and phylogenetic
relationships are being assessed through controlled hybridization and progeny
evaluations.
</P>
<P><B>Status/Accomplishments:</B> Three cycles of RRPS were completed in each
population. Experimental synthetic varieties were produced from elite plants
identified from the breeding nurseries. Sixteen populations, which consist of
C0, C1, and C2 generations from each population, plus four synthetic varieties,
were established in four field tests in Spring 1995 to assess agronomic
performance and response to selection. The tests consist of solid seeded and
space planted nurseries at each of two Oklahoma locations. Seed of four new
synthetic varieties was produced in 1995.
</P>
<P>A diverse switchgrass germplasm collection of about 100 accessions was
assembled from commercial varieties and native stands. Descriptor data were
collected for 2 years. Flow cytometry procedures were adapted to determine
ploidy level. Plants from selected germplasms were incorporated into the
breeding populations.
</P>
<P>Preliminary results from crossing studies that encompass thousands of
hybridization attempts indicate a strong genetic barrier between ploidy
levels/ecotypes.

<P><B>Objectives:</B> Validate and characterize field resistance expressed by
somaclones. Assess the level of pathogenic and molecular genetic variation in
<I>Septoria</I> spp. Monitor disease effects in poplar trials.
</P>
<P><B>Approach/Background:</B> We successfully increased the resistance of
clone NE 299 (<I>Populus nigra</I> var <I>betulifolia</I> x<I> P. trichocarpa</I>)
to <I>Septoria</I> leaf spot and canker. Clone NE 308 (<I>P. charkowiensis</I>
x <I>P. incrassata</I>) grows rapidly and is tolerant to drought, so it was
chosen to further test somaclonal selection to rapidly improve its disease
resistance. Somaclones were generated, allowed to grow for several months, and
screened for disease resistance. Selected somaclones and controls are being
field tested in replicated plantings.
</P>
<P><I>Septoria</I> spp. caused serious leaf and stem diseases. <I>S.
populicola</I> is found in the Pacific Northwest and on native poplars elsewhere
in North America.<I> S. musiva</I> is commonly found on poplars in North
America, but not in the Pacific Northwest. <I>Septoria</I> spp. isolate
morphometrics were compared using replicated growth tests, and by measuring
conidial dimensions microscopically. Differences in isolate pathogenicity were
assessed using <I>in vitro</I> inoculations of leaf tissue and stems of poplar
host differentials. Genetic structure and variability of the pathogen
populations were analyzed using random amplified polymorphic DNA markers based
on the polymerase chain reaction.
</P>
<P>Hybrid poplar clonal trials are assessed annually for resistance to the
major limiting diseases. Clones were ranked as to disease resistance, growth,
and survival.
</P>
<P><B>Status/Accomplishments</B>: Somaclonal selection was used to increase
resistance to <I>S. musiva</I>. Of 486 NE 308 somaclones, 29 tested resistant
in two repeated leaf disk assays. The resistant somaclones, susceptible
somaclone controls, and donor control plants were established in a replicated
field planting. The trees will be assessed annually for survival, growth, and
disease incidence and severity. 
</P>
<P>The genetic and pathogenic variability within <I>S. musiva</I> and <I>S.
populicola</I> were assessed. More than 1,000 <I>Septoria</I> spp. isolates
were recovered from 50 hybrid poplar and aspen clones and native poplars.
Isolates were collected from 21 locations. A group of 162 isolates was highly
variable in color, sporulation, morphology, and growth rate on artificial media.
Pathogenicity of 27 isolates vary widely, and variations in host specificity
were detected, using a leaf disk assay on susceptible and resistant hybrid
poplar clones. Stem inoculations using 10 isolates from eight hybrid clones and
balsam poplar indicated variation in canker development among hybrid poplar host
differentials. 
</P>
<P>Poplar selections in the clonal trials established in the north central
United States were monitored for resistance to the major limiting diseases. This
has resulted in the identification of a group of clones that have exhibited good
growth and a high level of resistance or tolerance to disease over a range of
sites. The common set of clones across a wide range of sites has also allowed us
to monitor the pathogen populations within them, and has facilitated the
collections of various fungi for identification and comparison purposes.

benefits of large short-rotation plantations in Brazil, including effects on
biodiversity, nutrients in soils, carbon storage, and the effects of
environmental regulations. Provide case studies of successful ventures that use
various types of woody biomass to produce energy in Brazil. Enhance liaisons

now involved with the project as part of the faculty at UFV.
</P>
<P><B>Status/Accomplishments:</B> Economic, yield, and cultural treatment data
were obtained from four Brazilian companies: Duratex, Gerdau, Champion, and
Copener. These data were augmented by pertinent information contained in theses
of graduate students at the Federal University of Vicosa. A major effort to
collect additional data is ongoing.
</P>
<P>A proposal involving ORNL entitled &quot;Database for Short Rotation Forest
Plantations&#151;An International Partnership&quot; was submitted for funding by
the National Science Foundation and the USDA Forest Service International
Programs division. If funded, it will provide additional support for data
collection and exchange. 
</P>
<P>The principal investigator and Lynn Wright, deputy program manager of the
Biofuels Feedstock Development Program visited several forest companies,
universities, and government organizations in Brazil that do biomass research or
are interested in using biomass for energy. They established new contacts and
generated substantial interest on the part of Brazilian organizations. As a
result, UFV's president and vice president for research and Aracruz Celulose, a
leading short-rotation plantation company visited the United States and
solidified the working relationships.

<P><B>Objectives:</B> Evaluate the productivity of switchgrass varieties
adapted to the upper southeastern United States and managed under two harvest
regimes. Refine no-till establishment practices for switchgrass that will
include considerations of insecticides, planting dates, and seed quality
(dormancy). Examine the over-winter losses of standing switchgrass biomass.
</P>
<P><B>Approach/Background:</B> Switchgrass has good potential as a biofuels
feedstock, but more information is needed on its establishment and management to
optimize productivity regionally. Several field and laboratory studies were
undertaken to assess yield and other responses to management. The largest is a
five-state, six-variety, cutting- management, and maximum-yield trial. Other
work involves studies to consistently and successfully establish under a variety
of conditions.
</P>
<P><B>Status/Accomplishments:</B> A regional variety-screening study was
established in 1992 at eight sites in Kentucky, North Carolina, Tennessee,
Virginia, and West Virginia. Yields from the 1992 growing season ranged from 0
to 8 Mg/ha. In 1993, the yields ranged up to 19 Mg/ha for the best variety at
one site, and average yields within a site varied from 5.6 to 14.6 Mg/ha.
Severe, early-season drought accounted for the lower yields at two locations. &quot;Kanlow&quot;
and &quot;Alamo&quot; were among the more productive varieties. Two harvests
(one in mid-summer and another at the end of the season) provided about 25% more
yield than a single cutting at the end of the season. In 1994, the maximum yield
for any variety at any site was 24.6 Mg/ha. Yields averaged across varieties
within a site ranged from 8.5 to 22.5 Mg/ha. Two cuttings provided an average
yield of 15.0 Mg/ha versus 11.7 Mg/ha for a single harvest at the end of the
season. &quot;Shelter&quot; was generally less productive than the other
varieties, especially when harvested only once.
</P>
<P>Studies with delayed harvests revealed that harvestable biomass declines
between early September and the end of the season. This appears to be related to
translocation of dry matter to below-ground parts. There was no significant
decline in standing biomass from November through February.
</P>
<P>Recently harvested switchgrass seeds exhibited high levels of dormancy;
germinability was often 10% or less. Dormancy was broken by several treatments:
exposure of wet seeds to 10&#183;C for 14 to 35 days, mechanical or acid
scarification of the seed covering, and dry storage (after-ripening). An
accelerated after-ripening (by exposing dry seeds to temperatures of 50&#183; to
60&#183;C for 5 to 30 days) is a feasible way to relieve much of the dormancy,
but the exposure to higher temperatures poses risk of loss of vigor, especially
if seed moisture is elevated (&gt;7%).

<P><B>Objectives:</B> Obtain data on adapting switchgrass cultivars in the
south central United States. Develop improved management practices for producing
switchgrass biomass. Develop germplasm with improved establishment and reduced
seed dormancy.
</P>
<P><B>Approach/Background:</B> A multi-environment approach is used to
determine cultivar performance. Genetic and physiological techniques are used to
modify seed dormancy and improve establishment of switchgrass. Plot studies are
used to examine responses to harvest frequency and timing and soil fertility
needs.
</P>
<P><B>Status/Accomplishments:</B> Alamo switchgrass was the highest yielding
cultivar in 1993 and 1994. Caddo and Cave- in-Rock were the lowest yielding
cultivars in both years. Caddo and Cave-in-Rock matured in June, whereas the
other switchgrasses matured in August and September.
</P>
<P>Biomass yield of Alamo switchgrass increased with increasing nitrogen rate
at each location in 1992, 1993, 1994, and 1995. There was a small response to 20
kg of P2O5 ha-1 at Stephenville in 1992, but none to phosphorous fertilizer at
Stephenville in 1993 or 1994 or at Beeville in 1993 or 1994. Soils at both
locations were low in phosphorous (less than 10 kg ha-1 of available phosphorous
in the surface 30 cm of soil according to soil test). Switchgrass does not
respond to phosphorous fertilizer, which indicates that switchgrass uses
phosphorous very efficiently. This may be a result of colonization of
switchgrass roots by vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizae.
</P>
<P>At both Dallas and Stephenville, increasing harvest frequency reduced total
season biomass yields of Alamo switchgrass in 1993 and 1994. The highest yields
at both locations were obtained with a single harvest in September. Delaying the
final fall harvest until October or November reduced yields. In the multiple
harvest systems, about 40% of the yield was obtained at the first harvest in
May.
</P>
<P>We have made progress in selecting switchgrass populations for enhanced and
reduced crown node (subcoleoptile internode) elevation and reduced postharvest
seed dormancy. These selections may have improved establishment characteristics.

<P><B>Objective:</B> Use improved regeneration and transformation methods to
develop efficient gene transfer protocols for poplars.
</P>
<P><B>Approach/Background:</B> We seek to improve transformation by developing
means to rapidly customize transformation protocols for individual clones and
generalized methods that would improve transformation of a variety of clones and
species.
</P>
<P><B>Status/Accomplishments:</B> In Experiment 1 we developed a way to
transform model clones at high frequency. The goal of this work is to generate
transformants with transgenes for sterility, and for glyphosate and insect
resistance for near-term field testing. An indirect organogenesis approach
substantially increased transformation efficiency in hybrid cottonwood.
Forty-four transgenic lines with glyphosate resistance transgenes were generated
in four triploid cottonwood clones; they will be field tested in 1996 and 1997.
</P>
<P>In Experiment 2 we made genotype-independent transformation advances. The
goal of this study is to identify major factors that enhance transformation but
do not show strong genotype interactions. A current focus of this work is on
matrix attachment regions (MARs). They are sections of DNA that help to
coordinate chromosome structure, and can significantly increase uniformity and
intensity of transgene expression. We have observed large increases of transgene
expression in poplar the first few weeks following cocultivation using a
tobacco-derived MAR. Effects on recovery of transformants are currently under
study.

<P><B>Objective:</B> Draft a strategic plan for the Biofuels Program as a
whole, and for each project in the program.
</P>
<P><B>Approach/Background:</B> Strategic plans have been written annually for
each project within the Biofuels Program.  The previous version of the Biofuels
Program Strategic Plan was simply a summary of the individual project plans. 
This year's was written as a separate, stand-alone plan that included the
updated project strategic plans as appendices, and that discussed issues
pertinent to the program as a whole.
</P>
<P><B>Status/Accomplishments:</B> An NREL-reviewed program plan was completed
and submitted to DOE in August 1995.  It starts by putting the NREL Biofuels
Program into the context of the DOE mission and the OTT strategy to carry out
that mission for the transportation sector.  It then describes the benefits to
the country that a successful biofuels industry could accrue.  These benefits
include enhanced energy security, environmental quality, economic growth,
enhanced science and technology base, and regional equity. 
</P>
<P>The vision and mission statements are taken from the DOE Biofuels Systems
Program strategic plan&#151; <I>Biofuels:  At the Crossroads</I>.  Windows of
opportunity are identified that will aid in commercializing biofuels, and that
do or will exist for specified periods of time.  Target costs that will make
biofuels competitive with fossil fuels are included.  Factors that could
threaten the commercial success of biofuels are also presented, and include
lowering the projected demand for oxygenates and the long-term price of oil.
Goals and objectives are listed, as are strategies to achieve them while
minimizing the risk of failure. The strategies are broken down into biofuels
cost reductions, technology and product selection, and management.  Finally,
background information on the situation analysis is presented in an appendix.

<P><B>Objective:</B> The United States belongs to the International Energy
Agency's (IEA) Bioenergy Agreement, which provides a mechanism for participating
countries to exchange information and coordinate ongoing research programs in
bioenergy.  The agreement includes cooperation in the areas of biomass
production, harvesting, and conversion.  Participation allows the United States
to take advantage of extensive research in other countries, thus gaining access
to a much larger base of information than it would have without the cooperation.
 This knowledge helps the United States leverage its research dollars.  At
present, the United States pays only about 10% of the total costs of this work
and receives the benefit of having other countries pay the remaining 90%.
</P>
<P><B>Approach/Background:</B> The United States has participated in the IEA
Bioenergy Agreement since its inception in 1978.  At present, 15 countries plus
the European Union participate.  The agreement consists of specific programs,
called tasks, in four areas:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Task XII&#151;biomass production, harvesting, and supply
</LI>
<LI> Task XIII&#151;biomass utilization
</LI>
<LI> Task XIV&#151;municipal solid waste conversion
</LI>
<LI> Task XV&#151;greenhouse gas balances. 
</LI></UL>
<P>Within each task are individual projects, called activities, which deal with
topics such as bioconversion for ethanol production, thermal gasification, and
pyrolysis for liquid products.  The United States participates in all four tasks
and in several activities within each task.  In addition, the United States
leads the conversion work of Task XIII.  As the operating agent, the United
States leads the technical program and administers the funds provided by the
participants.  NREL performs the operating agent function for Task XIII for 1992&#150;
1997.
</P>
<P><B>Status/Accomplishments:</B> These funds will be used to (1) pay 1995
U.S. contributions to the IEA Bioenergy Agreement, (2) contribute to
implementing the IEA Strategic Plan, which includes increasing industry
participation, upgrading products, and increasing communication via the World
Wide Web and Internet.

<P><B>Objective:</B> in direct support of the shared goals adopted at the
International Energy Agency (IEA) Ministerial Meeting of June 1993, the
executive committee for the Bioenergy Agreement has promulgated a strategic
plan.  This plan provides a strategic approach for achieving the vision and
mission of the Bioenergy Agreement, and summarizes the joint views of the
member-country participants (currently 15 countries and the European Union) who
collaborate in the Agreement.  In addition, it seeks to motivate the
participation of industry and other interested parties, and to broaden public
awareness of and support for its activities.
</P>
<P><B>Approach/Background:</B> The vision and mission concepts that emerged
from the strategic planning process focus on overcoming the environmental,
institutional, technological, and financial barriers to the nearand long-term
deployment of bioenergy technologies.  The importance of these concepts is
emphasized by: the potential of widespread commercial application of biomass
energy to help participating nations meet the shared goals of the IEA;  the
evolutionary forces that support the enhanced use of bioenergy for sustainable
development; and the difficulties and barriers that must be addressed to help
make this vision a reality.
</P>
<P><B>Status/Accomplishment:</B> These funds were used to develop and publish
the IEA Bioenergy Agreement Strategic Plan 1995&#150;2000.

<P><B>Objective:</B> To assess the issues that surround the addition of a
biomass-to-ethanol plant to a biomass-fired power generating facility.  The
analysis examines the technical feasibility of collocating both plants, and
emphasizes the resulting technical, economic, and environmental benefits.
</P>
<P><B>Approach/Background:</B> The minimum biomass feedstock requirements of a
power facility were determined so the amount dedicated for ethanol production
affects no more than 10% of current daily usage.
</P>
<P>Databases of biomass power facilities of 14 MW and greater were researched. 
Likely biomass power facilities that sold power to the grid and were 14 MW or
larger were identified.  This resulted in identifying 150 candidate facilities.
Several discriminatory criteria were developed to reduce the number of candidate
power facilities from 150 to 34.  Further analysis focused on three states that
contain 24 of the 34 remaining sites, representing the East and West Coasts, and
the upper Midwest regions of the United States.  Additional criteria reduced the
analysis to three sites, one each in California, Maine, and Michigan.
</P>
<P><B>Status/Accomplishments:</B> surveys were conducted to gather specific
general and technical information on each selected power plant.  Key technical
requirements for designing and implementing an ethanol plant were identified. 
Site-specific improvements required for adding an ethanol plant to a biomass
power plant were recognized.  Synergies between ethanol and power plants, and
the resulting benefits, were identified.  The options of coupling the biomass
ethanol plant to a biomass power facility, or operating it on a stand-alone
basis, and the potential tie-ins of process energy and labor that could benefit
or hamper the operation of ethanol and power plants, were examined.  A
spreadsheet model was developed that estimates capital and operating costs for
all scenarios.  Although this was only a preliminary approach, the results are
promising, and the study shows a deeper analysis is sought.

<P><B>Objectives:</B> Reevaluate the Biofuels Systems Program (BSP) direction
and interactions with industry and other stakeholders. Incorporate strategic
planning into BSP program management, budget formulation, technology transfer,
and annual operations.
</P>
<P><B>Approach/Background:</B> The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is
refocusing its research from strictly long term to include commercializing
technologies that benefit the strategic planning for all government programs. 
This activity by DynCorp EENSP was designed to help DOE's Biofuels Systems
Division (BSD) develop a multiyear strategic plan for the Biofuels Program,
including a total reevaluation of program direction and interactions with
industry.
</P>
<P>A series of workshops and meetings was held between BSD program managers and
program managers from NREL and Oak Ridge National Laboratory.  DynCorp EENSP
strategic planning facilitators and writers guided the process during the
workshops and meetings, and documented results.  Three workshops and several
meetings were conducted, during which draft vision, mission, goals, and
objectives were developed.  A situation analysis that examines the program's
strengths, weaknesses, threats, and opportunities was also completed. 
Implementation strategies and action plans are now being developed.
</P>
<P><B>Status/Accomplishments:</B> The initial phase of strategic planning was
completed by making one BSP goals strategy &quot;planning and management.&quot; 
A draft Biofuels Program Strategies Plan was completed and peer reviewed.

<P><B>Objective:</B> Help develop and implement standardized approaches for
compiling biomass energy information required for the U.S. Department of Energy
(DOE) Regional Biomass Energy Program (RBEP) planning, in coordination with the
DOE Energy Information Administration (EIA).
</P>
<P><B>Approach/Background:</B> RBEP-HQ, the five RBEP regional offices, and
DOE-EIA are interested in having access to accurate, up-to-date information
regarding institutional and industrial use of biomass at facilities across the
United States.  To help meet this need, DynCorp EENSP prepared an upgraded
version of software it developed, called the Biomass Facility Information System
(BFIS).  This is a user-friendly relational database that compiles and displays
information regarding biomass facilities in the utility, industrial, commercial,
and institutional sectors.  BFIS includes a facility mapping system that
graphically displays the location (including state and county boundaries, major
roads, and cities) of biomass energy facilities in the database.  To help RBEP
and EIA staff assess the merits and usefulness of BFIS, DynCorp prepared
presentations and demonstrations of BFIS for the staff of RBEP, DOE-EIA, NREL,
Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA), and the five RBEP regional offices; and
participated in joint meetings and workshops for RBEP and DOE-EIA, to address
biomass data collection requirements and issues.
</P>
<P><B>Status/Accomplishments:</B> Presented a demonstration of BFIS at DOE on
May 12, 1994, including a video display of the relational database and mapping
features of the software. Prepared and presented a briefing on BFIS for a
workshop sponsored by RBEP and DOE-EIA to address biomass data collection
requirements.

<P><B>Objective:</B> Help the Regional Biomass Energy Program (RBEP) summarize
its past role and accomplishments in recovering methane from biomass, and
identify potential future roles for RBEP in methane recovery.
</P>
<P><B>Approach/Background:</B> Substantial input was obtained from RBEP's five
regional managers regarding past RBEP projects and successes in recovering
methane-for-energy at landfills, sewage treatment facilities, and on-farm
anaerobic digestion facilities.  Information was also collected on methane
recovery efforts supported by other DOE programs, USDA, and EPA.  A report was
prepared that addressed the methane recovery opportunities and why they are
important (specifically for landfills, on-farm animal manure, and sewage
treatment facilities).  Barriers to methane recovery and utilization were
summarized; highlights of RBEP projects and successes in each methane recovery
area were presented; brief descriptions of other federal methane recovery
efforts were provided (the EPA/USDA AgStar Program; the EPA Landfill Outreach
Program; and the DOE Landfill Methane Recovery initiative under Action #37 of
the &quot;Energy Partnership for a Strong Economy&quot;).  The report concluded
with suggestions regarding the potential role RBEP can play in fostering methane
recovery in coordinating and collaborating with other federal agencies.
</P>
<P><B>Status/Accomplishments:</B> A draft report was submitted to the RBEP
managers for review.  Based on this review a final revised report was prepared
and printed in time for distribution at the Second Biomass Conference of the
Americas in Portland, Oregon, August 21&#150;24, 1995.

<P><B>Objective:</B> Provide information about the potential contributions
thermochemical conversion of domestic biomass can make to the U.S. energy supply
and to national economic and environmental goals.  Specifically, to examine
impacts of creating and implementing biomethanol into the transportation system.
 Changes in fuel prices and import levels were considered for overall impact on
the U.S. economy.
</P>
<P><B>Approach/Background:</B> Today, there is no commercial biomethanol plant
in the United States.  However, the technology to produce methanol from biomass
is evolving.  The only current commercial technology is represented by the
Koppers-Totzek gasifier that was designed for coal;  the Institute of Gas
Technology (IGT) gasifier and the Battelle-Columbus gasifiers represent
near-term technologies; and an advanced Battelle Columbus gasifier with hot-gas
cleanup represents a nearto mid-term possibility.
</P>
<P>The approach is to show how thermochemical biomethanol plants can be
competitive in the United States without subsidies in the long term.  The
analysis looks at opportunities for collocating biomass processing with existing
natural gas methanol plants, reducing the costs of the initial plants, and
building them sooner than would otherwise be possible.  Finally, the technical
and nontechnical barriers to biomethanol market entry and growth are examined.
</P>
<P><B>Status/Accomplishments:</B> Several industrial firms, including
BrightStar, Eastman Chemicals, and Terameth, are interested in developing,
implementing, and commercializing biomethanol activities.  These initiatives
need to be encouraged by more cooperative government/industry cost-shared
projects to demonstrate successively larger, fully integrated thermochemical
biomethanol production systems.  More research is needed to develop an optimized
dedicated biomass feedstock and to resolve numerous technical issues.  An
extension of the current tax credit beyond the year 2000 is necessary.  The
analysis shows that the long-term economics of a mature industry using dedicated
biomass feedstocks are close enough to being competitive to warrant continued
inclusion in the national R&amp;D portfolio.

<P><B>Approach/Background:</B> This is a joint study between DOE's Policy
Office, the Biofuels Systems Program (BSP) and their contractors (NREL, Argonne
National Laboratory, and DynCorp EENSP) in response to EPACT 502(b) and the
BSP's Strategic Goal No. 3.  The analytic approach will:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Develop alternative demand scenarios to define the volume of ethanol in the
market, whether driven by legislation, policy, or the market
</LI>
<LI> Project feedstock cost curves and ethanol plant economics for grain
ethanol and cellulosic ethanol, assuming several conversion plant types
</LI>
<LI> Define a family of supply curves for grain ethanol and cellulosic ethanol
using several plant types
</LI>
<LI>Aggregate the feedstock/plant-type supply curves into an industry supply
curve
</LI>
<LI>Determine the least-cost mix of feedstocks and conversion plant types that
will satisfy the demand as defined by various demand scenarios
</LI>
<LI>Define barriers, such as the dramatic increase in imports of very low-cost
methanol from countries such as Saudi Arabia (where the natural gas feedstock
was considered a waste product), to the transition and policies to facilitate
the transition.
</LI></UL>
<P><B>Status/Accomplishments:</B> Work is in progress.  DynCorp's role is to
develop one or more of the following:  ethanol demand scenarios, feedstock
supply curves, ethanol supply curves, or investment criteria.

<P>The <B>Biofuels Feedstock Development Program (BFDP)</B> is a
mission-oriented program of research and analysis whose goal is to develop
environmentally acceptable crops and cropping systems for producing large
quantities of low-cost, high-quality biomass feedstocks. Major funding comes
from the U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE) Office of Transportation Technologies
with additional funding from the Office of Utility Technologies and the Office
of Industrial Technologies. This issue of <I>Energy Crops Forum</I> highlights
the cooperative nature of several of the research efforts.</P>

<H2><A NAME="Virtual">Virtual </A>Crop Development Center Knows No Boundaries</H2>
<P><B><I>Sheryl Martin and Jerry Tuskan</I><BR>BFDP</B></P>
<P>Eastern cottonwood (<I>Populus deltoides</I>) is one of the native poplars
of the Southeast. When properly managed, it outproduces all other southeastern
tree species. These trees perform best on deep, fertile sand-loam to clay- loam
soil with high water-holding capacity. On such sites and under proper
management, cottonwood reaches a height of 30 feet in 5 years, becoming
reproductively mature in 6 to 10 years. Currently, however, we lack well-
tested, broadly adapted clones suitable for short-rotation production.</P>
<P>How do you quickly and efficiently develop superior cottonwood clones that
are resistant to disease and perform well across most of the Southeast? BFDP
decided that the most effective way would be a &quot;virtual crop development
center&quot; that coordinated and united the efforts of experts from
institutions across the region.</P>
<P>Dr. Sam Land, Jr., Mississippi State University (MSU), and his
co-investigators, Dr. Mike Stine, Louisiana State University and Dr. Donald
Rockwood, University of Florida, have created just such an initiative for BFDP.
Their &quot;virtual crop development center&quot; includes a host of cooperators
across 13 southeastern states&#151;Boise Cascade Corporation (Louisiana),
Champion International Company (Florida), Northwest Florida Water Management
District, Crown Vantage (Mississippi), International Paper Company (Georgia),
Neal Land and Timber Company (Florida), Packaging Corporation of America
(Tennessee), Tennessee Division of Forestry, Union Camp Corporation (Georgia),
and Westvaco (Kentucky and South Carolina). Their goal is to develop eastern
cottonwood (<I>Populus deltoides</I>) clones suitable for short-rotation  woody
crops in the Southeast.</P>
<P>How do you coordinate the efforts of this many people? &quot;Frantically,&quot;
says Land. The cooperators locate natural stands, obtain flowers and seeds, and
provide and maintain test sites. Sites for collecting flowers and seeds stands
have already been located throughout the Southeast, and new test sites are being
prepared in west Tennessee, Alabama, northwest Florida, and South Carolina.
Cottonwood flowers are pollinated and the seed is dispersed in a short time
period, typically within 3 or 4 weeks. Seed must be collected prior to seed
shedding so that its origin is known. Spring is also the only time to collect
limbs containing flowers and to bring these limbs back to the laboratory to make
controlled crosses. </P>
<P>When a cooperator reports trees are in flower or that seeds are mature,
everyone must be ready to move. Land contacts his assistants, who are often far
away from MSU. He puts those assistants in touch with the cooperating
institution's field people to coordinate the collection of new material. The
field workers also collect leaf tissue for biotechnology studies at Louisiana
State University.</P>
<P>The work does not end there. Summers are spent maintaining a breeding
orchard. In the winters,  cuttings of the selected genotypes from the nursery
are prepared. Throughout the year, everyone is on the lookout for new cottonwood
stands.</P>
<P>Not just any cottonwood will do. Selections are based on relative growth,
apparent disease resistance, and wood specific gravity. The goal is to collect
plant material from a total of 24 areas, four areas in each of six subregions
across the Southeast. The areas coverdifferent river systems and different parts
of  river systems and include river bottom lands and upland stream sites. After
selection and collection are completed, the researchers cross- pollinate
selected plants to develop new clones that are genetically suitable for
short-rotation woody crops in the Southeast.</P>
<P>Mississippi State University's Delta Research and Extension Center is the
hub of the cottonwood development effort. This facility was previously used in
the 1960s and 1970 by the U.S. Forest Service for cottonwood selection and
improvement. The University of Florida's contribution includes the establishment
and maintenance of a test site and nursery near Tallahassee, Florida. The
industrial cooperators are providing additional test sites. Louisiana State
University will use the leaves collected during seed sampling to construct gene
maps consisting of DNA markers. Relating these markers to traits of commercial
interest, such as growth rate or disease resistance, will permit early
identification of desired traits in offspring, eliminating a long wait for
plants to exhibit superior performance.</P>
<P>Through modern technology and old-fashioned cooperation, the process of tree
improvement, one of the oldest procedures in forestry, is being done faster and
more efficiently by Land and his collaborators across the Southeast in BFDP's
new &quot;virtual crop development center.</P>

<H2><A NAME="Poplar">Poplar</A> Molecular Genetics Cooperative</H2>
<P><B><I>Toby Bradshaw</I><BR>University of Washington</B></P>
<P>As intensive culture of <I>Populus</I> species and hybrids becomes
increasingly important as a source of fiber and fuel, breeding strategies must
be developed and implemented to measure, capture, recombine, and fully exploit
the abundant genetic variation still found in natural populations of poplars and
cottonwoods. Adaptation of poplars to the specialized needs of industry is still
in its earliest stages and must take advantage of the best genetic methods
available if rapid, sustained genetic improvement is to be made.</P>
<P>Since 1989, molecular genetic investigations into the basis of <I>Populus</I>
stem growth, form, stress tolerance, and disease resistance have pinpointed
regions of the <I>Populus</I> genome that have significant effects on these
traits. In collaboration with tree physiologists, anatomists, biochemists, and
pathologists, we are at the threshold of a new era in poplar breeding in which
these few key regions of the genome may be manipulated efficiently and then
recombined into novel hybrids with the best characteristics of several <I>Populus</I>
species.</P>
<P>The time is right to capitalize on the insights into poplar breeding that
molecular biology offers. Significant gains can then be expected in both the
near and longer term. For &quot;molecular breeding&quot; to flourish, however,
critical research needs must be addressed. Informative genetic material must be
identified, collected, bred, and tested over a wide range of actual and
potential growing areas. Although previous clonal testing and breeding have
offered useful guidelines, new research will expand the scale of breeding and
testing while increasing their pace and precision through the use of molecular
tools.</P>
<P>Data gathering, storage, retrieval, and analysis must be coordinated to
ensure rapid dissemination of useful information. Stability and continuity of
funding are required to permit the development of highly informative
multigeneration pedigrees within a large mating design, to explore alternative
breeding strategies, and to retain key personnel. At the same time, immediate
and continued production of clones with potential commercial use is needed.</P>
<P>Each of these research needs will require extensive collaborative efforts on
the part of industry, government, and academic institutions. In order to
coordinate research efforts among these organizations, the Poplar Molecular
Genetics Cooperative (PMGC) was formed in March, 1995. PMGC's goals are to
increase understanding of the molecular genetic mechanisms causing variation in
productivity and quality traits in hybrid poplar and to use research results to
accelerate progress in poplar breeding.</P>
<P>The key to sustained genetic improvement in <I>Populus</I> is a detailed
understanding of the genetic architecture of important phenotypic traits (e.g.,
stem volume, wood quality, disease resistance). Such an understanding will
accelerate progress in breeding by providing improved methods to identify
superior clones for immediate commercial use and parents for the next generation
of hybrids. Crucial questions to be addressed include:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Which regions of the <I>Populus</I> genome contribute to heterosis (hybrid
vigor) in interspecific hybrids?</LI>
<LI>Which regions of the genome are responsible for variation in clonal
performance and breeding value?</LI>
<LI>Is clonal performance a good predictor of breeding value?</LI>
<LI>What useful traits do each of several<I> Populus</I> species bring to
their hybrid offspring?</LI>
<LI>How can clones be genetically tailored to match specific sites and
silvicultural regimes, as well as manufacturing processes and products?</LI>
<LI>Which breeding and selection system(s) will maximize genetic gain in the
near and long terms?</LI></UL>
<P>These questions have no simple or obvious answers, but with molecular tools
they are now approachable in a reasonable time frame.</P>
<P>In the first year of PMGC's existence, breeding methods suitable for
handling large numbers of crosses were developed and implemented. Especially
significant were techniques that enabled researchers to isolate female branches
from unwanted pollen and to rescue immature embryos by <I>in vitro</I> culture.
More than 1800 new hybrid seedlings were planted at the Washington State
University Farm 5 in Puyallup, Washington. The industry demand for new genetic
material was very strong; more than 10,000 cuttings were requested from the
first-year PMGC seedlings for immediate placement in company-sponsored clonal
performance trials.</P>
<P>PMGC members support the cooperative with annual dues of $12,500 and with
in-kind contributions of land, equipment, personnel, and expertise. PMGC is also
working with nonmembers who provide additional breeding materials and technical
advice and support. Thus, monies from DOE and BFDP are leveraged significantly
by industry and academic institutions around the world. The current PMGC
membership includes Alberta-Pacific Forest Industries; Boise Cascade
Corporation; Georgia-Pacific West, Inc.; Inland Empire Paper Company; James
River Corporation; MacMillan Bloedel Timberlands, Inc.; Nippon Paper Industries
Company, Ltd.; Potlatch Corporation; Scott Paper, Ltd.; Union Camp Corporation;
Weyerhaeuser Company; British Columbia Ministry of Forests Research Branch;
Washington State University; the University of Washington; and, of course, DOE
and BFDP.</P>

<H2><A NAME="Switchgrass">Switchgrass</A> Molecular Markers Research</H2>
<P><B><I>Lee Gunter, Jerry Tuskan, and Stan Wullschleger</I><BR>BFDP</B></P>
<P>Crop breeders have long sought to identify genetically controlled traits
that are associated with superior plant growth and dependable productivity and
that can be used as indicators in the selection of higher yielding cultivars.
Unlike many forage and cereal crops, which have been in domestication for
centuries, relatively little is known about the genetics of switchgrass, BFDP's
model herbaceous energy crop. Such a deficiency makes development of superior
cultivars difficult. Across its wide native geographic range, switchgrass has
evolved into upland and lowland ecotypes (locally adapted populations) that vary
in morphology and physiology. The considerable variation in switchgrass will
provide plant breeders with the means to increase biomass yields.</P>
<P>BFDP hopes to simplify the assessment of switchgrass germplasm by using a
technique that reveals variation in randomly distributed genomic DNA segments.
It is now possible for geneticists and breeders to routinely extract DNA from
small amounts of leaf tissue and make many copies using the polymerase chain
reaction (PCR), a process that mimics the enzymatic amplification of DNA within
a single cell. These amplified segments can serve as markers for attributes such
as disease resistance or drought tolerance that may not be apparent at the
seedling stage. In such cases, the marker is assumed to be genetically linked to
the trait. Often, however, these PCR-based markers (known as random amplified
polymorphic DNA or RAPD markers) act as simple genetic &quot;fingerprints&quot;
and are useful tools to enhance our ability to perceive differences between very
similar individuals, cultivars, varieties, or breeding lines.</P>
<P>One of the conditions that makes successful switchgrass breeding difficult
is variation in chromosome numbers, because reliable inheritance of
genetically-controlled traits is based on stable chromosome arrangements across
generations. Switchgrass ecotypes are known to have multiple copies of a basic
chromosome number: typically 4X in lowlands and 6X to 8X in uplands, according
to observations made by Charles Taliaferro and Andy Hopkins at Oklahoma State
University<SUP>1</SUP>.</P>
<P>Our first objective was to search for markers that could be used to
differentiate switchgrass cultivars on the basis of chromosome number or
ecotype. Using RAPD primers in the PCR amplification process, we detected a
single marker in plants with higher chromosome numbers<SUP>2</SUP>. The marker
is present in 8X cultivars (e.g., 'Shelter' and 'Trailblazer') but is absent
from 4X cultivars (e.g., 'Alamo' and 'Kanlow'). This finding is in accord with
the work of University of Nebraska agronomist Ken Vogel, who developed markers
that distinguish 4X and 8X cultivars based on chloroplast DNA restriction
fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs3). We anticipate that these research
results will enable breeders to make a quick assessment of native germ plasm
collections for potential genetic compatibility without resorting to
labor-intensive chromosome counts.</P>
<P>Because chromosome number is not an absolute predictor of ecotype in
switchgrass, we are assembling a set of diagnostic markers for estimating
relationships between new germ plasm and released cultivars by comparing
standard morphological descriptors to molecular markers. While both diagnostic
markers and morphological descriptors are useful, preliminary evidence suggests
that molecular markers, which are more abundant, are better predictors when
cultivars are morphologically similar. The ability to make such distinctions
will facilitate the organization of switchgrass germ plasm breeding populations.</P>
<P>The use of molecular markers in switchgrass research seems promising. We
hope the application of these methods and others will encourage collaboration
among researchers to increase our understanding of switchgrass biology, thus
overcoming obstacles in the development of superior cultivars.</P>

Wildlife </A></H2>
<P><I><B>Virginia Tolbert, Biofuels Feedstock Development Program</B></I></P>
<P>The Environmental Research task of the Biofuels Feedstock Development
Program (BFDP) supports research to understand environmental changes that may
occur from growing biomass crops. This includes changes in soil erosion, soil
structure, chemical movement through soil, water quality, sequestration of
carbon, and wildlife habitat use from planting biomass crops (hardwood trees and
perennial grasses) on fallow or active agricultural lands. BFDP research on the
interactions between biomass crops and wildlife is designed to develop useful,
informative guidelines that will assist biomass producers in achieving both
economic and wildlife values from their crops.</P>
<P>Specific research questions about wildlife habitat and energy crop
production currently include the following :</P>
<UL>
<LI> How do energy crop plantings compare with other land uses (e.g., row
crops, hay fields, native grasslands, forests) as habitat for selected wildlife
species?
</LI>
<LI> How do different energy crop characteristics (e.g., acreage, age, species,
adjacent land uses) affect wildlife use of the energy crop?
</LI>
<LI> How do energy crops with particular characteristics affect wildlife in
adjacent natural or managed habitats?
</LI>
<LI> How can growers manage biomass crops to optimize energy and economic
values in different regions of the country while simultaneously benefiting
native wildlife?
</LI></UL>
<P>Since 1992, environmental research funded by BFDP has addressed whether the
diversity of bird and small mammal species in row crops and on Conservation
Reserve Program lands (erosive agricultural lands temporarily retired through a
government program) changes when these lands are planted with fast-growing trees
for energy and fiber. This research has also looked at how bird and small mammal
communities respond when agricultural land is used for energy crop acreage and
vegetation structure.</P>
<P>Birds and small mammals are sensitive to changes in habitat at different
scales&#151;birds are broad ranging whereas small mammals are confined to
smaller areas by their lack of mobility&#151;and use different components of the
habitat. Consequently, these are complementary species groups to use in
assessing native wildlife response to changes in land use. BFDP hopes to
complement ongoing wildlife research in the north-central and southeast United
States in the near future by including studies in other regions. We hope to
monitor plantings of additional hardwood tree species, to assess tree crops over
their full growth cycles from planting to harvest, to evaluate large acreage
plantings, and also to explore how large mammals and other wildlife groups use
energy crops as habitat. </P>
<P>To date, studies of biomass plantings conducted in the north-central United
States have shown that hardwood tree crops support increased diversity of birds
in comparison with row crops. However, the habitat value of these tree plantings
for birds was less than that of natural forest. In the Pacific Northwest,
breeding birds used the more mature poplar plantings but fall migrant birds did
not. Studies in Iowa showed that switchgrass provided an enhanced habitat over
row crops for grassland birds. Bird communities were found to be more highly
influenced by the surrounding landscape than by the structure of the switchgrass
plantings. Bird communities also differed between the studied plantings and the
various habitat types surrounding the switchgrass (wetland, forest, row crop).
Bird species found in adjacent surveyed woodlands were not found in the younger,
more open tree plantings.</P>
<P>Studies of small mammals found differences in habitat use in tree plantings,
nearby natural wooded areas, row crops, and grasslands. Before canopy closure,
small mammal species using the plantings were similar to those using grasslands.
The tree plantings provided improved habitat value over row crops for small
mammals. More grass cover and increased vegetation diversity within the tree
plantings, tree deaths and differences in planting and management techniques,
increased small mammal density and diversity in the plantings. The results of
these studies are specific to hybrid poplars planted in the northwest and
north-central United States and to switchgrass plantings in the north-central
United States.</P>
<P>BFDP is continuing to define and promote cooperative research in other areas
and on plantings of different species. These studies will be conducted on larger
and older plantings (closed canopy) than the research conducted thus far. They
will more accurately address total effects and define maximum potential benefits
for wildlife diversity with energy crop development. </P>
<P>New research data will complement existing information and help direct
future plantings of biomass crops to enhance habitat for wildlife while meeting
production and grower needs.</P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="Streamside">Streamside Buffer Strips Improve Water Quality and
Provide Wildlife Habitat</A></H2>
<P><I><B>Richard Schultz, Iowa State University</B></I></P>
<P>Bountiful production of corn and soybeans can cause pollution of streams and
groundwater. Along many miles of Iowa streams, row crops are grown down to the
stream edge or cattle are grazed in narrow bands of land that include the stream
and its flood plain. Before European settlement, Iowa had many more miles of
streams that carried cleaner water than today. Floodplain forests, prairies, and
wetlands along the streams regulated water flow and quality and provided
wildlife habitat. As these plant communities were cleared and laid fallow for
part of each year, and as many fields were tiled and stream channels were
straightened, large amounts of soil and chemicals were carried to the streams.
Streams carried more water after rains, which collapsed streambanks and caused
them to erode deeper into the landscape.</P>
<P>Concerns about water quality and an interest in reestablishing forests,
prairies, and wetlands in Iowa and the Midwest led the Iowa State Agroforestry
Research Team (IStART) and the Agroecology Issue Team of the Leopold Center for
Sustainable Agriculture to develop a streamside management system. The
multispecies system uses trees, shrubs, and prairie plants as a buffer strip
along a stream. The basic model consists of four rows of trees planted along the
stream edge, followed by two rows of shrubs and then a strip of prairie plants
planted along the edge of the crop field. This plant community provides a
frictional surface that slows surface erosion and causes water and chemicals to
soak into a &quot;living filter&quot; made up of soil, plant roots, microbes,
and soil animals. Water moving through this filter is cleaned and slowly
released to the stream channel. Many variations of this model, with widths from
50 to 100 feet, can be planted depending on the landscape features and landowner
objectives. The rich soil along the stream edge can support many species of
trees, shrubs, and prairie plants. The key is to get this plant community
rapidly established. To accomplish this, fast-growing trees such as willow,
poplar hybrids, and silver maple are usually planted in the two rows closest to
the stream. The other rows may consist of fine hardwoods such as black walnut,
oaks, and ash. Many species of shrubs can be planted to diversify the habitat
for wildlife. This system has been shown to reduce chemicals and surface erosion
by as much as 80%. Four times more bird species use this system than use the
straightened streams where corn and beans are grown to the edge. If planted as a
short- rotation woody crop or biomass energy system, all of the woody rows can
be planted with tree species such as willow, poplar hybrids, or silver maple.
The switchgrass strip provides an herbaceous energy crop.</P>
<P>Another important component of this system is the use of willows and certain
shrubs to stabilize the streambanks themselves. As much as 50&#150;60% of the
sediment carried in streams can come from the collapse of streambanks. Woody
tree and shrub species that are able to produce roots from stem segments are
pounded or pushed into the streambank, where they hold the soil in place once
they have rooted and grown tops. The amount of work needed to assure success of
this procedure depends on the height and shape of the streambank. Where
streambanks are less than four feet high, it is possible to simply push or pound
two rows of willow posts, large cuttings up to 4&#150;5 feet long, along the
bottom of the bank. Higher up the bank, smaller cuttings are pushed into the
bank. If the banks are 4&#150;10 feet in height, the toe of the bank must be
specially stabilized with rock or red cedars to reduce the chance of
undercutting and collapse of the streambank. Willow posts and cuttings are
planted between the cedars or rock. Where vertical streambanks are 10 feet or
more in height, equipment is used to produce a gentler slope (2:1). Grass may be
seeded and a fiber mat staked down before the willow and shrubs are planted. In
this case, stabilizing the toe of the bank with cedars or rock is even more
important. These streambank bioengineering techniques can effectively stop
erosion along critical streambanks and protect such structures as bridges,
buildings, and fences that may be threatened by channel erosion.</P>
<P>The last component of the streamside management system is a small
constructed wetland built within the buffer strip where a field tiledrains into
the stream. A shallow depression, no deeper than 2 feet at the center, is
excavated and planted with cattails, bulrushes, and other wetland plants. Such
wetlands, when properly designed and maintained, can remove most of the nitrate
contained in the tile water. Microbes attached to sediments and decaying plant
material use the nitrate molecule in place of oxygen to provide them air to &quot;breathe&quot;
while releasing harmless nitrogen gas into the atmosphere.</P>
<P>The streamside management system, in concert with upland conservation
practices such as minimum tillage, grass waterways, and terracing, can
effectively reduce pollution produced by agriculture. At the same time it can
provide diversified products for the landowner and a diverse habitat for
improved wildlife and aesthetics. Native trees and shrubs together with prairie
plants can help improve water quality and protect the long-term sustainability
of Iowa and Midwestern farmland.</P>

<H2><A NAME="SUNY">SUNY Uses Swedish System as a Model</A></H2>
<P><I><B>Dan Robison, SUNY</B></I></P>
<P>The wood biomass&#150;bioenergy program at the State University of New York
College of Environmental Science and Forestry (SUNY ESF) in Syracuse has focused
recent work on developing a wood biomass production system for the northeast
based on an operational system in Sweden. This agri-forest system is based on a
double-row planting of approximately 6,200 willow trees per acre and is
harvested on a 3-year coppice cycle after being cutback the first year to
promote multiple sprouting and full site occupancy.</P>
<P>Mechanized planting and harvesting equipment has been commercialized in
Europe. Equipment configurations include 2- and 4- row planters which can plant
10 in. precut cuttings or 1&#150;2 yd long whips, cutting each off at 10 in.
after insertion. Mechanized direct- chip harvesters are modified from corn and
sugar cane harvesting machines, which cut and chip in a single operation, or
from whole- stem harvesters, much like old-fashioned reapers, which cut and
stack willow or poplar stems for storage and drying in the field, and for later
movement by grapple for transport and stationary chipping. These systems are
operational in Sweden and other areas of Europe and are under development by
SUNY ESF and the University of Toronto (UT) for use in North America.</P>
<P>Research and development at SUNY ESF has concentrated on willow clones but
has also included the introduction of select hybrid poplar clones into the
system, cooperation with the UT on clonal improvement and the testing of more
than 300 willow clones, and experimental yields as high as 10.6 oven-dry tons
per acre per year. Ongoing clonal improvement through the SUNY ESF&#150;UT
efforts and through work in Sweden is expected to increase yields by as much as
20-30%. Other research topics include pest management, carbon sequestration,
nutrient cycling, organic soil amendments, clonal deployment patterns, and
economics. Scale-up activities have included a variety of clone-site and
demonstration trials including 12 acres established in 1995 and 17 acres planned
for 1996. In addition to continued support from the Biofuels Feedstock
Development Program for research and development efforts, a U.S. Department of
Agriculture grant will facilitate the establishment of a 60&#150;100 acre
research and demonstration farm in 1996.</P>
<P>In public meetings, farmers and landowners have indicated a strong interest
in bioenergy crop production. SUNY ESF along with its sponsors/cooperators has
built a broad partnership across the northeast with industry, and
nongovernmental and government agencies. The principle partners include New York
State Energy Research and Development Authority, Niagara Mohawk Power
Corporation, New York State Electric and Gas Corp., South-Central New York
Resource Conservation and Development District, Burlington Electric Department,
Empire State Electric Energy Research Corp., New York Gas Group, and UT. A
feasibility study, recently completed by this partnership for the National
Renewable Energy Laboratory and the Electric Power Research Institute, indicated
a bottom line price of $1.96 per MBtu biomass by 2001.</P>

<H2><A NAME="bea">Biomass Energy Alliance</A></H2>
<P>Recent polls have indicated that renewable energy is publicly more popular
than ever before. The Biomass Energy Alliance, a non-profit organization, was
created to make policy makers and the public aware of the many benefits of
biomass use, which is second only to hydroelectric among renewable energy
technologies, and to accelerate the development of a major new American
industry. The Alliance seeks to bring together individuals and groups who
support these objectives -- for reasons as varied as the benefits themselves. A
united coalition of researchers, farmers, environmentalists, and industry is
essential to maintaining support for biomass energy.</P>

<H2><A NAME="envirconf">Environmental Answers and Questions</A></H2>
<P><I><B>Virginia Tolbert, Biofuels Feedstock Development Program</B></I></P>
<P>	The Biofuels Feedstock Development Program (BFDP) organized a conference
entitled &quot;Environmental Effects of Biomass Crop Production. What do we
know? What do we need to know?&quot; It was held on August 7-8, 1995, in Oak
Ridge, Tennessee. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Office of Global
Climate Change and the American Forest and Paper Association provided additional
support for the conference which established a benchmark for what is known about
the environmental sustainability of perennial biomass crop production systems.
</P>
<P>	The conference addressed issues ranging from the global scale to the
site-specific scale. Greg Marland, (Oak Ridge National Laboratory) described the
potential role of biomass crops in offsetting the effects of greenhouse gases
and in reducing potential global climate changes. Robin Graham (BFDP) identified
several areas in the Tennessee valley with the potential for improved water
quality through biomass crop production. Bill Berguson (University of Minnesota,
Duluth), David Grigal (University of Minnesota, St. Paul), David Bransby (Auburn
University), and David Parrish (Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State
University) summarized carbon sequestration changes that occur with conversion
of land from traditional row crops to biomass crop production. These studies
showed that both woody and herbaceous crops can increase carbon storage on
agricultural sites. Herbaceous crops store more carbon than traditional row
crops but less than pasture and undisturbed grasslands. For the first few years
after establishment of tree crops,  carbon is lost due to soil mineralization
and erosion losses. Carbon retention increases with canopy closure.
</P>
<P>	Several speakers emphasized the positive environmental benefits. Jon Kourt
(AgCanada) and Michael Collins (University of Kentucky) showed that both woody
and herbaceous perennial biomass crops can provide site stabilization and reduce
erosion compared with annual crops. Perennial crops were also shown to be more
energy efficient and to require lower nutrient input than annual agricultural
crops by Paul Heilman (Washington State University) and Rich Norby (ORNL).
Richard Schultz, Iowa State University, vividly demonstrated the desirability of
using biomass crops to provide buffer strips along waterways and drainage areas
with photos from Iowa.  Wayne Hoffman (Audubon Society) found that switchgrass
plantings in Iowa provided habitat for species that have been previously
restricted to wetland habitat by lack of available grasslands. In Minnesota, Don
Christian and JoAnn Hanowski (University of Minnesota, Duluth) found that hybrid
poplar plantings were used more extensively than traditional row crops by both
birds and small mammals but less than native mixed forests.
</P>
<P>	Conference speakers also posed a number of questions that need to be
answered to ensure environmentally beneficial deployment of biomass crops while
meeting the economic needs of individual crop producers, local agricultural
communities, and industrial consumers at both local and regional scales. For
instance, what are the consequences of increased fertilizer use, particularly
nitrogen, to sustain or enhance yields on soil quality? What are the long-term
consequences of nutrient removal with successive crop harvesting? How can or
should nonnative or genetically transformed species of energy crops be
incorporated into existing landscapes? How can energy crops be deployed with
respect to size, shape, and existing vegetation distribution to increase habitat
connectedness?
</P>
<P>	With more than 100 attendees, the conference offered a timely opportunity
for participants to exchange information and ideas. This forum helped the BFDP
identify mechanisms to answer the questions raised. The BFDP plans to facilitate
publication of the papers presented at the conference. Watch this space for

<H2><A NAME="crpacres">Estimated Government Savings from Biomass Production on
CRP Acres</A></H2>
<P><I><B>Marie E. Walsh, Denny Becker, Robin Graham, BFDP</B></I><BR>
<I><B>Erik Lichtenberg, University of Maryland</B></I>
</P>
<P>	The Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) was enacted in the 1985 Food
Security Act (Farm Bill) as a means of removing environmentally sensitive
(primarily highly erosive) cropland from row crop production. Farmers offer to
remove vulnerable cropland (generally for a 10-year period) in exchange for
annual rental payments. Currently, 36.4 million acres in the United States are
enrolled in the CRP. The annual cost of the program is approximately $1.8
billion. Given current federal budget constraints, modifications to the CRP have
been suggested for the 1995 Farm Bill. U.S. Department of Agriculture Secretary
Glickman has suggested modifying the program to allow economic use of the CRP
acres under specified conditions (haying and grazing, biomass energy crop
production) in exchange for reduced rental payments. 
</P>
<P>	The U.S. Department of Energy, through the Biofuels Feedstock Development
Program at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, has supported development of
short-rotation woody crops (e.g., hybrid poplar, hybrid willow) and herbaceous
crops (e.g., switchgrass) to produce power, liquid fuels, and chemicals. These
crops are among those currently grown on CRP acres for their environmental
benefit; however, they cannot presently be harvested and sold. Under the
proposed changes to the CRP program, these crops could be sold in exchange for
reduced rental payments.  If conducted appropriately, harvest of these crops
will not significantly reduce the environmental benefits of the program.
</P>
<P>	Estimates of the potential 10-year savings to the federal government
resulting from reduced rental payments in exchange for the sale of short
rotation woody crops or switchgrass produced on CRP acres are presented in
Figures 1 and 2. The analysis includes all CRP acres considered suitable for
biomass production from the mid Plains states eastward (about 17.4 million acres
for switchgrass and 14.2 million acres for hybrid poplar). The western regions
of the U.S. have been excluded from the analysis due to the lack of available
data regarding likely biomass yields and production costs in these regions.
</P>

</P>
<P><B>Figure 2: Potential CRP savings-Switchgrass. Selected Biomass prices and
yields.</B>
<IMG ALIGN="bottom" SRC="swbtu2.gif">
</P>
<P>	Estimates are made for 3 yield levels for switchgrass and hybrid poplar
(weighted national average yields for 4 regions and 11 subregions), and 6 market
prices for biomass (price offered to biomass producer). The analysis assumes the
same distribution of CRP rental rates that occurs in the twelfth CRP sign-up.
Farm income per CRP acre with biomass production is restricted to being at least
equal to the income earned from CRP rental payments without biomass production.
The estimates assume that the CRP acres are planted entirely with hybrid poplar
(Figure 1) or entirely with switchgrass (Figure 2) and that the stands remain in
production for 10 years. Intermediate savings would result from simultaneous
production.
</P>
<P>	Government savings are estimated as the difference between the cost of the
CRP program with no economic use of the acreage and the cost of the program with
economic use allowed. The cost of the program with no economic use is the
10-year net present value of the annual rental payments plus a one time charge
of  of the establishment cost. The estimated government program cost with
economic use (biomass production) includes a one-time charge of  of the
establishment costs plus the 10-year net present value of

<UL>
<LI>Zero rental payments if the profit from the sale of biomass (i.e., biomass
price  biomass yield  biomass production cost) is greater than the CRP rental
rate,</LI>

profit from the sale of biomass is greater than zero but less than the CRP
rental rate,</LI>
<LI>the CRP rental rate plus the difference between the CRP rental rate and the
biomass profit if the profit from the sale of biomass is less than zero (i.e., a
government subsidy).</LI></UL>
<P>For example, at annual national yield levels of 4 and 3 dry tons/acre for
switchgrass and hybrid poplar respectively, farmers would need to receive a
market price of at least $1.50/MBtu ($27.75/dry ton) for switchgrass and
$2.25/MBtu ($37.13/dry ton) for hybrid poplar to generate biomass profits
greater than zero. Positive biomass profits offer, at least in theory, an
opportunity to reduce CRP rental payments in exchange for the right to produce
and sell biomass. The savings estimated should be interpreted as an upper bound.
The production and harvest of biomass will entail additional resources on the
farmers' part, primarily labor. Thus, farmers may not be willing to accept as
large a reduction in rental payments as this analysis assumes.
</P>
<P>	Higher yields such as 6 and 7 dry tons/acre for switchgrass and hybrid
poplar can potentially result in significantly greater government savings.
Sustained research funding will be needed to increase yields from the 4-5 dry
tons/acre currently expected. The payoff, however, could be substantial.
</P>
<P>	The use of CRP acres for biomass production reduces the required market
prices and improves the reactive competitiveness of biomass energy compared to
fossil fuels. Current coal and natural gas prices are approximately $1.30/MBtu
and $1.65/MBtu delivered respectively. Advances in biomass management and
harvest strategies can potentially decrease biomass production costs below those
used in this analysis and further improve the competitive position of biomass.

<H2><A NAME="market">To Market, To Market with Biomass Energy Crops . . . But
Where? And When?</A></H2>
<P><B><I>Mark Downing,</I> BFDP</B>
</P>
<P>Wheres the market? When will commercialization take place? These and other
related questions are being asked by potential producers and consumers of
biomass feedstocks.
</P>
<P>	As recently as five years ago, short-rotation woody crops such as
genetically superior hybrid poplar clones were just being adopted in large
plantings by the pulp and paper industry. The trees were planted for use in pulp
mills although energy was a co-product after harvest.
</P>
<P>	Recently, new emphasis has been given to understanding the economics of
using woody and/or herbaceous crops for a variety of energy production
processes. In response to the U.S. Department of Energy's Economic Development
Through Biomass Systems Integration solicitation, ten site-specific feasibility
studies were initiated. All regions of the country were represented and
industrial participation was strong. The results of these studies show the
interdependence and integration of supply and demand systems. The National
Renewable Energy Laboratory in Golden, Colorado is preparing the study reports
for publication.
</P>
<P>	However, these individual studies do not clarify how regional markets will
develop for energy feedstocks. There are several steps that can be taken by
community or regional organizations to develop markets...and the important word
in that statement is <I>develop</I>. Markets do not just happen. They are
developed and they evolve over time.
</P>
<P>	New business efforts are stimulated and guided by market research. Market
research can help identify the range of potential customers such as ethanol
producers, electric power producers, and the fiber industry as well as heating
and cogeneration opportunities. It can also identify the specific requirements
of each potential customer, including feedstock requirements. As potential
customers are defined, the size of potential regional markets can be defined.
</P>
<P>	To facilitate market development, the relationship between cost and supply
of biomass feedstocks in the region must be analyzed. This information, combined
with estimates of the annual, monthly, and daily feedstock consumption of
potential customers, will allow planners to assess the mix of industries that
can be supported and their total economic impact on the region. Project planners
will also need this information to analyze scale and efficiency issues,
including the interactions between facility size, capital investments, and
operating costs.
</P>
<P>	Next, market research should identify publicly available or easily
obtainable indicators that can be used to estimate the consumption level of the
resulting energy products, including long-term growth and investment incentives
that residential and industrial energy users might create. Focusing only on
individual facilities rather than total regional impacts is inappropriate. For
example, public schools in the State of Vermont which could be considered &quot;small
markets&quot; have provided enough demand for feedstock and heating conversion
systems to be a significant market for wood residues in that region.
</P>
<P>	Concurrently, the opportunity for farmer-producers to enhance their income
through expanding the production and marketing of biomass feedstocks must be
analyzed. An individual farmer-producer decides what land, labor, and capital to
allocate to energy crops. The sum of all decisions made by farmer-producers in a
region affects the supply available to market channels. Joint risk management on
the part of the feedstock producers and feedstock consumer helps the
farmer-producer choose the production and marketing alternatives that are most
consistent with the farmer's profit objectives and willingness and ability to
bear risk.1 Long term contracts between feedstock producers and feedstock
consumers, combined with annual payments to farmers, can reduce the risk of
market failure.
</P>
<P>	To develop energy markets for biomass feedstocks, several specific things
must happen. Long-term demand for energy must be sufficient for firms to locate
energy production facilities in a region. Feedstock purchasers and farmers must
agree on payment and delivery schedules. An adequate supply of capital must
exist, and an infrastructure must be available or easily developed to support
transportation, storage and handling of the feedstock.
</P>
<P>	Although each region may have a different cost structure for biomass
feedstocks, regional similarities will exist in the ways in which markets
actually develop. Industries looking for investment opportunities and farmers
who are thinking about an alternative enterprise for their operation will rely
on marketing studies. They will also look to other regions and markets for
models of agricultural products that most closely resemble energy feedstocks in
seasonality, price level, and stability. Because potential energy markets are
very large, all regions have much to gain by sharing such information.

<P>The last six months have been extremely busy ones for the Biofuels Feedstock
Development Program staff. We've been on the road quite a bit--monitoring field
research, participating in round tables and planning meetings, meeting with our
counterparts at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory and Department of
Energy sponsors, and preparing conference papers. This hectic schedule, coupled
with the preparation of materials for the Biofuels Information Network, has
caused <I>Energy Crops Forum</I> to take a back seat. This issue highlights
some of our recent publications, tells you about some important conferences,
describes the Biofuels Information Network, and, finally, teases you with
abstracts of papers authored or coauthored by the BFDP staff and subcontractors.
Please take the time to let me know what you would find interesting in future
issues. Even better, consider submitting something for publication.</P>

Supply and Cost of Biomass from Energy Crops in the TVA Region</A></B></I></DT>
<DD><I>Robin Graham and Mark Downing</I>. April 1995. ORNL-6858.</DD></DL>
<P>Establishing the likely price and supply of energy crop biomass in a region
is a complex task because biomass is not a known commodity like oil, natural
gas, and coal. In this study, the cost and supply of biomass from short-rotation
woody crops and switchgrass are projected for the Tennessee Valley Authority
region--a 276-county area that includes portions of 11 states in the
southeastern United States. Projected prices and quantities of biomass are
calculated as a function of the amount and quality of crop and pasture land
available in a region, expected energy crop yields and production costs on
differing soils and land types, and the profit that could be obtained from
current conventional crop production on these same lands. Results include the
supply curves of short-rotation woody crop and switchgrass biomass projected to
be available from the entire region, the amount and location of crop and pasture
land that would be used, and the conventional agricultural crops that would be
displaced as a function of energy crop production. The results of sensitivity
analysis on the projected cost and supply of energy crop biomass are also shown.
In particular, the separate impacts of varying energy crop production costs and
yields, as well as interest rates, are examined.

Herbaceous Biomass Crops.</I></B></DT>
<DD> <I>John Ferrell, Acting Director, Biofuels Systems Division, U.S.
Department of Energy, and Lynn Wright and Gerald Tuskan, BFDP</I></DD></DL>
<P>The U.S. Department of Energy's Biofuels Feedstock Development Program has
led the nation in developing short-rotation woody crops and herbaceous energy
crops as feedstocks for renewable energy. During the past 15 years, BFDP has
examined the performance of 154 woody species and 35 herbaceous species in field
trials across the United States. It has managed research projects involving more
than 100 federal, university, and private research institutions. One result of
this effort to date has been the prescription of silvicultural systems for
hybrid poplars and hybrid willows and agricultural systems for switchgrass.
Selected clones of woody species are producing dry-weight yields in research
plots on agricultural land that are 3 to 7 times greater than those obtained
from mixed species stands on forest land and that are at least 2 times the
yields of southern plantation pines. Selected switchgrass varieties are
producing dry-weight yields 2 to 7 times greater than average forage grass
yields on similar sites. Crop development research is continuing efforts to
translate this potential, in a sustainable manner, to larger, more
geographically diverse acreage. Research on environmental aspects of biomass
crop production is aimed at developing sustainable systems that will contribute
to the biodiversity of agricultural landscapes. Systems integration aims to
understand all factors affecting bringing the crop to market. Factors affecting
price and potential supplies of biomass crops are being evaluated at regional
and national scales. Scale-up studies, feasibility analyses and demonstrations
are establishing actual costs and facilitating the commercialization of
integrated biomass systems. Information management and dissemination activities
are facilitating the communication of results among a community of researchers,
policymakers, and potential users and producers of energy crops.</P>

<DT><B><I>Demonstration and Commercial Production of Biomass for Energy.</I></B></DT>
<DD><I>Lynn Wright, BFDP</I></DD></DL>
<P>Five years ago, environmentally benign biomass crop technologies were only
beginning to be commercialized and they were being used for products other than
fuels. Twenty organizations in the United States and Canada could be identified
that had plantings of at least 50 acres of short-rotation woody crops.  Of
those, 12 were established by forest products companies. All commercial activity
was with woody crops because herbaceous crops were still being evaluated by the
DOE program. Since then, significant progress has been made in identifying the
potential of a herbaceous crop-- switchgrass--as an environmentally desirable
and highly productive potential energy feedstock. The harvest and use of hybrid
poplars for pulp and paper production have clearly demonstrated the value of
genetically superior hybrid poplar clones. Significant progress has been made in
developing sophisticated techniques that will enable even more improvement of
hybrid poplars for a variety of locations. Interest is emerging from the forest
products industry in all parts of the country regarding the potential of
short-rotation woody crops. While the primary use of commercially planted woody
crops continues to be for pulp and paper, energy is a coproduct in nearly all
situations. Additionally, some serious consideration is being given to the
economics of using woody and herbaceous crops for a variety of energy production
processes. Feasibility studies have been or are being conducted by ten or more
groups around the country and several serious proposals for biomass energy
demonstrations have recently been received by the U.S. Department of Energy in
response to a solicitation for  cost-shared demonstration projects. There
continue to be numerous constraints to the commercialization of biomass crops
for energy without federal assistance or policy modifications. The success of
research and demonstrations over the next 5 years will be key to determining the
rate of adoption of biomass energy technologies in the United States.</P>

Demonstration Projects in Perspective.</B></I></DT>
<DD><I>Thomas Kroll, Minnesota Department of Natural Resources--Forestry, and
Mark Downing, BFDP</I></DD></DL>
<P>Scale-up projects are an important step toward demonstration and
commercialization of woody biomass because simply planting extensive acreage of
hybrid poplar will not develop markets. Project objectives are to document the
cost to plant and establish woody biomass on agricultural land as well as the
effort needed to monitor and maintain it. Conversion technologies and
alternative end uses are examined in a larger framework in order to afford
researchers and industrial partners information necessary to develop supply and
demand on a local or regional scale. Likely to be determined are risk factors of
crop failure and differences between establishment of research plots and
agricultural scale field work. Production economics are only one consideration
in understanding demonstration and scale-up. Others are environmental,
marketing, industrial, and agricultural in nature. Markets for energy crops are
only beginning to develop. Although information collected as a result of
planting up to 5000 acres of hybrid poplar in central Minnesota will not
necessarily be transferable to other areas of the country, a national
perspective will come from development of regional markets for woody and
herbaceous crops. Several feedstocks, with alternative markets in different
regions, will eventually constitute the entire picture of biofuels feedstock
market development. Current projects offer opportunities to learn about the
complexity and requirements that will move biomass from research and development
to actual market development.

<DT><I><B>Energy, Economic, and Environmental Implications of Production of
Grasses as Biomass Feedstocks.</B></I></DT>
<DD> <I>Mark Downing, Sandy McLaughlin, and Marie Walsh, BFDP</I></DD></DL>
<P>Perennial prairie grasses offer many advantages to the developing biofuels
industry. High-yielding  varieties of native prairie grasses such as switchgrass
combine lower levels of nutrient demand, diverse geographical growing range,
high net energy yields, and high soil and water conservation potential. These
advantages provide strong reasons that the grasses could and should supplement
annual row crops such as corn in developing alternative fuels markets. Favorable
net energy returns, increased soil erosion prevention, and a geographically
diverse land base that can incorporate energy grasses into conventional farm
practices will provide direct benefits to local and regional farm economies and
lead to accelerated commercialization of conversion technologies. Displacement
of row crops with perennial grasses will have major agricultural, economic,
sociological, and cross-market implications. Thus, perennial grass production
for biofuels offers significant economic advantages to a national energy
strategy that considers both agricultural and environmental issues.

<DT><I><B>Environmental Effects of Planting Biomass Crops at Larger Scales on
Agricultural Lands.</B></I></DT>
<DD><I>Virginia Tolbert and Mark Downing, BFDP</I></DD></DL>
<P>A shift from research-scale to larger scale plantings of herbaceous and
short-rotation woody crops on agricultural land in the United States has raised
questions about the positive and negative environmental effects of farmland
conversion. Research currently under way at experimental plot scales enables us
to examine runoff quality and quantity, erosion, and changes in soil
characteristics associated with energy crops and compare the results to facts
associated with conventional row crops. A study of the fate of chemicals applied
to the different crop types will enhance our knowledge of uptake, release, and
off-site movement of nutrients and pesticides. Ongoing biodiversity studies in
the north central United States allow us to compare the effects that different
planting scales have on bird and small mammal populations and habitat use.
Plantings of 50-100 or more contiguous acres are needed to allow both
researchers and producers to determine the benefits of including temporal energy
crop rotations in the landscape. Results from these larger scale plantings will
help identify (1) the monitoring requirements needed to determine environmental
effects of larger scale plantings, (2) the best methods to determine the
environmental effects of rotation length, and (3) the best crop management
strategies for full-scale production. Because of the variations in soils,
temperature, rainfall, and other climatic conditions, as well as differences in
the types of energy crops most suited to different regions, monitoring of
large-scale plantings in these different regions of the United States will be
required to predict the environmental effects of regional agricultural land-use
shifts to full-scale plantings.

Woody Crop Plantings?</B></I></DT>
<DD><I>Mark Downing and Gerald Tuskan, BFDP</I></DD></DL>
<P>For more than a decade, researchers have used small-scale research plots to
assist development and selection of high-yielding, pest-resistant clones of
fast-growing hardwoods such as hybrid poplar (<I>Populus</I> spp.). Substantial
advances have been made in the techniques and criteria for screening species and
selecting clones. Data from these research plots indicate that the ultimate
performance of selected clones is dependent upon variable factors in the
environment. Until now, researchers could determine only the suitability of a
given site for such clones, not the actual yield potential of the site. Recently
in the north central United States, several clones were planted on
larger-than-research-scale plots on private land recontracted under the
Conservation Reserve Program.
</P>
<P>Historical data could not provide a framework that would allow producers to
predict the yield potential of a particular clone on a specific site. Through a
systematic combination of clonal trials on experimental research-scale plots and
operational plantings on 50- to 100-acre agricultural-scale field plots, it may
be possible to develop yield functions or site quality equations that would
predict biomass yields at rotation for selected clones. Such estimates will (1)
reduce the probability of planting failure, (2) allow maximum expression of the
genetic potential of selected superior clones, and thus (3) facilitate accurate
economic planning for both the producer and the conversion facility manager.

Biomass Energy Systems: the Importance of Scale.</B></I></DT>
<DD><I>Robin Graham and Marie Walsh, BFDP</I></DD></DL>
<P>The economic and environmental costs, benefits, and tradeoffs of bioenergy
from dedicated biomass energy systems must be addressed in the context of the
scale of interest. At different scales there are different economic and
environmental features and processes to consider. The depth of our understanding
of the processes and features that influence the potential of energy crops also
varies with scale, as do the quality and kinds of data that are needed and
available. Finally, the appropriate models to use for predicting economic and
environmental impacts change with the scale of the questions. This paper
explores these issues at three scales: the individual firm, the community, and
the nation.

<P>Following the principles set by the National Biofuels Roundtable, a workshop
held in March 1995 brought together a  group of stakeholders and experts in the
field of biomass energy and ecology. The mission of the workshop was to identify
and set priorities for ecological research to ensure that large-scale biomass
energy development occurs in an ecologically sound, sustainable manner. The
workshop participants found that questions about the landscape-scale deployment
of biomass plantations were most pressing. The participants recommended that
adaptive resource management principles be applied in a phased development of
increasingly larger plantations. Each phase of development would help to answer
questions about landscape-scale development and help to design the following
phases to minimize impacts. Principles of sustainable agriculture should also be
applied to biomass plantations to help minimize impact on soils and water
quality and to maintain productivity. Results of the workshop will be helpful to
natural resource and research agencies as well as utilities and biomass energy
developers.

<P><I>Marie Walsh, BFDP </I>
</P>
<P>Farmers, policymakers, and chemical and electrical companies are
increasingly interested in biomass energy systems due to the many air, soil, and
water quality benefits they offer. New policies to encourage biomass
commercialization and decisions to use or produce biomass will depend on its
economic competitiveness relative to other energy supplies. A major determinant
of competitiveness is the cost of producing the energy crop.
</P>
<P>We have estimated switchgrass production costs in the Lake States (Michigan,
Minnesota, Wisconsin); Corn Belt (Iowa, Illinois, Indiana, Missouri, Ohio);
Southeast (Alabama, Georgia, South Carolina); Appalachia (Kentucky, North
Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia); North Plains (Kansas, Nebraska,
North Dakota, South Dakota); and South Plains (Oklahoma, Texas). These regions
correspond to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Economic Research Service
major crop production regions. Switchgrass can be grown in other states as well.
</P>
<P>Switchgrass is not produced currently for commercial sale; historical
production cost data are not available. Production costs estimated in the
analysis are based on assumptions regarding likely management practices.
Machinery specifications are used to calculate the number of hours required for
each production operation. Costs per acre are calculated by multiplying the
per-hour machinery costs by the number of hours in operation. All input costs
are in 1993 dollars.
</P>
<P>The analysis does not include transportation costs from the site of
production to the end user. These costs are expected to be about $0.10 per dry
ton per mile for hauling distances of less than 50 miles.
</P>
<P>Variable cash costs of production are presented in Table 1. Variable cash
costs are the out-of-pocket expenses of production and include expenditures for
seeds, fertilizers, chemicals, twine, machinery repair, and fuel and
lubrication. For short-run farmer decisions regarding which crop to plant each
year, variable cash costs are the most relevant costs.

<P>Switchgrass is a perennial and, once established, can remain productive for
many years. The analysis assumes that switchgrass stands remain in production
for 10 years. Establishment costs are annualized over the 10-year stand life
using a 7.5 percent discount rate.
</P>
<P>The analysis also assumes that switchgrass is produced by individual farm
operators who own the necessary equipment. Costs are estimated for two different
machinery complements a large-scale and a small-scale complement  typically
associated with larger and smaller farms. The costs shown in Tables 1 and 2 are
averages of the two estimates. If farm operators do not own haying equipment
(i.e., mowers, rakes, balers) and must rely on custom harvesting, costs will be
higher.
</P>
<P>In the analysis, fields are prepared for planting by plowing and disking.
Weed control is important for establishment; herbicide applications are
included. Phosphorous, potassium, and lime are added as needed before planting;
levels assumed in the analysis are typical of those used for other crops in the
region.
</P>
<P>In the years following establishment, nitrogen fertilizer is applied in
quantities sufficient to replace that removed as a result of harvesting;
quantity applied is generally about 0.5 percent of yield.
</P>
<P>Only one harvest per year is assumed. Harvest costs are adjusted for yield.
As yields increase, the per acre harvesting cost correspondingly increases, but
the per ton harvesting cost decreases.
</P>
<P>The yields used in the analysis are based on research plot data and expert
opinion. Yields are expected to be low during the establishment year, increase
during years 2 and 3, and maintain a relatively constant annual yield in years 4
through 10. Harvesting losses of about 5 to 7 percent of growth have been
included in the analysis. Long-term storage losses, expected to be about 10 to
13 percent for bales stored outside on the ground, are not included in the
analysis.
</P>
<P>Production costs for each farm operation will vary from these estimated
costs depending on local conditions and management practices. However, the
estimated production costs provide a basis for analyzing the regional costs and
profitability of switchgrass production in the United States. The complete
study, with documentation of data and methodology, will be published as an ORNL
report some time in 1995.

<H2><A NAME="hawaii">Hawaiian researchers model alternative land use</A></H2>
<P><I>Victor D. Phillips, Wei Liu, and Robert A. Merriam; College of Tropical
Agriculture and Human Resources, University of Hawaii at Manoa, Honolulu, HI
96822 </I>
</P>
<P>A research team in the College of Tropical Agriculture and Human Resources
at the University of Hawaii at Manoa has developed a decision support system for
those interested in short-rotation, intensive-culture (SRIC) forestry on former
sugarcane and pineapple plantation lands to produce a variety of wood products,
including renewable biofuels. The system has three integrated components: (1)
empirical SRIC yield models of promising tropical hardwoods (Eucalyptus spp.)
that were constructed using growth data, site characteristics, and management
variables from field trials in Hawaii; (2) a SRIC biomass system model of
production costs, including establishment, maintenance, harvesting, transport,
and storage; and (3) a geographical information system to extend the analysis to
areas where no field trials exist and to present the results as a map. Our
system can predict the potential biomass supply (dry ton) and delivered cost
($/dry ton) of Eucalyptus spp. at potentially available locations for tree
plantations on both an island-wide scale for general land-use planning and a
specific-site scale for field-level recommendations.
</P>
<P>The Hilo coast plantations that were modeled could provide more than 1.8
million dry tons over 7 years; most of the feedstock would cost under $36/dry
ton. Using an optimized SRIC management strategy that recommends a planting
density of 578 trees/acre and 7 years of age at harvest, the average cost of
chips delivered to the Pepeekeo factory is $36/dry ton. The least-cost
production target is the minimum delivered cost of <I>E. saligna</I> from the
Hilo coast plantation to the bioconversion facility achieved by optimizing
growing space and rotation age. A prediction of the potential biomass supply of
<I>E. saligna</I> from the Hilo coast indicates that 220,000 dry tons/year
could be produced at $36/dry ton. Sensitivity analyses revealed that delivered
cost is affected mostly by biomass yield and harvesting costs.
</P>
<P>These results were then used with specific bioconversion processes for
estimating the costs of manufacturing energy products at a plant capacity of 25
million gallons/year for ethanol and methanol fuels and 25 MWe for electricity.
Calculations for ethanol production were based on a simultaneous
saccharification and fermentation system that would produce 100 gallons
ethanol/dry ton and would require approximately 245,000 dry tons of feedstock
annually. Calculations for methanol production were based on a low-pressure
indirect gasifier with hot-gas conditioning and methanol synthesis that would
provide 86 gallons methanol/dry ton and would require approximately 148,000 dry
tons of feedstock annually. Electricity calculations were based on a fixed-bed
gasifier coupled to an open-cycle turbine that would generate 393 kWh/dry ton
feedstock and would require approximately 110,000 dry tons of feedstock
annually.
</P>
<P>Preliminary levelized cost estimates are $1.21/gallon for ethanol,
$0.80/gallon for methanol, and $0.071/kWh for electricity. For comparison, the
prices of the current sources of energy in Hawaii are roughly $1.51/gallon for
unleaded regular gasoline and $0.10 0.12/kWh for electricity generated by
burning residual fuel oil, which fluctuates between $15 20/barrel.
</P>
<P>In Hawaii, the SRIC biomass system model can reliably estimate yield and
optimized economic costs of tropical hardwood production at the state, county
(island), and plantation (field) levels. The decision-support tools and
information are useful to land owners and decision-makers in evaluating the
economic viability of short-rotation forestry in Hawaii, including growing
biomass crops for manufacturing energy products. This methodology is readily
transferable to other areas of the United States and to the rest of the world.

<H2><A NAME="intern">Intern birdwatches for BFDP</A></H2>
<P><I>Nathan Rice; University of Wisconsin, Stevens Point</I>
</P>
<P>In July 1994, Audubon ornithologist Wayne Hoffman and I conducted the second
of two bird surveys for the BFDP  in switchgrass plantings near Centerville,
Iowa. The study site contains nearly 400 acres of switchgrass. It is owned by
the Iowa Department of Natural Resources and is managed as public hunting land.
</P>
<P>Seven fields on this site were separated into two survey areas. Area one
included a newly planted switchgrass field (points 1 and 2), a switchgrass field
planted in 1993 (points 3 and 4), and a switchgrass planting harvested in 1993
(points 5-8). Vegetation at points 1 and 2 was approximately 2 feet high and
contained 90% switchgrass stems. Weeds grew where switchgrass had not
established. Common yellowthroats were the most commonly observed bird in this
area, although the number of birds detected was low.
</P>
<P>At points 3 and 4 the vegetation was more than 3 feet tall and was again
mainly switchgrass. Dickcissels, common yellowthroats, and a few grasshopper
sparrows were observed. Points 5-8 contained little switchgrass. Only 30% of the
area, typically lowland, had vigorously growing switchgrass; the majority of the
site had been invaded by weeds. This area had the highest singing male densities
of dickcissels and grasshopper sparrows.
</P>
<P>Points 1 and 2 in the second study area were located in a field planted with
big bluestem and switchgrass. Vegetation height ranged from 2-4 feet. Sedge
wrens, common yellowthroats, and dickcissels were common at these points. Points
3 and 4 were planted with switchgrass on upland areas and orchard grass in lower
areas. The switchgrass was approximately 3 feet high. Flocks of more than 100
red-winged blackbirds were sighted at these points along with numerous
forest-edge species (northern cardinal, gray catbird, and brown thrasher). The
third field (points 5-7) had been planted in 1993 with switchgrass that was now
more than 4 feet high. Sedge wrens, dickcissels, and red-winged blackbirds were
the most abundant birds at these points. Points 8 and 9 were located near a
small stand of trees and the previously mentioned switchgrass field. Forest
birds (northern cardinal, northern oriole, black-capped chickadee, house wren,
and downy woodpecker) were common at these points.
</P>
<P>Sedge wrens and grasshopper sparrows should be considered as indicators of
habitat quality when evaluating the habitat value of herbaceous energy crops.
Sedge wrens preferred lush, dense, lowland switchgrass sites while the
grasshopper sparrows tended to inhabit drier, upland sites. Both species are in
decline and their presence in switchgrass plantings is an indication that
herbaceous energy crops can potentially provide usable habitat for wildlife.
</P>
<P>Information gained from these surveys has highlighted areas in need of
further study and has provided baseline data for comparison with scale-up
projects. In all cases, breeding grassland bird densities were higher in 1994
than in 1993. This is most likely a function of the weather and the age and size
of the grass. More research is needed on larger, more intensively managed
switchgrass fields. Research should also be considered on multiple species
plantings and grasses should also be considered.

<H2><A NAME="crp">CRP lands for biofuels production?</A></H2>
<P><I>Sandy McLaughlin, BFDP</I>
</P>
<P>At a time when the scientific community is considering the potential role of
biofuels for conversion to transportation fuels and power production, the issue
of land availability is an important one. It has been projected that 10 million
acres of land will be required if ethanol production increases from its present
1 billion gallons annually to 5 billion by 2000.
</P>
<P>Where will this land come from and how rapidly can such wide-scale
implementation occur? The answer lies partly in the hands of Congress as it
debates the fate of over 36 million acres of the Conservation Reserve Program
(CRP).
</P>
<P>In 1985 Congress established the CRP to protect cropland from further
deterioration by removing erodible crop lands from cultivation. The program
provides a subsidy to farmers to plant perennial grasses or trees that would
conserve soil resources and provide wildlife habitat. Over 36 million acres of
cropland primarily in the Midwest, south central, and Southeast were eventually
enrolled in the program. The current annual cost of the CRP is approximately $6
billion per year, a significant issue as a budget-conscious Congress considers
renewing the program as part of the 1995 Farm Bill.
</P>
<P>A number of important issues should be considered. How effective has the CRP
been? Is the program a net cost or a net benefit to the nation when viewed in
the longer term? What will be the impacts on American agriculture if the program
ends after 1995? And finally, are there alternative uses for this land that
would offer farmers additional options besides a return to traditional crop
production?
</P>
<P>Critics have said that the CRP is an unjustifiable cost to American
taxpayers while proponents tout resource conservation, improved soil quality,
wildlife diversity, reduced erosion, and sedimentation of wetlands. If the CRP
was eliminated, payments would be reduced. However, the reduction could be
offset by crop subsidies if the lands were returned to agricultural production.
</P>
<P>It appears unlikely that Congress will include the CRP in its current form
in the 1995 Farm Bill. There could be substantial consequences. A majority of
CRP contracts will expire in 1997. Surveys of landowners currently participating
in the CRP indicate that there would be a rapid return of much of this land to
row crop production. Commodity payments for subsidized crops will increase if
current programs are maintained as a result of the downward price pressure
exerted by increased supplies, and soil degradation will once again take place.
</P>
<P>Could CRP land be used for production of biofuels while still meeting many
of the soil conservation requirements for which the program was established? In
the case of perennial grasses the answer would certainly seem to be  Yes.  
</P>
<P>Current annual erosion losses are estimated at 1.2 billion metric tons per
year and much of that is due to intense cultivation associated with annual crop
production. Erosion losses associated with corn cultivation in Iowa, for
example, are approximately 70 times greater than for production of grasses on
similar land. In addition, deep rooted native perennial grasses replace a
significant fraction of the soil organic carbon (SOC) that has been depleted by
decades of cultivation. SOC is extremely important in controlling nutrient and
water retention in soils.
</P>
<P>Switchgrass, which is one of the native grasses recommended by the Soil
Conservation Service, has been identified as a model herbaceous energy crop by
the Biofuels Feedstock Development Program (BFDP). Research sponsored by BFDP at
both Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University and Auburn University
document high levels of deep rooting activity. Switchgrass was also found to
increase soil organic matter and improve soil quality. Soil Conservation Service
studies in Texas, Kansas, and Nebraska have shown a gain of about 0.5 tons of
carbon per acre per year during 5 years of CRP grass production, replacing about
25% of the soil carbon lost by decades of cultivation. The poorer quality, more
erodible land, which has been one of the targets of CRP, is expected to be very
suitable for production of perennial grasses such as switchgrass which have
lower requirements for nutrients and water than annual crops such as corn. If a
market is available, grass production on those erosive soils may be more
profitable to farmers than a return to annual crops.
</P>
<P>Thus, in many ways, CRP makes good economic and ecological sense. What would
also seem to make good sense is a  hybrid  CRP program that would be tailored to
both the closely affiliated soil and energy conservation needs of CRP and
renewable energy crops. The economic and ecological facets of such a merger of
interests are intriguing and deserve consideration. Important considerations are
how fast the markets for biofuels will develop, how flexible we can be in
designing multiple-use policies that benefit the nation and its farmers, and our
patience and vision. It s an interesting challenge and opportunity!

<P>Alison Moore, an agricultural economist with the Energy Technology Support
Unity (ETSU), a technology transfer and support organization of the United
Kingdom's Department of Trade and Labor spent three weeks at Oak Ridge National
Laboratory working with the BFDP. With Robin Graham, BFDP s systems integration
task leader, Moore examined the projected prices of different quantities of
woody crops biomass delivered to 21 locations across the state of Tennessee. The
price and supply information was derived from a county-level biomass database
developed by BFDP. BRAVO, a GIS-based computer model developed by the University
of Tennessee, was used to calculate transportation costs associated with
supplying biomass to specific locations. This analysis was an extension of work
originally sponsored by the Tennessee Valley Authority and the Electric Power
Research Institute.
</P>
<P>The analysis is one of the first to consider the effects of spatial
variation in biomass transport costs and prices paid to farmers on the marginal
cost of supplying biomass. The investigation revealed that location-related
differences existed even at low demands (100,000 dry tons per year   sufficient
to support a 20-MW power plant). At this demand level, marginal costs were
lowest in the central and the far southwest portion of the state, ranging from
$35 to $40 per delivered dry ton. Location-related differences were amplified
and costs were higher at high demand (1 million dry tons per year   sufficient
to support a large ethanol plant). At this demand level, the costs were lowest
in the north central portion of the state, about $43 per delivered dry ton.
</P>
<P>Graham is planning a visit to the United Kingdom where she will work with
ETSU's biomass supply model. Exchanges such as these represent international
biomass technology transfer and facilitate the development of biomass energy
worldwide.
</P>
<P>Melora Doan, University of Tennessee, has worked with the BFDP for the past
year and a half under the direction of Jack Ranney, former task leader for
environmental analysis, on several natural resource projects directly related to
her wildlife management major. Field surveys of wildlife populations in energy
crop plantations and research papers about wetlands, flooding, biodiversity, and
producer concerns in growing energy crops were some of her major tasks.
</P>
<P>Melora said, &quot;I learned new ways of considering aspects of
sustainability, valuation, and ecological function. This experience has given me
new tools to use when considering how to enhance both economic and natural
resource values. The internship provided opportunities to be a contributing
member of the BFDP team, increased my knowledge about field work, ecological
processes, economics, resource sustainability, and the whims of nature. I have
had the opportunity to attend conferences and meetings that introduced me to new
technologies and their impact on our natural resources. I have also met many
researchers and resource professionals who have been very generous with their
knowledge and time in helping me understand the biofuels field and complete my
projects. These valuable insights taught me how to focus both on the  big
picture  as well as the essential elements of a situation. My writing skills
have improved as have my research and organizational skills. Keeping my desk
orderly, however, is a skill I have not mastered. The publications certainly
make my resume look better. &quot;</P>

<H2><A NAME="drought">Poplar drought tolerance investigated</A></H2>
<P><I>Tim Tschaplinski, BFDP</I>
</P>
<P>Tim Tschaplinski and Jerry Tuskan, BFDP, are cooperating with Boise Cascade
Corporation to study drought tolerance of several poplar (<I>Populus</I>)
species and their hybrid offspring. The work seeks to verify whether certain
biochemical indicators can be used to predict which clones of poplar can best
survive episodic periods of little or no rain and still be productive (i.e.,
drought tolerant).
</P>
<P>Previous work, detailed in two recent papers published in the <I>Canadian
Journal of Forest Research</I>, found that the concentrations of several
metabolites are highly correlated with drought tolerance. For this project, the
researchers' mission is to validate the use of these plant metabolites (solutes
involved in plant metabolism) as biochemical indicators (i.e., molecular
selection criteria) for drought tolerance in poplar trees. Seven clones of 2-
year-old hybrid <I>Populus</I> grown by Boise Cascade under six levels of
moisture stress at two sites in a drought stress facility in eastern Oregon will
form the nucleus of the research activities. ORNL researchers will also screen
80 to 90 genotypes   individuals sharing a unique genetic makeup to assess the
validity of molecular selection criteria in large-scale field trials.
</P>
<P>Criteria that prove to be correlated with drought tolerance will be mapped
on the Populus genome. If the molecular selection criteria are validated, poplar
clones found to be most drought tolerant may be used as dedicated energy
feedstocks - sources of wood for liquid transportation fuels - in a renewable
energy industry. The ability to use molecular selection criteria will reduce the
amount of time, money, and effort needed to identify and test drought- tolerant
genotypes.

<H2><A NAME="coop">Research cooperative formed</A></H2>
<P><I>Steve Strauss, Oregon State University</I>
</P>
<P>Four companies (Boise-Cascade, James River, Potlatch, and Union Camp) have
joined with the BFDP and Oregon State University to form the Tree Genetic
Engineering Research Cooperative (TGERC) to advance methods for genetically
engineering trees grown for use in intensively managed plantations. TGERC s
focus will be on hybrid cottonwoods. However, the genes and gene transfer
methods used have wide applicability, especially to hardwood tree species. Work
with other species may be undertaken in the future depending on interests of the
TGERC membership.
</P>
<P>Cottonwoods and other poplars are almost ideal trees for genetic
engineering. They are transformed more readily that most other forest species.
Facile vegetative propagation could allow rapid deployment of genetically
engineered clones. Genes are available that are likely to enhance profitability
and reduce environmental impacts of intensive culture.
</P>
<P>TGERC researchers at Oregon State are working to provide the few remaining
scientific advances needed to allow transgenic poplars to be used in commercial
plantations. They include (1) developing more efficient and broadly applicable
gene transfer systems for commercially important clones; (2) developing genetic
engineering methods to ensure sterility for gene containment, thus promoting
ecological safety and regulatory approval); and (3) demonstrating transgene
effectiveness at delivering desired traits in plantations are the primary
thrusts. During the first five years, TGERC will focus on developing two 
evolving  technologies for genetic engineering: improved gene transfer for
systems and engineered sterility. For additional information about TGERC,

<H2><A NAME="mech">Mechanization workshop held</A></H2>
<P><I>Bryce Stokes, USDA Forest Service</I></P>
<P>An international group of researchers, administrators, and manufacturing
representatives gathered in Mobile, Alabama, on March 1-3, 1994 for the 
Mechanization in Short Rotation Intensive Culture (SRIC) Forestry  conference.
The meeting was sponsored by the Electric Power Research Institute,
International Energy Agency Mechanization for Short Rotation Forestry Task,
BFDP, Southern Forest Engineering Center,  Southern Forest Experiment Station,
and Southeastern Regional Biomass Energy Program. Scott Paper Company served as
host. The objectives of the conference were to exchange scientific and technical
information concerning the establishment, tending, harvesting, processing, and
transport of wood crops for fiber and energy, and to foster national and
international collaboration in SRIC mechanization research.
</P>
<P>The conference program included 20 scientific and technical presentations
discussing all aspects of forest operations in short-rotation forestry. A
general review of current operations was given for the southern, north central,
and western United States, Canada, United Kingdom, Sweden, and New Zealand.
Results from specific research studies on innovative techniques and machines,
costs and recovery, and cultural treatments were presented. A one-day tour,
sponsored as part of the conference, included stops at a hardwood nursery and
operational SRIC production sites. Equipment for cutting, shredding, debarking,
chipping, and hogging small-diameter stems was demonstrated.
</P>
<P>Closing discussions focused on the need for continued collaboration in SRIC
mechanization research and technical exchange. Interest was expressed in
developing a formal structure that would enhance continued collaboration,
especially at an international level. Initial efforts will be to form an
informal working group, compile a mailing list of interested persons, and
organize similar conferences/tours in the future. Sponsorship of an
industrial/government/university roundtable to identify issues and begin the
process of establishing a formal organization to expand and enhance research was
also discussed. The U.S. Department of Energy, in collaboration with the U.S.
Department of Agriculture Forest Service, will help to initiate and foster these
goals.

<P>The Biofuels Feedstock Development Program (BFDP) holds an annual workshop
for its researchers that brings them together with researchers from other
programs, industry representatives, environmental and other groups interested in
the production and use of energy crops. In 1993, representatives from a very
important group, farmers, were featured guests.</P>
<P>In a departure from our regular format, this issue of <I>Energy Crops Forum</I>
summarizes discussions at the workshop and closes with recent happenings in
BFDP.</P>
<P>The 1993 workshop was held at Auburn University and was hosted by David
Bransby. Plans are under way for the 1994 workshop to be hosted by Ed White at
the State University of New York in Syracuse, New York. For additional
information about the workshop, contact Wilma McNabb (615-574-8029) or by mail
at the BFDP address listed at the end of this newsletter.</P>
<P>The workshop opened with presentations by <B>John Ferrell</B>, U.S.
Department of Energy (DOE), Biofuels System Division, and
<B>Janet Cushman</B>, program manager at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL),
that outlined DOE's goals and plans for the program. BFDP-funded researchers
then shared their results and strategies for future work. A recently released
report,

<H3><A NAME="acceptance">Energy Crop Acceptance</A></H3>
<P><B>Daniel Hines</B>, representing the American Corn Growers Association,
discussed what it might take to induce farmer/producer acceptance of dedicated
energy crops. The American Corn Growers Association has more than 10,000 members
in 26 states. Hines outlined the Association's programs to meet issues facing
American production agriculture. One of the programs addresses the increased use
of ethanol in cities that do not meet Clean Air standards. Another program--the
Bottom Line Contest--emphasizes increasing farm profitability and productivity
while minimizing adverse environmental impacts.</P>
<P>Hines said that farmers are currently faced with commodity surpluses,
depressed prices and profits, and increasing public pressure to reduce chemical
use and land degradation. Consequently, many farmers are interested in low-input
energy crops alternatives to traditional crops. The conservative and independent
nature of farmers can be both a hindrance to and an opportunity for the
acceptance of energy crops. Some farmers identify themselves primarily as
producers of a particular commodity and attempts to provide alternatives may be
viewed as a threat. For others, corn has a natural supremacy among energy crops.
Some equate sustainability with organic farming.</P>
<P>However, Hines felt that many farmers are coming to realize that policies
promoting yield as the key to profitability have failed. With concern over use
of agricultural chemicals, a new standard of successful farming is needed.
Farmers are also beginning to recognize that agriculture can play a major role
in the development of a diversified and balanced national energy strategy.</P>
<P>Representation of agricultural production interests in planning and
development decisions is crucial to the commercial success of energy crops. As a
result of their declining numbers and a lack of coalition among researchers,
environmentalists, and policymakers, farmers are often isolated from the
decision-making processes that affect them. Early and extensive involvement of
farmers in energy crop commercialization efforts is essential to their
acceptance of these crops.</P>
<P><B>Joseph Molnar</B> of Auburn University's Department of Agricultural
Economics and Rural Sociology discussed issues that must be considered when
establishing a network of farmers to supply energy crops to a biomass facility.
Although he talked specifically about switchgrass as an energy crop, his
concerns are valid for all energy crops. He, too, stressed the importance of
early and sustained involvement of farmers in the planning process. In addition,
he suggested that attention be paid to the unique configuration of costs,
resources, and capabilities of individual farms. The effects of energy crop
production on the total pattern of farm activities may be as important as the
economics of energy crop production alone.</P>
<P>Molnar stressed that participation and education are the keys to achieving
early and sustained producer involvement. Information regarding biomass
production facilities, expected input needs, and harvest schedules must be
shared directly with potential producers. Even more important, answers to basic
production questions about planting material suppliers, agronomic practices, and
equipment needs must be readily available. Individualized analyses of how energy
crop production can be adjusted to use existing farm equipment and facilities
will aid the acceptance of these new crops.</P>
<P>Land used for energy crops is lost to some other use. Large scale production
will require many farmers to redirect pasture and cropland acres as well as
drawing idle or passive land into active production. The opportunity costs of
reallocated land will influence farmers' decisions.</P>
<P>County extension staff have well-established contacts, are credible, and are
conveniently located. They can provide an excellent entry point for contacting
and organizing producers. Extension staff can use their experience and local
knowledge to anticipate farmer needs and reactions to a biomass program.
Repeated contacts will be needed to share information and answer questions.</P>
<P>Perceptions of trust, fairness, credibility, and equity will also influence
farmers' decisions. They will need assurances that a biomass energy system is
more than a short-term experiment if they are to invest their time and resources
in energy crop production. Contractual arrangements should provide guarantees
that transition costs can be recovered if a biomass system operates for a
shorter period than expected. Contracts may be written to provide early-stage
participants with greater protection from risks.</P>
<P>Wide variability exists among farmers in terms of their resources,
capabilities, and interests. Consequently, arrangements should be tailored to
meet the needs of individual producers, including small-scale farmers.
Recognizing differing abilities to schedule or coordinate harvest activities
should be considered. For example, some producers might opt for lower
compensation in return for greater flexibility in harvest timing or method.
Others might choose to receive a premium for meeting timing and quality
standards.</P>
<P></P>

<H3><A NAME="economics">Energy Crop Economics</A></H3>
<P><B>Eric Denzler</B> of the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS) described a
UCS study that examined the economic benefits and technical potential of
producing electricity from renewable resources in a 12-state region in the
Midwest. The study determined that up to 250 million dry tons of switchgrass and
20 million dry tons of hybrid poplar could be grown annually without competing
with food crops, supplying nearly 20% of the primary energy consumption in the
Midwest. Switchgrass can be grown in all 12 states considered. The analysis
indicates that more than half of the total is likely to be produced in Kansas,
Minnesota, Nebraska, and South Dakota. Hybrid poplar production is potentially
highest in Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, and Wisconsin.</P>
<P>Analyzing the effect of pricing on production, UCS found that at prices
below $40 per dry ton an estimated 54 million dry tons of switchgrass will be
produced. The production potential increases to 171 million dry tons at a price
of $50 per dry ton. For hybrid poplars, prices below $50 per dry ton result in
the production of 7.3 million dry tons. At prices near $70/dry ton, 15.7 million
dry tons are produced. Production costs are significantly affected by land rent
values and crop yields.</P>
<P>Working with other public interest groups, UCS is trying to stimulate
development of renewable energy projects. For copies of the report, <I>Powering

<P><B>David Bransby</B>, Auburn University, pointed out that successful
large-scale switchgrass production in the Southeast will depend on several
important conditions:</P>
<P></P>
<UL>
<LI>Improvements in conversion technologies
</LI>
<LI>Government and industry support
</LI>
<LI>Involvement and awareness of a broad array of constituent groups
</LI>
<LI> Profitable switchgrass production with returns comparable to other
alternatives
</LI>
<LI>Compatibility with existing farm practices.
</LI></UL>
<P>Switchgrass profitability will require increased yields. Bransby calculated
that yields of 6 tons per acre are needed to break even (assuming current
estimated production costs and a selling price of $34 per ton) in Alabama. Ten
tons per acre are needed to provide net returns of $100 per acre to land and
labor. On Alabama research plots, yields of 10 to 15 tons per acre have been
achieved for mature (greater than 2 years old) stands of the cultivar 'Alamo'.
Field-scale production trials yielded 7 tons per acre in the first year of
production.</P>
<P>In the Southeast, pasture-fed beef production and forestry provide net
returns of less than $50 per acre per year. On the basis of these figures,
switchgrass may be an attractive alternative for some Southeastern farm
enterprises.</P>
<P>Compatibility of switchgrass production with existing farm activities will
enhance its appeal. Alternative uses for energy crops would serve to reduce the
risk involved. Switchgrass provides excellent grazing and hay, increases soil
organic matter, improves water infiltration, reduces erosion, and may enhance
wildlife habitat. When grown in rotation with cotton and peanuts, switchgrass
may enhance nematode control. Auburn University has switchgrass research
addressing a number of these issues.</P>

<H3><A NAME="srwc">SRWC Lessons</A></H3>
<P><B>Jerry Tuskan</B>, task manager for BFDP's woody crops research,
presented a brief overview of the evolution of the BFDP's research--species
screening and management studies leading to breeding projects, and breeding
projects leading to sophisticated molecular genetics and plant physiology
studies. The program has been involved with several commercial successes--the
adoption of short rotation woody crop (SRWC) technology for production of
cellulose for pulp and energy--but it has also had some failures that provide
valuable lessons.</P>
<P><B>Lesson 1:</B> It is not possible to predict a precise productivity rate
for a given site because there is no precise way to extrapolate research plot
data to demonstration or commercial scale operations. The effects of cultural
practices and unexpected occurrences like unusual weather conditions on
large-scale production activities cannot be simulated accurately.</P>
<P><B>Lesson 2:</B> No matter how resistant a particular cultivar appears to
be under test conditions or small field trials, eventually some pest organism
will appear if that cultivar is produced on a large scale in a limited
geographic area. Long-term production on a commercial scale provides the time
needed for pests to overcome any variety's inherent resistance. As with other
crops, continual development efforts will be needed to stay ahead of pest
populations.</P>
<P><B>Lesson 3:</B> As woody crops are planted at larger scales, mistakes
occur in identifying the genetic makeup of planting stock. The testing of
multiple cultivars at multiple locations by several institutions can lead to the
unwitting misidentification of genetic material which then finds its way into
commercial operations. Data obtained from one set of cultivars is not always
valid to another set of cultivars and misidentified material can cause a great
deal of confusion about expected performance.</P>
<P><B>Lesson 4:</B> Researchers must be aware that changes will occur as
operations move from tests to commercial scale. Planting, tending, and
harvesting methods will evolve to meet the needs of individual producers as they
develop methods that optimize their own resources and situation.</P>
<P>Understanding these lessons will help the BFDP as it moves forward toward
regional herbaceous and SRWC demonstrations. These demonstration studies will
maximize but not guarantee the success of larger commercial operations.</P>
<P></P>

<P><I>Robin Graham; BFDP</I></P>
<P>Using biomass from energy crops for electric power plants or liquid fuel
conversion facilities will cause major shifts in the use of agricultural land.
Energy crops, like other crops, require agricultural-quality land for good
yields. As a rule of thumb, a 100 MW power plant operating at baseload capacity
(10,000 Btu/Kwh heat rate; 100% capacity) will require approximately 500,000 dry
tons of biomass per year, or 100,000 acres of agricultural-quality land
dedicated to energy crops, provided the average delivered yield from that land
is 5 dry tons/acre/year. Liquid fuel facilities will also require large amounts
of biomass and, correspondingly, large acreages of energy crops.</P>
<P>The environmental effects of dedicating large acreages of cropland to energy
crop production will depend on the soil quality and slope of the land, the
conventional crops that are displaced, the landscape surrounding the energy
crops, and the management regime of the energy crops. If one assumes that energy
crops will be located where they can be procured at the least cost to a power
plant or liquid fuel facility and at the greatest profit to farmers, then
economics will determine the amount and type of land to be converted to energy
crop production. Thus, projecting the environmental impacts of energy crop
production requires an understanding of the economic factors that will influence
the location of energy crops.</P>
<P>An approach for projecting the probable environmental impacts of growing
energy crops at the regional scale is under development. The approach considers
both economic and environmental factors. A breakeven model is used to project
where energy crops could be grown least expensively (see <A HREF="#downing">Downing</A>'s
article below). A U.S. Department of Agriculture simulation model of crop growth
and soil processes is used to predict the environmental changes associated with
switching from conventional crops to energy crops.</P>
<P>To test this approach, an analysis of the probable environmental changes
(specifically erosion, evapotranspiration, nitrate in runoff, and phosphorous
fertilizer use) associated with growing switchgrass (<I>Panicum virgatum</I>)
is being conducted in two subregions within the Tennessee Valley Authority
region
<A HREF="tvaregn.gif">Click here to see a map of the region.</A>
</P>
<P>The analysis shows that switchgrass production will have different impacts
in each subregion as a result of differences in the initial land use and soil
conditions in the subregions. Erosion, evapotranspiration, and nitrate in runoff
are projected to decrease in both subregions as switchgrass displaces the
current crops. Phosphorous fertilizer applications are likely to increase in one
subregion but decrease in the other due to initial differences in the types of
conventional crops grown in each subregion. Overall, the predicted changes
portend an improvement in water quality and soil conservation in both subregions
with the production of switchgrass.</P>
<P>The results of this study should not be viewed as definitive or necessarily
reflective of what might be projected elsewhere. Each location will have unique
environmental and land use attributes that will affect both the economics and
environmental impacts of energy crop production. Furthermore, model projections
are only as good as the basic data that underlie them. Energy crops have not
been widely grown in many regions. More field studies are needed to characterize
both the energy crops themselves and their likely environmental impact.
Nonetheless, the model allows projections of at least the first-order
environmental changes that might accompany the introduction of energy crops into
a region.</P>

<P>Development and implementation of the National Energy Policy Act, passage of
the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, and recent advances in science and
technology create expanding opportunities for liquid fuels derived from
renewable resources produced by America's farmers and foresters. The U.S.
Department of Agriculture (USDA) is committed to working with the Department of
Energy (DOE), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and the private sector
to accelerate the development of markets for economically-competitive biofuels.</P>
<P>Our goal is to increase the use of biofuels made from domestic renewable
farm and forestry resources, thus creating jobs, economic activity, reducing
dependence on foreign oil, and reducing air pollution. </P>
<P>The objectives of the USDA Biofuels program are to: (1) increase the
efficiency of converting biomass to liquid fuels; (2) improve and expand
feedstocks available for conversion to liquid fuels; (3) develop high-value
coproducts form unused feedstock materials; (4) accelerate the identification
and demonstration of new conversion technology;  and (5) expand market
opportunities for biofuels through the development of engine technology and fuel
formulations that maximize the environmental and technical benefits of biofuels.</P>

<P><I><A NAME="downing">Mark Downing; BFDP</A></I>
</P>
<P>BFDP staff have developed a 
<A HREF="biomod.gif">regional biomass feedstock supply model.</A> The work,
done cooperatively with the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) and The University
of Tennessee, predicts the amount of dedicated biomass feedstock that could
potentially be produced in any of the counties in the Tennessee Valley region.
Using county level data on cropland and soils and projected energy crop yields
(5 dry tons/acre), the model projected the amount of land capable of supporting
energy crops (nearly 27 million acres in the region) and the cost and supply of
biomass from that land.</P>
<P>Results suggest that a breakeven farmgate price of at least $43/dry ton will
be needed to generate substantial supplies of feedstocks. At this price, 25
million dry tons/year might be grown. In reality, a farmer's decision to plant
or not plant energy crops would be more complex than a simple profitability
decision. The farmer would consider relative risk factors as well as farm level
constraints, time frames for production, and government programs.  For this
study, however, the simple case of relative profitability was used because it
captures most of the cost and supply dynamics of producing biomass feedstocks
from energy crops.</P>
<P>The geographically specific information on woody biomass cost and supply is
being combined with information on the location, quantity, and cost of mill and
logging wood residues in a transportation network model of the TVA region as a
precursor to a geographic information system. The transportation network model
will be used to determine the least cost supply of wood to existing TVA
coal-fired plants that are being considered for cofiring. This will assist TVA
in determining which plants are most suited for cofiring and the associated
costs.</P>

<H2><A NAME="biomass">Biomass Energy for Carbon Mitigation</A></H2>
<P><I>Lynn Wright and Gregg Marland; BFDP</I></P>
<P>The United States has established a goal of stabilizing greenhouse gas
emissions at 1990 levels by the year 2000. Although energy conservation is
likely to provide the most immediate reductions in CO<SUB>2</SUB> emissions,
biomass energy is one of the few energy production options currently available
for displacing fossil fuels. Several sources of biomass are available, but not
all offer the same level of environmental benefits.</P>
<P>Wastes and residues are potentially the most accessible source of biomass
for fuel within the next few years. The use of wastes and residues can be very
economical and environmentally beneficial. If left to decay, CO<SUB>2</SUB>
(and possibly methane) is released to the atmosphere. When wastes and residues
displace fossil fuels, CO<SUB>2</SUB> emissions are still produced but the
fossil carbon stays in the ground. Drawbacks include the potential for
undesirable contaminants in the wastes and excessive removal of crop residues
from the fields. It is also likely that the rate of residue use might exceed the
normal rate of decay. Recycling of the carbon into new growth, while possible,
is not assured.</P>
<P>Existing forest resources are another potential source of biomass. Stands
that are susceptible to fire hazard, disease, or decay would be good candidates
as are stands now being planted for carbon sequestration. Drawbacks include loss
of wildlife habitat, visual impacts, and soil erosion on sloping land. The
harvesting of mature trees results in an immediate loss of carbon that is not
quickly offset by new growth. Good forest management can, however, include
environmentally sound harvesting techniques and sustainable growth. Efficient
energy production may ultimately be the best use of some forest stands now being
planted for long-term carbon sequestration.</P>
<P>Dedicated energy crops grown on land depleted of soil carbon offer the most
environmentally beneficial and largest biomass resource for displacing fossil
fuel use. While all the various types of energy crops being
considered--short-rotation woody crops (SRWC), perennial grasses, and annual
grasses--provide a positive net CO<SUB>2</SUB> emission reduction benefit when
converted to energy, SRWC offers the greatest net carbon benefit. SRWC stands
provide some carbon sequestration benefit as well as a fossil fuel offset. When
established on previously cropped soils, both SRWC and perennial grasses can
increase the carbon stored in the soil as well as reduce soil erosion.</P>
<P>Using efficient conversion processes to maximize the amount of fossil fuel
displaced is extremely important for increasing the carbon benefits of all
biomass resources. Unfortunately, many biomass energy systems operating today
are highly inefficient. High efficiency steam plants that can be modified for
cofiring of wood and coal offer one opportunity for more efficient biomass use
by 2000. The Whole Tree Energy concept  is another acceptable option but the
first such facility is yet to be built. Combined cycle gas turbines may be
available within 10-15 years.Given these limitations, how can biomass energy
systems assist the United States in meeting CO<SUB>2</SUB> emission reduction
goals by the year 2000? The biomass energy option that would offer the greatest
CO<SUB>2</SUB> reduction per unit of land area harvested, that of using SRWC in
high efficiency conversion to electricity, is limited by the 5-10 year required
growth period of the trees. To reduce 1990 CO<SUB>2</SUB> levels by 3% by 2000
would require replacing 25,000 MWe of coal-fired electric power production with
biomass-based power production at a net conversion efficiency of 33% or better
and the immediate planting of at least 15 million acres of SRWC within 2 years.
While these efforts should be started, such a rapid deployment of new technology
is not feasible. The use of annual or perennial grasses as biomass fuels could
expand the planting window up to 6 years to meet year 2000 goals. However, in
either case, there are significant sociological and political constraints to
converting large amounts of land and biological constraints to acquiring
sufficient high-quality planting material and seeds. Existing forest wastes,
residues, and forest thinning are the most feasible near-term biomass feedstock
supply alternative. Environmentally suitable and sustainable waste, residue, and
forest resources are limited however. It is unlikely that their use could
achieve greenhouse gas emission reductions of more than 1 or 2% per year. Thus,
efforts must be initiated to expand the biomass resource base. If incentives
were in place to plant dedicated energy crops now, the CO<SUB>2</SUB> from
waste and residue utilization could be recycled into a valuable resource that
would support the expansion of biomass energy commercialization soon after the
year 2000.</P>
<P>Realizing the tremendous potential that biomass energy offers for greenhouse
gas emission reduction within the next 20 to 30 years requires immediate action
by both the public and private sector. These actions should include: (1)
improving biomass energy technologies through research, development, and
demonstration; (2) investing in high-efficiency biomass conversion facilities;
and (3) developing agricultural and energy policies that facilitate production
and use of energy crops.</P>

<H2><A NAME="bfdp">BFDP workshop explores the past, present, and future</A></H2>
<P>Michigan State University in East Lansing, Michigan, hosted the 1992
Biofuels Feedstock Development Program's (BFDP) Subcontractors' Workshop on
November 9-13. Sixty people from universities, private companies, and government
programs in the United States and Canada attended the 3&#189; day meeting. The
presentations and reports reflected the challenges facing biomass energy
systems--resource availability, land suitability, environmental concerns,
economic competitiveness, harvesting--and recent research progress in BFDP.
</P>
<P>John Ferrell, U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), Biofuels System Division, led
off the meeting with a discussion of BFDP's history coupled with proposed future
directions. Bob Rabson of DOE's Bioenergy Sciences Program outlined that
Program's efforts to use basic sciences and biotechnology to understand plant
growth and development. Rabson's presentation provided insights into the
potential such an effort would have on the development of biomass energy crops.
Jane Turnbull of the Electric Power Research Institute spoke about
commercialization strategies. Wayne Hoffman of the National Audubon Society
briefly described the Biofuels Roundtable, a coalition of environmental groups,
research institutions, and others devoted to finding potential solutions to
environmental problems. An environmental assessments session was chaired by Jack
Ranney, BFDP.</P>
<P>After progress reports by principal investigators, BFDP's Jerry Tuskan
unveiled a proposed plan for the management and research direction of the
short-rotation woody crops (SRWC) projects. Under the proposed plan, seven
cooperative development centers would be established: three for poplars and four
for other species--sycamore, silver maple, black locust, and willow. Breeding
programs that focused on genotype assembly, pedigree development, and clonal
release would be combined with physiology, molecular biology, pathology,
entomology, and silvicultural studies. This approach will lead to appropriate
crop production systems, superior plant materials, developed genetic resources,
and an immediate, cost-effective increase in research knowledge. BFDP currently
supports <I>Populus</I> development centers in the north-central region and the
Pacific Northwest. A request for proposals for a <I>Populus</I> center for the
Southeast is planned for 1993. Centers will be established for other species as
funds become available. The plan also includes support for SRWC projects that
have broad applicability or are exploratory in nature. Anticipated studies
include development of site quality/site index prediction functions for poplars;
vegetative propagation of selected sycamore genotypes; physiological
characterization of root growth, specifically related to adaptation to stress;
and continued testing and development of stem borer resistance in black locust
with gene transformation techniques.</P>
<P>The potential for producing high-yielding woody crops in a cooperative
development center was featured in a talk by Paul Heilman, Washington State
University. He reported that irrigated stands of poplar clones, developed at the
University of Washington center and planted in eastern Washington by Boise
Cascade, occasionally approached 50 ft high by age 3. Heilman also noted that
growing irrigated hybrid poplars for pulp in that region will produce more
income per acre than alfalfa, corn or wheat. His report also emphasized the
necessity of continued genetic selection. Of the 50 clones being commercially
produced, only a few are resistant to rust.</P>
<P>The workshop marked a period of transition for herbaceous energy crops
research. Variety trials, species-site trials, and cultural management
investigations to identify production issues and limitations have been under way
for 8 years. Principal investigators from Iowa State University, the University
of Kentucky, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Research
Service at Lincoln, Nebraska, reported on work nearing completion. Results
include identification and biochemical characterization of best-yielding species
and varieties of herbaceous energy crops, documentation of consistent
switchgrass yields across soil types and climatic conditions, optimization of
fertilization practices and harvesting strategies, identification of dormancy
and establishment limitations, and quantification of impacts on soil erosion and
soil organic matter.</P>
<P>Attention then shifted to progress reports for 6 new switchgrass projects
started in 1992. Research at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University
(Virginia Tech), Auburn University, and Texas A&amp;M University is designed to
improve production and management strategies. Studies to test variety
performance were established at 18 field stations in 1992, representing
significant progress toward evaluating the regional potential of switchgrass for
the southern United States.</P>
<P>Three other new projects, more basic in nature, are designed to enhance and
sustain switchgrass growth potential. At Oklahoma State University, Charles
Taliaferro has successfully demonstrated the detached culm technique which will
accelerate breeding cycles. At Oak Ridge National Laboratory, researchers are
comparing gas exchange physiology and carbon allocation patterns of eight
switchgrass varieties. At the University of Tennessee, Bob Conger has developed
basic tissue culture techniques for regenerating switchgrass from callus tissue.</P>
<P>John Cundiff, an agricultural engineer from Virginia Tech on sabbatical at
ORNL, presented the results of his analysis of harvesting and transportation
strategies from an agricultural systems perspective. The meeting closed with a
brief description by Anne Ehrenshaft, BFDP, of the development of a database to
capture herbaceous crop production and establishment data.</P>
<P>Plans for the 1993 BFDP subcontractors workshop are underway. It will be the
week of September 26 on the campus of Auburn University in Auburn, Alabama. For
additional information about the meeting, contact BFDP's Linda Cooper, Oak Ridge
National Laboratory, P.O. Box 2008, Oak Ridge, TN 37831-6352 USA; 615-576-8143.</P>

<H2><A NAME="solicitation">Solicitation for integrated biomass systems
published</A></H2>
<P>An announcement in the April 1, 1993 issue of the Commerce Business Daily
invited interested parties to contact the National Renewable Energy Laboratory
(NREL) for information on a proposed project entitled <I>Economic Development
Through Biomass Systems Integration</I>. The objective of the project is to
promote the development of integrated biomass production and conversion
technologies. NREL anticipates releasing a formal solicitation for Letters of
Interest (LOI).
</P>
<P>The project will support DOE's efforts to assist in the commercialization of
biomass energy systems by inviting proponents of integrated biomass production
and conversion systems to share the cost of feasibility studies. The studies are
being undertaken in anticipation that demonstration and commercialization will
be undertaken by means of cosponsored projects under various provisions of the
Energy Policy Act of 1992. </P>
<P>The Electric Power Research Institute is supporting the solicitation by
encouraging its member utilities to respond. Cost-sharing at a minimum level of
50% is required for electricity production proposals. EPRI anticipates joining
with DOE in sharing the other 50% of the total costs. Cost share will also be
considered in liquid fuels proposals but a minimum requirement has not been
established. It is the intent of NREL to make multiple awards on a cost sharing
subcontract basis as a result of this solicitation.</P>
<P>Responses to the solicitation prepared in accordance with specific
requirements and conditions will be due to NREL by approximately July 30. ORNL
and NREL staff with technical expertise in biofuels and biomass power are <I>not
eligible</I> to participate or collaborate in responses to the LOI.</P>
<P>All questions or inquiries concerning the solicitations must be in writing
and should be addressed to:

<H2><A NAME="alternative">Alternative feedstocks use for chemicals and
materials</A></H2>
<P>by Linda Beth Schilling;  Office of Industrial Technologies, Energy
Efficiency and Renewable Energy, U.S. Department of Energy</P>
<P>A renewables-based chemical processing sector is evolving in the United
States through strategic alliances between chemical and agriprocessing
companies. Recent advances in metabolic engineering, bioprocessing, catalysis,
fast pyrolysis, and separations technologies currently provide an unprecedented
opportunity to overcome key technical and economic challenges that have limited
new industrial applications of agricultural and forestry materials. The U.S.
Department of Energy's Alternative Feedstocks Program is using a national team
approach in  developing its program in close cooperation with industry, national
laboratories, universities, and other federal and state agencies.
</P>
<P>The goal of the Alternative Feedstocks Program is to develop precompetitive
and environmentally acceptable technologies for the production of chemicals and
materials from agricultural and forestry resources. Program elements consist of
bioprocessing, thermal/chemical processing, and hybrid systems combining
biological, thermal, and chemical conversion and separation technologies. Using
agricultural and forestry materials as chemical feedstocks can potentially
encourage economic development, environmental improvement, and energy security
benefits to domestic industries. Approximately 3 quads or approximately 170
million barrels of oil are currently consumed as energy feedstocks for nonfuel
chemical and material products.

<H2><A NAME="mission">The Mission of Energy Crops Forum</A></H2>
<P>As <I>Energy Crops Forum</I> begins its second year of publication, it is
time to remind readers of the newsletter's mission statement: to facilitate
communications among a community composed of researchers, policy makers, and
potential users and producers of energy crops. The publication intends to
highlight important developments wherever they occur rather than focus on a
particular institution or point of view.</P>
<P>The <I>Energy Crops Forum</I> is a product of the Biofuels Feedstock
Development Program, managed since 1978 by Oak Ridge National Laboratory for the
U.S. Department of Energy. Much of the program's research is conducted by
cooperators at universities and the U.S. Department of Agriculture research
facilities. The program funds 25 to 50 research and development projects each
year, most of which are multiyear in scope. In addition, ORNL performs research,
analysis, and information synthesis at regional and national levels. The need to
communicate within the program and, equally important, to publicize developments
by others outside this network led to the creation of this newsletter. Articles
from outside ORNL and its cooperators are invited.

<P>by Ed White;  State University of New York, College of Environmental Science
and Forestry</P>
<P>The State University of New York College of Environmental Science and
Forestry (ESF) launched a Fast-Growing Hardwoods Program in 1983. In the years
since then, financial support has come from the New York State Energy Research
and Development Authority, Gas Research Institute, New York Gas Group, Niagara
Mohawk Power Corporation, U.S. Department of Energy Biofuels Feedstock
Development Program, Electric Power Research Institute, and Empire State
Electric Energy Research Corporation. The University of Toronto, Ontario
Ministry of Natural Resources, U.S. Department of Agriculture Soil Conservation
Service, Reynolds Metals Company, and New York State Department of Environmental
Conservation have also cooperated in  the research or have provided services
which have made the research possible.</P>
<P>Following a successful effort with the short-rotation intensive culture of
hybrid poplar, ESF researchers studied the potential suitability of <I>Salix</I>
(willow) as a high-yielding biomass feedstock. Research has emphasized the
development and refinement of establishment, tending, and maintenance
techniques. Complementary studies on breeding, coppice physiology, pests,
nutrient use, wood quality, and bioconversion to energy products were also part
of the program. Using <I>Salix</I> clones developed in cooperation with the
University of Toronto, current yields in New York are ~20 oven dry tonnes per
hectare per year, the most promising results to date in the northeast. We at
SUNY plan to continue the strong integrated research program on short-rotation
intensive culture of woody biomass plantations. The knowledge developed over the
past decade will be used to establish a 40-ha <I>Salix</I> large-scale
bioenergy farm to demonstrate current biomass production technology. The farm
will be large enough to test new commercial harvesters, provide opportunities to
accurately assess economics of the systems, and provide large quantities of
uniform biomass for pilot-scale conversion facilities.</P>

<P>Professionals with expertise relevant to energy crop development and
commercialization should consider a sabbatical with BFDP at ORNL. Both the
program and the visitor would benefit. A few years ago, Dr. David Betters of
Colorado State University spent three months at ORNL with the program. His visit
began a relationship that resulted in co-authored papers, ORNL staff serving on
graduate student committees at Colorado State, and continuing collaboration on
several projects. More recently, Dr. John Cundiff, a professor of agricultural
engineering at Virginia Tech, completed a six month sabbatical with the BFDP. He
said about his experience:</P>
<P>&quot;I have been well pleased with my support and opportunity to contribute
to the work being done (at ORNL). Because of the program's needs, the research
that I did was different from my original plan. This change in direction is not
surprising and was ultimately beneficial. I assimilated information from the
group . . . and broadened my view of the biomass-for-fuel industry . . . I feel
I am returning to my faculty position with a much improved understanding of the
BFDP and a much improved understanding of how my engineering efforts can
contribute to the program. The setting at a national laboratory is significantly
different from the setting we face on campus and this change is refreshing.&quot;</P>
<P>Most sabbaticals are arranged through an educational consortium such as Oak
Ridge Associated Universities (ORAU). The first step, however, is to find out if
a match exists between research interests and the program's needs. Faculty
members interested in sabbatical opportunities with BFDP are urged to contact
Lynn Wright, Deputy Program Manager, BFDP, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, P.O.
Box 2008, Oak Ridge, TN, 37831-6352.</P>
<P>Persons interested in sabbaticals with the BFDP must be able to cover their
own salary during the sabbatical period. The BFDP may be able to provide limited
support for travel and lodging depending on available funds.</P>
<P>Other educational opportunities also exist at ORNL. Through a variety of
innovative programs from elementary through postgraduate levels, hundreds of
students, teachers, and visiting researchers work with ORNL scientists each
year. The BFDP is interested in hosting a limited number of students who have
interests and experience corresponding to research areas funded by the program.</P>

<H2><A NAME="biotechnology"><B>Biotechnology tools used to improve energy
crops</B></A></H2>
<P><I>By Jerry Tuskan; BFDP</I></P>
<P></P>
<P>Tree improvement is an area of scientific endeavor that until recently
required a human lifetime for meaningful results to be realized. With the advent
of clonal propagation techniques and interest in short-rotation forestry, the
time frame required for testing and releasing improved plant materials has been
reduced from decades to years. In addition, new biotechnology tools are now
radically changing the rate and efficiency at which tree improvement can be
achieved.</P>
<P>Simply stated, plant biotechnology is the application of basic biological
sciences for the genetic improvement of plant processes or plant species as a
whole. Several BFDP-funded studies are leading in the development and use of
plant biotechnology for hardwood species. Techniques including tissue culture
propagation, genetic transformation, somaclonal variation, and molecular mapping
are being incorporated into and complemented by ongoing breeding, physiologic,
pathologic, entomological, and morphologic research as part of BFDP's mission to
develop improved energy crops.</P>
<P>The use of biotechnology tools in a plant development program follows a
logical progression. The first step is the development of tissue culture
techniques (i.e., the ability to clonally propagate individual genotypes from
excised tissues). These techniques allow researchers to replicate large numbers
of selected individual plants. But more importantly, tissue culture propagation
systems provide researchers with the means to regenerate genetically modified
individuals. In the early 1980s, BFDP-supported scientists helped to develop
tissue culture methods for sweetgum and alder. More recently, Dr. John Preece
and his associates at Southern Illinois University have defined a tissue culture
system for the commercial production of silver maple. Dr. Scott Merkle,
University of Georgia, is developing tissue culture methods as an intermediate
step in obtaining genetically transformed black locust. Today, Dr. Bob Conger,
University of Tennessee, is working to establish tissue culture protocols for
switchgrass. Once tissue culture systems are established, the techniques of
genetic transformation or somaclonal variation can be pursued. Genetic
transformation involves the movement of a gene, or set of genes, from one
organism to another through mechanisms other than sexual recombination.
Somaclonal variation involves the capturing of genetic variability that is
expressed when plants are regenerated through 
<A HREF="http://www.esd.ornl.gov/BFDP/BFDPMOSAIC/ECFMOS/culture.gif">cell
culture</A>. Both techniques result in the introduction of new characteristics
into a breeding or production populations.</P>
<P>BFDP has provided support under interagency agreements with the U.S. Forest
Service to Dr. Bruce Haissig and his colleagues at Rhinelander, Wisconsin, to
study herbicide resistance in hybrid poplars using both genetic transformation
and somaclonal variation and to Dr.  Mike Ostry, St. Paul, Minnesota, to obtain
Septoria resistance in selected hybrid poplars using somaclonal variation. In
addition, Dr. Scott Merkle is testing the &quot;gene gun&quot; as a means of
genetic transformation; the ultimate goal of this work is to insert genes for
insect resistance in black locust.</P>
<P>Several BFDP projects are using molecular mapping to genetically &quot;fingerprint&quot;
individuals in breeding populations. A team headed by Dr. Toby Bradshaw at the
University of Washington is developing a genetic map of hybrid poplar in an
effort to locate genes involved in rapid growth, superior form, and disease
resistance. Dr. Mike Stine, Louisiana State University, is using molecular
makers to determine if apoximis (the formation of seed without fertilization) is
occurring in American sycamore. Dr. Mike Ostry is classifying common poplar
pathogens into biotypes on the basis of their molecular profile.</P>
<P>Each of the above biotechnology efforts is an integral part of ongoing work
to develop and incorporate state-of-the-art research tools for the improvement
of biofuel feedstocks. Through this combination of traditional plant improvement
work and biotechnology, BFDP has moved several steps forward in its quest to
develop broadly adapted, reliable energy crops for the United States.</P>

<H2><A NAME="brazilian">Brazilian industries plant forests</A></H2>
<P><I>by La&eacute;rcio Couto and David R. Betters; Federal University of
Vicosa, Brazil, and Colorado State University</I></P>
<P></P>
<P>Brazil has one of the most highly developed industrial forest plantation
systems in the world. Between 1965 and 1985, more than 13.5 million acres (5.5
million ha) of short-rotation woody crop plantations (SRWCP) were established,
primarily in southern Brazil. These plantings of pine and eucalyptus were
established to compensate for a shortfall in local wood resources that began to
occur in the early 1960s. Although the Brazilian tax incentives were not without
problems, they nevertheless resulted in the creation of a major new wood supply
source. Rural employment opportunities dramatically improved and Brazil has
become a net exporter of SRWC-based wood products that are competitive in the
world market.</P>
<P>The Brazilian companies that depend on SRWCP as their wood source have large
research organizations dedicated to continually improving the yields, quality,
and sustainability of their resource. New developments in the management and
user of SRWCP in Brazil are of interest worldwide.</P>
<P>Industrial plantation companies are addressing environmental concerns by (1)
shifting to the use of leguminous species within plantations in order to reduce
the use of herbicides and chemical fertilizers; (2) chipping logging residues
and debarking logs in the field to reduce nutrient loss and decrease the use of
fire in site preparation; (3) using biological control techniques to address
caterpillar and leaf-eating-ant problems instead of applying chloride-based
pesticides; and (4) organizing certification standards for exported wood
products through cooperation among companies, non-government organizations, and
research groups to ensure that the wood product meets quality standards and the
production process satisfies environmental concerns.</P>
<P>New product developments include (1) an increase in pulp production and a
decrease in charcoal production from eucalyptus and pines; (2) a greater
emphasis on wood product quality to address new competition generated by free
trade agreements; and (3) the use of bamboo intercropped with food crops to
produce pulp, livestock feed, and ethanol. Only 37,000 acres (15,000 ha) of
bamboo are currently planted, but plans include expansion to 148,000 acres
(60,000 ha) in the near future.</P>
<P>New industrial management approaches include (1) shifting to the use of
contractors to perform cultural practices and tree harvesting in order to reduce
costs; (2) using agroforestry practices on plantations to reduce establishment
costs and to induce farmers to grow plantations; (3) providing small landowners
with technical assistance under partnership arrangements that pay for the annual
plantation growth; (4) shifting to more mechanization in the harvesting process;
(5)  using geographic information systems for planning; and (6) establishing
networks among companies and state and federal agencies for forest fire
prevention and control.</P>
<P>The Federal University of Vicosa and Colorado State University have a
Cooperative Agreement for Faculty Exchange and have ongoing environmental
studies sponsored, in part, by the U.S. Information Agency. Plantation forests
are part of these studies. Data exchanges with BFDP are being planned. For
additional information, see &quot;Short rotation woody crop plantations in
Brazil and the United States&quot; by D. R. Betters, L .L. Wright and L. Couto,

<H2><A NAME="notice">Notice evokes interest in integrated biomass systems</A></H2>
<P><I>by Lynn Wright; BFDP</I>
</P>
<P>More than 30 groups in the United States expressed an interest in
cost-shared demonstration projects involving integrated systems of energy crops
and energy end uses. The National Renewable Energy Laboratory received the
responses following a Notice of Intent published in <I>The Commerce Business
Daily</I>. Several organizations with expertise in either conversion systems or
crop production indicated interest in connecting with groups providing the
complementary expertise. Nine of the responses, however, included both
production and conversion components. Sixteen organizations expressed interest
in utility applications and five proposed ethanol as the end product.</P>
<P>The next step is to identify funds that can support such work and issue a
request for proposals. <I>Energy Crops Forum</I> will publicize such a request
if and when it is issued. Anyone who wants to be notified as soon as a request
is issued should contact Ralph Overend at the National Renewable Energy
Laboratory, 1617 Cole Boulevard, Golden, CO 80401-3393

U.S. dependence on fossil fuels, the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI)
has undertaken a project to define for its more than 600 member utilities &quot;Strategies
for Achieving a Sustainable, Clean and Cost-Effective Biomass Resource.&quot;
Over the past two decades significant investments in research and development on
renewable energy resources have been made by the federal government, by a number
of state governments, and by U.S. electric utilities, either independently or
through their EPRI participation. However, most renewable resources remain
limited in terms of their availability or because of their costs. Biomass is the
one renewable resource that shows real promise in making a major contribution to
the nation's electric grid within the next two decades.</P>
<P>At present, approximately 7000 MWs of electric power are generated from
biomass, mainly by lumber and paper companies using their industrial wastes or
from forest and agricultural residues. The adoption of integrated forest
management techniques in support of improved forest health and productivity will
augment supplies of these wastes. After the year 2000, however, the major
contributions to biomass energy resources are expected to come from dedicated,
rapidly growing woody and herbaceous crops.</P>
<P>The EPRI work is considering several sources of electric power feedstocks --
wood wastes and explicitly grown energy crops -- but will focus on energy crops.
First, estimates of land availability and suitability are being evaluated. This
assessment will include soil characteristics (e.g., nutrients and water),
climate, and geology/topography. These estimates will be correlated with
projections of crop productivities and production costs for different parts of
the country. Second, the economics of energy crops are being examined in light
of current agricultural commodity and land use policies in order to assess how
they would either complement or compete with conventional agricultural
commodities. Third, the criteria to ensure long-term sustainability of
production of biomass resources are being addressed through the deliberations of
recognized experts serving on a National Biofuels Roundtable established by EPRI
and the National Audubon Society. EPRI staff will analyze the outcome of these
three investigations. A report will be prepared during the last quarter of 1992
that will provide U.S. utilities with a basis for considering biomass as a
resource for reliable electric power generation.

<P><I>by Wilma McNabb; BFDP</I></P>
<P></P>
<P>The Department of Forestry at Michigan State University (MSU) will host this
year's Biofuels Feedstock Development Program Subcontractors' Workshop on
November 10-13, 1992, in East Lansing, Michigan. Principal investigators,
program staff, cooperators, and guests will gather to exchange information,
present research results, and discuss progress to date on the development of
woody and herbaceous energy crops, environmental challenges in energy crop
development, and economic analyses. The agenda includes 2 days of technical
talks and an all-day trip to the Long Term Ecological Reserve at the Kellogg
Biological Station. The site features plantings of poplars and corn managed
under a variety of conditions. It will provide an excellent background for
discussions of environmental issues associated with energy crops as well as a
demonstration of the innovative research being conducted by MSU scientists.
Optional tours include MSU's Basic Energy Research Laboratory and campus sites
featuring poplar physiology and genetics work. For information, contact Wilma
McNabb at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, (615) 574-8029, or Kurt Pregetzer at
MSU, (517) 355-0091.

<H2><A NAME="reality"><B>From Research to Reality</B></A></H2>
<P><B><I>By Edward Hansen; Project Leader, U.S. Forest Service, North Central
Forest Experiment Station</I></B></P>
<P>The North Central Forest Experiment Station in Rhinelander, Wisconsin in
1970 began research on the culture of short-rotation hybrid poplar crops for
fiber. Early studies concentrated on the basics of growing a new crop: planting
material, fertilization, water requirements, pest problems, tree spacing,
rotation length, and -- most important -- potential yield. This research
provided the necessary information to grow hybrid poplar as a farm crop.</P>
<P>In the mid-1980s, a large midwestern power company became interested in wood
fuel for generating electricity which led to the establishment of 10- to 20-acre
hybrid poplar plantations across a four-state area. These plantations were
designed to identify suitable hybrids for the region and to obtain better yield
estimates and more realistic economic data for a commercially sized plantation.</P>
<P>The U.S. Congress established the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) to
address the chronic problem of agricultural overproduction of food and to reduce
erosion by removing erodible land from production. The needs for clean renewable
energy, a reduction of surplus agricultural crops, and crop alternatives were
emerging as problems with a common solution and tree planting on CRP lands was
encouraged.</P>
<P>Minnesota, which lies in the prairie/forest transition zone with more than 2
million acres enrolled in the CRP program, is particularly interested in
developing hybrid poplars as a new energy crop. Building on initial research
information, wood energy developmental projects are under way in a number of
areas. A state nursery is preparing for extensive production of the best hybrid
planting stock. Biochemical changes are being measured in a pile of poplar wood
chips to determine storage-related effects on use of the chips for ethanol
production. A 100-ft-high pile of whole trees has been constructed, and drying
trials will soon be initiated to test the feasibility of whole-tree stacking and
drying in preparation for burning the trees to produce electricity. A geographic
information system project has been initiated to develop siting information for
hybrid poplar plantations. Two proposals for planting as many as 14,000 acres of
hybrid poplar plantations have been submitted to a state legislative commission
for funding. These proposals are sponsored by consortia of state and local
agencies and private business.</P>
<P>The objective of these related efforts is to establish energy plantations to
produce fuelwood for direct burning for production of electricity or for
conversion to ethanol. The program is a good example of the practical
application of research information -- a true Research-to-Reality success story.</P>

<H2><A NAME="environmental"><B>Environmental Action Agenda Gathers Steam</B></A></H2>
<P><I><B>By Jack Ranney; BFDP</B></I></P>
<P>The Biofuels Feedstock Development Program (BFDP) is working with other
interested organizations to develop an environmental action agenda for biofuels
technologies. Assessments and studies currently underway are furnishing some of
the background for developing this agenda, including</P>
<P></P>
<P></P>
<UL>
<LI>DOE-coordinated efforts to estimate net emissions from the complete
energy-crop-to-ethanol pathway;
</LI>
<LI>development of selected subregional cost-supply relationships for energy
crops and analysis of associated environmental and land-use impacts;
</LI>
<LI>collection of data on the biodiversity of energy crops relative to
neighboring land uses;
</LI>
<LI>assessments of the probable fate of chemicals applied to energy crops using
agricultural systems as models;
</LI>
<LI>evaluation of possibilities for using energy crops in the remediation of
degraded sites; and
</LI>
<LI>assessments of special issues such as the relationships between wetlands
and energy crop deployment.</LI></UL>
<P>Collaborators with the BFDP in these and related activities include other
national laboratories, utilities, industry, academia, the U.S. Department of
Agriculture (USDA), the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the National
Audubon Society, the Nature Conservancy, and state agencies. Reaching agreement
on a definition of environmental acceptability is requiring cross-education and
in-depth exchange of views.</P>
<P>Energy crops offer opportunities to achieve significant environmental
advantages as well as energy independence. Some benefits relate to primary
emissions, but many involve a wide range of secondary issues. Net greenhouse gas
emission reductions, sustainable production systems, and increased landscape
biodiversity dominate the spectrum of apparently achievable benefits.</P>
<P>Innovative methods of biomass production which go beyond monocultures will
need to be included in response to these opportunities and issues. Mixed
species, habitat corridors, agroforesty concepts, fertilization of early
successional plant communities, a range of harvesting approaches, and variations
in weed management may be included. Biomass production systems can have specific
roles to fill in the framework of energy, economics, and the environment. It is
critical to understand the economic and environmental roles these alternatives
can provide and to develop an integrated framework for evaluating and improving
them.</P>
<P>A team is being formed at ORNL to develop an integrated framework for
evaluating and adapting biomass energy systems using a wide and adjustable range
of criteria. This will permit us to examine synergies between developing biomass
for energy, other agricultural production programs, and the emerging
environmental imperatives. Including innovative biomass production systems and
characterizing their environmental, supply, and economic roles is central to
meeting such a challenge.</P>
<P>This is the first time since the beginning of energy crop research in 1975
that such diverse groups have agreed work together on biofuel technologies.
Environmental issues including the Clean Air Act and concern over climate change
have stimulated a great deal of cooperation. The National Audubon Society
intends to form a &quot;round table&quot; of experts from all the interested
organizations to discuss policy and technology options for biofuels systems in
the hope that both the biofuels industry and the environment will benefit.</P>
<P>Early in 1993, the BFDP will hold a workshop to develop its environmental
action agenda. Environmental risk analysis, data collection, experimental
studies, economic evaluations, and policy considerations will be discussed.
Participants will consider how much emphasis should be placed on site-specific,
regional and national considerations. Other issues affecting energy crop
development will need clarification before environmental R&amp;D prioritization
can be discussed.</P>

<H2><A NAME="growing"><B>Growing Poplars on a Personal Computer</B></A></H2>
<P><I><B>By Judd Isebrands; USDA Forest Service, Forestry Sciences Laboratory</B></I></P>
<P>ECOPHYS is an ecophysiological whole-tree model that simulates the growth of
poplar in the establishment year. The model was developed as part of the USDA
Forest Service, North Central Forest Experiment Station's research program, &quot;Increasing
Yields of Poplar Energy Plantations,&quot; and was funded in part by the U.S.
Department of Energy's Biofuels Feedstock Development Program.</P>
<P>The model uses a geometric approach to simulate canopy architecture. Leaves
on a young poplar are displayed in a three-dimensional coordinate system so that
the orientation (lamina angle, midrib angle, and azimuth) of each leaf is known.
By keeping track of the sun's position over the course of a day, the model
calculates the amount of light received by each leaf in any given hour of the
day over the growing season. This strategy accounts for both the angle of
incidence and mutual leaf-shading patterns.</P>
<P>The direct and diffuse radiation received by each leaf is then used to
calculate hourly photosynthate production. Photosynthates are periodically
translocated to various growth centers within the plant (leaves, stem, roots)
and used to determine increases in
<A HREF="ecophys.gif">biomass and dimensional growth.</A> The model runs on an
hourly time step over the growing season until the date of bud set.</P>
<P></P>
<P>ECOPHYS was developed for two purposes: first, to determine the effect of
genetically selectable factors such as leaf shape or orientation on tree growth
and, second, to develop a tool for rapidly screening genetic material -- clones
that appear productive can be carried on to field trials. Because there was a
strong theoretical basis in developing the model, it is well suited for teaching
basic concepts of plant physiology, including the relationship between light
interception and photosynthesis, the translocation of photosynthates throughout
the plant, and the growth of plants as affected by climate.</P>
<P>In the first phase the model was based primarily on the aboveground
structure and processes in trees growing under optimal conditions. Current work
focuses on the simulation of root structure and belowground processes. The model
is also being expanded to accommodate such environmental factors as moisture,
nutrient stress, and changes in air chemistry (i.e., elevated ozone and CO2).
The model may someday enable researchers to understand the mechanisms of stress
effects on tree growth. Recently, ECOPHYS has been generalized to simulate
aspen, yellow poplar and other hardwood trees. The model's high-quality graphics
show the aboveground as well as belowground structure of a 
<A HREF="ecotree.gif">tree </A> at any hour of any day.
</P>
<P>ECOPHYS runs on IBM-compatible machines with hard disk, 640K RAM, and CGA or
better graphics and is distributed on three 360K 5.25 in. floppy disks.</P>

<H2><A NAME="switchgrass">Switchgrass Research Started</A></H2>
<P><I><B>By Sandy McLaughlin; BFDP</B></I></P>
<P>In November 1991, the BFDP issued a request for proposals (RFP) to develop
improved techniques for selecting and growing switchgrass as a biofuels crop.
Southeastern and south central states were targeted in order to take advantage
of the longer growing season, a major determinant of yield potential for this
warm-season species. 
<A HREF="switchnt.gif">Click here</A> to see a map showing where the projects
are located.

<P>Three research areas -- breeding, cultural improvement, and biotechnology --
were included. Of the 12 proposals received, 5 proposals were selected:</P>

<P>A related project, &quot;Research on Improving the Productivity of
Switchgrass as a Biofuels Crop: Genotypic Diversity in Carbon Acquisition,
Allocation, and in the Utilization of Limiting Water and Nutrient Resources&quot;
was begun at ORNL with S. D. Wullschleger as principal investigator.</P>
<P>The investigators met in March in Oak Ridge, Tennessee to exchange ideas and
approaches. The potential for interactions among projects appears quite high and
should lead to some excellent interdisciplinary studies. As the research gets
underway, efforts will be made to promote the linkage of this work with other
related studies.</P>
<P></P>
<H2><A NAME="modeling">Modeling Biomass Feedstock Supplies</A></H2>
<P> <I><B>Anthony Turhollow; BFDP</B></I></P>
<P>Program researchers are often asked how much biomass can be produced in the
U.S. BFDP, working with the University of Tennessee, is developing supply curves
for energy crops to provide the answer to that question. An existing
agricultural modeling system is being linked with an econometric model to
evaluate price-quantity relationships.
</P>
<P>The linear program model in the
<A HREF="arims.gif">Agricultural Resource Interregional Modeling System (ARIMS)
</A>selects the mix of crops which will minimize the cost of producing a fixed
set of agricultural commodities, including energy crops. The Erosion
Productivity Index Calculator (EPIC), developed by the U.S. Department of
Agriculture, projects crop growth by soil type and management system. It also
calculates soil erosion and other environmental impacts. Both EPIC and a crop
budget generator provide input to the ARIMS linear program.</P>
<P>As the quantity of biomass required for energy purposes increases, the cost
of energy crops will also increase. At some level, producing energy crops will
have effects on the cost and supply of other crops. ARIMS output will be coupled
to POLYSIM (Policy Simulator), an econometric model, to examine the supply and
demand interactions between energy crops and other agricultural products.</P>
<P>Regional supply curves will be calculated by running regressions on
ARIMS-generated data regarding the cost of biomass in relation to its quantity.
The supply curves will examine the effects of such variables as energy prices,
crop demand, and yields on the cost of energy crops.</P>
<P>The modeling system will first be used to examine the production of corn for
ethanol. This test case should be completed before the end of 1992. Cellulosic
energy crops, alone and in combinations with corn, will be examined next year.
The Energy Information Administration of the U.S. Department of Energy is
cosponsoring this effort. The U.S. Department of Agriculture's Soil Conservation
Service will use this modeling system to examine the environmental impacts of
energy crop production.</P>

<H2><A NAME="switchgrass">Switchgrass--Back to the Future</A></H2>
<P>Pioneers who crossed the Great Plains in covered wagons tell of endless
oceans of tall grasses. The root structure of these grasses formed the sod with
which the early pioneers built their houses on the prairies and also provided
the food for the bison. One of these native prairie grasses was switchgrass, a
coarse-stemmed, hearty plant that grows to more than six feet in height,
producing most of its growth in the warmest and driest months of the year. It is
a perennial, coming up every spring from the previous year's root system.</P>
<P>Switchgrass (<I>Panicum virgatum</I> L.) is a leading candidate for use as
an energy crop. It can produce 5-6 dry tons/acre or more of biomass annually.
Switchgrass will take hold on newly cultivated soils within 1-3 years, depending
on rainfall, soil fertility, and establishment techniques. The grass has
soil-building qualities due to its deep root system that brings elements from
deep soil horizons to the surface.</P>
<P>Switchgrass production for energy could simulate the natural ecosystems of
the Great Plains. Today's remaining prairies have lost much of their diversity
and vigor because of monocropping and lack of invigorating fires. The removal of
the grass for energy production would mimic nature's methods of removal through
fire and herbivore grazing.</P>
<P>With energy cropping, enough material would be left on the ground through
the winter to protect the soil and wildlife. The byproducts from the conversion
processes could be put back on the land along with some nitrogen, replenishing
the nutrients taken off in the harvest.</P>
<P>Production and harvesting of grasses are common agricultural procedures. The
agricultural infrastructure and the social acceptability needed for larger
production of the crop are in place. The preferred harvest techniques are a
one-cut system in which the cutting is done after the first killing frost and a
two-cut system in which the first cutting is made midsummer and the second
occurs after the first frost. The two-cut system appears to have the higher
yield but the yield difference may not justify the additional cost.</P>
<P>The energy potential from switchgrass in Iowa is significant. The federal
agricultural programs have idled more than 3.3 million acres of farm land in the
state. These programs were set up to reduce the amount of feed grain crops being
grown and to prevent soil erosion. As part of the agreement for idling the land,
the farmer is given a yearly cash payment or allowed to participate in a
price-guarantee program for the current crop. If the 3.3 million acres were used
for switchgrass, producing 6 dry tons of material per year, and the material
were then converted to ethanol, yielding 100 gallons of ethanol per ton of
material, 1.98 billion gallons of ethanol would be produced annually. To place
this in perspective, in 1990 Iowa used 1.3 billion gallons of gasoline.</P>
<P>Bringing this scenario about may not be as complex as one might initially
think if federal money were used to build conversion plants instead of paying
farmers not to produce grain crops. Many farmers and landowners have indicated a
willingness to consider producing biomass for energy. Relatively small
conversion facilities might be built in county seat towns. This would guarantee
a market for the grass crop that the farmer could grow and provide the demand
pull necessary to establish a new industry. It would also establish a new crop
in rural America; continue grain crop acreage reduction, minimizing oversupply;
provide for rural revitalization by adding new jobs; lower or eliminate
farm-subsidy payments; limit nonrenewable energy dependence; provide for better
air quality; and lessen the contribution to global warming.</P>
<P>The groundwork is done. Now may be the time for the unified push that is
needed to propel this scenario from dream to reality. The process will not be
easy, but it is necessary.</P>

<H2><A NAME="land">Land Availability</A></H2>
<P>If biomass energy is to contribute significantly to the U.S. energy base, a
large land base must be dedicated to growing energy crops. In a recent study,
the National Resource Inventory (NRI) Database and information on expected
energy crop yields were used to assess what 
<A HREF="http://www.esd.ornl.gov/BFDP/BFDPMOSAIC/ECFMOS/LANDAVAL.gif">land base
in the United States</A> might be capable of growing energy crops and how much
biomass could be produced on that land.</P>
<P>The NRI database contains land use and agricultural capability information
for more than 800,000 systematically selected locations on nonfederal lands and
is designed for regional- and national-scale analyses of land use. To determine
the land base that could support energy crops, the database was first queried to
determine what land was cropland or had a good potential for conversion to
cropland. Tables were developed to identify where that land occurred and its
agricultural quality. In this manner, the gross land base for growing energy
crops in the United States was characterized. To determine the amount of biomass
feedstock that might be grown on that land base, biomass researchers were asked
about the standing yields they would expect on land of varying agricultural
capability in specific U.S. regions. From this information, a table of expected
energy crop yields by location in the country and land agricultural capability
was generated. Merging information from this table with information on land use
and quality from the NRI resulted in regional statistics on land base and
probable yield.</P>
<P>The land base identified includes 392 million acres capable of growing
energy crops in the United States, and most of this land (359 million acres) is
currently used for growing crops. If only land with a probable biomass feedstock
yield of 5 dry tons/acre-year or greater is considered, the land base shrinks to
324 million acres in the case of herbaceous energy feedstock and 225 million
acres in the case of short-rotation-woody-crop energy feedstock. If these acres
were put into energy feedstock production, 2423 million tons of herbaceous
biomass energy feedstock or 1427 million tons of woody feedstock could be
produced annually. If only woody feedstock were produced, more than 57% would
come from the North Central region, 20% from the South Central, and 10% from the
Southeast and Northeast. About the same proportions occur if one considers only
herbaceous feedstock production. The analysis points out that given current
yield assumptions, herbaceous crops could capture a larger land base than woody
crops, and more important, most of the land suitable for energy crops lies in
the North Central region.</P>
<P>Biomass feedstock crop production, of course, competes with more
conventional crop production. Only a portion of the identified land base could
ever be dedicated to energy crops. On the basis of projections of future
agricultural production and markets, perhaps 30 million-40 million acres could
be dedicated to energy crops before these crops would begin to compete with and
displace other agricultural products.</P>
<H2><A NAME="priming">Priming the Energy Pump</A></H2>
<P></P>
<P>The North Central region of the U.S. has more land suitable for growing
energy crops than any other area of the country. Although it is not possible to
calculate exactly how much land is
<I>available</I> for energy crop production in the region, some land is
available now and more is likely to be available in the future. Not only is land
available, but the region also has more technical expertise and research data on
growing energy crops than any other region. Equally important is the fact that
many organizations are extremely interested in developing new land uses. This
combination is ideal for the development of new biofuels industries.</P>
<P>A considerable portion of the U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE) Biofuels
Feedstock Development Program's research budget is devoted to &quot;priming the
pump&quot; in the area. Switchgrass and several other grass species are being
evaluated for their biomass potential in screening trials in Iowa and North
Dakota. New switchgrass germplasm, collect from eight mid-western states, is
being tested at research sites in Indiana, Iowa, and Nebraska. Wood energy crop
research includes a major breeding effort at Iowa State University to produce
new hybrid poplar and eastern cottonwood clones adapted for the territory.
Supporting the breeding effort is physiological modeling and biotechnology
research being conducted by the U.S. Forest Service (USFS) in Rhinelander,
Wisconsin, and at Michigan State University. Hybrid poplar clones in 10 and 20
acre blocks have been planted in Minnesota, North Dakota and South Dakota, and
Wisconsin to investigate operational and environmental aspects of producing wood
energy crops. This project is cost-shared by DOE, USFS and the Electric Power
Research Institute.</P>
<P>Current wood energy crop research builds heavily on the pioneering work that
has been conducted since the mid-70s by the North Central Forest Experiment
Station in Rhinelander, Wisconsin. This work identified the potential of energy
crops in the region and has yielded a solid base of information about hybrid
poplars that is beginning to attract interest among private industries and
farmers. The next
<I>Energy Crops Forum</I> will feature highlights from the past 15 years of
woody crops research in Wisconsin and exciting new developments in Minnesota.</P>

<H2><A NAME="model">Switchgrass -- A Model Species</A></H2>
<P>In order to meet the future need for cellulosic feedstock for conversion to
ethanol, biofuels production strategies will have to rely on species capable of
high production across diverse, often poor quality sites, with minimum adverse
effects to the environment. As these needs are considered, it has become
increasingly clear that herbaceous as well as woody crops will be required to
maintain a stable supply of biofuels feedstock.</P>
<P>Having spent the past 6 years screening 44 herbaceous species, the Biofuels
Feedstock Development Program (BFDP) is intensifying efforts to develop
herbaceous crops as a significant component of a biofuels production strategy.
The decision to focus initially on switchgrass as a model species is based on
the premise that the most efficient use of current resources involves intensive
research on one desirable species rather than more fragmented work on several.</P>
<P>As an endemic species of the tall grass prairie, switchgrass grows naturally
across a wide range of sites extending from Canada to South America. This broad
adaptation is evidenced by the fact that both lowland and upland ecotypes exist.
The very active and deep rooting system equips the species to deal with marginal
sites where water and nutrients limit less hardy species. The regional yields
for switchgrass suggest it is an ideal energy crop due to its perennial growth
habit, relatively low fertilization requirements (a factor in reducing
production costs), and year-round ground cover for erosion control. Important to
its reliability for both the supplier and biofuels production facilities are its
rather high and stable biomass yields even in drought years.</P>
<P>The table below summarizes seven studies funded by BFDP. Maximum and minimum
yields obtained during a representative, postestablishment year show the range
in variation of performance over different soil and site types. Clearly site
selection will be important to the attainment of high yields. The highest yields
achieved to date have come from the lowland ecotypes, `Alamo' and `Kanlow',
grown in the South Central region. Auburn University investigators David Bransby
and Susan Sladden have achieved yields of approximately 15 dry tons/acre in 2
successive years in their research plots in Alabama.</P>
<P>With respect to environmental concerns regarding intensive biofuels
production, switchgrass also appears to be a winner. Research at Virginia
Polytechnic Institute by Lee Daniels and his students indicates that switchgrass
can actually improve soil quality on marginal sites with its deep rooting
pattern. Studies at Iowa have documented very low erosion rates and low nitrogen
loss by leaching for switchgrass compared to conventional row crops. In
addition, increased food and cover for wildlife are other important
environmental considerations for this remarkable species.</P>
<P>As good as this crop is, it can be made even better through additional
breeding and production-oriented research. Recently initiated BFDP-funded
research will proceed across four fronts: classical breeding and selection
techniques; physiological studies to identify short-term criteria for promoting
and monitoring yield improvement; tissue culture to assist in production and
protection of new cultivars; and permanent field plots designed for
documentation and cultural improvement of longer-term yield potential. The first
pilot-scale biofuels facilities for production of ethanol from cellulose are
expected to be built in the late '90s. As these plans near completion, the
availability of improved herbaceous varieties and production techniques will be
very important to the critical challenges of interfacing bioproduction and
bioconversion on a timely scale.</P>

<H2><A NAME="Vision"><B>A Vision of the Future</B></A></H2>
<P>Within the next 20 to 40 years, millions of acres of cropland in the United
States could support the production of crops for energy. Rows of short-rotation
woody crops (SRWC) would grow alongside corn and sorghum on flat cropland, and
lush fields of grass would thrive on gently sloping hillsides. This vision is
held by program managers at the U.S. Department of Energy, scientists at Oak
Ridge National Laboratory, and many researchers around the world. Exact
predictions are impossible, but the United States appears to have the productive
capacity to support significant biomass-based energy production.  Preliminary
analyses estimate 35-70 million acres could become available for energy crops
without impairing the country's ability to meet other agricultural demands.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Energy crops of the future will differ from today's food and energy crops.
Although starch, sugar, and oilseed crops will remain a part of the energy crop
mix, whole-plant biomass crops (trees and grasses) are expected to predominate.
The amount of useful energy fixed on a per acre basis will increase. Product
losses will decrease and economic advantages of whole-plant use will be enhanced
as more efficient biomass energy conversion systems become available. </P>
<P></P>
<P>Energy crops will be selected on the basis of their ability to meet
stringent criteria. First and foremost, high yet cost-effective yields must be
achieved in environmentally sustainable management systems. Crops must be able
to grow productively despite climatic and biological stresses. They must be
inherently pest resistant, requiring very little pesticide. Species, varieties,
and management systems must be developed to promote efficient nutrient
recycling.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Genetically superior varieties may be cloned to capture their high
production potential. However, a large number of different clones and clonal
mixtures will be planted to increase diversity and reduce risks from pests and
diseases. Cropping patterns and cropping systems that further reduce
environmental risks will be developed, and plantings will be carefully planned
to improve local environmental quality.</P>
<P></P>
<P>This vision will not be possible without work. It requires a solid base of
research and cooperation among researchers, policymakers, and private sector
entrepreneurs. Making this vision a reality would be a significant step toward a
sustainable, renewable future, a goal well worth working for.</P>

<H2><A NAME="Environment"><B>Energy Crops and the Environment</B></A></H2>
<P>Many environmental policy groups are aware of the potentially positive role
energy crops and biomass fuels can play in controlling greenhouse gases (such as
CO2) and improving air quality. Although climate change and air quality issues
drive this interest, concern is also growing for improved biodiversity,
sustainability, and wildlife habitat, especially for threatened and endangered
species on both local and national scales. Facts about the environmental impact
of energy crops are scarce. In FY 1992 the U.S. Department of Energy through Oak
Ridge National Laboratory will begin to address this deficiency by initiating
research on the interaction of energy crops with the environment in cooperation
with environmental groups and existing R&amp;D projects.</P>
<P></P>
<P>A recent review of the rather limited literature on wildlife, habitat, and
sustainability of SRWC, combined with anecdotal observations and discussions
with environmental groups has illuminated some important issues and results. By
the second or third year of growth, for example, SRWC stands temporarily take on
species composition characteristics of old field succession with juvenile trees
and a grassy understory. By the fifth year, fast-growing SRWC stands more
closely approximate hardwood forests than old fields or conifer monocultures.
The wildlife species diversity in SRWC stands appears to improve by contact with
native forests. Data collection on the effects of habitat structure and
landscape patterns on wildlife will be high on the research agenda.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Chemical use and erosion associated with energy crops are also of major
concern. Comparisons with annual food crops are generally favorable, but energy
crops may also be planted on land now in perennial fodder crops and pasture. R&amp;D
recommendations for complete weed control in SRWC stands and relatively high
fertilization rates in both woody and herbaceous stands may need operational
modifications to meet environmental concerns. Use of soil-stabilizing ground
covers such as nitrogen-fixing legumes and strip herbiciding instead of
broadcast herbiciding could reduce chemical use, improve sustainability by
reducing erosion, and improve habitat quality during plantation establishment.
</P>
<P></P>
<P>Forest clear-cutting issues are inappropriately linked with SRWC. Sufficient
excess agricultural land is available so that forest land is not required for
energy crop production. No forests will be cleared for SRWC plantings. A related
issue may be the public response to the harvesting of energy crops once they
have provided improved habitat conditions for wildlife. Careful early planning
with local wildlife agencies and conservation and sportsman's groups will be
important.</P>
<P></P>
<P>The positive effects on greenhouse gases and air quality from the use of
energy crops for fuel should remain an important part of the environmental
equation and will be more clearly documented in the future.</P>

<H2><A NAME="Populars"><B>Poplars popular in the Pacific Northwest</B></A></H2>
<P>Most forestry researchers would be proud to claim that in just 12 years
their genetic hybridization and silviculture research had generated 30,000
seedlings, of which 2,000 selected clones had been placed in 25 separate field
trials. But for the scientific team that began in 1978 with the joint efforts of
Reinhard Stettler, a forest geneticist at the University of Washington (UW), and
Paul Heilman, a silviculturist at Washington State University (WSU), these
hybridization accomplishments and field trial networks only hint at their
considerable scientific progress and technology transfer success.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Initially, most of their research focused on crossing various
<I>Populus</I> species with the native black cottonwood (<I>P. trichocarpa</I>)
to create new interspecific hybrids better suited for short-rotation  forestry.
When a group of <I>P. trichocarpa</I> x <I>P. deltoides</I> (TxD) hybrids
demonstrated 100 to 200% growth improvements in yield trials, naturally the
response was to probe for reasons why the plants performed so differently. Since
then research has expanded into many areas, including work on root morphology,
seedling nutrition, leaf anatomy, whole-plant physiology, cellular biology, and
mechanisms of pest resistance.
</P>
<P>Today the poplar research performed at UW and WSU includes 11 principal
investigators, their co-workers, and funding in excess of $1.6 million from
federal, state, and private sources. Exciting developments are occurring in all
phases of the research and technology transfer. Two-year growth in 1990 field
trials suggested, for example, that new hybrids, <I>P. trichocarpa</I> x
<I>P. nigra</I> (TxN), appear promising for rapid growth in dry areas in
eastern Washington and Oregon. Some of the top TxD hybrids demonstrated high
performance in both eastern and western Washington, especially when irrigation
was applied. Evaluations of specific gravity show ranges of 0.27 to 0.45 among
different hybrid clones, thus offering excellent opportunities for selecting
high-performance clones with high energy content. An extension bulletin on
growing hybrid poplars in the Pacific Northwest has just been published (see
<A HREF="#publications">Publications of Interest</A>). 
</P>
<P>The mapping of the <I>Populus</I> genome using molecular markers is a new
effort under way at UW. This mapping allows previous information relating to
plant morphology and physiology, wood quality, and pest resistance to be linked
to specific DNA sites within the genome, possibly leading to direct selection of
the genes responsible for such traits. Along with the continued efforts in basic
Populus biology, this type of research should increase hybrid productivity. 
</P>
<P>This interdisciplinary group of researchers has worked on many facets of
poplar biology. They have also demonstrated how genetic and environmental
manipulation can be effectively orchestrated toward specific goals related to
improving biomass yields in short-rotation woody crops. Several companies are
contributing money to the research. Hybrids produced by UW are now being planted
commercially by James River Corporation and 25,000 to 50,000 acres may be
planted in the near future by Boise Cascade and Scott Paper companies.</P>

<H2><A NAME="James River">James River first to harvest SRWC in U.S.</A> </H2>
<P>The first commercial harvest of short-rotation woody crops (SRWC) in the
United States is taking place this year on James River Corporation land in the
Pacific Northwest. The trees, mostly hybrid poplar clones developed by the
University of Washington, were planted by the former Crown Zellerbach
Corporation in 1983 on the Lower Columbia River Fiber Farm (LCRFF), a
10,000-acre project on previously planted fertile bottomland. For logistical
reasons, the first plantations were located adjacent to an existing papermill. 
Luckily, the site has proven to be an excellent choice for the production of
hybrid poplars.</P>
<P></P>
<P>The supervisor of the LCRFF, Don Rice, stresses there are five keys to
success in growing SRWC.</P>
<P></P>
<UL>
<LI>Suitable lands for establishing the crops must be used.</LI>
<LI>Improved genetic materials must be available to justify the use of
intensified culture techniques and high-quality land.</LI>
<LI>Agricultural production techniques must be applied to the planting and
tending of the trees.</LI>
<LI>Specialized harvesting and processing systems must be used.</LI>
<LI>Planting, tending, and harvesting approaches must be sensitive to and
compatible with the environment.</LI></UL>
<P></P>
<P>One possible reason that James River has been so successful in adapting
agricultural production methods to tree growing is that the company started with
personnel trained in farm management rather than forest management. James River
also took advantage of the expertise of university researchers who were
developing production techniques for the new hybrid poplar clones. Even so, a
learning curve of 3 to 5 years was required to arrive at the best management
practices for the LCRFF site. James River continues to have a good relationship
with and be supportive of academic research, even though the company has
invested in its own genetic- improvement and cultural-management research
programs. This cooperation assures that the corporation will have access to
multiple resources to address any problems that may arise.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Although specialized harvesting and processing systems are not commercially
available, James River's solution is likely to result in success. The company
has hired a qualified harvest equipment engineer and conducted field research to
determine the best available options.</P>
<P></P>
<P>James River personnel are learning by experience and experimentation how to
manage an operation that is not only productive but also harmonious with the
environment. James River appears committed to growing SRWC in a way that
maximizes profit and minimizes environmental impact. This successful operation
may serve as a model for commercializing SRWC in other parts of the country.</P>

<H2><A NAME="field day">Field day a huge success</A></H2>
<P>An energy crop field day focusing on short-rotation management of
cottonwoods, hybrid poplars, and alders in the Pacific Northwest was held on
July 10, 1991, in Yelm, Washington. The event, organized by Connie Harrington
and Dean DeBell of the U.S. Forest Service Pacific Northwest Station, attracted
approximately 80 people from diverse environments: 7 wood products companies, 2
newspapers, a mining company, local and state government agencies, several
landowners, and university and forest service scientists, including some from
Canada and Europe.</P>
<P>The well-organized event offered a profusion of informative handouts and
knowledgeable speakers presented technical information on red alder cottonwood
and hybrid poplar silviculture; fertilizer trials; and genetics research.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Tours of the hybrid poplars plantations were a high point. The observed
growth in the various experiments was impressive and illustrated the
possibilities offered by short-rotation woody crops using genetically superior
plant material.
</P>
<H2><A NAME="CAA">Clean Air Act affects biomass fuels</A></H2>
<P>On November 15, 1990, a significant revision of the Clean Air Act (CAA) was
signed into law. CAA is designed to improve air quality through reducing smog,
air toxics and volatile organic compounds (VOCs), carbon monoxide (CO), acid
precipitation (sulfur dioxide [SO<SUB>2</SUB>] and nitrogen oxides [NO<SUB>x</SUB>]),
and chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs). A number of provisions of the revised CAA will
affect the production of biomass and fuels derived from biomass.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Ozone, the main ingredient in smog, is formed by the reaction of volatile
organic compounds (VOCs) with NO<SUB>x</SUB> in the presence of sunlight. CAA
reduces allowable VOCs in gasoline and mandates reduced NOx emissions. In areas
where ozone exceeds Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) standards, gasoline
containing 2% by weight (wt%) of oxygen will be required by January 1, 1995.
This could affect 22% of the gasoline sold.</P>
<P></P>
<P>The major source of carbon monoxide is the transportation sector. By
November 1, 1992, nonattainment areas (accounting for 27% of the gasoline sold)
will require gasoline with 2.7 wt% oxygen during certain winter months. In the
most serious CO nonattainment areas (e.g., Los Angeles, Houston, and New York),
gasoline with 3.1 wt% oxygen may be required.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Provisions to reduce ozone formation and CO emissions require oxygenated
fuels such as ethanol, methanol, ethyl tertiary butyl ether (ETBE), and methyl
tertiary butyl ether (MTBE) that can be derived from biomass. The presence of
oxygen in gasoline reduces VOCs and CO emissions. Ethanol, methanol, ETBE, and
MTBE contain 35, 50, 18, and 16 wt% oxygen, respectively. These fuels are also
good octane sources.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Electric utilities burning coal are the primary sources of SO<SUB>2</SUB>
emissions. CAA provisions to reduce SO<SUB>2</SUB> emissions make biomass fuels
more attractive to utilities. Under regulations to be developed by EPA by May
15, 1992, renewable fuels (including biomass) will qualify for additional
emissions allocations for acid rain, primarily through SO<SUB>2</SUB>
reductions (Sect. 404). To also reduce overall SO<SUB>2</SUB> emissions, sulfur
content of diesel fuel is limited to 0.05%.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Some sections of the CAA specifically affect biomass and biomass-derived
fuels. For instance, Section 231 specifically directs research on substituting
alcohol esters of high erucic acid rapeseed oil for diesel. Other sections may
have indirect impacts. The prescribed burning used in site preparation for
production of some crops may eventually require operating permits (Title V).</P>
<P></P>
<P>Although the effects of the CAA on biomass commercialization are uncertain,
the Act mandates a study (Sect. 808) to calculate &quot;environmental benefits
of renewable energy.&quot; Regulations are to be developed that reward renewable
energy technologies for these environmental benefits.</P>

<P>The Biofuels Feedstock Development Program (BFDP) is the U.S. Department of
Energy's national program to develop low-cost, environmentally acceptable
biomass energy crops and cropping systems. To reach its goal, BFDP has sought
and supported long-term (5 years or more) research and development at more than
30 universities, 5 U.S. Department of Agriculture research units, and 4 private
companies, as well as research and analysis projects at Oak Ridge National
Laboratory. Oak Ridge National Laboratory has provided technical leadership and
field management for the program since 1978. BFDP currently supports studies in
five areas: woody energy species; herbaceous energy species; environmental
research; systems integration and analysis; and scale-up, feasibility, and
demonstration.
</P>
<P>This bibliography is a compilation of materials published since 1978, when
the program began, through December 1994. It was compiled primarily from
information reported to BFDP in the quarterly, annual, and final progress
reports of its researchers. BFDP encourages cooperative research and actively
seeks cost-sharing for its projects. Much of the work included in this
bibliography would not have been possible without the significant support many
projects have received from other public and private sources. It is difficult to
determine sponsorship for any one component in an integrated research program.
If materials are included that should not be credited to BFDP, please send
corrections to Anne Ehrenshaft at the address below.
</P>
<P>BFDP-sponsored or cooperatively-funded researchers produced 8 books, 6 book
chapters, 549 journal articles, 290 conference papers, 74 dissertations and
theses, 430 posters and presentations, and 308 technical reports. This
bibliography has been limited to approximately 1000 published journal articles,
books or chapters, proceedings papers, and other publications. Most of the
journal articles, books, and conference proceedings are available through
libraries or the publisher listed in the citation. Reports published by Oak
Ridge National Laboratory are available through the National Technical
Information Service. For price and availability contact:

</P>
<P>This report discusses the biologic, environmental, economic, and operational
issues associated with growing woody crops in managed plantations. Information
on plantation productivity, environmental issues and impacts, and costs is drawn
from DOE's Biofuels Feedstock Development as well as commercial operations in
the U.S. and elsewhere. The particular experiences from three countries --
Brazil, the Philippines, and Hawaii (U.S.) -- are discussed in considerable
detail.

<P><B><A NAME="Introduction">Introduction</A></B> 
</P>
<P> Biomass accounts for nearly 15% of world energy supplies.<A
HREF="notes.html#1">1</A> In industrialized countries, biomass supplies about
3%, or 8 exajoules (EJ), of total primary energy. The dominant and fastest
growing use of biomass fuels in industrialized countries is for process heat and
electricity.<A HREF="notes.html#2">2</A> In the developing countries, biomass
fuel supplies about 48 EJ or 35% of total primary energy. Most of this biomass
energy is used traditionally for domestic cooking and space heating. However,
where there are industrial and agricultural enterprises, wood, bagasse, rice
hull, and other waste products are often used to generate heat for agricultural
processes such as crop drying, steam to drive small-scale industrial processes,
and electricity for on-site use and sometimes for off-site power sales. 
</P>
<P></P>
<P> The recent interest in converting biomass to electricity comes not only
from its potential as a low-cost, indigenous supply of power, but for its
potential environmental and developmental benefits. For example, biomass may be
a globally important mitigation option to reduce the rate of CO<SUB>2</SUB>
buildup by sequestering carbon and by displacing fossil fuels. Renewably-grown
biomass contributes only a very small amount of carbon to the atmosphere.
Locally, plantations can lessen soil erosion, provide a means to restore
degraded lands, offset emissions and local impacts from fossil-fired power
generation (e.g., SO<SUB>2</SUB> and NO<SUB>x</SUB>), and, perhaps, reduce
demands on existing forests. In addition to the direct power and environmental
benefits, biomass energy systems offer numerous other benefits, especially for
developing countries. Some of these benefits include the employment of
underutilized labor and the production of co- and by-products (e.g., fuelwood).
</P>
<P> 
</P>
<P> Nearly all of the experience with biomass for power generation is based on
the use of waste and residue fuels (primarily wood/wood wastes and agricultural
residues). The production of electric power from plantation grown wood is an
emerging technology with considerable promise. However, actual commercial use of
plantation-grown fuels for power generation is limited to a few isolated
experiences. Wood from plantations is not an inexpensive energy feedstock, and
as long as worldwide prices of coal, oil and gas are relatively low, the
establishment of plantations dedicated to supplying electric power or other
higher forms of energy will occur only where financial subsidies or incentives
exist or where other sources of energy are not available.
</P>
<P> 
</P>
<P> In countries where biomass plantations are supplying energy on a commercial
basis, such as in Brazil, the Philippines and Sweden, it can be shown that a
combination of government policies and/or high conventional energy prices have
stimulated the use of short-rotation plantations for energy. Brazil used tax
incentives beginning in the mid-1960s to initiate a reforestation program to
provide for industrial wood energy and wood product needs.<A HREF="notes.html#3">3</A>
As a consequence of the Brazilian Forestry Code with its favorable tax
incentives, the planted forest area in Brazil increased from 470,000 ha to 6.5
million ha by 1993.<A HREF="notes.html#4">4</A> With the discontinuation of the
tax incentives in 1988, plantation establishment in Brazil has slowed although
the commercial feasibility of using eucalyptus for energy and other products has
been clearly demonstrated.<A HREF="notes.html#5">5</A> In Sweden, where
district heating with wood is relatively common, the government used direct
subsidies to farmers and by 1992 over 6,000 ha of commercial willow plantations
had been planted. Government support was also used to provide extension services
to farmers, distribute improved plant materials and contract with regional power
plants to buy the biomass and fund an extensive research and development
program.<A HREF="notes.html#6">6</A> The Dendro Thermal Power Program in the
Philippines started off with a considerable amount of government support through
farmer loan programs and technical assistance that resulted in nearly 18,000 ha
of leucaena being planted in the early 1980s. With the demise of government
support in the mid-80's, and because of inadequate planning, poor technical
decisions and inexperience with biomass energy systems, the program failed.
Today, very little of the planted area is supplying feedstocks for electric
power.<A HREF="notes.html#7">7</A>
</P>
<P> 
</P>
<P> The commercialization of short-rotation energy plantations are more likely
to occur where market opportunities coincide with suitable crop production areas
(i.e., availability of local expertise on soil and crop management, and locally
adapted sources of selected fast-growing plant materials). In considering the
potential for commercially viable biomass energy systems, it is necessary to
think beyond conversion technologies, crop yield potential and site-specific
production costs. To be successful developers must be cognizant of fuel prices;
energy, environmental and agricultural policies; infrastructure support;
financing arrangements; conversion technology requirements; potential risks; and
local environmental conditions to make informed decisions about location, crop
type and management approach. Successful ventures also require regional (or
local) crop development and research activities to assure the availability of
selected materials that are adapted to soils and climates of the region and the
availability of knowledge and techniques for crop management.
</P>
<P> 
</P>
<P> This Report focuses on the biologic, environmental, economic and
operational issues to be considered by decision makers contemplating the
establishment of biomass plantations to provide fuel for power generation.
Although some of the policy, social, and infrastructure issues will be alluded
to, they are very country specific and difficult to treat generically. To
provide context, three case studies are first discussed in Chapter 1. Chapter 2
considers concepts associated with plantation management that would apply to
plantations established for nearly any purpose. Chapter 3 discusses harvest and
handling technologies as well as electricity conversion technologies. Chapter 4
deals with environmental issues that must be considered in the establishment and
harvesting of short-rotation wood plantations as well as social and
environmental benefits of locally produced energy resources. Chapter 5
integrates the sections together by discussing the economics of producing wood
for energy and the implications of scaling factors.
</P>
<P> 
</P>
<P> The information on plantation growth and environmental concerns used in
this Report has largely been drawn from commercial experience in the production
of short-rotation forests in the U.S. and Brazil and from research data
generated by the Biofuels Feedstock Development Program in the U.S. and similar
programs in Sweden, U.K. and other European countries. Information on the use of
wood for energy has largely been drawn from available information on biomass
energy projects using wood wastes and residues.

<HR>
<P>Since 1978, the <B>U.S. Department of Energy's </B>Biofuels Feedstock
Development Program (BFDP) has moved the nation closer to the realization of a
biofuels industry based on short-rotation woody crops (SRWC) and herbaceous
energy crops (HEC). The BFDP has supported research projects involving more than
100 federal, university, and private research institutions. The research has
been highly leveraged with cost-sharing from the U.S. Department of Agriculture,
private industry, and state agencies.</P>
<P>Crop development research continues to be the core of the BFDP, supported
and complemented by a range of research efforts. Environmental research on
biomass crops is developing sustainable systems that will contribute to the
biodiversity of agricultural landscapes. Systems integration and analysis is
defining and quantifying factors affecting price and potential supplies of
biomass crops at regional and national scales. Scale-up studies, feasibility
analysis and demonstrations are establishing operational costs and
characteristics of integrated biomass systems. Information management and
dissemination activities are facilitating the communication of results among a
community of researchers, policymakers, and potential users and producers of
energy crops.</P>

focus on Eastern cottonwood (Populus deltoides ) which has potential as a
biofuels crop per se and also has potential value as a parent in interspecific
hybridizations. Eastern cottonwood has been selected as the primary species for
woody biofuels development in the North Central US because of its relative
resistance to Septoria canker, which limits deployment of many poplar hybrids in
the region.</DD></DL>

<H2>What are Dedicated Feedstocks? </H2>
<P>Dedicated feedstocks are perennial grasses and trees  grown as crops
specifically to provide the required raw materials to industrial enterprises
especially bioenergy producers. The Biofuels Feedstock Development Program,
funded by the U.S. Department of Energy's Biofuels System Division, has
identified hybrid poplars, hybrid willows, silver maples, and switchgrass as
having the most potential for dedicated use as bioenergy feedstocks over a wide
geographic range. Other feedstocks such as agricultural and forest wastes,
recycled paper, or municipal wastes are valuable short term bioenergy resources
but do not provide the same long term advantages as dedicated feedstocks.

<H2>Where can dedicated feedstocks be grown?</H2>
<P>Recent studies estimate that most of the approximately 400 million acres of 
land classified as cropland in the U.S. are suitable for growing dedicated
feedstocks. Perennial grasses and trees can often be economically grown on land
that is not suitable for conventional crops and can provide the same protection
from erosion recommended for agricultural set aside or Conservation Reserve
Program lands.

poplars, hybrid willows, silver maples, and switchgrass have the greatest
potential for dedicated energy and raw material crops across a wide geographic
range. Agricultural, forest and municipal wastes, and recycled paper, are
valuable short term &quot;bioenergy&quot; resources, but alone do not provide
the long term advantages of dedicated tree and grass energy crops. Together,
bioenergy from waste sources and dedicated crops can provide substantial
contributions for energy production needs. The main goal of dedicated crops is
to provide energy and material sources while increasing the ability of the
agricultural community to meet economic needs. Additionally, these crops may
provide environmental benefits such as native wildlife habitat, improved water
quality, and increased soil conservation over traditional agricultural row
crops.</P>

<H2>Where can energy crops be grown?</H2>
<P> <IMG ALIGN="RIGHT" SRC="landavsm.gif">Perennial grasses and trees can
often be grown on farm land that is less suitable for conventional row crops and
can provide the same protection from erosion recommended for agricultural set
aside or Conservation Reserve Program lands. Complementing traditional row crops
with tree and grass crops on marginal farmland can provide land owners the
option of diversifying their income opportunities with environ-mentally
sustainable crops.</P>

<TD>
<H2>Background</H2></TD>
<TD>
<P>Drought tolerance of various species of poplar trees (<I>Populus</I>) and
their hybrid offspring is the subject of a cooperative research and development
agreement (CRADA) between <I><B>Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Biofuels
Feedstock Development Program (BFDP)</B></I> and <I><B>Boise Cascade
Corporation</B></I>. The purpose of the CRADA is to verify that certain
biochemical indicators can be used to predict which poplar clones can best
survive periods of little or no rain and still be productive.</P>
<P>Research has shown that some individual plants and plant species tolerate
water shortages by maintaining or accumulating high concentrations of sugars,
amino acids, organic acids, and inorganic ions. The presence and elevated
amounts of these substances may indicate that a particular plant can tolerate
drought.</P></TD></TR>
<TR ALIGN="LEFT" VALIGN="TOP">
<TD>
<H2>Methodology</H2></TD>
<TD>
<P>In a study of six poplar clones, the ORNL researchers isolated 60 to 80
metabolites that may be involved in drought tolerance. High concentrations of
several metabolites were found in clones identified as drought tolerant.</P>
<P>For the CRADA, which is funded by the<I><B> U.S. Department of Energy's
Office of Transportation Technologies</B></I>, the ORNL researchers will
validate whether these plant metabolites can be used to identify drought
tolerance in poplar trees. Boise Cascade is poplar clones under six levels of
irrigation in their drought stress facility in eastern Oregon. ORNL will collect
leaf samples from these trees, measure the total amount of dissolved substances,
and determine the concentrations of metabolites that may indicate drought
tolerance.</P>
<P>In other work related to the CRADA, BFDP researchers will screen 60
genotypes &#151; individuals sharing a unique genetic makeup &#151; in large
scale field trials to assess the validity of using the metabolites as
drought-tolerance indicators. Molecular markers that prove to be correlated with
drought tolerance will be mapped on the <I>Populus</I> genome.</P></TD></TR>
<TR ALIGN="LEFT" VALIGN="TOP">
<TD>
<H2>Hoped for Results</H2></TD>
<TD>
<P>The ability of <I>Populus</I> clones to tolerate drought is critical to
short- rotation silviculture. The identification of drought-tolerant genotypes
will enable industry to manage water resources more efficiently. Boise Cascade,
a major U.S. producer of <I>Populus</I> fiber, hopes to use the technology to
maintain improved growth rates in hybrid <I>Populus</I> while minimizing use of
irrigation water. The ability to use biochemical and molecular markers will
reduce the amount of time, money and effort needed to identify and test
drought-tolerant genotypes.</P></TD></TR>

<P> In the Pacific Northwest, two poplar species,<I> Populus trichocarpa</I>
and <I>Populus deltoides</I>, were crossed to produce a hybrid that exhibits
increased vigor and yield. The leaves of the hybrid are about four times as
large as the leaves of either parent at a similar age. These hybrids are now
being grown commercially by forest products companies in the region.</P>
<P>Similar breeding efforts are underway in the north-central and southeastern
U.S. All three breeding efforts rely upon information provided by physiologists,
pathologists, and entomologists to aid in the selection of useful, reliable
clones. As an example of one of the supportive research projects, a Cooperative
Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) with Boise Cascade is under way to
evaluate biochemical indicators for drought tolerance in the hybrids. This study
uses the hybrids in an operational field irrigation experiment to characterize
biochemical changes in large commercially grown trees. In all regions, continued
progress towards fast-growing adapted poplar clones requires a team effort.</P></TD>
<TD ALIGN="LEFT" VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="50%">
<P>In the Pacific Northwest this teamwork is represented by two
industrial/university-based cooperatives; one at Oregon State University and the
other at University of Washington. The program's newest poplar breeding project,
in the Southeast, includes seven industrial and three university participants
interacting to accomplish initial selections of poplar parents and broad field
testing of the selected plant materials. This effort is being coordinated by
Mississippi State University. Breeding of poplar in the north- central region is
a multi-state effort that includes the USDA-Forest Service and four
universities, with the USDA-Forest Service coordinating this research effort.
Based on the ongoing, long- term breeding of poplars, the commercially available
clones of today in the Pacific Northwest, north-central and southeastern regions
will be rapidly replaced by new materials in the near future.</P></TD></TR></TABLE>

<H3>Introduction</H3>
<P>The Biofuels Feedstock Development Program sponsored by the U.S. Department
of Energy's (DOE) Biofuels Systems Division is the only U.S. program of research
on the development of new woody and herbaceous crops for energy with a national
scope of activity. Since its initiation in 1978, the program's field management
staff at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) have consistently tried to link
DOE-funded research with related state and private sector research and
development activities. By 1995, these linkages have resulted in nearly a 100%
cost-sharing of the research and a coordination of effort across the U.S. that
is benefiting all organizations involved.
</P>
<P>While biomass energy systems based on sustainably produced biomass crops are
not currently competitive in today's fuel markets, drivers for the continued
development of sustainable biomass supply systems include domestic energy
security, rural job creation, global warming concerns, CO<SUB>2</SUB>
mitigation obligations and EPAct requirements. Section 502 of EPAct requires
sufficient domestic replacement fuels to substitute, on an energy equivalent
basis, 10% by 2000 and 30% by 2010 of the project consumption of motor fuel by
light duty vehicles in the U.S. (<A HREF="#doe">DOE</A>, 1994). Biofuels
provide the only option for meeting this  requirement with a renewable fuel.
</P>
<P>Initially biofuels production can be based on waste lignocellulosics from
agricultural, wood products, and municipal refuse. Biomass power producers are
also competing for these waste resources at the same time that mulching and
recycling efforts are reducing the size of the waste resource. To augment the
waste resource supplies and meet the 2010 EPAct requirements for biofuels and
biomass power requirements, several millions of acres of dedicated biomass crops
may need to be in production by 2010.
</P>
<P>The DOE Biofuels Feedstock Development Program (BFDP) has defined its
mission as one of providing leadership in the development and demonstration of
environmentally acceptable and commercially viable biomass supply systems. The
mission is being pursued by the ORNL BFDP management team in a way that
</P>
<OL>
<LI>integrates and promotes multiple objectives for agriculture, energy and the
environment; 
</LI>
<LI>seeks and fosters the best research, development, and demonstration in the
private, academic and government sectors; and 
</LI>
<LI>ensures information on biomass supply systems is accurate, understandable,
and accessible.
</LI></OL>
<P>and has been undertaken to insure
</P>
<OL>
<LI>new, profitable and environmentally acceptable cropping options for biomass
producers;
</LI>
<LI>secure, affordable and sustainable supplies for biomass end-users; and
</LI>
<LI>that the U.S. is capable of meeting up to 15% of its primary energy demand
from dedicated biomass crops.
</LI></OL>
<P>The BFDP strives to not only assure that the dedicated biomass crop
technologies are available when and where needed, but also that the
infrastructure for production and delivery of the biomass supplies is also
developed in tandem. The six major task areas of the program that support these
goals are described below.
</P>
<P></P>
<HR>
<P></P>
<H3><A NAME="wood">Short-Rotation Woody Crop Research</A></H3>
<P>BFDP's objective is to develop and refine short-rotation woody crop (SRWC)
silviculture systems for the production of reliable, low-cost, high quality,
sustainable wood for fuel and fiber in the U.S. This task includes the
development of equipment systems for improving the efficiency and reducing the
cost of producing and harvesting SRWC.
</P>
<P>The BFDP has supported woody crop research integrating traditional breeding,
silvicultural research, and molecular genetics throughout the U.S. In the
Pacific Northwest, a well integrated research effort has led to the development
of high-yielding (ca. 8-12 dry per acre per year) hybrid poplar cultivars
adapted to the environmental, climatic and biological constraints of the region
(<A HREF="#Wright">Wright</A>, 1994). These poplars are being planted on almost
50,000 acres with more than double that amount anticipated to be planted within
the next 5 years. In other parts of the U.s., yield improvement has not been as
dramatic but steady progress is being made using a combination of genetic and
silvicultural approaches. The yields of the best clones at 7 years old are
approaching 5 dry tons per acres per year in scale-up clone-site trial and up to
8 dry tons per acre per year in small plots in the North Central Region.
</P>
<P>The BFDP is gradually modifying and linking the ongoing research funded at
several institutions to create regional woody crop development centers for the
North Central Region, the South and the Northeast that are modeled after the
successfully integrated efforts in the Pacific Northwest. At a minimum, each
center will optimally involve the integration of silviculture, genetics, plant
breeding, entomology and pathology. To the extent possible, new and ongoing
research dealing with mechanization and harvesting, economic analysis,
environmental studies and demonstrations will be linked with the regional crop
development centers as well.
</P>
<P>The principal effort of the three regional crop development centers is the
selection and breeding of new hybrid poplar plant materials for SRWC production.
In the North Central Region, the Iowa State University manages the genetic
improvement of hybrid poplar in collaboration with 3 universities, and 2 U.S.
Department of Agriculture (USDA) Forest Service Research Stations. Several
nurseries and paper companies are contributing to this effort through
participation in the North-Central Hybrid Poplar Research Consortium. In the
southern part of the U.S., the Mississippi State University is initiating
breeding work on hybrid poplar in collaboration with 2 other universities and
the USDA Forest Service. Although a consortium has not yet been formally
established, 6 paper companies have agreed to assist with germplasm collections
and 3 companies are scheduled to assist with regional trials when new clonal
material is produced. In the Northeast, the State University of New York, in
close association with the University of Toronto in Canada, is serving as the
focal point for the evaluation of willow hybrids in the U.S. Several private
companies, primarily utilities, are contributing funds, manpower, and lands to
support trials of new willow clones. In the Pacific Northwest, a very well
integrated effort continues with cooperation between 3 universities and a large
number of companies. Now that breeding for the Pacific Northwest is being done
by private companies, the University of Washington (UW) is serving as the focal
point for the <I>Populus</I> Genetic Mapping Cooperative. A closely linked
effort is the <I>Populus</I> Genetic Transformation Cooperative managed by
Oregon State University. Both these efforts transcend the region and have
national applicability for all hybrid poplar work. Details of some of the work
ongoing at each of these centers was recently described by 
<A HREF="#Tschaplinski">Tschaplinski and Wright</A> (1994).
</P>
<P>All genetic selections made by the woody crop development centers are being
tested in several regional yield and site-adaptability trials. Productivity
estimates are being verified on a per unit area basis. Adaptability over a broad
geographic area is being established. Climate-site factors are being evaluated
in terms of their impact on pest resistance and, finally, technology is being
transferred from the research center to subregions where landowners/producers
who will be growing the crops can gain &quot;hands on experience&quot; with new
production systems. Four regional test sites are in operation or planned for the
North Central Region. Optimally designed tests will evaluate 30-50 new, selected
clones per year, planted in large monoclonal blocks over a five-year period.
From these tests it is likely that a single highly productive, regionally
adapted, pest resistant clone will be identified each year following the initial
five years of growth. Results from these efforts will allow better species-site
matching and improved productivity estimates from each site (<A HREF="#Downing2">Downing
and Tuskan, 1995</A>).
</P>
<P></P>
<HR>
<P></P>
<H3><A NAME="herb">Herbaceous Energy Crop Research</A></H3>
<P>The goal of herbaceous energy crop (HEC) research is to develop crops that
can be economically produced on a wide variety of sites and readily and
practically incorporated into conventional farming operations. Systematic
screening studies in a variety of locations have shown that switchgrass can meet
this goal for several regions of the U.S. While other species may also be viable
candidates, switchgrass has been chosen as the model herbaceous energy crop
species for demonstrating the concept. It has a geographical range that covers
most of the United States and portions of Canada and Central America and is
found in diverse habitats ranging from Midwestern prairies to brackish marshes
and open woods. The grass can be used both as a biofuel and as a forage species,
although optimal characteristics for each use differ. Switchgrass has several
positive environmental attributes including low nutrient use, low pesticide
requirements, and a perennial growth habit (<A HREF="#McLaughlin">McLaughlin</A>,
1994).
</P>
<P>Screening studies continue in order to identify the most promising cultivars
and cultural practices. Selected varieties have been utilized in a switchgrass
breeding program to further improve production potential. Breeding studies are
being integrated with physiological evaluations to develop physiologically based
selection criteria for improving yield and identifying promising parents.
Classical breeding techniques are being used for rapid improvement of existing
varieties with the most desirable phenological and physiological attributes.
Tissue culture techniques are being developed to augment classical breeding
efforts.
</P>
<P>In 1995, there were seven actively funded projects in the herbaceous species
task. Six of the projects, located in the Southeastern region of the U.S., are
collaborating to develop the management techniques, physiological understanding,
and breeding technology to establish, produce and harvest switchgrass in an
economically and environmentally sound manner. The six projects incorporate
production research and regional variety trials at three locations, Texas A&amp;M,
Virginia Polytechnic Institute and Auburn University; breeding research at
Oklahoma State University; development of techniques to propagate and screen
switchgrass through tissue culture techniques at the University of Tennessee;
and physiological characterization of switchgrass at ORNL. With ORNL staff
facilitating the linkages between the investigators at the different
institutions, the set of projects meets the program's objective for having a
switchgrass crop development center for the South.
</P>
<P>Third-year results from the variety trials, established in Alabama, Texas,
Virginia, Tennessee, Kentucky and West Virginia, indicate that the select
varieties are capable of producing high yields on a variety of site types
(McLaughlin, personal communication, May 1995, ORNL). In 1994, the average
yields of the best varieties ranged from 6.8-7.5 dry tons per acres in 1994 over
19 different locations and the maximum yields of the best varieties ranged from
9-12.3 dry tons per acre. Average yields of all nine of the varieties
established in the trials are also good, ranging from 5.4-7.3 dry tons per acre.
Harvesting frequency studies are showing that a double cut system produces
highest yields in Alabama and Virginia while a single cut system is best in
Texas, with the timing of the second cut being very important. Breeding research
has gone through 3 cycles with selected plants averaging 60% above non-selected
plants. The highest yielding variety continues to be Alamo. Switchgrass is being
successfully tissue cultured from nodes, leaves, seeds and florets. Four
varieties have been placed in tissue culture. Yields from tissue cultured Alamo
varieties established in experimental trials in Tennessee have been very high.
1994 yields averaged 10 dry tons per acre with a maximum plot yield of 16.3 dry
tons per acre.
</P>
<P>Work in the North Central region is presently limited to a collaborative
effort with the USDA Agricultural Research Service at Lincoln, Nebraska. The
project is conducting yield trials of northern cultivars of switchgrass,
evaluating fertilization effects and new herbicides and beginning a breeding
effort. If additional money becomes available, switchgrass work in the North
Central region would be expanded. A workshop for potential collaborators and
stakeholders has been conducted in an effort to define the need and interest in
additional switchgrass work in the region.

<H3><A NAME="environ">Environmental Research</A></H3>
<P>The objective of BFDP's environmental research is to develop site-specific
regional data related to environmental parameters such as biodiversity, chemical
fate, soil chemistry and carbon content, erosion and surface water runoff, and
plantation design. Possession of this information will ensure sustainable,
environmentally acceptable feedstock production and facilitate the
implementation of energy crop plantings at the field, landscape, and regional
levels.
</P>
<P>Since the beginning of the BFDP, environmental acceptability and
sustainability have been part of the selection criteria for identification of
promising crops and production systems. Perennial crops have been favored over
annual crops because of their ability to provide soil stability, nutrient
retention, and reduced agrochemical requirements. Tree crops with 5-10 year
rotations have been favored over very short 1-3 year rotations, in part, to
reduce nutrient drainage from soils and the potential for soil compaction
effects from frequent harvesting. Fertilization studies designed to consider
effects on water quality have demonstrated that application procedures can
minimize water quality impacts and provide more cost-effective impacts on growth
if applied on an as needed basis during the rotation rather than in a large
initial application (
<A HREF="#VanMiegroet">Van Miegroet <I>et al</I></A>, 1994). Bird and small
mammal surveys have been conducted  in commercial and experimental plots to
address biodiversity compared to traditional land uses. Results from some of
these studies have shown switchgrass plantings can serve as habitat for some
prairie songbirds that are dwindling in population numbers. Woody crop
plantations established next to forest land allow internal forest species to
extend their habitat range to the edge of the forested area (<A HREF="#Tolbert">Tolbert
and Downing</A>, 1995). Where woody crops provide the only wood cover in a farm
area, preliminary data suggests they will be used by a variety of birds.
</P>
<P>Existing and proposed biomass plantings at demonstration and industrial
sites are providing the opportunity to expand the existing data needed to
address environmental questions associated with biodiversity, chemical fate,
erosion and surface water movement, and soil chemistry in a number of regions
with the potential for biomass crop production. A small scale study is underway 
with the National Audubon Society to monitor groundwater drawdown beneath
demonstration hybrid poplar plantings in Minnesota because of concerns about
potential effects on nearby wetlands. Comparisons of large-scale plantings with
adjacent or nearby natural areas, wetlands, managed forests, grasslands, and
agricultural sites will provide data to determine if location of biomass crops
can enhance the biodiversity of existing landscapes. Some flexibility will exist
to design experimental SRWC plantings to fit within existing landscape features
to address the premise that plantation design and silvicultural options can
enhance SRWC value for wildlife. Contingent on program funding levels, plans
include monitoring various SRWC management options such as interplanting trees
with a cover crop, planting specific tree or cover crops adjacent to SRWC
plantations, and planting multiple commercial species to determine if SRWC can
increase biodiversity.
</P>
<P>The fate of chemicals, including pesticides, herbicides, and fertilizers,
are an important component of developing environmentally acceptable biomass crop
systems. There are currently no field data specific to biomass crops which
addresses how environmental parameters such as soil type, species, cover crops,
or climate influence movement of chemicals within the soil and the release of
chemicals into soils and groundwater. The effect of these physical parameters on
the type and quantity of chemicals which migrate from production sites and their
ultimate effects on surface water quality are also unknown. The BFDP is
currently examining some water quality issues using small watershed models in
collaboration with Purdue University. Collaborative work initiated in fall 1994
with the Tennessee Valley Authority in northern Mississippi, western Tennessee
and northern Alabama (with Alabama A&amp;M involved) will assess the fate of
chemicals applied to SRWC with and without a cover crop, switchgrass, and corn
plantings. Studies in Minnesota which were initiated in 1994 involving the USDA
Forest Service and the University of Minnesota are looking at nutrients,
pesticides and herbicides in soil and groundwater. Additional field studies,
preferably linked with each woody and herbaceous crop development center, are
needed to estimate the above parameters under the wide variety of physical
boundaries within and among regions.
</P>
<P>The third area of environmental research is the sequestration of carbon in
soils by biomass crops. Carbon sequestration in soil has been predicted to be an
important means of reducing greenhouse gases. Assessing soil carbon changes is
essential in developing greenhouse gas balances and determining the economic
importance of potential carbon sequestration tax credits. Studies on
Conservation Reserve Program sites planted to switchgrass have shown that soil
carbon sequestration may be as much as .45 ton C per acre per year over the
first 5 years in the top 120 inches of soil (<A HREF="#McLaughlin">McLaughlin</A>,
1994). New studies collecting soil chemistry  data at multiple sites in
different regions will provide information on potential differences in soil
carbon sequestration rates as a function of soil type, tree or grass species,
management systems, harvesting regimes, and climate. The results of soil carbon
studies can contribute to consideration of issues related to carbon tax credits.
</P>
<P>The BFDP's environmental task is attempting to provide a well-documented,
technically sound database on environmental impacts of various silvicultural
options. This information can then be used on a region, site, and species basis
to document the sustainability and environmental benefits of energy crops as
currently envisioned. These data will also provide a baseline and basis for
improving the cultural systems to enhance the sustainability of energy crops. It
is anticipated that with adequate funding at least five years will be required
to adequately quantify changes in soil carbon, chemical composition of
groundwater and surface water runoff, and biodiversity associated with
representative energy crop sites in the U.S.

<H3><A NAME="systems">Systems Integration and Analysis</A></H3>
<P>One of this task's objective is to assess the environmental and economic
costs, benefits, and trade-offs associated with various cropping systems for
life cycle analysis. Economic analyses of production systems have been a part of
the BFDP program since program inception and have become increasingly
sophisticated as our understanding of production technology has matured.
</P>
<P>Preliminary evaluations analyzed the variation in production costs with
respect to resource characteristics and economic conditions and examined the
nature of potential trade-offs in system design and operation. Some of the early
studies were concerned with determining optimal rotations, yield-response to
fertilization, and whether certain management options, such as irrigation, were
likely to be cost-effective. As better information and data became available,
these studies were refined and new studies undertaken to look at energy crop
economics more from the perspective of potential developers. Farm level studies
were conducted  (<A HREF="#English">English <I>et al</I></A> 1991) and
preliminary regional supply curves estimated  (<A HREF="#Graham">Graham and
Downing</A>, 1995). Fuel cycle studies and assessments of carbon flows from
plantings were also undertaken  (<A HREF="#Perlack">Perlack <I>et al,</I></A>
1992).  Recently a complete accounting of hybrid poplar and switchgrass
production costs has been documented, though not yet published.
</P>
<P>Several attempts have been made to estimate the potential supplies of
biomass crops that could be available on a national scale at prices that would
provide the landowners a profit and yet be feasible for use as an energy
feedstock. The most comprehensive effort has been undertaken in collaboration
with USDA, the Environmental Protection Agency, and the Office of Science and
Technology Policy. If energy users could pay $1.90 Btu, then energy crops could
be competitive on about 30 million acres. However, with coal available at less
than $1.19 Btu, the supplies of biomass crops that could be competitive with
coal, using conventional conversion technologies are very limited. Work is
currently also underway to examine in a more detailed level the potential
supplies of biomass crops that would be available in 11 selected Midwestern and
southern states. Environmental and economic drivers are being linked in the
analysis efforts. 
</P>
<P></P>
<HR>
<P></P>
<H3><A NAME="scale">Scale-up, Feasibility and Demonstration</A></H3>
<P>To facilitate commercialization of integrated biomass energy systems, this
task gathers, assesses, and disseminates information about operational costs,
requirements, risks and other considerations in planting and developing entire
integrated commercial supply systems of biomass crops. The task extends energy
crop research results to successively larger planting blocks from 30 to 300
acres; 1000 acres at a time. A major component of the task involves synthesizing
relevant information from herbaceous and woody crop development, environmental
research, and systems integration and analysis components of the BFDP and making
it available to industries developing or considering biomass facilities. 
</P>
<P>The BFDP is supporting one major scale-up project, a hybrid poplar project
administered by the WesMin RC&amp;D near Alexandria, Minnesota. One thousand
acres were planted in late May 1994 following early spring land preparation. All
land was enrolled in the Conservation Reserve Program and qualified for 5-year
contract extensions. Seven hundred thousand hybrid poplar cuttings were produced
and planted by several private nurseries. Some initial plantings were
successful. Others were replanted in spring of 1995 along with an additional
1000 acres. Lessons learned by the participants included the importance of fall
site preparation, site selection, specifications for planting stock, and the
importance of good nursery management of the planting stock. Valuable
information on costs, labor and issues highlighted by the experience are being
summarized (<A HREF="#Downing1">Downing <I>et al</I></A>, 1995).
</P>
<P>The BFDP is working with industries and landowners considering electricity
and liquid fuel produced from biomass by participating in 10 DOE-funded
feasibility studies entitled &quot;Economic Development through Biomass Systems
Integration.&quot; The benefits expected to accrue to the DOE biomass programs
are an increased understanding of how potential users of energy crops expect to
evaluate dedicated feedstock supply systems and the kinds of information needed
for the operational phase. The BFDP participation adds an agricultural
perspective to the feasibility study groups and provides access to results of
energy crop research performed for the BFDP since 1978.

<P></P>
<H3><A NAME="data">Data and Information Management</A></H3>
<P>This task's mission is to compile, develop, maintain, and disseminate
programmatic information internally to DOE and BFDP and externally to a
worldwide community of researchers, government agencies, agro-industrial
organizations, and the public.
</P>
<P>Computerized management of SRWC data was initiated in 1984 in response to a
need to simultaneously analyze numeric data from several parts of the country.
The database, which has a 33-file hierarchical design, contains the locations
and types of most field trials established with program funding or co-funding,
site characteristic information, cultural practices, growth measurements, and
actual and estimated growth and biomass yield data. Information previously
reported in various units and styles is transformed into units of measurement
that can easily be compared and analyzed. This database currently contains
information from more than 300 separate field trials associated with
approximately 25 projects conducted in the United States. The computerization of
herbaceous energy crops field data began in 1992. The HEC database contains much
of the same information as SRWC (locations and types of field trials, growth and
biomass yield data, and cultural practices) as well as information unique to
herbaceous crops such as the ability to do multiple harvests per season and
double cropping. These two energy crop data sets are unique in their regional
and national scope.
</P>
<P>A bibliographic database, BIOBIB, enables retrieval of relevant materials
upon demand. The database also serves as an inventory of the work of the very
prolific principal investigators and BFDP staff who have written more than 2,000
reports, journal articles, papers, theses and dissertations. Books, reports,
newsletters, conference proceedings, and reprints collected to support analyses
and assessments have also been catalogued. To share this information, a
bibliography (<A HREF="#Martin">Martin</A> 1995) was published.
</P>
<P>Because BFDP is recognized as the premier authority on feedstock production
issues, BFDP receives frequent requests for information. Computer searches are
done almost daily -- not only on the bibliographic database but also on the
2,700-record database of slides and photographs that illustrate program
achievements. Subject-specific information packages composed of relevant
reprints and reports are also available upon request. A series of fact sheets
that present an overview of energy crops, short-rotation woody and herbaceous
crops, and environmental implications are under development.
</P>
<P>A newsletter, <I>Energy Crops Forum</I>, is published periodically. The
newsletter's objectives are to (1) facilitate communication and awareness of
ongoing research among the members of the biomass energy community, (2) transfer
research results to those outside the research community, and (3) identify and
develop a constituency for energy crops research. The first issue was published
in the fall of 1991 and sent to approximately 1,200 people. Recipient referrals
and citations in other publications have increased the distribution list to
nearly 3,000 subscribers and new subscription requests are received almost
daily. The Biomass Interest Group Inventory database is the repository of this
information and has been provided to other organizations to assist them to
distribute information.
</P>
<P>And last, but not least, BFDP has established an on-ramp on the Information
Superhighway--the Biofuels Information Network (BIN). Not only does BIN contain
the full text of many DOE and BFDP reports, fact sheets, conference
announcements, and <I>Energy Crops Forum</I>, it has an extensive list of links
to other Internet sites with related information. Between August 1994 when the
service went online and June 1995, BIN has been accessed more than 10,000 times.

<H2>Abstract</H2></CENTER>
<P>
</P>
<P> Electricity produced from burning sugarcane bagasse has provided as much as
10 percent of Hawaii's electricity supply in the past. As sugarcane production
has ceased on the islands of Oahu and Hawaii and diminished on Maui and Kauai,
the role of biomass energy will be reduced unless economically viable
alternatives can be identified. An empirical biomass yield and cost system model
linked to a geographical information system has been developed at the University
of Hawaii. This short-rotation forestry decision support system was used to
estimate dedicated biomass feedstock supplies and delivered costs of tropical
hardwoods for ethanol, methanol, and electricity production. Output from the
system model was incorporated in a linear programming optimization model to
identify the mix of tree plantation practices, wood processing technologies, and
end-products that results in the highest economic return on investment under
given market situations. An application of these decision-support tools is
presented for hypothetical integrated forest product systems established at two
former sugarcane plantations in Hawaii.</P>
<P>
</P>
<P> Results indicate that the optimal profit opportunity exists for the
production of medium density fibreboard and plywood, with annual net return
estimates of approximately $3.5 million at the Hamakua plantation on the island
of Hawaii and $2.2 million at the Waialua plantation on Oahu. Sensitivity
analyses of the effects of different milling capacities, end-product market
prices, increased plantation areas, and forced saw milling were performed.
Potential economic credits for carbon sequestration and wastewater effluent
management were estimated. The favorable net return estimates and the carbon and
wastewater credits suggest that commercial forestry ventures merit consideration
for these sites in Hawaii. While biofuels are not identified as an economically
viable component, energy co-products may help reduce market risk via product
diversification in such forestry ventures.</P>
<CENTER>
<H2>Introduction</H2></CENTER>
<P> Hawaii is undergoing profound land use changes due to urbanization and
tourism, heightened environmental awareness and conservation of island
biodiversity, and transition from traditional plantation agriculture to
diversified agricultural industries that enhance agroecosystem sustainability.
To help plan for a future that is consistent with local values and to implement
effective land-use strategies during this period of rapid change, decision
support tools are urgently needed. Our research team has evaluated the
feasibility of short-rotation forestry on former sugarcane and pineapple
plantation lands to manufacture a variety of wood products, including biofuels
from wood chips.</P>
<CENTER>
<H2>Short-Rotation Forestry Decision Support System</H2></CENTER>
<P>To provide useful information to those interested in short-rotation forestry
as an alternative land use, our research team at the University of Hawaii has
developed a short-rotation forestry decision support system (SRFDSS) (<A
HREF="#liu">Liu <I>et al., </I>1992, 1993</A>; <A HREF="#merriam">Merriam
<I>et al., </I>1995</A>;
<A HREF="#phillips">Phillips <I>et al., </I>1993a, 1993b, 1994, 1995</A>).
This tool, which addresses both land suitability and land availability criteria,
can estimate yields and delivered costs of <I>Eucalyptus </I>spp. at several
scales (state-wide, county or island, and field). It features four integrated
components: (a) empirical yield models of promising tropical hardwoods <I>(Eucalyptus
</I>spp.) constructed using growth data, site characteristics, and management
variables from field trials conducted throughout the state by scientists at the
College of Tropical Agriculture and Human Resources (CTAHR) at the University of
Hawaii at Manoa, the Hawaiian Sugar Planters' Association (HSPA), the U.S.
Department of' Agriculture Forest Service Institute of Pacific Islands Forestry
(IPIF), and the BioEnergy Development Corporation (BDC);  (b) a short-rotation
intensive-culture system model of production costs, including establishment,
maintenance, harvesting, transport, and storage; (c) the Hawaii Natural Resource
Information System (HNRIS) geographical information system and database
developed by researchers in the Department of Biosystems Engineering at the
University of Hawaii to extend the analysis to areas where no field trials exist
and to present results in map form; and (d) a linear programming (LP) model to
determine the maximum net return from the optimized mix of plantation management
options, wood processing technologies, and market prices identified.</P>
<P> The SRFDSS has been used to estimate yield and delivered costs of wood
chips from hypothetical tree plantations on Kauai, Maui, Molokai, Hawaii, and
Oahu to specific bioconversion facilities on each island (<A HREF="#phillips">Phillips
<I>et al., </I>1993a, 1994</A>), as well as product yields and costs associated
with manufacturing energy products (ethanol, methanol, and electricity) (<A
HREF="#phillips">Phillips <I>el al., </I>1995</A>). The SRFDSS is capable of
estimating yield and production costs of tree plantations managed for up to
40-year rotations, with (or without) commercial thinnings to provide a variety
of wood products throughout the rotation to generate cash flow. The LP
capability is used to identify the optimized mix of (1)<I> Eucalyptus </I>plantation
management strategies (e.g., growing space per tree, rotation age, thinning
regime, nitrogen fertilizer application, establishment, maintenance, harvesting,
transport, and storage), including potential for carbon sequestration and use of
wastewater for irrigation and (2) processing technologies (chip mill to produce 
hardwood chips for export, MDF mill to manufacture medium density fibreboard,
veneer mill to produce plywood, and saw mill to produce lumber) for two specific
potential plantation sites in the State of Hawaii. The land parcels that were
modeled are the former Hamakua Sugar Company plantation (7,778 ha) on Hawaii and
the Waialua Sugar Company plantation (6,790 ha) on Oahu.</P>
<P><B>Figure 1</B><IMG SRC="phillips.gif" ALT="Figure 1">
</P>
<P> Figure 1 is a schematic overview of the integrated forest products
components that are featured in the analysis. Because <I>Eucalyptus saligna
</I>(Sydney blue gum) was determined to be more productive and cost effective
than <I>E. grandis </I>(flooded gum) for both Waialua and Hamakua plantations,
this species was chosen for subsequent system model analyses to develop 84
different combinations of growing space per tree, rotation age, thinning, and
N-fertilizer for input to the LP model. Optimal spacing and rotation age for
<I>E. saligna</I> chip production on Waialua and Hamakua plantations were
identified using the SRFDSS model. This information was used to develop graphs
of optimized management strategies and biomass supply curves for both
plantations as managed for chip production only. Maps depicting the yields and
delivered costs of <I>E. saligna </I>chips for both plantations were generated
using HNRIS and the SRFDSS model.</P>
<P>A literature search was conducted for information on technical
specifications, performance data, scale, and capital, fixed, and variable
operating costs of a variety of wood processing technologies. Information on
product prices, carbon sequestration by tropical hardwoods, and wastewater
quality and quantity were obtained. Linear programming development and results
of net return estimates of the optimized integrated forestry operations at the
Hamakua and Waialua plantations are presented below.</P>
<H3>Linear Programming Model Development</H3>
<P> Plantation management, wood processing technology, and end-product price
variables were used to develop the LP model. Base and alternative cases were
identified for the analysis (technical and economic assumptions in the LP model
development as well as the results reported here are detailed in a manuscript
being prepared for submittal to an appropriate peer-reviewed journal for
publication).</P>
<H3><I>Plantation Management Variables</I></H3>
<P> The SRFDSS utilizes both intrinsic site conditions (elevation, temperature,
solar radiation, rainfall, and soil nitrogen and pH) and manageable factors
(growing space, rotation age, and N-fertilizer) to estimate mean tree diameter
at breast height (DBH) and stand productivity, as well as costs associated with
establishment, maintenance, thinning/harvesting, transport, and storage of wood
material. Because growing space (planting density) and rotation age variables
account for approximately 75 percent of the regression coefficient values for
<I>E. saligna </I>yield, with N-fertilizer application being the next most
important management variable, these three variables were employed in developing
the plantation management options for LP analysis. Options for zero, one, two,
and three thinnings were also incorporated into the LP model. A feller-buncher
and grapple-skidder provided the least-cost harvesting system as described by
Liu <I>et al.</I> (<A HREF="#liu">1992</A>). Nitrogen fertilizer application
was derived from BDC  recommendations (<A HREF="#whitesell">Whitesell <I>et
al., </I>1992</A>). For no-thinning options, a total of 0.15 kg N per tree is
applied so that half of the fertilizer is provided at outplanting and the
remainder applied at one-year after outplanting. For the thinned options, 0.04
kg N per tree is applied twice (at outplanting and at age one year), and an
additional 50 kg N per hectare is applied at each thinning.</P>
<P> The SRFDSS was used to calculate yields and costs for the different
plantation management options at each plantation. Mean tree DBH estimates were
calculated by the SRFDSS at the times of various thinnings and final harvest
(rotation age). These DBH data were used to determine log distribution to
suitable wood processing mills, e.g., chip and MDF milling, veneer milling, and
saw milling. This log 'split' or percentage distribution of log types based on
DBH was accomplished by selecting a certain growing space per tree (10 m2/tree)
as being representative of the forest stand described in Table A.9.3 of Groome
Poyry, Ltd. (<A HREF="#poyry">1994</A>).</P>
<P> For the plantation management options, the wood production yield and cost
estimates developed using the SRFDSS are presented for (a) Hamakua plantation
and (b) Waialua plantation. This information was used subsequently in the LP
analysis to select the integrated forest products system (both plantation
management option and wood processing technology and price option) that
maximized net return on investment.</P>
<H3><I>Wood Processing Technology and End-product Price Variables</I></H3>
<P> The wood processing technologies used in the LP analysis are those featured
in the
<I>Hawaii Forestry Investment Memorandum </I>(<A HREF="#poyry">Groome Poyry,
Ltd., 1994</A>) at the same and different plant capacity scales: (a) saw mill
for sawn lumber of various quality grades; (b) veneer mill (Meinan &quot;Aristlathe&quot;
with drier and press) for plywood production; (c) medium density fibreboard
(MDF) mill; and (d) chip mill for hardwood chip export.  Through an extensive
literature search and numerous contacts with national and international experts,
reasonable data for each of these technology/price variables were developed and
characterized by (1) capital requirement at various production capacities, (2)
product recovery and loss described factors, (3) operating costs, (4) annual
depreciation rate, and (5) average market price at the plant gate.</P>
<P> Prices for wood products were derived from <I>Forest Products Prices,
1971-1990</I> (<A HREF="#un">U.N. Food and Agricultural Organization, 1992</A>)
for plywood, MDF, and export chips. Sawn lumber prices were derived from <I>Asian
Timber </I>as reported by Tisseverasinghe (<A HREF="#tiss">1989</A>).  To
calculate capital costs, an annual discount rate of 10 percent and an annual
depreciation rate of 10 percent were used. Operating costs were calculated
simply as a percentage of capital costs based on examples found in the
literature.</P>
<H3><I>Base Cases</I></H3>
<P> Any of the wood processing/end-product price options used in the LP model
contains a certain set of production processes, with a certain relationship
between input and output for each process. The LP model chooses the optimal
combination of these production  processes including the optimal scale
(production capacity) of operation. Base case #1 and base case #2 differ in
processing plant capacity, with base case #2 having a chip mill, MDF mill, and
veneer mill at one-half the capacity of base case #1 (the saw mill capacity
remains the same). When the processing plant capacities are decreased, both
capital and operating costs per m<SUP>3</SUP> of end-product increase, i.e.,
economies of scale are evident, and are estimated from reports in the
literature.</P>
<H3><I>Alternative Cases</I></H3>
<P> Alternative wood processing/end-product price options were used in LP
sensitivity analyses to determine the effects of +/- 20 percent price changes
(alternative case #1), plantation  land area tripled and three out of four mill
capacities increased (alternative case #2), and forced saw milling (alternative
case #3) with a fixed annual production of 4,000 m<SUP>3</SUP> sawn lumber in
the integrated operation (all other assumptions remained the same as those in
base case #1).</P>
<CENTER>
<H2>Linear Programming Application and Results</H2></CENTER>
<P> The utility and strength of the LP model are that a multitude of possible
combinations of plantation management and production process options, which are
subject to a set of resource limitations and production coefficients, can be
evaluated accurately and expeditiously. The LP model finds the best possible
combination for a given objective function, which may be either maximized or
minimized. Because it is easy to change assumptions (coefficients and
restrictions or bounds), the LP model facilitates the ability to conduct
'what-if' and sensitivity analyses. The LP software used for model calculations
in this study was the LPS-867, Release 4.05 developed by Applied Automated
Engineering Corporation.</P>
<P> The design criterion of the LP model was to maximize net return as the
objective function. Net return was defined as the difference between the
plant-gate revenue received from selling the products of the processing plants
and the production costs of both the tree plantation and wood processing
operations. The plantation and processing components were modeled as an
integrated system, in which there are no internal prices (i.e., there is no
income to the plantation operation and no cost for wood material to the
processing operation). However, the LP model evaluates wood production costs in
identifying the unique combination of a plantation management scheme and a set
of processing plants that maximizes net return.</P>
<P> In the LP model runs, the plantation management options produce three
different log types based on diameter size in various proportions. The logs may
be utilized in one or more of four different types of wood processing plants.
Within the scope of this project as the LP model exists presently, it describes
a situation beyond the start-up period where both the tree plantation and the
wood processing mills are operating at a steady state. This assumption means
that the tree plantation is supplying a constant yield of logs of the same
amount and log size distribution every year. This allows for maintaining a
constant workforce, and for providing the processing plants with a stable,
steady source of raw material. The LP model considers planting, thinning, and
harvesting a certain number of hectares each year when selecting the optimal
plantation management option. This number of hectares is equal to the total
plantation area divided by the number of years from planting to final harvest
(rotation age) for each particular option. The processing technologies are also
modeled as a steady-state operation, as long as other variables, e.g., prices,
are constant.  Therefore, LP model calculates net return estimates only at a
point in time after the start-up period is over. In addition to the revenue from
the production of wood products, revenue may be obtained in the future from a &quot;carbon
sequestration credit&quot; or from a &quot;wastewater credit.&quot;</P>
<P> Results of the LP model calculations were developed for the base and
alternative cases as annual end-product production (1000 m<SUP>3</SUP>/yr), net
return (1000$), and carbon and wastewater credits (1000$) for both plantations.
Also, the plantation management option and the wood processing technology and
price option selected, area harvested (ha), harvested yield (1000 m<SUP>3</SUP>),
net return per end-product unit ($/m<SUP>3</SUP>), net return increase per unit
required for the processing technology to become competitive ($/m<SUP>3</SUP>),
shadow price of land ($/ha), and carbon sequestered in end-products (Mg C) are
featured. By applying various restrictions either on the resources (e.g., land
area available) or directly on the amount of end-product produced by each wood
processing mill, sensitivity analyses were performed. In the two base cases,
mill capacity was varied to determine the effect of plant processing scale on
net return. In the alternative cases, the effects of price change, expanded
plantation size and increased plant processing capacity, and forced saw milling
were featured. Table 1 summarizes the annual net return results for all cases.
Discussion of the results are presented by plantation below.</P>

<P> To determine &quot;how far&quot; a certain non-selected production process
is from being selected as part of the optimal solution, the LP model calculates
the quantitative amount by which the contribution of the non-selected production
to the objective function must change to become selected. This amount is
expressed as the positive price change in dollars per end-product unit that is
required for one of the non-selected productions to become selected as part of
the optimal solution. This LP output is reported as net return increase per
end-product unit required for the processing technology to become competitive.
For example, in base case #1, for export wood chips to become competitive the
net return would have to be $82/m<SUP>3</SUP> ($28/m<SUP>3</SUP>+ $54/m<SUP>3</SUP>),
and the net return for sawn lumber would have to be $110/m<SUP>3</SUP> ($64/m<SUP>3</SUP>
+ $46/m<SUP>3</SUP>).</P>
<P> Another interesting output feature from the LP model is the shadow price of
land, which is the increase in annual net return if one more unit of land is
added ($/ha). For example, in base case #1, each additional hectare of land
would generate $449/ha at Hamakua and $326/ha at Waialua. Considering the final
harvest times, the total increase in net return would be $8,980 ($449 X 20 yrs)
over the 20-year rotation at Hamakua and $4,890 ($326 X 5 yrs) over the 15-year
rotation at Waialua.</P>
<H3>Hamakua plantation</H3>
<P> For base case #1, the annual net return is $3,490,000, where 35,000 m<SUP>3</SUP>/yr
of MDF and 22,000 m<SUP>3</SUP>/yr of plywood are produced. Base case #2
features a 50 percent reduction in mill capacities with the same quantities of
MDF and plywood produced as in base case #1 (in either case wood supply is the
limiting factor, not mill capacity). The results of base case #2 indicate that
the annual net return is approximately $1 million. This decrease in annual net
return is attributed to diseconomies of scale associated with the smaller
processing plants. For alternative case #1, a +20 percent increase in
end-product prices increases the annual net return to $8,615,000, and a -20
percent decrease in prices results in a negative annual net return. By tripling
the land area to 23,334 ha and utilizing processing mills with larger
capacities, the LP model reported the annual net return to be 23,390,000. While
economies of scale would be expected to improve plant processing return on
capital, this is not necessarily the situation for the expanded plantation
operation because of longer hauling distances and greater variability in site
productivity. For alternative case #3, in which the LP model was forced to
produce 4,000 m<SUP>3</SUP>/yr sawn lumber, the annual net return is
$3,307,000, or $183,000/yr less than without forcing the saw mill. The
disadvantage of &quot;losing&quot; the $183,000/yr may be countered by &quot;gaining&quot;
product diversification to hedge against market risks.<I></I></P>
<P> With 45 percent of stem dry weight stored as carbon (<A HREF="#evans">Evans,
1992</A>), the potential for carbon sequestration in planted trees through final
harvest at Hamakua (base case #1) is approximately 290,000 Mg C. A linear
relationship between tree age and carbon sequestration is assumed for the
purposes of this analysis because the trees are harvested before asymptotic
stage of development. Therefore, dynamic growth of trees (life cycle) is not
considered. The carbon sequestered annually in end-products is estimated to be
12,825 Mg C/yr. If a carbon credit of $10/Mg C is applied, approximately
$128,000/yr could be added to the annual net return.</P>
<H3>Waialua plantation</H3>
<P> For base case #1, the annual net return is $2,211,000, where 21,000 m<SUP>3</SUP>/yr
of MDF and 14,000 m<SUP>3</SUP>/yr of plywood are produced. With the reduced
mill capacities (but the same quantities of MDF and plywood produced as in base
case #1), base case #2 results indicate that the annual net return is $836,000.
As for Hamakua, this decrease in annual net return is due to scale impacts of
the smaller processing plants. For alternative case #1, a +20 percent increase
in end-product prices increases the annual net return to $5,353,000, and a -20
percent decrease in prices decreases the annual net return to $12,000. By
tripling the land area to 20,370 ha and utilizing processing mills with larger
capacities, the annual net return increases to $14,522,000.  However, for the
same reasons as explained for Hamakua, this amount is artificially inflated
because longer hauling distances and greater variability in site productivity
are not accounted.  For alternative case #3, in which the LP model was forced to
produce 4,000 m<SUP>3</SUP>/yr sawn lumber, the annual net return is
$2,028,000, or $183,000/yr less than without forcing the saw mill. Again as with
Hamakua, the addition of the saw mill to increase end-product diversification
may help hedge against market risks.</P>
<P> With 45 percent of stem dry weight stored as carbon (<A HREF="#evans">Evans,
1992</A>), the potential for carbon sequestration in planted trees through final
harvest at Waialua (base case #1) is approximately 152,000 Mg C. The annual
carbon sequestration represented in end-products is approximately 7,875 Mg C/yr.
Given a carbon credit of $10/Mg C, the annual net return would be increased by
$79,000. The potential use of wastewater effluent from the Schofield-Wheeler
military bases and City and County Wahiawa and Whitmore Village sewage treatment
plants to irrigate the Waialua plantation was investigated. Based on effluent
deliveries from Wahiawa reservoir estimated at 2.5 million gallons per day, MGPD
(9.5 million liters per day, MLPD) from the Schofield-Wheeler military bases,
1.7 MGPD (6.5 MLPD) from the Wahiawa sewage treatment plant, and 0.25 MGPD (0.95
MLPD) from the Whitmore Village sewage treatment plant, the total wastewater
volume is approximately 4.5 MGPD (17.2 MLPD). This wastewater volume is
approximately 10 percent of the 45 MGPD (174 MLPD) total irrigation rate applied
to the Waialua plantation. The total irrigation volume represents an additional
0.8 inches or 20 mm (5-10 percent) of annual rainfall received at Waialua. With
a wastewater effluent NH3-N concentration of 7 ppm (mg/l) applied to the 6790-ha
plantation, the additional nitrogen fertilizer contribution is approximately 1.4
kg/ha/yr. Regarding the additional input of water, the yield response of <I>E.
saligna </I>is estimated to be less than a 5-percent increase. While the
additional N input may enhance tree growth, the small amount is considered to
have a negligible effect on stand productivity. However, as a means to dispose
of wastewater, the opportunity to procure a wastewater credit of $1,350,000/yr
is a significant bonus.</P>
<CENTER>
<H2>Conclusion</H2></CENTER>
<P> The utility of the SRFDSS developed previously (to estimate yield and
delivered cost of. tropical hardwood from parcels of land identified as both
suitable and available for species-specific tree plantations in Hawaii) has been
extended via linear programming capability (to estimate net returns of optimized
combinations of wood products from specific plantations). The analytical results
provide decision-makers who are contemplating alternative land uses on Hamakua
and Waialua plantations readily useful information for scoping forest product
investment strategies. The net return estimates for both plantations suggest
that commercial forestry ventures merit consideration at these sites in Hawaii.
Energy co-product(s) as part of potential forestry ventures will be determined
primarily on their demonstrated contribution to net return on investment and
secondarily to reduced market risk via product diversification.</P>

<H3>Abstract</H3></CENTER>
<P>Five years ago, environmentally benign biomass crop technologies were only
beginning to be commercialized and they were being used for products other than
fuels. Twenty organizations could be identified in the U.S. and Canada that had
plantings of at least 20 ha in size or greater of short-rotation woody crops and
of those 12 were established by forest products companies. All commercial
activity was with woody crops since herbaceous crops were still be evaluated by
the DOE program. In the intervening 5 years, significant progress has been made
on identifying the potential of a herbaceous crop, switchgrass, as an
environmentally desirable and highly productive potential energy feedstock. The
recent harvest and use of hybrid poplars for pulp and paper production have
clearly demonstrated the value of genetically superior hybrid poplar clones. 
Significant progress has been made in developing sophisticated techniques which
will enable even more improvement of hybrid poplars for a variety of locations.
Interest is emerging from the forest products industry in all parts of the
country regarding the potential of short-rotation woody crops. While the primary
use of commercially planted woody crops continues to be for pulp and paper,
energy is a co-product in nearly all situations. Additionally, some serious
consideration is being given to the economics of using woody and/or herbaceous
crops for a variety of energy production processes.  Feasibility studies have or
are being conducted by 10 or more groups around the country and several serious
proposals for biomass energy demonstrations have recently be received by the
Department of Energy in response to a solicitation for cost-shared demonstration
projects. There continue to be numerous constraints to the commercialization of
biomass crops for energy without federal assistance or policy modifications. The
success of research and demonstrations over the next 5 years will be key to
determining the rate of adoption of biomass energy technologies in the United
States.</P>
<CENTER>
<H3>Introduction</H3></CENTER>
<P> The U.S. Department of Energy initiated biomass energy research in 1978,
viewing it as a viable alternative to fossil fuel and has focused on strategies
to implement biomass energy if sources of fossil fuels became unavailable. While
the fuel shortages foreseen in the 1970's have not materialized, environmental
concerns associated with fossil fuel use are increasingly important, the
potential for creating jobs in rural areas has been recognized, and the
possibility of assisting the farm economy even while reducing farm subsidies is
being considered. Consequently the federal government has pursued biomass energy
research and is now attempting to bring it to an integrated demonstration phase
so that the benefits of biomass energy systems can be fully explored and
documented (<A HREF="#doe">DOE, 1994</A>). Meanwhile forest products companies
have recognized that supplies of wood in some regions of the country are
beginning to be limited and that the production of fast-growing trees crops may
have economic advantages (<A HREF="#arnold">Arnold 1995</A>, <A HREF="#afpa">American
Forest and Paper Association, 1994</A>). A surge of interest from several forest
products companies is resulting in numerous new trials being established for
evaluation and the consideration of techniques such as irrigation that have
normally been considered too expensive for energy. This paper briefly summarizes
the demonstrations and commercial biomass crop activity that is occurring the
U.S. and Canada and the barriers that remain relative to using biomass crops for
energy. The paper further discusses the implications of these activities
relative to the potential for  biomass crops to contribute to energy demands in
the U.S. in the near future.</P>
<CENTER>
<H3>Herbaceous Crop Demonstration and Commercialization</H3></CENTER>
<P> The demonstration and commercialization of herbaceous crops for energy is
only beginning though many of the candidate crops have been grown for other
purposes for 10's to 100's of years. For example, sugarcane has been grown
commercially for the production of sugar for decades. The commercial production
of this, or similar crops for energy, would be very, if not exactly similar to
the methods and technologies currently used. While new varieties selected
specifically for high yield might be substituted if the crops are fully
dedicated to energy, it is likely that the co-production of sugar and
electricity (from the sugarcane bagasse) will continue to be more economically
viable in the near future. Annual crops such as rapeseed and soybeans are being
used to produce biodiesel, a diesel fuel substitute. Corn grain is being used on
a significant scale in the production of ethanol. Alfalfa, a major forage crop,
has the potential for use as an energy crop when utilized in a co-product mode
with the nutrient rich leafy part of the crop being used as an animal feed and
the stems being used as the  energy resource. Perennial grasses, the herbaceous
crops which appear most likely to be included in a dedicated feedstock supply
system (DFSS) for an energy facility are the focus of this article. </P>
<P> Switchgrass, one of many perennial grass species, was selected in 1990 by
the Department of Energy's Biofuels Feedstock Development Program as a model
species deserving further research and development. This selection was based on
the results of screening trials in the Northeast, Southeast, Midwest, and Great
Plains regions. Yields  in the early screening trials were not particularly
high, ranging from 2-14 dry Mg/ha/yr, but switchgrass tended to stand out,
particularly during the dryer years. A select variety of switchgrass, Alamo,
produced as much as 34 dry Mg/ha in one year in one location. A limited
switchgrass breeding effort was initiated for switchgrass in the North Central
region in 1990 and a second, more comprehensive breeding and selection program
was initiated for switchgrass in the South in 1992. Field trials of available
varieties were initiated at three institutions (and 15 locations) in the south
in 1992.  Third year results from those trials are showing average yields of the
best varieties in the range of 15 to 17 dry Mg/ha and maximum yields of 20 to 27
dry Mg/ha.</P>
<P> Switchgrass is commercially grown in the sense that it has been planted
widely in many part of the U.S. as forage and was one of the several perennial
grasses used to satisfy the requirements for lands placed in the Conservation
Reserve Program during the past 10 years. For example at least 36,400 ha were
planted on CRP land in the green hills area of Missouri and at least 7,200 ha
were switchgrass (McLaughlin, ORNL, personal communication). Farmers in Alabama
and Texas have planted the select variety, Alamo, on the order of at least a few
hundred acres as a forage crop.</P>
<P> Serious consideration of producing switchgrass in a DFSS is being pursued
in the Chariton Valley area of Iowa, in Kansas, and in Alabama. Potential energy
end-users and potential producers or representatives of producers populations
are engaged in developing business plans for the potential production of energy
from switchgrass in those locations. In Iowa, the candidate conversion
technology is co-firing with coal to produce electricity, in Kansas the
candidate technology is fast pyrolysis to produce a biocrude oil and in Alabama,
it is a gasification technology serving as a precursor to an ethanol production
system. Individuals or groups of other areas of the U.S. such as Wisconsin,
Nebraska, and Pennsylvania have expressed interest in the use of switchgrass for
energy but it is not known whether the interest has evolved into actual
feasibility studies. </P>
<CENTER>
<H3>Woody Crop Demonstration and Commercialization </H3></CENTER>
<P>  The first large scale trials of the SRWC concept actually occurred in the
mid to late 70's and early 80's. Several northern pulp and paper companies and
other private groups established trials of hybrid poplars on the order of 5 to
200 ha in the North Central and Northeastern portions of the U.S. and in eastern
Canada. Several southern pulp and paper companies also began the establishment
of several thousand hectares of sweetgum, sycamore and cottonwoods during the
same time period (<A HREF="#wright">Wright 1990</A>).  Many of these plantings
either failed or are not currently categorized as short-rotation since the
appropriate rotation ages are estimated to be between 15 and 20 years of age. 
Most of the early failures were due to a combination of poor site selection,
disease problems, inadequate silvicultural methods and growth rates which did
not match expectations. These failures certainly contributed to a loss of
private interest in SRWC at the time that the DOE Short Rotation Woody Crops
Program and the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources Fast Growing Forest
Program were just beginning. </P>
<P> Both the Canadian and U.S. research programs on short-rotation woody crops
addressed the issues and problems identified by the early plantings. The Ontario
program addressed the problems by working directly with an interested industry,
Domtar, and learned by doing as they assisted Domtar in managing plantations on 
Domtar lands. Some of the early hybrid poplar plantings have been replaced with
other species. Domtar has continued to be involved with hybrid poplars but they
have leased higher quality land from farmers close to the mill and have improved
their planting and management techniques (Adam Zulinski, Domtar, personal
communication, May 1995). The U.S. program addressed the issues associated with
SRWC by funding a variety of projects, primarily with academic institutions or
the U.S. Forest Service, at several different locations around the country. The
most successful of these projects gradually developed collaborative activities
with industry as the value of their work became apparent. Most of the private
sector plantings of SRWC which occurred between 1980 and 1994 have been closely
linked with a university SRWC research program funded by DOE.</P>
<P> Recent interest by the private sector in SRWC has increased noticeably just
within the past 2 years. Table 1 summarizes the status of active SRWC projects
in the U.S. and Canada and the amount of land involved. Of particular interest
is the column identifying new activity since my last assessment in 1990 (11 of
the 12 new planting starts have actually occurred in 1994 or 1995). Most new
plantings have been initiated by pulp and paper industries, however some of the
projects under evaluation include feasibility studies being done for the
purposes of producing biomass energy. Pulp and paper company interest is being
stimulated, in part, by the current or anticipated reduction in hardwood
supplies that is resulting from environmentally driven legislation and
regulations in the U.S. Forest products industry interest is also being driven
by the recognition of the worldwide competitive advantages being gained by the
production of fast growing hardwoods in places like Brazil, Chili, South Africa,
and Indonesia. If higher quality, lower cost fiber supplies can not be
established in the U.S. then many jobs in the forest products industry will be
lost or moved overseas. </P>

</DD></DL>
<P> The probability is good that many of the SRWC projects being initiated by
pulp and paper company will be successful. Company staff are contacting ORNL
staff familiar with the SRWC research performed in each region, they are linking
up with researchers in the regions, they are joining collaboratives and
consortia established within the regions, and they are visiting and evaluating
many of the successful commercial sites that have been established by early
private sector adopters of the technology. The success of the projects will
depend upon the ability of the company staff to quickly master the technical
aspects of good site selection, proper site preparation and establishment
techniques, and weed control techniques for SRWC. Considerably more information
and expertise is available now than was available 15 to 20 years ago but success
is not guaranteed, since firsthand learning is always required for adapting the
techniques to the particular sites and climatic situations available. </P>
<P> Short-rotation woody crops have always been viewed as a multi-purpose crop.
While some of the early commercial plantings were intended for energy end-use,
such as the 20 ha planting in 1979 by the city of Hagerstown, Maryland and the
120 ha planting in 1981 by Reynolds Metal Company, most were planted by pulp and
paper companies who were interested in new fast-growing sources of fiber. This
trend has continued to today. Even where developers are interested in
short-rotation woody crops as a dedicated biomass energy feedstock, there is a
concern that the pulp and paper industry will tie-up the available supplies.
Efforts are being made to resolve competition that might exist between energy
and fiber end-users and to look for ways to build up the resource to meet the
needs of both end-users. The acceleration in the development of the SRWC
technology which is occurring by gaining the support and involvement of the pulp
and paper industry, is anticipated to aid in the utilization of the technology
for energy as well as for fiber.</P>
<P> One way of meeting both energy and fiber production goals is to encourage
the pulp and paper industry to consider more seriously the co-production of
energy from the wood resource. This could result, not only in total energy self
sufficiency of the industry but also in an expansion of income generating
products from the industry.  Possibilities include not only excess electricity
produced from the efficient burning of bark trash, sawdust and black liquor but
also the production of liquid fuels or chemicals from the lignin components of
the wood. The document &quot;Agenda 2020: A Technology Vision and Research
Agenda for America's Forest, Wood and Paper Industry&quot; indicates the
interest of the forest products industry in pursuing research of that nature (<A
HREF="#afpa">American Forest and Paper Association, 1994</A>). The agreement
being developed between the leaders of the forest products industry (as
represented by the American Forest and Paper Association) and the Department of
Energy is anticipated to lead to some innovative collaborative research that
will address both energy and fiber supply issues.</P>
<CENTER>
<H3>Barriers to Using Biomass Crops for Energy</H3></CENTER>
<P>   Perhaps the most significant non-technical barrier to using biomass crops
for energy is  the lack of creativity and negativity in attitudes. &quot;Too
many people know what can't be done&quot; is the way it was recently stated by a
biomass energy proponent. With limited federal and private research budgets,
ideas have to gain the acceptance and approval of many people before money can
be obtained to develop a concept or build a prototype. Many &quot;experts&quot;
(including myself) are often constrained by their training and experiences.
Their opinions fail to credit what can be accomplished by &quot;can do&quot;
people determined to make a new idea work. Based on these expert opinions,
improvements tend to be slow and incremental based on modifications of currently
accepted technologies (or technologies in which the government or industry are
already heavily invested). This approach is understandable, it avoids major
mistakes, it involves major industrial players in the work, and it may be
inhibiting the emergence of new, innovative ideas and concepts that could make a
difference now. </P>
<P> Non-technical barriers to using biomass crops for energy which could change
with policy changes include factors such as, the high cost of land suitable for
high yield production, the low cost of competing fossil fuel feedstocks, the
lack of established energy markets, the lack of adequate financing mechanisms,
and the lack of information and technical support for the farmers. Some of these
barriers can only be resolved with policy changes. For instance, the USDA farm
commodities price support programs have a major impact on the value of cropland.
If those price supports were to be reduced or dropped, land values would drop.
Fossil fuel prices are not likely to change in the foreseeable future unless
environmental considerations add to the cost of using fossil fuels. The lack of
established energy markets and financing mechanisms is a chicken and egg problem
which federal programs are attempting to resolve by initiating cost-shared
demonstrations of integrated biomass energy systems. The inadequacy of
information and technical support to the farmer is an issue which must be
addressed by DOE, USDA and state groups interested in facilitating biomass
energy.</P>
<P> Technological barriers to the sustainable commercial production of
switchgrass for energy are minimal but improvements to assure the availability
of low-cost supplies are still needed. Experience with demand for the seed for
CRP plantings showed that seed availability could be a problem during a period
of rapid scale-up. Since only a few of the varieties currently available produce
the yields needed for economically viable biomass energy systems, the need
exists for additional breeding and selection programs for the Midwest and the
southeast to produce optimally adapted varieties for those regions.
Establishment of the crop in a way that leads to optimal production in the first
and second year does vary with different parts of the country and requires some
attention for risk reduction. Development, testing and demonstration of optimal
harvesting, and handling strategies for switchgrass crops that considerably
exceed the yields normally found with forage crops is also needed. Since
handling and storage losses can make a considerable difference in the delivered
yields, continued attention to the best ways to minimize such losses is
necessary for assuring the economics of using the crop for energy. </P>
<P> The biggest technical barrier to the widespread use of hybrid poplars,
willows or other fast growing hardwoods on a large scale for energy is that the
sites and climates conducive to high-yield production of hybrid poplars and
willows is rather limited for the currently available superior clones.
Additional breeding efforts and field trials are needed throughout the country
to determine which sources and clones are most suitable for each region. The
recent addition of a third crop development center for poplars by the DOE
program, will help, but it will require the involvement of the private sector to
establish the many expensive field trials needed. Similar work needs to be done
for at least one or two additional fast-growing hardwood species to assure that
adaptable, pest resistant woody crops are available for a broad range of
locations in the U.S. and Canada. Additional research could enhance the
sustainability of the techniques used for SRWC production and/or assure the
public that current approaches are environmentally beneficial in terms of
biodiversity, chemical reduction, etc..</P>

<CENTER>
<H3>Potential for Biomass Crop Contribution to Sustainable Energy Supplies</H3></CENTER>
<P>  Biomass crop production technology is ready for application in an
environmentally sustainable manner in many parts of the U.S. although
significant opportunity exists for greater crop yield increases, and
adaptability of the technology to a broader range of soil and climate
conditions. One major question is how much land is available and what type of
land is available. It was estimated by <A HREF="#graham">Graham</A> (1994) that
8 to 16 million hectares of cropland could theoretically be converted to biomass
production in the near future without displacing conventional crops in any
significant way. This has been validated by more recent analysis done jointly by
USDA, DOE and EPA (<A HREF="#ronigen">Ronigen <I>et al,</I>1995</A>). However,
the analysis being published by <A HREF="#turnure">Turnure <I>et al</I></A>,
(1995) also resulting from the same joint USDA, DOE and EPA analysis concludes
that integrated biomass energy systems supplied solely with DFSS are not likely
to be competitive with fossil energy systems until 2020. Even that is based on
what might be considered an optimistic scenario for crop improvement and
deployment, which assumes a well funded research program and considerable
private sector cost sharing. </P>
<P> Stakeholder acceptance of the concept of growing perennial crops for energy
is increasing. Emerging landowner/farm community acceptance is increasing as
evidenced by the support of groups such as the American Corn Growers Association
and the formation of the American Energy Crop Association in Peoria, Illinois.
Likewise, utility acceptance appears to be slightly increasing as evidenced by
the recent formation of the Utilities for Biomass Energy Commercialization
Association, the continued participation of utilities in the Electric Power
Research Institute's Biomass Working Group, the testing of biomass resources for
co-firing by a number of utilities, and the participation of some utilities in
biomass energy feasibility studies being conducted around the U.S. The
bottomline for most utilities, however, is the relative cost of biomass energy
compared to energy from fossil sources. Where utility interest in biomass
exists, it is generally linked to a desire to provide a service to customers who
have a biomass waste disposal problems or to a agricultural customer base which
could benefit from local markets for biomass crops. Situations where independent
power producers are considering using biomass energy systems also seem to
provide an incentive for an established utility to consider the option. The
acceptance of the general public and environmental groups is also beginning to
increase as evidenced by the willingness of such groups to participate in
national and regional roundtable discussion groups which particularly focus on
the environmental issues surrounding the potential large-scale deployment of
biomass crops.</P>
<P> As discussed in the previous section, policy factors are a significant
barrier limiting biomass crops from providing a significant energy resource in
the near term.  Consideration of policy changes are occurring. The outcome of
the 1995 farm bill  will be a critical factor in determining the near term
interest of the agricultural community in biomass crops. The U. S. Department of
Agriculture has included biomass crops as an option in performing it's analysis
to aid in the establishment of new farm policies. Numerous constituency groups
are preparing analysis and statements on the desirability of policy changes
which would encourage the establishment of biomass crops, this includes the
American Forest and Paper Association which sees the benefits of additional
fiber supplies being developed on agricultural land. Analysts have suggested
that farm policy does not need to be radically changed but that relatively minor
changes in existing programs could have a significant impact. One example is the
continuation of the Conservation Reserve Program at some level with a
modification to allow establishment and harvesting of crops for energy as long
as the soil conservation objectives of the program continue to be met. </P>
<P> The successful demonstration of new biomass conversion technologies in the
near future will be a critical factor in attracting investor interest and
establishing markets for DFSS. Thus the program recently initiated by DOE, as
part of the Climate Change Action Plan, to initiate cost-shared demonstrations
of integrated biomass energy systems could have a major impact on how soon new
biomass energy technology is implemented. The type of conversion technologies
which are demonstrated will also have an impact on how quickly biomass crops
become part of the biomass supply picture. Considerable risk is perceived to be
involved in linking new crop production technologies and supply systems to new
conversion technologies. Thus it will be difficult to gain acceptance or market
penetration of biomass energy systems largely dependent on DFSS unless they are
first demonstrated in systems where the risk is shared by the government, and
the private sector. It is anticipated that the research and demonstrations which
occur over the next 5 years will be critical to determining whether biomass
crops become a significant contributor to sustainable energy supplies within
15-20 years or whether it will require 25-50 years. This will be a important
time period for federal programs supporting biomass energy development to remain
strong in their support. </P>

<H3>Abstract</H3></CENTER>
<P> Efforts are currently underway to assess the market potential and prospects
for the U.S. private sector in biomass energy development in Yunnan Province. 
Among the specific objectives of the study are to: estimate the likely market
size and competitiveness of biomass energy; assess the viability of U.S. private
sector ventures; assess non-economic factors (e.g., resource, environmental,
social, political, institutional) that could affect the viability of biomass
energy; and recommend appropriate actions to help stimulate biomass initiatives.
 Feasibility studies show that biomass projects in Yunnan Province are
financially and technically viable.  Biomass can be grown and converted to
electricity at costs lower than other alternatives.  These projects if
implemented can ease power shortages and help to sustain the region's economic
growth.  The external environmental benefits of integrated biomass projects are
also potentially significant.  This paper summarizes a two-step screening and
rank-ordering process that is being used to identify the best candidate projects
for possible U.S. private sector investment.  The process uses a set of initial
screens to eliminate projects that are not technically feasible to develop.  The
remaining projects are then rank-ordered using a multicriteria technique.</P>
<CENTER>
<H3>INTRODUCTION</H3></CENTER>
<P> Energy use in rural China is typical of most rapidly industrializing
developing countries.  There is a household sector that is highly dependent on
traditional biomass sources of energy -- firewood and agricultural residues
(straw); and a growing industrial sector that meets its energy needs from both
traditional and modern sources of energy.<A HREF="#1"><I>(1)</I></A><A
NAME="r1"></A>  In both of these sectors there are critical energy shortages
that have led to worsening environmental conditions.  The presence of shortages
also means that existing industrial capacity is underutilized and/or good
development projects are not proceeding at all.</P>
<P> The Joint Institute for Energy and Environment (JIEE) has been cooperating
with Yunnan authorities since 1989 to investigate the possibility of using
biomass to generate electricity.<A HREF="#2"><I>(2)</I></A>  <A NAME="r2"></A>Five
teams of researchers have worked with Chinese experts and officials from Yunnan
Province to plan, evaluate, and implement biomass-to-electricity projects.<A
HREF="#3"><I>(3)</I></A> <A NAME="r3"></A>Results of prefeasibility studies
show that biomass-to-electricity projects in Yunnan Province are financially and
technically viable.  Biomass can be grown and converted to electricity at costs
lower than other alternatives and can yield internal rates of return in excess
of 15%.  Study teams judged that biomass energy can ease power shortages and
help sustain the region's economic growth, now averaging 8-10% annually.<A
HREF="#4"><I>(4)</I></A> <A NAME="r4"></A> Also, the external environmental
benefits of biomass-to-electricity projects are potentially large, if replicated
on region-wide scale.  At present, tree plantations are being established in
Yunnan Province and some plans are being made to co-fire existing sugar mills
with bagasse and wood for year-round power production, and to construct
stand-alone biomass-fired facilities. </P>
<P> Currently, there is a study underway to assess the market potential and
prospects for the U.S. private sector in biomass energy development in Yunnan
Province.<A HREF="#5"><I>(5)</I></A>  <A NAME="r5"></A> Among the specific
objectives of this study are to: estimate the likely market size and
competitiveness of biomass energy; assess the viability of U.S. private sector
ventures; assess non-economic factors (e.g., resource, environmental, social,
political, institutional) that could affect the relevancy of biomass energy; and
recommend appropriate actions to help condition and stimulate biomass energy
initiatives. This paper addresses the general approach that is being used to
identify and rank-order biomass-to-electricity projects in Yunnan Province.  The
next section provides an overview of the screening and rank-ordering approach
and some initial results.<A HREF="#6"><I>(6)</I></A>  <A NAME="r6"></A>The
final section of the paper provides some conclusions and discusses future work.</P>
<CENTER>
<H3>APPROACH</H3></CENTER>
<P> A multicriteria screening model is being used to provide a rational and
systematic procedure to identify the best investment opportunities for
biomass-to-electricity projects in Yunnan Province.  Past assessment efforts
have identified two general types of projects.  These are the conversion of
agricultural processing mills (primarily sugar mills) to cogenerate heat and
export power and the development of stand-alone biomass-to-electricity plants.
The multicriteria screening model uses a two step approach:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>multiple technical screens (filters) to eliminate projects that are not
technically viable,<A HREF="#7"><I>(7)</I></A><A NAME="r7"></A>
</LI>
<LI>and a multicriteria decision model to rank order the candidate list of
biomass-to-electricity
</LI>
<LI>projects.  A flowchart of this general approach is shown in Table 1. 
</LI></UL>
<P>The results from the first step are a list of technically feasible or
candidate projects.  The technical screens include: 
</P>
<UL>
<LI>unavailability of land for biomass plantations (or existing feedstocks)
within a 25 km of a mill site;
</LI>
<LI>no need for power (e.g., availability of inexpensive hydropower);
</LI>
<LI>development cost is prohibited or the plant is too small;
</LI>
<LI>the area is too remote or inaccessible;
</LI>
<LI>there are lower-cost alternatives available (hydro or coal); and
</LI>
<LI>there is no local management capability and/or there is a lack of interest
in biomass on the part of local institutions.
</LI></UL>
<P>The projects that survive the screening are considered to be technically
feasible in that they possess either a mill location or an area to grow
plantation trees and there is minimum infrastructure and a perceived need for
the power.  At this step, no indication of viability has been made, only
technical feasibility.</P>
<P> The second step in the screening framework is to apply a multicriteria
decision model to rank order the candidate projects.  Multiattribute value
theory (MAVT) is the most widely used approach for solving multicriteria ranking
problems.<A HREF="#8"><I>(8)</I></A> <A NAME="r8"></A>The basic MAVT decision
model can be represented as follows:</P>
<P><IMG SRC="formula1.gif" ALIGN="MIDDLE" ALT="formula"> where <I>V(Xj)</I>
is the overall additive value function for candidate biomass-to-electricity
project<I>j</I>, <I>wi</I> is the weight assigned to criterion <I>I</I>, <I>vi</I>
is the single attribute value function for <I>xi</I>, <I>xi</I> is the
measurement on attribute <I>I</I> for project <I>j</I>, and <I>n</I> is the
number of criteria.</P>
<P> The model is made operational in the following sequence of steps:</P>
<UL>
<LI>define candidate projects (projects from initial technical screens) and
decision criteria (hierarchy);
</LI>
<LI>evaluate each project separately on each criterion (scaling);
</LI>
<LI>assign weights to the criteria;
</LI>
<LI>aggregate the criterion weights and the single-criterion evaluations of the
projects to obtain an overall measure of value or worth (e.g., additive value
function);
</LI>
<LI>conduct sensitivity analyses;
</LI>
<LI>and rank order projects and determine potential market  size.</LI></UL>
<P> In performing the actual ranking, four criteria are being used.  These
criteria are: </P>
<UL>
<LI>the internal rate of return on the project,

<H3>Abstract</H3>
</CENTER>
<P>Biomass crops (e.g. poplar, willow, switchgrass) could become important
feedstocks for power, liquid fuel and chemical production. With successful
research programs that boost crop yields and develop appropriate power and
chemical conversion technologies, biomass might compete with fossil fuels for a
broad range of uses. Compared to fossil fuels, biomass feedstocks can offer
significant environmental benefits. For example, biomass crops do not add
greenhouse gases to the atmosphere during their life cycle.</P>
<P></P>
<P>This paper presents estimates of the potential production of biomass in the
United States under a range of assumptions. Estimates of potential biomass crop
yields and production costs from the Department of Energy's (DOE) Oak Ridge
National Laboratories (ORNL), are combined with measures of land rents from
USDA's Conservation Reserve Program (CRP), to estimate a competitive supply of
biomass wood and grass crops. Estimates are made for one potential biomass
use--electric power production--where future costs of electricity production
from competing fossil fuels set the demand price. The paper outlines the
methodology used and limitations of the analysis.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Currently, biomass-based electricity generation is a niche market where
electricity is expensive and fuel is cheap or incurs a disposal cost, e.g. waste
wood, sawdust, etc. However, if biomass production and usage systems demonstrate
themselves to be workable at DOE's projected costs, biomass crops might become
competitive for electricity production and other uses. Increases in fossil fuel
prices, more rapid advances in gassification-gas turbine power generation
technology, or rapid market development for biomass-based co-products such as
pulp wood or chemicals could accelerate the production of biomass for
electricity generation. Policies that discourage greenhouse gas emissions or
encourage biomass production on idle land could also make biomass feedstocks
more competitive with fossil fuels for a range of uses.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Biomass crops could be produced on some of the land idled by farm programs
in recent years. However, if biomass crop production should expand beyond 30
million acres, then the interaction of biomass with traditional agricultural
crops, markets, and programs becomes important. While the outlook for biomass
feedstocks for energy and other uses offers promise, the practical viability of
biomass production and usage systems needs to be demonstrated. Given the
uncertainty about the competitiveness of the biomass industry, projects that
successfully demonstrate biomass production and utilization systems hold the key
to the future of biomass production in the United States</P>
<CENTER>
<H3>Background</H3></CENTER>
<P>This paper discusses the economic potential of biomass production and
utilization. Biomass crops are being promoted as feedstocks for the production
of electric power, liquid fuels, and chemicals. Biomass feedstocks have
environmental advantages compared to fossil fuels. For example, they would not
add greenhouse gasses to the atmosphere during their life cycle. These crops
might be grown on fragile lands and could perform other environmental tasks such
as the filtration of fertilizer and pesticide runoff. DOE research suggests that
yields of biomass crops such as poplar, willow, and switchgrass could be
increased significantly. If new generation efficient gassification systems and
turbines were developed for power production, biomass might become competitive
with fossil fuels as an energy source. Such a development would benefit farmers
by adding energy crops to traditional food and fiber production. Rural
communities would benefit from jobs created by biomass production and
utilization.</P>
<CENTER>
<H3>Methodology</H3></CENTER>
<P>The supply of a product is the quantity that will be produced with a unit of
resources at a price that is competitive with other uses for the same resources.
Given a fixed amount of biomass production, the competitive price is set by the
last unit of resources coming into production which just meets production
expenses. The potential supply of biomass can be estimated given data on land
productivity, biomass production costs, and the cost of land for alternative
uses. Since biomass crops have a life cycle of several years, the stream of
biomass revenues and costs has to be discounted in order to compare returns from
biomass production with alternative investments (<A HREF="#strauss">Strauss and
Wright</A><A NAME="rstrauss"></A>).</P>
<P>The supply price estimates for biomass on an acre of land can be done by
calculating the present value of estimated revenue and costs over a production
cycle (n years). Let p = average annual biomass crop price per ton harvested, y<SUB>t</SUB>
 <IMG SRC="equalab.gif" ALT="=" ALIGN="ABSMIDDLE"> biomass yield per acre (in
period t), c<SUB>t</SUB> 
<IMG SRC="equalab.gif" ALT="=" ALIGN="ABSMIDDLE"> total production cost per

<IMG SRC="equalab.gif" ALT="=" ALIGN="ABSMIDDLE"> the discount rate over the

<IMG
SRC="equ1.gif" ALT="=Et=1ton[(p*yt)/(1+r)t]=p*Et=1 ton[yt/(1+r)t]" ALIGN="ABSMIDDLE">
, since p is defined as an average price over the crop cycle. This discounted
revenue from biomass production must equal the discounted cost 
<IMG SRC="equ2.gif" ALT="=Et=1ton[ct/(1+r)t]" ALIGN="ABSMIDDLE">. Solving for
p, p=
<IMG
SRC="equ3.gif" ALT="={Et=1 ton[ct/(1+r)t}/{Et=1 ton[yt/(1+r)t]}" ALIGN="ABSMIDDLE">.
 The average biomass supply price depends on the ratio of discounted production
costs to discounted yields (resource productivity). This calculation was
repeated for land units with differing productivity (yields) and value (rental
rates).</P>
<P></P>
<P>The quantity of biomass produced on a unit of land is simply the area times
the average annual yield. The total quantity q supplied to the market at a price
p is the sum of production on all land where the equivalent discounted price &lt;
= p (p is the marginal price for the last unit of land to go into production at
that price). Land units were ranked by their estimated &quot;break even&quot;
price p, and production was summed over all units of land with an equal or lower
price. This calculation gives the total quantity of biomass produced at each
price level (current prices), i.e. the potential biomasssupply.</P>

SRC="w1.gif" ALT="North Central, North East, South Central, South East" ALIGN="RIGHT">
A data set for four potential biomass production regions in the United States
was created. Acreagewas broken down into land units by land capability class  (<A
HREF="#walsh">Walsh and Graham, 1995</A><A NAME="rwalsh"></A>) and average
land rental values from the 12th sign-up of USDA's Conservation Reserve Program 
(<A HREF="#osborn">Osborn,Liacuna, and Linsenbigier, 1992</A>
<A NAME="rosborn"></A>). Data on potential biomass yields and production costs
by land class was assembled by ORNL for land suitable for biomass (crop, CRP,
and pasture land with medium to high conversion potential) in the four regions
shown in Figure 1. Calculations assume that biomass yields, production budgets,
and CRP land rents applied to all land in a unit. Switchgrass was the
representative grass crop while poplar was the wood crop for all regions except
for willows in the North East. The yield scenarios (labeled by year) represented
 judgments about the potential success of biomass research programs: 2000 -
yields attainable with current technology, 2005 - yields with improved
management and clonal and varietal selection, and 2020 - yields that could be
achieved with a sustained multi-regional genetic improvement program. Table 1
summarizes the data set used for estimation of the potential biomass supply in
the U.S.</P>

<P> Figure 2 shows a sample ORNL switchgrass crop budget and associated average
yield scenarios for 2000, 2005, and 2020 for the North Central region. Budgets
included variable cash, labor, and operating capital costs of production. This
data was combined with a 6.5 percent discount rate and a CRP rental rate for the
land unit (representing the required return from the land to cover ownership
costs, profits, and taxes) to calculate an annualized farmgate price (cost, per
ton that would allow normal returns for the land owner, given estimated revenues
and costs. Budgets did include some variation in production costs associated
with different yields (e.g. harvesting, transportation).</P>

<P> Figure 2 shows the calculations for an observation with a CRP rent of 74
dollars per acre that is expected to yield 3.7 tons per acre of switchgrass in
2000, 4.2 tons in 2005, and 5.3 tons in 2020. When similar spreadsheet
calculations were performed for all rental observations in the North Central
region, they were sorted by price (annualized farmgate cost). Then total acreage
and production was cumulated for all land units with equal or lower prices. This
process yielded a supply estimate with the lowest &quot;break even&quot;
farmgate price per ton (left axis) verses the total acreage of land used (bottom
axis) shown in Figure 3. 
<IMG
SRC="w3.gif" ALT="[Potential Switchgrass Supply for the North Central Region]" ALIGN="RIGHT">
 The left part of the supply response scenario estimates shows the minimum price
needed to bring switchgrass into production in competition with existing land
use while the right part of the figure indicates the price that would be needed
to bring all of the land in the North Central region into switchgrass
production. The point representing the results of the spreadsheet calculation
shown in<B> </B>Figure 2 is marked with a vertical line.</P>
<P>
</P>
<P> When the supply estimate is presented in terms of total acreage in a
region, the scenarios with increased yields move the supply prices downward,
i.e. they lower supply costs. Improved yields in 2005 with a modest research
program lower costs at the line shown Figure 3 from $47.60 per ton to $42.48, a
reduction of $5.12 per dry ton or 11 percent. By 2020 with a long term research
program, the costs are lowered to $35.74 per ton, down $11.86 or 25 percent from
the costs projected in 2000. This calculation shows that given production costs
and a variety of land prices and productivity; a) there is available that could
produce switchgrass at a low price, e.g. $30 or less per ton, b) if research
programs could successfully increase yields, switchgrass at $30 per ton would
competitive on more acreage (or at any of the acreages shown in Figure 3, the
competitive price would be reduced). The calculation of a national biomass
supply estimate follows the same methodology, combining land data from the four
regions shown in Figure 1.</P>
<P>
</P>
<P> There is an important caveat about this type of analysis. The land rent 
distribution comes from a survey with existing crop production patterns in
place. For example, the North Central region shown in Figure 1 has over 60
million acres in corn production, accounting for almost 80 percent of corn
production land in the U.S. While Figure 3 suggests that all of this land could
be converted to switchgrass production if prices approached $60 per ton, the
resulting removal of 80 percent of U.S. corn production would raise feed grain,
livestock, and food prices dramatically. In turn this would raise the prices
required to maintain all of this land in switchgrass production. Therefore the
supply estimates using this methodology are appropriate for smaller acreages or
biomass on idle land that is not competing with mainstream crops (e.g. the 50
million acres in conservation and crop set-aside programs in recent years). If
biomass crops were to seriously compete with traditional food and fiber crops, a
full multi-commodity global market analysis would be needed to analyze the
interaction of biomass crops with the existing farm economy.</P>
<P>
</P>
<CENTER><B>Biomass Supply Estimates for the United States</B></CENTER>
<P>Figure 4 shows supply estimates for switchgrass on the lowest cost 50
million acres. The downward shift of supply prices in each scenario results from
the yield increases assumed to follow from stepped-up research programs. The
numbers in the table below the acreage show the total switchgrass production
expected with each scenario. For example, a price of 28 dollars per dry ton
would encourage production of 128 million tons on 20 million acres in the
scenario for 2000. For 2005, 20 million acres could produce 146 million tons at
a price of 26 dollars per ton. The 2020 scenario suggests the same 20 moon acres
could produce 159 million tons for less than 24 dollars per dry ton. The amounts
that could be produced under 25 dollars per ton with research progress,
constitute a niche market that might develop.</P>
<P><IMG
SRC="w4.gif" ALT="[Potential U.S. Switchgrass Supply Prices, Acreages, and Quantities]">
</P>
<P>The quantities supplied in these estimates are very sensitive to price. This
is consistent with the long run methodology used for the estimates and is
appropriate for land currently idle. Experience with long-run multi-crop
estimates suggests that each quantity produced would require higher prices if
biomass production significantly displaced existing crops.</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
<IMG
SRC="w5.gif" ALT="[Potential U.S. Wood Crop Supply Prices, Acreages, and Quantities]" ALIGN="right">
Estimates for U.S. wood crop production on 50 million acres are shown in Figure
5. The interpretation is the same as for Figure 4. The left part of the
estimates at lower prices represent lower costs associated with willow
production (relative to poplar). The supply estimates in these two figures
include much of the same land. Therefore an additional calculation is needed in
terms of a common energy metric, allowing either grass or wood production, to
determine how much of each particular biomass crop is produced. Since wood and
grass crops have different energy contents per ton, a combined estimate can be
made by converting wood and grass tonnage to common energy units and prices.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Assuming wood and grass crops contain 16.5 and 14.5 million Btu of energy
per dry ton, respectively, the tonnage and prices shown above (with transport
costs added) were converted to energy units. Ranking the data for about 50
million acres by energy prices and cumulating the energy content gives the
national biomass supply in Figure 6.</P>
<P>
<IMG
SRC="w6.gif" ALT="[Potential U.S. Biomass (Wood and Grass Crops) Energy Supply]" ALIGN="LEFT">
The steeper line in Figure 6 shows an alternative biomass supply estimate by
McCarl using a multi-crop model (<A HREF="#adams">Adams, et. al.</A><A
NAME="radams"></A>) for 2020. At lower prices, the McCarl analysis includes
waste wood. As the biomass acreage climbs above 30 million acres and biomass
crops compete with existing ones, the multi-crop methodology suggests that
higher prices would be needed to cause biomass to displace existing crop
production.</P>
<P>
</P>
<P> Regardless of the estimated biomass supply in energy terms, additional
assumptions about technology are required if biomass is to be evaluated
exclusively for use as a fuel for electric power generation. 
<IMG
SRC="w7.gif" ALT="[Estimates of Electricity Price Components]" ALIGN="RIGHT">
Figure 7 summarizes some technical cost assumptions as three components of
electricity prices. DOE and Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) electric
power cost assumptions for the three scenarios are shown at the right and are
compared to other estimates using various energy sources, including biomass.
Lower cost estimates in 2005 and 2020 basically assume greater cost and
production efficiency using new generation gasification-gas turbine systems to
convert biomass to electricity.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Since capital and operation and maintenance costs make up over half of the
electricity price, their reduction with new technology is crucial to the
attainment of a 4 cents per kWh biomass based electricity price that is thought
to be competitive with power production from other fuels in 2020 such as coal
and natural gas. The power cost assumptions in Figure 7 are combined with the
biomass energy supply estimates in Figure 6 to produce the potential
biomass-based electricity supply for the three scenarios in Figure 8. An
additional alternative scenario for 2020 assuming yields from 2000 gives
electricity price estimates only 0.2 cents per kWh higher on average. Therefore
the required cost reduction for competitive electricity production in 2020 in
Figure 8 comes almost entirely from the new lower-cost electricity generation
technology. If these cost assumptions hold true and if biomass production does
not crowd out existing crops, then up to 50 million acres of competitive biomass
crops might exist in the future.</P>
<P>
<IMG SRC="w8.gif" ALT="[Potential  Biomass  Based  Electricity  Supply]">
</P>
<P> These calculations and underlying assumptions lead to a distribution of
biomass supply by region and crop shown in Figure 9. 
<IMG
SRC="w9.gif" ALT="[Estimated Regional Biomass Production by Crop for Power Generation]" ALIGN="right">
Willows could become a major wood crop in the North East while switchgrass could
be a major biomass crop in the other regions. Low cost power technology and
improved feedstock production systems are keys to this future.</P>
<P></P>
<P>To summarize, biomass crops could become feedstocks for industrial uses,
given optimistic assumptions about the success of research programs for
production and utilization. The successful development of a new generation of
efficient power generation technology could make biomass generated electricity a
reality. Some low cost biomass production and biomass wastes such as wood make a
niche biomass power market possible now. Successful biomass research programs,
rising fossil fuel prices, and/or biomass incentive policies could expand the
biomass industry. However, the optimistic U.S. biomass scenarios assume that
improved production, harvesting, delivery, and utilization systems implied by
crop budgets and power/utilization cost estimates are in place. Much hard
engineering, organizational, and research work will be required to demonstrate
the workability of these systems. Future biomass farmers and processors need to
see practical and successful demonstration projects on the ground that before
they begin to participate on a large scale.</P>

<H3><B>ABSTRACT</B></H3>
</CENTER>
<P>
</P>
<P> Cost-supply curves for delivered wood chips from short rotation woody crops
were calculated for 21 regularly-spaced locations spanning the state of
Tennessee. These curves were used to systematically evaluate the combined
effects of location and facility demand on wood chip feedstock costs in
Tennessee.  The cost-supply curves were developed using BRAVO, a GIS-based
decision support system which calculates marginal cost of delivering wood chips
to a specific location given road network maps and maps of farmgate prices and
supplies of woody chips from short rotation energy crops. </P>
<P>
</P>
<P> Marginal costs of delivered chips varied by both facility location in the
state and facility demand.  Marginal costs were lowest in central Tennessee
unless the facility demand was greater than 2.7 million dry Mg per year (3
million dry tons per year) in which case west Tennessee was the lowest cost
region.  Marginal costs rose rapidly with increasing facility demand in the
mountainous eastern portion of the state.  Transportation costs accounted for 18
to 29% of the delivered cost and ranged between $8 and $18/dry Mg ($7 and
$16/dry ton).  Reducing the expected farmer participation rate from 100% to 50%
or 25% dramatically raised the marginal costs of feedstock supply in the east
and central regions of the state.  The analysis demonstrates the need to use
geographically-specific information when projecting the potential costs and
supplies of biomass feedstock.</P>

<CENTER>
<H3><B>Introduction and Purpose</B></H3></CENTER>
<P>
</P>
<P> The purpose of this study is to systematically quantify both regional
differences in the cost of supplying wood chips to biomass energy facilities in
the state of Tennessee and the effect of facility demand on those differences. 
While it is well known that biomass feedstock cost-supply curves will be
location-specific, no study has systematically quantified the expected
geographic variation in feedstock supply curves for a region.  Without some
understanding of the geographic variation, it is impossible to assess the
magnitude of error of generalizing from one location to another or using
aggregate data to make site-specific estimates.  This study goes the next step
and demonstrates a methodology for quantifying the geographic variation in
feedstock supply curves using the state of Tennessee as a case study.</P>

<P> The study extends previous studies by Noon, Graham and Downing in this
region (<A HREF="#ref">Graham and Downing 1995, Downing and Graham 1995, Graham
and Downing 1993, Downing and Graham 1993, Noon et.al. 1993</A>).  These studies
mapped projected farmgate prices and woody biomass supplies<A HREF="#2"><I>(2)</I></A><A
NAME="r2"></A>    at a county-level using a breakeven analysis which took into
account the density of crop and pasture land, expected yields of woody crops,
and current profitability of crop and pasture land.<A HREF="#3"><I>(3)</I></A><A
NAME="r3"></A>      In conjunction with the biomass production estimates, a
GIS-based decision support system called BRAVO was developed and applied to
assess the probable cost of supplying wood chips from SRWC plantations to
specific Tennessee Valley Agency (TVA) power plants in this region.  BRAVO uses
road networks and farmgate price and supply maps in conjunction with a
transportation model to develop delivered cost supply curves for a given
location or collection point.</P>
<P>  </P>
<P> In this study BRAVO is used to develop delivered cost-supply curves for 21
locations evenly spaced across the State.  These supply curves are then
systematically examined at 10 facility demand levels corresponding to a range of
likely power plant or ethanol plant sizes.  Regional differences in costs at
each demand level are quantified as are (1) portion of the cost attributable to
transporting biomass from the farm to the facility, and (2) effect of reducing
farmer participation rate (the proportion of the land that is converted to SRWC
plantations if the projected farmgate price for wood from that land is met).</P>

<P> A grid of 21 points evenly spaced across the state was used to define the
locations for the BRAVO runs (Figure 1).<IMG
SRC="tn1.gif" ALT="Hypothetical Bioenergy Plant Locations" ALIGN="RIGHT">  The
collection points were assigned to their respective regions - East, Central, and
West.  The state of Tennessee falls into three physiographic regions.  The
eastern third is part of the Appalachian Highlands.  It is heavily forested and
mountainous with marked parallel ridges and valleys.  Agricultural land is
limited to valley bottoms and roads tend to parallel the ridges.  The central
third of the state is part of the Interior plains and is much flatter.  The
density of agricultural land is higher although forest is still the dominant
land cover in many of the counties.  The road network is more uniform.  The
western third of the state is part of the Gulf - Atlantic Plain.  Streams flow
towards the Mississippi.  The agricultural density of the land is higher in this
region than the others.  As in the central portion of the state, the road
network is well developed but the Mississippi River poses a transportation
barrier.</P>

<B>BRAVO Model Runs</B> </P>
<P>  Previously-developed county-level farmgate price and supply maps for the
TVA region (<A HREF="#ref">Graham and Downing 1995, Downing and Graham 1995</A>)
were used as the biomass maps for the BRAVO runs.  The potential wood chip
supplies were assumed to be located at the centroid of the county.  Each county
had 14 potential supplies of wood chips each corresponding to one of the
fourteen types of land that could be used to grow SRWC plantations.<A HREF="#4"><I>(4)</I></A><A
NAME="r4"></A>      The amount of each potential supply was based on the
assumption that all the land with that farmgate price was used to grow SRWC
plantations (e.g., assumed 100% farmer participation in SRWC production if the
farmgate price was met).  BRAVO was run at each collection point to generate a
supply curve for that point.  Only supplies from counties within 80 km (50
miles) of the collection point were eligible<A HREF="#5"><I>(5)</I></A><A
NAME="r5"></A>   The amount, farmgate price, transport cost and minimum
delivered price (sum of the farmgate price and the transport cost) of each
supply used in creation of the supply curve was extracted from the BRAVO run and
entered into spreadsheets.  Supply curves associated with 25% and 50% farmer
participation rates were generated in the spreadsheet by reducing each
individual supply amount (as extracted by BRAVO) by 75% or 50%.<A HREF="#6"><I>(6)</I></A><A

<B>Cost and Demand Levels</B></P>
<P> The marginal costs of supplying the 10 quantities of wood chips listed in
Table 1 for 100%, 50% and 25% farmer participation were extracted from the
supply curves in the EXCEL spreadsheets.  The mean transportation cost and
farmgate price of the supplies needed to achieve a specific demand level were
calculated for each location.</P>

<P> Once the marginal costs for a specific demand level were extracted from the
curves for the 21 locations they were grouped by their region - east, central,
west as were the mean transportation costs and farmgate prices.  The regional
means of those variables (6 to 8 locations per region) were calculated as were
the standard error about those means.  Plots showing the mean regional marginal
costs, transportation costs and farmgate prices by demand were created.  Maps
were also made showing the marginal cost of chipped wood from SRWC plantations
at each location for supplying a 100MW power plant and a 9,000 dry Mg/day

Tennessee assuming 100% farmer participation - a best case.  The central region
is the least cost region unless very large amounts of woody chips are  required
(greater than 2.7 million Mg/yr).  The eastern region is the highest cost
region.  Examination of the standard error reveals that the western region is
the most homogeneous region; biomass supplies will cost about the same any place
within this region regardless of demand.  The eastern region shows considerable
site to site variation in costs and this variation increases as demand

<IMG SRC="g3.gif" ALT="Short-rotation Woody Crop Farmgate Costs"><BR>The
central region had the lowest transportation costs and the lowest farmgate costs
until very high levels of wood chips were required (&gt; 3 million dry Mg/yr). 
Farmgate costs were slightly higher in the western region than in the central
region but transportation costs were markedly higher.  The higher transportation
costs in the west region can be attributed to the transportation barrier
presented by the Mississippi River.   The east region had the highest
transportation costs averaging better than $15/dry delivered Mg ($13/dry ton)
even at demands as low as 500,000 dry Mg per year and assuming 100% farmer
participation. The high transportation costs can be attributed to both the
mountainous terrain and the low density of agricultural land.  Average farmgate
prices were high in the east because the low density of crop and pasture land
forced the use of land with high farmgate prices.  </P>

HREF="#8"><I>(8)</I></A><A NAME="r8"></A>
<IMG
SRC="g4.gif" ALT="Short-rotation Woody Crop Marginal Cost vs Demand & Farmer Participation Rate - West" ALIGN="RIGHT">
  The impact of farmer participation rate is much greater in the central region
than in the west region.  Assuming 100% farmer participation, the west region is
the least cost region only for facilities demanding more than 2.7 million dry
Mg/year (e.g. all but the very largest ethanol plant).  Assuming 50% farmer
participation, the west region is the least cost region for facilities demanding
more than 1.3 million dry Mg per year (e.g. most ethanol plants) and some of the
collection points in each region have an inadequate landbase (within the 80 km
collection radius) for producing 6 million dry Mg (6.6 million dry tons) of wood
a year.  At a 25% participation rate, the western region is the least cost
region for any plant requiring more than 750 million Mg per year (e.g. large
power plants and all ethanol plants). 
<IMG
SRC="g5.gif" ALT="Short-rotation Woody Crop Marginal Cost vs Demand & Farmer Participation Rate - Central" ALIGN="LEFT">
Furthermore none of the collection sites in either region could support a 18,000
dry Mg per day ethanol plant without taking wood from counties farther than 80
km (50 miles) away and some sites in the central region could not support a
6,800 dry Mg day (7,500 dry ton day) ethanol plant. The within-region
variability in delivered costs at a given demand level increases in the central
region but not the western region as the farmer participation rate decreases. 
Thus from the perspective of risk reduction, all but the smallest-demand
facilities would be better off sited in the western region than in the central
region unless they had some mechanism to ensure high farmer participation rates.

<H3><B>Summary</B></H3></CENTER>
<P>
</P>
<P> Biomass facilities will always be faced with dilemma that their feedstock
cost will be highly location specific.  Using supply curves that are based on
aggregate farmgate price information and uniform transportation costs can be
misleading. Such curves may obscure opportune locations where biomass supplies
can be had inexpensively while at the same time overestimating the total number
of facilities that can be supported by feedstock under a specific price. 
Capturing the geographic complexity of potential biomass supplies is a necessity
and one for which GIS is well-suited.</P>
<P>
</P>
<P> This study demonstrates one approach for quantifying the geographic
complexity of biomass supplies and illustrates the need to consider the adoption
rate of energy crops by farmers in projecting the likely cost of biomass
feedstock. </P>

price needed to induce a farmer to grow SRWC plantations ($/Mg). In this study
the farmgate price is assumed equivalent to the breakeven price - the wood price
needed to assure the farmer a profit equal to his current profit. The supply
amount associated with a specific farmgate price is the wood that could be grown
if all the land of that farmgate price were put into SRWC production.

hectare ($0 to $182 per acre) after variable costs (e.g., seeds, fertilizer,
farmer labor, custom harvesting), and fixed costs other than land were accounted
for. The rental rate of pasture defined the profitability of pasture and ranged
from $36.30 to $66.44 per hectare per year ($14.69 to $26.89 per acre per year).

<P>  Perennial prairie grasses offer many advantages to the developing biofuels
industry. High yielding varieties of native prairie grasses such as switchgrass,
which combine lower levels of nutrient demand, diverse geographical growing
range, high net energy yields and high soil and water conservation potential
indicate that these grasses could and should supplement annual row crops such as
corn in developing alternative fuels markets. Favorable net energy returns,
increased soil erosion prevention, and a geographically diverse land base that
can incorporate energy grasses into conventional farm practices will provide
direct benefits to local and regional farm economies and lead to accelerated
commercialization of conversion technologies. Displacement of row crops with
perennial grasses will have major agricultural, economic, sociologic and
cross-market implications. Thus, perennial grass production for biofuels offers
significant economic advantages to a national energy strategy which considers
both agricultural and environmental issues. </P>
<CENTER>
<H3>Introduction</H3></CENTER>
<P>  This paper will have four general parts. These include 1) U.S. energy
markets and the niche which biofuels may fill, 2) the contribution to
agriculture and scope of current agricultural production, 3) the role of
technology in reducing barriers to market feasibility and 4) the significance of
environmental issues. Crucial to understanding each of these four parts is in
evaluating relationships among them and integration of these in any discussion
of the potential for lignocellulosic inputs to the production of ethanol or
other fuels produced by lignocellulosics. This is the reason for complexity and
potential misunderstanding of any eventual benefits which may be derived from
production of liquid fuels from renewable biomass sources. First, an
understanding of the United States energy situation and opportunity for
production of ethanol from lignocellulosic crops will be outlined. Second,
agriculture, and more specifically, corn grain to ethanol in the U.S. is heavily
subsidized and there are many incentives to produce traditional and conventional
agricultural crops as a result. Economically, production and market incentives
are strong. The technological development and advanced engineering is very
capable of producing vast quantities of ethanol at a low price in a fixed
market. Last, specific and significant environmental issues have recently have
come to the forefront of the energy crop production debate. Environmental
concerns have been voiced with respect to current agricultural production, but
not with the intense scrutiny as potential alternative energy crops are.</P>
<P> After screening numerous annual and perennial species (<A HREF="#wright">Wright
et al., 1994</A>), the reduced cultivation, generally lower nutrient demand, and
positive environmental attributes of the native American prairie grass,
switchgrass, has led to its selection as a model herbaceous energy crop by the
Department of Energy's (DOE) Biofuels Feedstock Development Program (BFDP) (<A
HREF="#mclaughlin">McLaughlin, 1992</A>). Research completed on this species to
date, suggests that it could provide significant future ecological and economic
advantages as well over annual crops such as corn. The energy, agricultural and
agronomic, economic and environmental rationale for considering switchgrass as
an alternative to corn is now presented. </P>
<CENTER>
<H3>Energy Situation in the United States</H3></CENTER>
<P> Transportation fuels in this country have been dominated by oil for nearly
100 years. Oil fossil fuels are neither endless in supply nor environmentally
benign. Energy price shocks have proven costly as measured by the extent of
their dislocative effects. While the time frame is uncertain, alternative fuels
will need to be developed to replace current transportation fuels. A longer term
perspective is important in developing bioenergy systems. Most current
development in this area has been catalyzed by environmental mandates from the
United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA). Development has also been
attributed to economic factors in oil markets as a result of supply and demand
shocks. </P>
<P> Fuel cell technology and methanol for internal combustion engines are two
potential alternatives to gasoline. Fuel cells which generate electricity from
fuels such as hydrogen and methanol are still being developed. Energy costs from
fuel cells is currently seen as being greater than gasoline per unit of energy.
If these fuels cells are operated from methanol, methanol is considered to
further the greenhouse effect. If operated on hydrogen, remote generation of
hydrogen would be necessary. Methanol to operate internal combustion engines is
less expensive than gasoline, but must be produced from natural gas. This is
seen to contribute nothing to reducing the greenhouse effect (<A HREF="#foody">Foody,
1988</A>). </P>
<P> Ethanol is another alternative to fossil fuels for powering internal
combustion engines and is the focus of this paper. Ethanol can be used as a
blended fuel at 10 percent with 90 percent gasoline, or as a neat fuel (100
percent ethanol). It is currently used to enhance octane levels in gasoline, and
acts as a co-solvent for other fuel additives. Its ability to substitute for
other additives with harmful emissions may eventually add economic value above
and beyond simply being an additive to gasoline. </P>
<P> The increased use of renewable fuels for energy offers the United States a
strategy for significantly reducing national dependency on imported oil (<A
HREF="#lynd">Lynd et al., 1991</A>; <A HREF="#robertson">Robertson and
Shapouri, 1993</A>). There are several renewable feedstocks that can be used to
produce ethanol, while providing diverse benefits to the national agricultural
economy. Sugar, grain, and lignocellulosic biomass such as wood, agricultural
residues, herbaceous crops such as sorghum, and switchgrass, and municipal
wastes and paper are the most prevalent. </P>
<P> Current production of ethanol stands at 1426.5 million gallons in the
United States. 1235 million gallons is produced from corn, the remaining from
other sources (<A HREF="#gist">Gists-brocades, 1995</A>). Projections for
future supply and economic gain are derived based largely on the use of corn as
the feedstock (Petrulis et al., 1992). </P>
<P>
<B>Net Energy Projections</B></P>
<P> The capacity of energy crops to offset imported energy will depend on the
net energy return achieved in the series of energy consuming processes by which
crops are grown, harvested and converted to energy. Extensive studies to date
support the conversion efficiency of nearly 5:1 (units of energy out per unit
in). Switchgrass requires less energy to produce than does corn. Corn produced
per acre of land contains 50 million BTUs and requires 7.6 million BTUs to
produce for an energy out-energy in ratio of 6.67.</P>
<P> Inclusion of corn stover improves the energy efficiency ratio to 8.8. An
acre of switchgrass will produce 20.6 times the energy required to produce it if
it is transported directly to the ethanol plant. The higher ratios for
switchgrass result largely from the perennial nature of switchgrass (remaining
in production for 10 years or more before replanting) and from lower chemical
and fertilizer requirements. Chemical and fertilizer application for production
were obtained from USDA (<A HREF="#usda">1991</A>) and from The Fertilizer
Institute (<A HREF="#fert88">1988</A>; <A HREF="#fert92">1992</A>), DeLuchi (<A
HREF="#deluchi">1991</A>), and Pimental (<A HREF="#pimentel">1980</A>).
Transportation energetics were derived from Fluck (<A HREF="#fluck92">1992</A>).
Identical equipment complement assumptions were made for corn and switchgrass
for preparation and planting; harvesting and handling equipment obviously varied
(<A HREF="#fluck85">Fluck, 1985</A>; and <A HREF="#bowers">Bowers, 1992</A>).
</P>
<P> While net energy returns will vary somewhat regionally the energy advantage
of grasses has been found to be consistently and significantly higher than for
corn in all regions considered. The overall implication of the major portion of
the differences among geographic production regions appears to stem from a net
energy savings per unit of land used for perennial grasses as compared to corn.
</P>
<CENTER>
<H3>Agricultural Benefit and Agronomic Potential</H3></CENTER>
<P>  Perennial grasses were an ecological cornerstone of the early American
prairie because of their forage quality and soil stabilizing attributes (<A
HREF="#weaver">Weaver, 1968</A>). To date switchgrass has been bred primarily
to enhance its nutritional value as a forage crop for livestock (<A
HREF="#vogel89">Vogel, 1989</A>). It has been managed primarily as a hay crop
and early yields (4-17 metric tons per hectare (MTH)) have averaged
approximately 60% above nation-wide yields for the 60 million acres of hay
harvested annually in the United States (<A HREF="#usda">USDA, 1991</A>).
Recent research with several switchgrass varieties within the Department of
Energy herbaceous crop research program (<A HREF="#mclaughlin">McLaughlin, 1992</A>)
is focusing more on total biomass production rather than foliage composition.
This research and the evaluation of better adapted varieties has resulted in
yields on research plots in Alabama as high as 35 MTH (<A HREF="#sladden">Sladden
et al., 1991</A>) in a single year and 24 MTH over 5 years. During the latest
test cycle yields have averaged approximately approximately 11 MTH across 17
locations in the Midwest and Southeastern United States for still aggrading 2
year old stands. These yields are being produced without irrigation, without the
annual cultivation and planting cycle of annual crops, and with nitrogen and
phosphorous fertilizer requirements that are typically one-fourth to one-half
those for corn production. New breeding activities that are underway in the DOE
sponsored BFDP are emphasizing increased total biomass production, and leaf
nutrient contents. Some components such as nitrogen and potassium, may reduce
biomass conversion efficiency. We estimate that 11-22 MTH/y could be achieved
with current varieties and production techniques in better switchgrass growing
regions.</P>
<CENTER>
<H3>Economics</H3></CENTER>
<P>  The Biofuels Feedstock Development Program staff and economists at Oak
Ridge National Laboratory, and others, have extensively studied and researched
the economics of switchgrass production and potential in the United States.
These crop production budgets are being empirically verified now as the USDOE
begins to fund large scale plantings of switchgrass for energy. Expansion of
ethanol production from a current 0.8 billion gallon level to a level that will
significantly offset dependency on foreign oil imports is anticipated to result
in increased agricultural productivity, the creation of additional income for
farmers, and thus implications for production of several types of crops. Based
on the assumption that increased production will be achieved through increased
utilization of corn, the United States Department of Agriculture's Economic
Research Service (ERS) estimated agricultural impacts for two scenarios: an
increase to 2 billion gallons by 1995, and 2) an increase to 5 billion gallons
by 2000 (House et al., 1993). In the first scenario corn acreage is increased by
2.6 million acres and net farm income is increased by $153 million; in the
second, acreage is increased by 9.3 million and net farm income increased by
$1.6 billion. Significant effects on other crops and activities are not achieved
until the second scenario, which is projected to result in a loss of $550.
million in livestock production, because of increased feed costs associated with
competition for corn as a biofuel.</P>
<P> Examination of the demographics of production, gain, and loss reveal some
important regional discrepancies when additional bioenergy needs are met solely
with corn. The net economic gain will be realized primarily in the current Corn
Belt, Lake and Plain States that are already in primary corn producers. Cattle
production losses will be spread more evenly across all cattle producing states.
Thus, in spite of a national agricultural gain, the southeastern and
mid-Atlantic states will experience a net economic loss which will be augmented
by a loss of approximately 700,000 acres of soybean and cotton acreage
associated with grain production shifts under increased corn production.</P>
<P> By contrast, a shift to reliance on perennial grass production could be
effected using a much broader spectrum of land quality types, thereby impacting
other crops minimally and spreading the benefits more evenly across the country.
The southern states, which currently have a depressed agricultural economy, have
provided the highest yields of warm season perennial grasses thus far, and would
be among the most suitable target areas for biofuels industries.</P>
<P>
<B>Economic Factors Affecting Commercial Feasibility</B></P>
<P> Foody (<A HREF="#foody">1988</A>) suggested that the technology for
producing ethanol from biomass was improving rapidly and that laboratory reports
were approaching the ultimate levels of techno-economic feasibility. Neat
ethanol could compete in the current marketplace with gasoline at a price of
$20. to $30. per barrel of oil. A successful demonstration of cost effective
ethanol production would dramatically change the debate over major environmental
problems that are energy related. Fuel ethanol's primary advantage is
environmental as it is much cleaner burning than gasoline. When derived from
lignocellulosic biomass, it is the only liquid transportation fuel that does not
contribute to the greenhouse effect (<A HREF="#foody">Foody, 1988</A>). </P>
<P> There are many additional factors that will affect the commercial
feasibility. The ability to successfully develop enzymatic hydrolysis technology
will be crucial. The process for making ethanol from lignocellulosic biomass
involves seven major steps. Although complete treatment of each of these steps
is beyond the scope of this paper, (see <A HREF="#foody">Foody 1988</A>) they
are biomass production, pretreatment, enzyme production, enzymatic hydrolysis,
fermentation, distillation and by-product processing. Since each of these
processes are interdependent, improving one may decrease the ability to make
improvements in another. Finally, the ability to market by-products and
co-products is crucial to the economic viability of any commercial system (<A
HREF="#icast">ICAST, 1994</A>). </P>
<P>
<B>Conservation Reserve Program</B></P>
<P> The Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) was initiated by the United States
Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Soil Conservation Service (SCS) in 1985
largely to stabilize and improve soils degraded by over cropping. Over 36
million acres of land were idled by this law, primarily in the Great Plains and
Southeast. Much of this land was replanted to perennial grasses, that had formed
the principal species of the original American prairie. Predominant species were
big bluestem, Indian grass, wheatgrass, and a particularly hardy and widely
adapted and desirable species with potential energy use, switchgrass (<I>Panicum
virgatum</I>).</P>
<P> The CRP program is at a critical point after 10 years of contracting with
agricultural producers. Renewal or elimination options are currently being
considered in the 1995 Farm Bill. Critics see the CRP as an unnecessary expense
with questionable benefits to taxpayers. Recent consideration of both the
resource conservation benefits of CRP and economic subsidy costs of returning
these lands to annual row cropping suggests that CRP represents a gain to
taxpayers (Kruse, 1994). Recent studies suggest that failure to renew the CRP
will result in a rapid return of much of this land to annual row crops, notably
wheat with significant downward pressure on existing wheat prices. An
alternative to returning CRP to the same practices that necessitated its
implementation initially, is to consider these lands for energy crops that can
both preserve and enhance land quality and provide an economic return to the
landowners. This possibility is strengthened by realizing that native perennial
grasses that were planted under the CRP, are also excellent choices for
production of transportation fuels.</P>
<CENTER>
<H3>Environmental Considerations</H3></CENTER>
<P>  Soil conservation and augmentation is an important benefit from growing
perennial grasses. The CRP has considered soil stabilizing properties and
perennial grasses provide excellent protective cover and nutritive value to
wildlife. Perennial grasses most obvious advantage over row crops such as corn
is very significant reduction in soil erosion. Soil loss from erodable crop land
can be staggering and results in loss of valuable nutrients from that land. One
significant consequence is sedimentation and chemical input to and of adjoining
areas and wetlands.</P>
<P> Contrast in erosion rates between continuous cultivation as row crops such
as corn and perennial grasses such as switchgrass at many locations indicate
that annual soil loss is accelerated typically 100-2500 times by continuous
annual crop production (<A HREF="#shiflet">Shiflet and Darby, 1985</A>). During
heavy rains erosion differences can be even more marked.</P>
<P> Losses in soil organic matter are also increased by annual cultivation due
to increase soil organic matter turnover as well as increased transport of
topsoil (<A HREF="#buckman">Buckman and Brady, 1960</A>). The current rate of
loss of soil organic matter (SOM) through annual row cropping practices in the
United States has been estimated to be 2.7 million metric tons per year (<A
HREF="#cast">CAST, 1992</A>). This loss is important not only because it
represents 7.5% of the total carbon released to the atmosphere by combustion of
fossil fuels, but because SOM is critical to productive soils. Soil moisture
holding capacity, soil density and aeration, and soil nutrient availability and
conservation are among the essential properties controlled by SOM (<A
HREF="#anderson">Anderson and Coleman, 1985</A>).</P>
<P>
</P>
<P> Recent studies of the changes in soil organic matter during 5 years of
perennial grass production on CRP lands indicate that perennial grasses added
1.1 tons of carbon / ha-1 / yr-1 to the upper 100 cm of CRP soils (<A
HREF="#gebhart">Gebhardt, 1994</A>). These additions replaced 23% of the soil
carbon lost during decades of prior tillage. The large standing pools of roots,
which can equal or exceed annual above ground production (<A HREF="#anderson">Anderson
and Coleman, 1985</A>), and the rapid turnover of these pools, are the source of
this carbon. Preliminary data from soils where switchgrass is being examined for
energy production (<A HREF="#bransby">Bransby et al., 1994</A>) indicate that
below ground root mass is very high totaling almost 8 MTH in just the top 75 cm.
With Alamo switchgrass, over 1 MTH was found just in the interval 60-75 cm. </P>
<CENTER><B>Summary</B></CENTER>
<P>  Perennial grass production for biofuels offers significant advantages to a
national energy strategy which considers both environmental and economic issues.
The benefits of using a native prairie species such as switchgrass to meet
increasing an energy demand include improved soil quality, reduced soil erosion
and associated pollution of aquatic systems, reduced emissions of greenhouse
gases, increased efficiency of land and energy use, and a more equitable
distribution of economic benefit to farmer-producers. To achieve these benefits
in a timely manner will require we look beyond the relatively short term
supplies of supply of municipal waste and crop and other residues to industrial
feedstocks for future needs; crops grown specifically for a dedicated energy
end-use.</P>
<P> Our planning should include accelerated commercialization of both ethanol
conversion and grass fired combustion systems. It should also study the options
for maintaining landowner participation in a conservation reserve program for
which conservation objectives could be maintained by reduced subsidies and for
involvement of landowners in energy crop production. The benefits to the
national economy and national environment of such strategies appear too obvious
to ignore.</P>

<H3><B>ABSTRACT</B></H3></CENTER>
<P>The economic and environmental costs, benefits and tradeoffs of bioenergy
from dedicated biomass energy systems must be addressed in the context of the
scale of interest.  At different scales there are different economic and
environmental features and processes to consider.  The depth of our
understanding of the processes and features that influence the potential of
energy crops also varies with scale as do the quality and kinds of data that are
needed and available.  Finally, the appropriate models to use for predicting
economic and environmental impacts change with the scale of the questions.  This
paper explores these issues at three scales - the individual firm, the
community, and the nation.</P>
<CENTER>
<H3><B>Introduction</B></H3></CENTER>
<P> Currently, most dedicated biomass energy systems are not economically
competitive with their fossil fuel counterparts.  Biomass systems that exist
have been developed because they are perceived to offer benefits sufficiently
valued by society (e.g, improved national security; greenhouse gas mitigation;
local economic development; waste reduction) to offset their economic
disadvantages.  Policy makers considering biomass energy policy must balance the
benefits and the costs of these energy systems.  To effectively compare
different biomass energy systems with each other and with alternative energy
systems (e.g., fossil fuel), economic and environmental benefits, costs, and
tradeoffs associated with each system must be identified and their social
welfare value (worth to society) estimated (Figure 1).
<IMG
ALIGN="right" SRC="ecofig.gif" ALT="Figure 1.  Relating economic and environmental value to social value.">
 Evaluations of this type are difficult.  Economists have struggled with placing
a market value on goods and services not traded in any market.  Environmental
scientists have had trouble quantifying environmental impacts.  And, to date, no
one has satisfactorily found ways to weight the relative costs and benefits of
economic and environmental impacts.  How does one compare reduction in erosion
with improvement in air quality?  Or the quantity of jobs with the quality of
jobs?</P>
<P>  The social valuation of economic and environmental tradeoffs is
complicated by the fact that the values placed on economic and environmental
benefits and costs will differ at each scale (aggregation level) of analysis. 
Thus, social valuation will differ by individual, community, or nation and by
firm or industry.  Furthermore, our ability to identify and quantify
environmental and economic benefits and costs, much less place a relative value
on them, also differs by scale.  In this paper we take a first step towards
developing a model to evaluate the social value of dedicated biomass energy
systems by identifying and discussing the relevant scales, and the economic and
environmental features associated with each scale.  The status of our current
ability to quantify environmental and economic impacts is discussed.  It is our
hope that this characterization will assist in clarifying policy discussions on
biomass energy and point the way towards developing models for valuing different
biomass energy schemes. </P>
<CENTER>
<H3><B>Scales</B></H3></CENTER>
<P> The scales relevant to evaluating the economic and environmental tradeoffs
associated with dedicated biomass energy systems are (1) the individual firm
level (i.e., the farm and the conversion facility); (2) the community level
(i.e., the interaction of aggregate farms and a conversion facility with each
other and their associated goods and service providers, as well as the firm
interactions with and impacts on local infrastructure, institutions, and
economic base); and (3) the national level (the interaction of all firms and
consumers resulting from the production and use of bioenergy, and the
interactions and affects on national institutions).  These scales coincide well
with the scales at which economic or political decisions<A HREF="#2"><I>(2)</I></A><A
NAME="r2"></A>   are made and overlap reasonably well with typical
environmental scales (e.g., the field site, the watershed or landscape, and the
biome).</P>
<H4><B>Individual Firm Scale</B></H4>
<P>
<B><I>Farm</I></B></P>
<P> The economic and environmental costs, benefits and tradeoffs of  dedicated
biomass energy systems to the individual farm firm revolve around the
replacement of conventional crop production with dedicated energy crop
production.  The economic features most relevant at this scale are the average
relative profitability of biomass crops compared to conventional crops, the
variability of expected profits, and how new crops fit into the whole farm
management practices.  </P>
<P> At the firm level, economists typically focus on maximizing profits.  To
conduct such an analysis, one needs to know the production function and input
and output prices for all crops produced.  All prices are taken as a given in
this approach--the models estimate the level of output that maximizes firm
profit.  Variations and extensions on the basic approach can be used to estimate
supply curves and input demand curves.  </P>
<P> Farmers typically have the data (production costs, yields, and prices
received, government commodity payments) to compute the historical average
profitability and variance of profit for conventional crops, but because biomass
crops are new and have not been historically produced, expected profits must be
estimated.  Average production costs and yield estimates as well as likely
selling prices can be used to estimate expected biomass profits. Due to privacy
and confidentiality considerations, analysts frequently do not have individual
farm data with which to conduct analysis.  Given this constraint, economists
will typically evaluate &quot;farm&quot; profitability and decision choices by
constructing a representative farm based on regional (often county) data
regarding the distribution of farms by size, crop and livestock mix, typical
management practices, equipment complements, and yields among other factors. 
Profits to individual farmers will vary, in some cases substantially, from the
representative farm estimate.</P>
<P> Evaluation of the expected variability in profits (and hence the risk
associated with production) of biomass crops and conventional crops is more
complex and involves evaluating the variation in yields, production costs, and
selling prices.  Additionally, the risk preference of the farmer is significant
in understanding the choices a farmer might make when faced with increased
risks.  Evaluation of production cost and yield variability requires significant
knowledge of how climate, soil type, varietal choice, input use, pest outbreaks,
crop interactions, and numerous other factors affect production cost and yields.
 Data and adequate functional forms that quantify and characterize these
interactions are frequently lacking.  Expected input and product prices may vary
substantially in response to local, national, and global events.</P>
<P> Mathematical optimization models, utilizing representative farms, are
frequently used to evaluate farm profitability in the whole farm context.  These
models can be adjusted to include risk factors as well.  For example, a model
might evaluate maximum profits subject to a constraint of minimum income. 
Environmental risk constraints can also be included to evaluate how
environmental factors might affect profitability. </P>
<P> The environmental features most important to the farm as a firm are loss of
 land productivity (due to factors such as erosion, increased runoff, or soil
carbon losses), pest resistance, weed invasion, groundwater/well contamination,
aesthetics (messiness or neatness of fields, integration into the overall
landscape), and wetland losses.  There is considerable farm to farm variability
in the factors affecting these environmental features, so the environmental
impacts of biomass crops to individual farms will vary substantially. 
Unfortunately, quantifying these features is difficult even for a specific farm.
 Difficulties arise because of needs for farm-specific measurements that are not
routine (e g., weediness, soil carbon); lack of models to quantitatively predict
changes in the features in response to land management (as in the case of pest
resistance, weed invasion, well contamination), and inability to quantify the
feature (as in the case of aesthetics).  Wetland losses and erosion are the most
tractable of the environmental features to evaluate for a specific farm as
wetland maps exist for many locations and there are accepted models for
calculating erosion given crop management practices, weather patterns, and soil.
 Runoff changes and to some extent leachate can sometimes be modeled with the
same information as used for modeling erosion.</P>
<P> Unlike economists, ecologists cannot construct a representative farm to
evaluate most &quot;farm&quot; environmental features because there is no
information readily available on the distribution of either farm environmental
features or the factors controlling those features.  Thus characterization of
the environmental costs and benefits of bioenergy to the farm firm is limited to
environmental analyses of specific farms and there is little ability to
generalize to the array of farms found in any region. </P>
<P>
<B><I>Conversion facility</I></B></P>
<P> The economic framework for evaluating the conversion facility is the same
as for the farm, since both are individual firms.  Data limitations and
methodological approaches are analogous.  The economic feature of relevance is
the profitability of using biomass energy systems compared to alternative energy
systems (primarily fossil fuel systems).   Similar to farms, individual
conversion facility data may be unavailable, but industry-wide data and
engineering specifications can be used to construct representative conversion
facilities.  Techno-economic models can be used to estimate the costs of
building and operating new facilities using conventional technology, but are not
as reliable in predicting the costs of new technologies such as biomass.  
Biomass risks include uncertainties regarding biomass feedstock price, quantity,
quality, and timing of delivery.  Biomass feedstock prices will be a function of
the quantity demanded by the conversion facility, production costs, yields,
profitability of alternative crops, and transportation, storage, and handling
costs.  Transportation costs will be a function of the density and value of
agricultural land surrounding the facility, and the existing road network and
local labor costs.  Feedstock quality will vary with storage time and moisture
content at time of harvesting, among other factors.  Additionally, the impacts
of biomass energy systems on pollution control activities at a conversion
facility must be considered.</P>
<P> The environmental features most relevant to the conversion facility are the
facility's air/water emissions and wastes.  Data needed to quantify these
include the size and technical specification of the bioenergy facility. 
Facility-specific features (e.g., particulate emissions or tons of ash per MW
hour of operation) can be modeled and are independent of facility location. 
Thus, they are comparatively easy to quantify although the resulting estimates
will not be as reliable as with a proven technology.  Some impacts important to
the facility as a firm (localized erosion, possible loss of animal or plant
habitat) may occur in the building of the facility. Although comparatively easy
to quantify for a particular facility, these impacts are difficult to generalize
as they will be very site dependent. </P>
<H4><B>Community Scale</B></H4>
<P> At the community scale, the interactions among farms, the conversion
facility, support industries, and local infrastructure, institutions, and the
economic base become more significant in evaluating the economic and
environmental costs and benefits of biomass energy systems.  It is not
sufficient to analyze a firm in isolation to quantify economic and environmental
impacts to the community.  Unfortunately, formal economic models for community
scale analysis are frequently lacking.</P>
<P> From the community perspective, economic features such as the number and
quality of jobs produced or lost, impacts on the tax base, and changes in
infrastructure (e.g., roads, schools, waste management facilities, water and
sewer, etc.) needs and costs become more important in defining the economic
value of dedicated biomass energy systems.  Size of the conversion facility will
be an important factor in determining the quantity of jobs created and demands
on infrastructure.</P>
<P> Job creation potential increases with larger facilities as labor needs,
farmer participation, input use, and transportation and product distribution
needs increase.  Direct job creation associated with the conversion facility can
be measured relatively easily by determining the number of people needed to
build and operate the facility.  It is more difficult to measure the number of
jobs that may be created in associated supply and support industries--profit
maximization models can be used to estimate changes in input demand which will
have an indirect multiplier effect on employment levels among input suppliers. 
Increased employment will have a multiplier effect throughout the community.  
Estimation of the community multiplier effect is more difficult to estimate--it
is often based on changes in per capita income.  Additionally, jobs may be lost
if a new biomass facility displaces conversion facilities using conventional
technologies.</P>
<P> Demands (and thus costs) on local infrastructure facilities might also
increase as facility size increases.   A complicating factor in estimating the
impacts of a biomass conversion facility on the infrastructure needs of a
community involves whether or not new people move into the community to take
advantage of new economic opportunities.  Increased population puts added
pressure on infrastructure, at increased cost.  Profitability of the plant will
affect local taxes that may be collected and potentially influence the quality
of the jobs created. </P>
<P> At the community scale, the relevant environmental features for defining
the environmental value of dedicated biomass energy systems are stream water
quality, plant and animal changes and any local interactions between the
conversion facility emissions and construction and the surrounding environs.  
</P>
<P> Water quality and plant and animal shifts are both related to the landuse
change associated with supplying the feedstock to the conversion facility. They
are difficult to quantify as they are a function of what farmland changes and
where that land is located relative to streams and other land uses.   Models
exist which will predict stream water quality, and groundwater quality at the
community scale<A HREF="#3"><I>(3)</I></A> <A NAME="r3"></A>        but they
require considerable spatially explicit data (topography, soil, weather, land
use, land management practices).  Furthermore, the data need to be in digital
format (i.e., computerized maps).  Of these, land-use/land-cover data including
where energy crops are likely to be grown are the most problematic data to
acquire (or model as in the case of energy crop location).  Mapped soils data
can also be problematic as they are often not digital.  Digital topographic data
is generally available but may be of too coarse a quality to use in hydrologic
models, particularly for regions with little relief - the case of many  farming
regions.   There are no models to directly predict the plant and animal changes
that might be associated with the community level production of energy crops. 
However, habitat-scale models might be able to partially fulfill this need. </P>
<P> Community-level environmental impacts associated with conversion facility
emissions and construction and their interaction with community environs will
probably not be very significant in most cases as biomass conversion facilities
are generally projected to have low air emissions, their wastes are fairly
benign, and the facilities are most likely to be constructed at existing
industrial sites.  However, if the facility is built in an undeveloped area, 
the visual impact of the facility may be significant to the community as may the
potential plant or animal habitat loss.  These facility-related effects can be
quantified for a specific community but not for communities in general. </P>
<P> In many ways, the necessary environmental data are more available for
quantifying environmental features at community level than at the farm level. 
Generalizing environmental impacts of biomass energy systems to the array of
communities where bioenergy facilities might be built is possible (for most of
the relevant features) but technically challenging.  To construct a general
model of the environmental costs and benefits at the community level will
require systematically modeling likely land use changes across a large sample of
communities that are representative of the distribution of landscapes (e.g.
array of soils, land-uses, topography, climate) occurring  in the region of
interest. </P>
<H4><B>National Scale</B></H4>
<P> The bioenergy product becomes an important consideration in evaluating the
economic and environmental costs, benefits, and tradeoffs at the national scale.
 At this scale, total demand for the bioenergy product (e.g., electricity or
ethanol) will be a deciding factor in determining the number of conversion
facilities and quantities of biomass (and hence land base) needed. </P>
<P> The questions of economic interest involving biomass energy systems at the
national level are total economic activity generated (gross domestic product);
trade balance; job creation (loss); impacts on government expenditures: the cost
and economic impact of maintaining national security; and the economic cost and
effectiveness of environmental regulation.</P>
<P> Depending on the question to be analyzed and the degree of industry sector
interaction that occurs, a partial or a general equilibrium approach might be
taken.  A partial equilibrium approach analyzes one product market and keeps
fixed all input and output prices except the price of the product being
analyzed.  A general equilibrium approach analyzes multiple markets and allows
all prices to vary.  Large general equilibrium models exist that analyze the
impacts of changes in energy prices on employment, government payments, total
economic activity, and balance of trade.  National security issues can be
indirectly addressed by using the models to examine the impact of constraining
oil imports.   Additionally, agricultural general equilibrium models exist that
evaluate changes in farm income, food prices, and balance of trade under a
variety of market, technology, and policy conditions.   Most of the models allow
one to determine employment impacts by sector, and some estimate regional as
well as national economic variation, although the regions generally consist of
large geographic areas.   Most of these models do not currently contain a
biomass energy sector, however they could be adjusted to do so.</P>
<P> Some of the environmental features relevant at the community-scale related
to landuse change are still important at the national scale. These include plant
and animal impacts, stream water quality, and wetlands.  As at the community
scale, our ability to quantify these features varies both in level of effort
required and current-level of understanding.  Much of the discussion of data
needs under community-scale are equally applicable at the national scale. 
Quantifying plant and animal impacts becomes even more complex at this scale
because consideration of bird migration patterns and species extinction becomes
important. In addition, water quality modeling may be more difficult because
most existing water-quality models appropriate for this scale of analysis are
fairly empirical and thus ill-suited for evaluating the impact of a land use for
which there is little empirical data.</P>
<P> The new environmental features relevant at this scale relate to the
bioenergy product itself and what it replaces.  Air quality impacts (e.g.,  NO<SUB>x</SUB>,
SO<SUB>x</SUB>, ozone formation, aldehydes, particulates) resulting from the
substitution of biomass derived-ethanol or oil for fossil fuel-derived gasoline
or diesel,  or the substitution of biomass for coal or natural gas for power
production are key environmental features at this scale.  Reductions in CO<SUB>2</SUB>
emissions resulting from the substitution of bioenergy for fossil energy is
another important product-related feature. These product-related features are
fairly amenable to quantification, provided a scenario of bioenergy use is
assumed  (e.g. so many GW of power or liters of ethanol).  Publications exist on
these subjects and some of the general-equilibrium models could be easily
modified to include air quality impacts in their output. </P>
<P>
</P>
<P> In general, tools exist or could be modified to quantify the economic and
environmental tradeoffs of dedicated biomass energy systems (excluding the
environmental tradeoffs of land use change).  The uncertainty in most of these
analyses will reside in their ability to correctly characterize an emerging
hybrid (energy-agriculture) industry.</P>
<CENTER>
<H3><B>Summary</B> </H3></CENTER>
<P> Firms, communities and nations will face decisions regarding the
environmental and economic benefits, costs, and tradeoffs of dedicated bioenergy
systems.  Our ability to quantify those tradeoffs differs by scale. 
Environmental benefits, costs and tradeoffs of using bioenergy rather than
fossil fuels is probably better understood than anything else. We are just
beginning to quantify the environmental benefits, costs, and tradeoffs of
growing energy crops rather than conventional crops.  The potential economic
benefits to the firm (farm or conversion facility) can be readily quantified. 
Additionally, models exist that with sufficient adjustments could be used to
determine national income and employment changes and government expenditures
resulting from bioenergy system development.  And depending on the model,
evaluating employment changes by sector and region is feasible.  The community
scale is the scale which is most lacking for formal economic models.   </P>

<H3>Abstract</H3></CENTER>
<P>  For over a decade, researchers have used small-scale research plots to
assist development and selection of high yielding, pest-resistant clones of
fast-growing hardwoods such as hybrid poplar (<I>Populus</I> spp.). Substantial
advances have been made in the techniques and criteria for screening species and
selecting clones. Data from these research plots indicate that the ultimate
performance of selected clones is dependent upon variable factors in the
environment. Until now, researchers could only determine the suitability of a
given site for such clones, not the actual yield potential of the site. Recently
in the north central United States, several clones were planted on
larger-than-research-scale plots on private land recontracted under the
Conservation Reserve Program (CRP). The historical database could not provide a
framework which would allow producers to predict the yield potential of a
particular clone on a specific site. Through a systematic combination of clonal
trials on experimental research-scale plots and operational plantings on 50 to
100 acre agricultural-scale field plots, it may be possible to develop yield
functions or site quality equations which would predict biomass yields at
rotation for selected clones. Such estimates will (1) reduce the probability of
planting failure, (2) allow maximum expression of the genetic potential of
selected superior clones, and thus (3) facilitate accurate economic planning for
both the producer and conversion facility manager.</P>
<CENTER>
<H3>Introduction</H3></CENTER>
<P> Through financial cooperation and integrated research a hybrid poplar (<I>Populus</I>
spp.) plantation network was established in 1987 in the upper north-central
United States. There have been several research objectives related to the
establishment and monitoring of this network over the last 8 years. The most
important may have been the screening and identification of hybrid poplar clones
for operational use in Minnesota, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Wisconsin.
Through the screening process, researchers have worked to develop accurate tools
with which to estimate yield potential of selected clones on these particular
sites. In addition to clonal screening, these plantations have been used to
characterize pest resistance in the studied clones and to categorize
environmental factors that influence growth.</P>
<P> It is known that two major environmental factors that determine yield
potential are the edaphic and climatic characteristics of the selected sites.
Although many crop management factors like weed control affect mortality and
eventual productivity at rotation age, the soil and climatic factors are
generally a matter of initial site selection rather than site modification.
Thus, site selection becomes an important contributor to final plant
productivity. This paper addresses three aspects of site selection and
characterization related to short-rotation woody culture (SRWC) production. The
first, consists of a review of historical data and literature dealing with soil
and climate factors related to SRWC. The second aspect of this paper outlines
potential application of site productivity functions from a hybrid poplar
producer and hybrid poplar consumer perspective. And the third, presents a
framework for the development of site productivity functions based on estimates
of the number of acres, test sites, and clones to test on each site required to
create robust prediction equations.</P>
<P> Because of the importance of the north-central U.S. to the development of
biomass energy crops in the U.S. and because of the prominent role hybrid poplar
play in this development, this region will be used in this paper as a model for
the development of similar productivity functions in other regions and for other
species of SRWC.</P>
<CENTER>
<H3>Historical Data</H3></CENTER>
<P> Several authors over the past 10 years have published criteria for site
selection for hybrid poplars (<A HREF="#heilmann">Heilmann <I>et al</I>. 1991</A>,
<A HREF="#arbor">Arbor Day Foundation 1993</A>, <A HREF="#hansenetal93">Hansen
<I>et al</I>. 1993</A>). Site selection criteria for eastern cottonwood (<I>Populus
deltoides</I> Bart.) were developed nearly 35 years ago (<A HREF="#broadfoot">Broadfoot
1960</A>). All of these criteria describe the need for moderate textured,
well-drained soils with moderately high fertility, 3-8% organic matter and soil
pH between 5.6 and 7.8. High water availability through either high water
holding capacity or high water table are also required, though sites with
prolonged flooding or standing water should be avoided. These criteria are
designed mainly to eliminate sites that (1) do not provide minimal site
requirements for soil texture, fertility, or organic matter content or (2)
exceed threshold characteristics such as pH or slope. Although these criteria
are important, they do not establish a relationship between site &quot;quality&quot;
and ultimate hybrid poplar productivity. Such a relationship would (1) decrease
production risk and supply uncertainty for producers and consumers,
respectively, (2) ensure reliable productivity and yield from selected clones,
(3) assist in determination of number of sites needed of a particular &quot;quality&quot;
to attain an overall production level and (4) provide a reliable basis with
which to determine alternative economic returns to different scales of
production. The need for a more refined quantitative description of this
relationship is the basis of this paper.</P>
<P> There is little literature and data available describing the relationship
of hybrid poplar productivity to soils and climate within any SRWC plantations.
Hansen <I>et al</I>. (<A HREF="#hansen95">1995</A>), reporting on 130 acres of
demonstration plantations in the north-central U.S., states that average
productivity in 7- and 8-year-old hybrid poplar plantations equaled 3.3 dry tons
per acre per year (TAY), ranged up to 4.6 TAY for the best clone at the best
site, and surpassed 8.0 TAY on the best plot. Figure 1 demonstrates the effect
of site and clonal selection on biomass production for 6-year-old plantations (<A
HREF="#hansenetal93">Hansen <I>et al</I>. 1993</A>). Although there was little
difference in production within sites among clones, there was a substantial
difference in production between sites, illustrating the importance of and
opportunity for site selection to attain consistently high yields in future
plantings (<A HREF="#hansenetal93">Hansen <I>et al</I>. 1993</A>). Hansen <I>et
al</I>. (1993) did report that water availability was a major factor in
determining biomass production on a given site.</P>
<P><IMG SRC="downing1.gif" ALIGN="MIDDLE" ALT="Figure 1"><BR> Figure 1.
Effect of site and clonal selection on biomass production (6-year old
plantations). From Hansen et al., 1993.</P>
<P> Hansen <I>et al</I>. (1993) also showed no definitive results to suggest
that a particular clone would be recommended at one site or another. A
regression equation: total tree dry weight = -1.67 * 0.23 (Diameter at Breast
Height2), accounted for 98% of the total variation in biomass productivity and
did not significantly vary among clones. Similar results were obtained by Tuskan
and Rensema (1990) where total tree dry weight for four hybrid poplar clones
grown in North Dakota could be reliably predicted by a single regression
equation. Hansen <I>et al</I>. (<A HREF="#hansen95">1995</A>) did note that
the regression coefficients did vary significantly by site, supporting the
hypothesis that there is a relationship between site quality and hybrid poplar
productivity.</P>
<P> Berguson (<A HREF="#berguson92">1992</A>) examined the north-central
plantation network with the objectives to characterize soils within the network
and to investigate the relationship between plantation productivity to soil and
climate characteristics. Twenty-three sampling sites were chosen in Minnesota,
Wisconsin, North Dakota, and South Dakota. Complete soil profiles were described
according to Soil Conservation Service (SCS) standards. Soil bulk densities,
organic matter content, and portion of gravel, sand, silt and clay were
determined. Complete chemical analyses were performed. Particle size
distribution and organic matter content were used to estimate the available
water capacity by regression equation. Climate information was acquired from the
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) data obtained nearest
each planting site. Monthly average high and low temperatures, total annual
rainfall and cooling degree days were included in this database.</P>
<P> The results of this assessment indicated that although soil characteristics
varied widely across the network there was no relationship between any of the
measured soil characteristics and poplar productivity. Berguson (<A
HREF="#berguson92">1992</A>) did note that growth, stand age, and soil
characteristics were confounded among sampled sites. This confounding may have
obscured the effect of soil water holding capacity, total available moisture or
soil texture on tree biomass. After accounting for stand age, average cooling
degree days was found to be positively correlated with mean tree dry weight. The
R2 value indicated that 91 percent of the total variation in tree dry weight was
explained by differences in averaging cooling days among sites. Berguson
concluded that plantation productivity relationships with soil and climate
characteristics would become stronger and more evident over time as plantation
stands matured. Berguson recommended that the analysis could be improved by (1)
obtaining daily temperature and growing degree days for all sites, (2) improving
the precision of precipitation estimates, (3) using exponential weighing of soil
properties, (4) collecting tree growth measurements at other sites, and (5)
adding total runoff input by analyzing topography of land surrounding the sites.</P>
<P> Berguson (<A HREF="#berguson94">1994</A>), through funding provided by the
Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI), evaluated the land suitability of
soils and climate for poplar production within the north central U.S. As an
indicator of site quality, Berguson relied on the United States Department of
Agriculture Soil Conservation Service (USDA-SCS) land capability classes to
predict growth. The analyses were done with U.S. Forest Service Forest Inventory
and Analyses (FIA) unit boundaries. Division of some of the units was necessary
to provide a more detailed evaluation of soil suitability within the units. From
the data presented in this paper, and as noted by Graham and Downing (<A
HREF="#graham">1995</A>), it is apparent that there is no relationship between
SCS land capability class and poplar productivity. Heimlich (<A HREF="#heimlich">1994</A>)
confirms this as well. Furthermore, information on land rent, as provided by the
Conservation Reserve Program (CRP), was not related to hybrid poplar
productivity (see Table 8, <A HREF="#berguson94">Berguson 1994</A>). Berguson
does conclude that MN-AB MN-NP and MI-WUP units (Figure 2) have less potential
production due to lower quality soils and low percentage of agricultural land.
MN-P2 and MN-P3, and WI-SE units are considered highly productive in general but
any drought-risk areas may pose difficulty in making site specific clonal
selections (see Figure 2).</P>

<CENTER>
<H3>Potential Applications of Site Productivity Functions</H3></CENTER>
<P>  Reliable site productivity functions (that is, equations that would
predict final mean annual dry weight at rotation based on edaphic and climatic
characteristics of the selected site) would allow individual landowners to
assess the potential biomass crops would offer as an alternative crop for their
available land. This type of information would lead to more accurate projections
of economic return from these lands. In addition, a consumer in a market for
SRWC wood could more accurately plan annual feedstock acquisitions based on site
productivity functions. For example, if a conversion facility requires 500 tons
per day and the plant operates for 200 days per year, then 10,000 tons per year
are needed. This would require harvesting 2000 acres per year if productivity is
projected to be 5 TAY. If these plantations were managed on a 10 year rotation,
the facility would need to rely on a 20,000 acre &quot;fibershed&quot; base.
Alternatively, if sites could be identified that yield 7.5 TAY, then the total
number of acres committed to the conversion facility could be reduced to ca.
13,000 acres. Accurate site productivity functions would permit conversion
facility managers (1) to select the most productive sites within a given supply
radius or (2) to project biomass yields from available land if site selection
was not possible. Thus, both the landowner and conversion facility manager would
benefit from reliable site productivity functions.</P>
<P> The ability to provide site productivity functions and thus site indices to
predict final biomass yields on larger scales can only be accomplished through
continued refinement and collection of all possible environmental determinants
of growth. Although previous studies were unable to detect relationships between
direct (e.g. soil attributes) or indirect (e.g. land rent values) site
characteristics and measured productivity, Berguson and Hansen both noted the
limited number of sites available for conducting such studies. </P>
<CENTER>
<H3>Recommendations for the<BR>  Development of Site Productivity Functions</H3></CENTER>
<P>  There are three areas for continued and new research. Accomplishing these
goals over the next 5-10 years would (1) reduce the probability of planting
failure, (2) allow maximum expression of the genetic potential of selected
superior clones, and thus (3) facilitate accurate economic planning for both the
producer and conversion facility manager.</P>
<P> First, measurement of the current hybrid poplar plantation network must
continue through age 12 (currently age 9) in order to completely understand the
actual yield potential at these sites, as well as verify the developed biomass
regression equation. Information from these established sites will provide 1)
measurements of mean annual increment which had not culminated on the study
sites, 2) defined optimal rotation ages and yields of intensively cultured
hybrid poplar, and 3) a clear relationship between foliar N and plot yield based
on a significant decline in foliar N observed in the last year of study. </P>
<P> Second, in the spring of 1994, 3 clones of hybrid poplar were planted on
1000 acres of CRP land near Alexandria, MN. Intensive agricultural production
budget information is currently being tracked for each year of production
through harvest. This information is the only production-scale budget
information being assembled on hybrid poplar. Production budget data such as
these will provide economic information at the farm or producer scale. It will
also provide sufficient information needed to establish pricing information for
a potentially developing market for energy or increased hardwood market in the
pulp and paper industry (<A HREF="#downing">Downing <I>et al</I>. 1994</A>).</P>
<P> The most definitive data currently being assembled and tracked over time
are the relationships of 28 soils on 14 CRP sites across the 1000 acres
mentioned above and the specific number of plants and identified clones of
hybrid poplar planted. This information will provide valuable yield information
on sites where clones and soil types as well as SCS soil capability classes are
mapped with scaled precision (<A HREF="#downing">Downing <I>et al</I>. 1994</A>).
This information will be augmented by data collected from a second 1000 acre
planting established in May 1995. The growth and performance data on these sites
will need to continue to be tracked through one full rotation. While the
information will contribute to the data base needed to develop site productivity
functions, it is limited to one climatic zone.</P>
<P> Finally, to permit robust statistical testing of the relationship between
site characteristics and biomass productivity we propose the establishment of a
regional site quality characterization study for the north-central U.S. This
study would involve 4-8 test sites within each of three suitable subregions
noted by Berguson (<A HREF="#berguson94">1995</A>). At each site four
genetically-diverse, highly-productive, selected hybrid poplar clones should be
planted in 12 x 12 clonal blocks replicated four times per site. Establishment
and maintenance procedures should be based on standard protocols outlined by
Hansen <I>et al</I>. (<A HREF="#hansenetal93">1993</A>). The entire study
should be replicated in two successive years to account for variable climatic
conditions. Finally, the study should be maintained for the full rotation length
of 8-10 years. Annual incremental productivity should be based on the regression
equations developed by Hansen <I>et al</I>. (<A HREF="#hansen95">1995</A>),
with the final productivity values based on destructive sampling and direct
measures of dry weight. Weather stations should be established at each location
and a complete assessment of soil properties should be conducted before and
after completion of the study. This information should be combined with all
additional data available on environmental factors and growth rates from other
regional experimental, pre-operational, and commercial plantations to create a
reliable site productivity function for the north central U.S.</P>
<CENTER>
<H3>Conclusions</H3></CENTER>
<P>
</P>
<P> Accurate site productivity functions would have utility to both potential
producers and consumers of SRWC biomass. The establishment of systematically
selected research plots for the development of site productivity functions will
allow (1) a robust examination of the relationship between site characteristics
and biomass productivity, and if justified, (2) the development of such
functions. Data used in the correlation analyses would be collected at each
site, as opposed to near available source, to assure accuracy. Furthermore,
existing research plots and pre-operational plots in the region will be
leveraged against the new plots to help validate the tested relationships. </P>

<H3>Abstract</H3></CENTER>
<P>  Scale-up projects are an important step toward demonstration and
commercialization of woody biomass because simply planting extensive acreage of
hybrid poplar will not develop markets. Project objectives are to document the
cost to plant and establish, and effort needed to monitor and maintain woody
biomass on agricultural land. Conversion technologies and alternative end-uses
are examined in a larger framework in order to afford researchers and industrial
partners information necessary to develop supply and demand on a local or
regional scale. Likely to be determined are risk factors of crop failure and
differences between establishment of research plots and agricultural scale field
work. Production economics are only one consideration in understanding
demonstration and scale-up. Others are environmental, marketing, industrial, and
agricultural in nature. Markets for energy crops are only beginning to develop.
Although information collected as a result of planting up to 5000 acres of
hybrid poplar in central Minnesota will not necessarily be transferable to other
areas of the country, a national perspective will come from development of
regional markets for woody and herbaceous crops. Several feedstocks, with
alternative markets in different regions will eventually comprise the entire
picture of biofuels feedstock market development. Current projects offer
opportunities to learn about the complexity and requirements that will move
biomass from research and development to actual market development. These
markets may include energy and other end-uses such as fiber.	 </P>
<CENTER>
<H3>Introduction</H3></CENTER>
<P> Minnesota is currently the site of two scale-up research and demonstration
(R &amp; D) projects for planting short rotation intensive culture hybrid poplar
on private land. The projects are located in central Minnesota near Alexandria
and in the northwest near Oklee. The purpose of these projects is to provide a
base of experience to launch large scale commercial projects. This step toward
larger scale plantings is possible because of more than 15 years of research,
species screening and crop development of hybrid poplar. This research has
involved many state, local and federal agencies. Universities and individuals
alike have been involved in planning, research and development. Scale-ups such
as the two described in this paper are the next logical step toward creating a
market for wood for energy. Other scale-up projects of hybrid poplar have
occurred such as those performed by the forest products industries in the
pacific northwest United States. In most regions of the country, wood fiber
markets are fairly well developed and identified. Wood for energy is not;
especially hardwoods from trees grown for that end use. </P>
<P> It is important to understand the reasons for developing larger scale (R &amp;
D) projects, the kinds of information that is collected and data derived from
this near-production kind of work, and to understand the development of
potential markets and the persons or clients to whom benefits may accrue. When
many diverse groups with interests in agriculture, forestry, environment and
economics converge, complex interactions with opportunities for mutually
beneficial work may come about. We attempt to draw from early experiences and
document these carefully so information may be more easily transferred to those
who could most benefit from this information. </P>
<P> Most of the remarks in this paper center on the Alexandria project, the one
which the authors are most familiar with. Background and comments regarding the
Oklee project are also provided as they relate to the Alexandria project.</P>
<P> The next sections of the paper outline the historical perspective from
early work in Minnesota and Wisconsin. A third section takes a closer look at
the Alexandria project. In the following two sections, we outline interest among
private landowners, and specific lessons learned from the scale-up work,
respectively. We conclude with a summary of current related work, and
recommendations about future issues that are likely to arise. </P>
<CENTER>
<H3>Historical Perspective and Review</H3></CENTER>
<P> A review of short rotation woody crop (SRWC) work in the state adds some
perspective to efforts at Alexandria and Oklee. Regional research into these
crops began at the U.S. Forest Service (USFS) Research Laboratory in
Rhinelander, Wisconsin during the mid-1970s. Dave Dawson and Ed Hansen led the
SRWC research at Rhinelander. Many others were involved. These early efforts
helped to build a geographically limited but technologically solid base of
knowledge and interested parties.</P>
<P> From 1979 to 1983 the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Short Rotation Woody
Crops Program at Oak Ridge National Laboratory supported research to evaluate
the potential of peat lands for producing woody biomass under short rotation
intensive culture. University of Minnesota researchers planted poplar (<I>Populus
spp</I>.) and willow (<I>Salix spp</I>.) on peat land to measure growth rates
and other differences between clones. Since the proposed end product was biomass
for energy, the plantings were very densely spaced. Peat land was chosen as a
site because it was assumed that using more productive land to grow energy was
completely out of the question. Growth rates were low and studies ended in 1984.
 </P>
<P> Interest in SRWC slowly began to build in Minnesota. Collaborative work
with the North Central Forest Experiment Station continued to be supported by
the DOEs Biofuels Feedstock Development Program at Oak Ridge National Laboratory
under researchers Janet Cushman, Jack Ranney, Lynn Wright and others. In 1986,
the DOE through Oak Ridge issued a solicitation for cost sharing on 50-acre
scale-up plantings which developed into USFS and DOE cooperation on research for
a series of 10 and 20 acre clonal trial plots in Minnesota and surrounding
states. Eleven of these locations are still closely monitored (<A
HREF="#Downing95">Downing and Tuskan,1995</A>; <A HREF="#hansen93">Hansen et
al., 1993</A>). Studies including use of herbicides and cultural techniques were
also conducted. Information and research results generated from these plots is
used directly on the large-scale biomass plantings in Alexandria and Oklee.</P>
<P> Private sector interest in wood energy led to the choice of Minnesota as a
site for the1986 USFS and DOE field trials. Northern States Power Company (NSP)
was involved in the concept of growing trees to burn as fuel. An engineer on
their staff, Dave Ostlie, promoted a vision of burning whole trees. NSP
supported the project for a few years, but then withdrew their support, leaving
Mr. Ostlie to form his own company to further explore the technology of
whole-tree burning. Another private sector group interested in SRWC was the
Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI). EPRI, which joined the DOE in
supporting the early field trials, funded power conversion tests.</P>
<P> By the time the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MN-DNR) became
involved in SRWC, work was already well under way. Involvement of the MN-DNR was
inevitable because the DNRs role is to work directly with landowners whenever
state or federal cost-sharing is available for tree planting. DNR field
foresters provide technical advice to the owners and ensure that public monies
are achieving their mission. A real problem when DNR became involved in 1986 was
that they did not have any expertise on hybrid poplar and short rotation
planting. </P>
<CENTER>
<H3>Oklee and Alexandria Large-Scale Biomass Plantings</H3></CENTER>
<P> Minnesota has two simultaneous scale-up projects that are very different in
their approach and philosophy. In 1992, oil overcharge monies were appropriated
for a 3,000 acre SRWC project. This evolved into what is now known as the Oklee
project. It's original purpose was to provide feedstock for converting to
ethanol or thermochemical fuels. Lack of a commercial partner delayed the
project until late 1993, when a regional utility, Minnesota Power and Light
(MPL), agreed to find a market for the wood (though not necessarily an energy
market). Five hundred acres were planted in the spring of 1995, and the
remaining 2,500 acres are scheduled for planting in 1996. Site productivity,
grower security, and commercial viability (as evidenced by utility
participation) are key factors in this scale-up project.</P>
<P> Providentially, during the summer of 1993, DOE, EPRI and others were
seeking scale-up projects around the country. With the Oklee project on hold,
the DNR sought funds for a 1000 acre project as a substitute. The DOE, through
the Biofuels Feedstock Development Program, (successor to the Short Rotation
Woody Crops Program) and EPRI provided $227,000 of the $341,000 total to fund
the biomass project near Alexandria. </P>
<P> The Alexandria project picked up momentum that temporarily shifted from the
delayed oil overcharge project. Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) land was
available and federal cost-shares covered $62,000 of the establishment costs
plus the annual rent payments. Non-CRP land was not used as CRP was partially
cost-covered. Landowners were chosen from those that had indicated an interest.
Fortuitously, the CRP allowed landowners to recontract their currently held CRP
contracts on qualifying land for tree planting.</P>
<P> In 1993, all partners for the 1000-acre Alexandria project were financially
committed in less than two months. Work began by mid-October 1993 and 500 acres
of land near Alexandria was prepared for planting before the ground froze. The
remaining five hundred acres had to be prepared during the spring of 1994. All
1000 acres were planted with hybrid poplar cuttings in spring 1994.
Fourteen-hundred additional acres were planted in 1995 in a second phase. This
included a replanting of 400 original acres that had proven unsuccessful due
mostly to spring site preparation on heavy sod. To date, 19 landowners have
enrolled nearly 1900 acres. </P>
<CENTER>
<H3>The Alexandria Project</H3></CENTER>
<P> Overall, the main goal of the Alexandria project was to test systems that
were developed on smaller research plots in a scale-up context. Researchers
recommended only five of the best clones of hybrid poplar for commercial
out-planting. The rotation age was set at seven to ten years to allow the trees
to reach a size that would fit into existing commercial wood markets if energy
markets failed to materialize. The spacing for that rotation age (8 feet by 8
feet) requires about 700 trees per acre.</P>
<P> One of the early steps taken in Alexandria was to hold a meeting, or
roundtable, where a variety of stakeholders would be represented. The group
included project funders, landowners, researchers, end-users, environmental
groups, and natural resource agencies. The purpose of the roundtable was to
introduce the project and give stakeholders a chance to ask questions and
provide input to the project. The roundtable was modeled after early work of the
National Biofuels Roundtable (<A HREF="#nbr">unpublished draft final report</A>).</P>
<P> It was felt that the scale-up would provide a true test of landowner
interest in SRWC. Cultural techniques, such as site preparation, planting, and
tending would be tested. The method of dispensing technical advice to landowners
using a combination of foresters, crop management consultants, vendors, and
others was new and needed field testing and documented evaluation. Even the
interaction between the various agencies involved in the United States
Department of Agriculture (USDA) CRP was studied.</P>
<P> Not all factors could be tested. Yield was important, but because of a
shortage of availability of the newest clones, maximization of yield would not
be fully realized. Ultimately, sites were selected more based on environmental
impact assessment than productivity. Migratory bird and a small mammal studies
were begun and are still being monitored. </P>
<P> Alexandria was chosen for several reasons. Good land prices relative to
expected productivity certainly was a factor. CRP rents averaged $40 per acre
and there was a great deal of CRP acreage. It was also helpful to have an
enthusiastic DNR staff forester stationed in the area office that successfully
promoted the program to landowners. Product champions have proven very
instrumental and effective in developing new technologies toward
commercialization.</P>
<P> Another good feature of the Alexandria area was the availability of
alternative markets. Three major pulp and paper companies expressed interest in
the wood, although at this time growers do not have contracts for their wood in
hand. From a landscape perspective, Alexandria also was suitable. Historically
forested, the land was generally cleared for agriculture between 1880 and 1960.
Biomass crops, it was hoped, would more closely mimic the natural forest
processes than soybeans and corn could.</P>
<CENTER>
<H3>Interest Among Landowners</H3></CENTER>
<P> To gain more information about the landowners enrolled in the Alexandria
project, a survey was commissioned by the Wes-Min Resource Conservation and
Development Area. Questionnaires were mailed to all CRP participants with land
in the Alexandria region. Five-hundred thirty landowners representing one-sixth
of the CRP acres responded. Results showed that landowners were quite interested
in alternative crops. Sixty percent of the respondents indicated an interest in
planting trees. About 22,000 acres were offered by owners as land they would
consider for planting SRWC (<A HREF="#hps">Hybrid Poplar Survey, 1994</A>).</P>
<P> In Oklee, farmer response was so high that only three meetings were needed
to secure 10000 acres; only 3000 were needed. The difference in Oklee was that
the end market and user was known <I>a priori</I>. In both cases, it appears
that about three times as many acres were needed to select the best quality
land. For every 1 acre of land needed, 3 acres would have to be considered.</P>
<P> The Hybrid Poplar Survey also provided some interesting fiscal information.
Landowners were overwhelmingly (75%) in favor of annual payments instead of a
lump sum payment up front. 65 percent of the respondents were interested in
forward contracts with an end-user. Interest in joining a wood grower
cooperative was expressed by about half of the respondents.</P>
<P> Landowners had reasons beyond economic motivation for participating. It was
clear they did need to see a return on SRWC plantings, but not necessarily top
dollar compared to other cropping options. The land they enrolled in the poplar
program was productive but inconvenient to farm. Some land had lower
productivity for corn, but acceptable fertility levels for trees. Some producers
possibly were trying to reduce their workload (average survey age was 59). Some
landowners sought to diversify their crop base. In some areas the heavy use of
the CRP has changed the local farm economy. Not all landowners were full-time
farmers. A single economic criterion is that producers must be able to market
the product to users at prices they are willing to pay. Coming to terms on that
price is next.</P>
<CENTER>
<H3>Lessons Learned</H3></CENTER>
<P> Many lessons were and still are being learned on both projects. The lessons
learned will be incorporated into future plantings and projects. In fact, some
of the lessons learned and knowledge gained resulted in changes during the
second phase of the Alexandria project.</P>
<P> A key factor to ensuring success is to provide technical advice to
landowners. Private sector crop consultants were utilized in Alexandria. Their
knowledge of annual crops and weeds was extensive, but training was needed to
better prepare them for understanding competition and release among woody crops.
The DNR state forestry office, as the project leader, is now providing the bulk
of technical advice in coordination with others. However, any forester or
consultant getting into SRWC would need to learn more about weed control among
hybrid poplar crops. The Oklee project plans to rely heavily on crop consultants
in the future.</P>
<P> Some lessons were learned regarding environmental issues. First,
environmental groups are interested in participating. Unique resources need to
be protected in all planting areas. The National Biofuels Roundtable (<A
HREF="#nbr">1994</A>) was an attempt to foster a landscape approach to solving
natural resource problems. Such cooperation usually involves trade-offs and
always requires higher levels and sophisticated planning and communication among
stakeholders.
</P>
<P> As an example, one tract in each of the two projects was pulled from
consideration after landowner agreement, before planting, because of concern
about proximity to Nature Conservancy reserves. Maps of sensitive sites have
since been provided by the Natural Heritage Program. A forester's willingness to
work with a stakeholder like the Nature Conservancy will be a positive attribute
needed in expanding current planting scope.</P>
<P> In general, landscape level issues can be addressed, but benefits or
negative effects on landscape are directly related to project scale. For
example, a 100,000 acre project within a 50 mile radius involves less than 2% of
the land base. One should look at the appropriateness of the landscape for a
crop such as hybrid poplars and discuss general landscape concerns and
opportunities. It is, however, impractical to actually plan and implement the
best location for each field on a landscape basis, especially on private land.</P>
<P> Finally, immense technical information was gathered. For instance, site
preparation must begin the year prior to planting. Shifting from machine
planting to hand planting in most cases would permit early growing cycle
cross-cultivation. Hand planting costs are similar, but the method allows rows
to &quot;checked&quot; or marked evenly for precise placement and planting which
would afford cross cultivation later. Cross cultivation is a good option to
control weeds within the row. </P>
<P> Standards for planting stock have been established in writing and are
rigorously enforced. Planting small cuttings does not afford early season
drought resistance before cuttings take root.</P>
<P> The Biofuels Feedstock Development Program at Oak Ridge National Laboratory
funded a study of the plantation effects on small mammals and birds on a subset
of the Alexandria sites. The initial results clearly demonstrate that biological
diversity, while best in natural forest ecosystems, is still higher on SRWC
lands than on agricultural food and grain cropped areas.</P>
<CENTER>
<H3>Summary and Recommendations</H3></CENTER>
<P> Researchers are the key to technology transfer. A consortium of hybrid
poplar plant material researchers has been an informal research group, partially
organized by several universities, forest research laboratories and the Oak
Ridge National Laboratory. The Minnesota legislature recently approved a
$200,000 grant through the Natural Resource Research Institute at University of
Minnesota - Duluth. The money will be used with other partners such as the USFS
Research Laboratory in Rhinelander, WI to expand research related to plant
breeding of hybrid poplar specific to Minnesota's soil and climatic factors.
This grant requires 2:1 private sector matching funds. There are currently only
5 clones selected for their superior growing habit and viability planted on 2000
acres. As production scale planting increases, more clones need to be developed
and planted in test blocks for species screening. This will provide the numbers
of species that will increase the chances for adaptability on a wider variety of
sites and soils and decrease the probability of an outbreak of diseases or
pests. Other aspects that will continue to provide necessary production scale
information are herbicide trials and environmental and landscape level studies.
</P>
<P> The scale-up venture underscores the need to develop a pool of vendors for
successful SRWC implementation. Vendors prepare sites, plant trees, tend, and
harvest. They might include a subset of the farmer producers or may be comprised
of existing crop service or start-up companies. They need to be trained in
details such as weed identification and control. They may need specialized
equipment and licenses. Some subsidies to encourage a vendor pool may be
beneficial.</P>
<P> Not surprisingly, end users play a big role in project success. At a
minimum, there has to some viable market outlet for the wood. Scale-up and
demonstration projects such as in Alexandria demonstrate that early phases of
projects can rely on risk-takers and subsidies to get enough acres into the
project. In the long-run, end-users must be viable and committed. Providing
letters of general intent to buy wood is one method. Forward contracting is even
better. The higher level of commitment greatly eases the process of involving
landowners as was obvious in Oklee when recruiting of owners was achieved in
just a few public meetings. Parties involved must have the perception that risk
and costs are being shared among all participants.</P>
<P> Grower cooperatives have also been suggested for Alexandria. The
cooperatives could market wood and carbon credits. Carbon and other tax credits
are being considered in different areas of the country. Grower-producer
cooperatives would also jointly own equipment and bid for services. </P>
<P> We are learning that end-users can &quot;smell&quot; a winner in SRWC.
Traditional forest industries in Minnesota have become very interested and
active based on research work originally done with energy as an end-use option.
An agreement entitled &quot;Agenda 2020&quot;, signed November 1994 by the DOE
and the American Forest and Paper Association now sets the stage for promotion
of industrial growth, energy efficiency, and international competitiveness while
preserving the environment. Multiple end-users assure growers of robust market
viability.</P>
<P> The scale-up and demonstration work has been given a significant amount of
media and political attention. Biomass for energy and for traditional wood
products has moved from the &quot;idea&quot; phase to &quot;ground-breaking&quot;
reality. </P>
<P> More needs to be learned. New clonal development and testing of herbicides
like
<I>Oust</I> are examples. The bird and mammal studies need to be ongoing. It is
also necessary to continue scale-up to keep the momentum of the nurseries and
vendors going. We believe another 5,000 acres of scale-up to further test the
infrastructure of vendors, advisors, nurseries, would be valuable. We believe
the private sector is on the edge of implementing the SRWC technology using the
knowledge and skills gained to date. Because scale-up projects provide actual
data about successful sites, growers, users, decision-makers, and others will be
able to further develop production technology and integrate end-use systems in
markets.</P>

<H3><B>Introduction</B></H3>
<P>
</P>
<P> Perennial prairie grasses offer many advantages to the developing biofuels
industry.  High-yielding varieties of native prairie grasses such as switchgrass
(<I>Panicum virgatum</I>) have low nutrient demand, a diverse geographical
growing range and high net energy yields, and offer important soil and water
conservation benefits.  These crops can supplement annual row crops such as corn
in the developing alternative fuels market.  However, displacement of row crops
by perennial grasses will have major agricultural, economic, social and
cross-market implications.</P>
<P>
</P>
<P> To analyze the implications of using lignocellulosic materials to produce
ethanol or other fuels, we discuss four related topics: 1) the U.S. energy
markets and the niche that biofuels may fill; 2) the contribution of
agriculture; 3) economic barriers and the role of technology in reducing them;
and 4) the environmental effects of biomass fuels.  The need to integrate these
considerations is the reason that the eventual benefits of producing liquid
fuels from biomass are so complex and often misunderstood.  We first outline the
U.S. energy situation and the opportunity for producing ethanol from
lignocellulosic crops.  However, this opportunity is affected by the heavy
subsidies currently given for converting corn grain to ethanol.  Technological
development and advanced engineering could produce vast quantities of ethanol
cheaply in a fixed market.  Another consideration is that significant
environmental issues recently have become important in the debates over
producing energy crops.  Environmental concerns also have been voiced with
respect to current agricultural production, but not with the same intensity.</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<H3><B>The Energy Situation in the United States</B></H3>
<P> 	<B><I>The need for alternative fuels</I></B></P>
<P>  Transportation  fuels  in  this  country  have  been dominated  by  oil 
for  nearly  100 years.  The supply of oil is finite and its extraction and use
are environmentally damaging.  Energy price shocks have had dislocating effects.
 Eventually, we will need alternatives to current transportation fuels, although
we do not know exactly when.  A longer-term perspective is important in
developing bioenergy systems.  Most current development in this area has been
catalyzed by environmental mandates from the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA) and by supply and demand shocks in the oil market.</P>
<P>
</P>
<P> Fuel cells and methanol for internal combustion engines are two
alternatives to gasoline.  Fuel cells that generate electricity from hydrogen or
methanol are still being developed.  Energy from fuel cells is currently seen as
more expensive than gasoline.  To operate fuel cells on methanol contributes to
the greenhouse effect.  To operate them on hydrogen requires remote generation
of hydrogen.  For internal combustion engines, methanol is less expensive than
gasoline, but it must be produced from natural gas and therefore does not reduce
the greenhouse effect (<A HREF="#foody">Foody, 1988</A>).</P>
<P>
</P>
<P> Ethanol is another alternative to fossil fuels for powering internal
combustion engines, and is the focus of this paper.  Ethanol can be blended at
10% with 90% gasoline or used neat (100% ethanol).  It currently is used to
enhance octane levels in gasoline and as a cosolvent for other fuel additives. 
Its ability to substitute for other additives that have harmful emissions
eventually may add economic value beyond its value simply as a gasoline
additive.</P>
<P>
</P>
<P> The increased use of renewable fuels offers the United States a strategy
for significantly reducing its dependence on imported oil (<A HREF="#lynd">Lynd
et al., 1991</A>; <A HREF="#robertson">Robertson and Shapouri, 1993</A>). 
Several renewable feedstocks can be used to produce ethanol while providing
diverse benefits to the national agricultural economy: sugar, grains, wood,
agricultural residues, herbaceous crops (such as sorghum and switchgrass),
municipal wastes, and paper.</P>
<P>
</P>
<P> Currently, U.S. ethanol production is 1426 million gallons per year, of
which 1235 million gallons is produced from corn (<A HREF="#gist-brocades">Gist-brocades,
1995</A>).  Projections for future supply and economic gain are largely based on
corn as the feedstock.</P>
<P>
</P>
<P> 	<I><B>Net energy projections</B></I></P>
<P>
</P>
<P> The capacity of energy crops to offset imported energy will depend on their
energy yield net of the energy used to grow, harvest and convert them. 
Extensive studies have found a conversion efficiency of nearly 5: 1 (units of
energy out per unit in).  Switchgrass requires less energy to produce than does
corn.  One acre of corn grain contains 50 million BTU and requires 7.6 million
BTU to produce, for an energy output/input ratio of 6.6. When the corn stover is
included, the energy efficiency ratio improves to 8.8.</P>
<P>
</P>
<P> In comparison, switchgrass will produce 20.6 times the energy required to
produce it if it is transported directly to the ethanol plant.  The higher ratio
for switchgrass  occurs largely because it is a perennial (remaining in
production for ten years or more before replanting) and because of its lower
chemical and fertilizer requirements.  These calculations used chemical and
fertilizer application rates from U.S. Department of Agriculture (<A
HREF="#usda">1991a</A>), Fertilizer Institute (<A HREF="#fertilizer">1988;
1992</A>), DeLuchi (<A HREF="#deluchi">1991</A>), and Pimentel (<A
HREF="#pimentel">1980</A>).  Transportation energetics were derived from Fluck
(<A HREF="#fluck">1992</A>).  We assumed that corn and switchgrass needed
identical equipment for soil preparation and planting; however, their harvesting
and handling equipment obviously differed (<A HREF="#fluck">Fluck, 1985</A>;
<A HREF="#bowers">Bowers, 1992</A>).  Although net energy returns vary
regionally, the energy advantage of grasses has been found to be consistently
and significantly higher than for corn in all regions considered.</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<H3><B>Agricultural Benefit and Agronomic Potential</B></H3>
<P>
</P>
<P> After it screened numerous annual and perennial species (<A HREF="#wright">Wright
et al., 1994</A>), the Biofuels Feedstock Development Program (BFDP) of the U.S.
Department of Energy (DOE) selected switchgrass as a model herbaceous energy
crop (<A HREF="#mclaughlin">McLaughlin, 1992</A>).  Switchgrass is an
indigenous American prairie grass that is particularly hardy and widely adapted.
 The reasons it was selected were its reduced cultivation requirements, its
generally lower nutrient demand, and its positive environmental attributes. 
Research suggests that switchgrass could provide significant ecological,
agricultural and economic advantages over annual crops such as corn, as
discussed below.</P>
<P>
</P>
<P> Perennial grasses were an ecological cornerstone of the early American
prairie because of their forage quality and soil stabilizing attributes (<A
HREF="#weaver">Weaver, 1968</A>).  Until now, switchgrass has been bred
primarily to enhance its nutritional value as forage (<A HREF="#vogel">Vogel et
al., 1989</A>).  It has been managed primarily as a hay crop; its yields,
ranging from 4 to 17 t/ha (metric tons/ha), have averaged approximately 60 %
higher than the average yield on the 25 million ha harvested for hay (<A
HREF="#usda">U.S. Department of Agriculture, 1991b</A>).  Recent DOE research
on several switchgrass varieties (<A HREF="#mclaughlin">McLaughlin, 1992</A>)
focuses more on total biomass production than foliage composition.  This
research and the evaluation of better-adapted varieties has resulted in yields
on research plots in Alabama as high as 35 t/ha in a single year and an average
of 24 t/ha over five years (<A HREF="#sladden">Sladden et al., 1991</A>). 
During the latest test cycle, yields have averaged approximately 11 t/ha across
17 locations in the Midwest and Southeast for still-aggrading two-year-old
stands.  These yields were achieved without irrigation, without the annual
cultivation and planting cycle of annual crops, and with nitrogen and phosphorus
fertilizer applications that typically were only one-fourth to one-half those of
corn production.  New breeding activities underway in the BFDP are emphasizing
increased total biomass production and optimal leaf nutrient content.  Some
components, such as nitrogen and potassium, may reduce biomass conversion
efficiency.  We estimate that an annual yield of 11 to 22 t/ha could be achieved
with current varieties and production techniques in better growing regions.</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<H3><B>Economics</B></H3>
<P>
</P>
<P> The BFDP staff, economists at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, and others
have extensively researched the economics of switchgrass production and its
potential in the United States.  Production budgets are now being empirically
verified as DOE begins to fund large plantings of switchgrass for energy.</P>
<P>
</P>
<P> Expansion of ethanol production from its current level of 0.8 billion
gallons per year to one that will significantly reduce dependence on foreign oil
imports is anticipated to increase agricultural production and productivity and
provide additional income for farmers.  Thus it will have implications for
production of several crops.  Under the assumption that increased ethanol
production will be achieved using corn, USDA's Economic Research Service
estimated agricultural impacts for two scenarios: an increase to 2 billion
gallons by 1995; and an increase to 5 billion gallons by 2000.  In the first
scenario, corn area increases by 1.1 million ha and net farm income by $153
million; in the second, corn increases by 3.8 million ha and net farm income by
$1.6 billion.  Only the second scenario is projected to affect other
agricultural production significantly, including a loss of $550 million in
livestock production because of higher feed costs from the increased competition
for corn.</P>
<P>
</P>
<P> There will be important regional differences in the gains and losses from
meeting additional bioenergy needs solely with corn.  The main economic gains
will be in the major corn producing regions: the Corn Belt, the Lake States, and
parts of the Great Plains.  Cattle production losses will be spread more evenly
across all cattle producing states.  Thus, despite a national agricultural gain,
the southeastern and mid-Atlantic states will experience a net economic loss
that will be augmented by a loss of approximately 240,000 ha of soybean and
cotton because of shifts in grain production.</P>
<P>
</P>
<P> In contrast, a shift to perennial grasses could be achieved using land with
a much broader quality range.  This would have little effect on other crops and
would spread the benefits more evenly across the country.  The South, which
currently has a depressed agricultural economy, so far has the highest yields of
warm-season perennial grasses and would be among the most suitable areas for
biofuel production.</P>
<P>
</P>
<P> 	<I><B>Economic factors affecting commercial feasibility</B></I></P>
<P>
</P>
<P> Foody (<A HREF="#foody">1988</A>) noted that the technology for producing
ethanol from biomass was improving rapidly and that laboratory results were
approaching the limits of technical and economic feasibility.  Neat ethanol
could compete with gasoline in the current marketplace at an oil price of $20 to
$30 per barrel.  A successful demonstration of economically competitive ethanol
production would dramatically change the debate over energy-related
environmental problems.  Fuel ethanol's primary advantage is environmental, as
it burns much more cleanly than gasoline.  When derived from lignocellulosic
biomass, it is the only liquid transportation fuel that does not contribute to
the greenhouse effect (<A HREF="#foody">Foody, 1988</A>).</P>
<P>
</P>
<P> Many additional factors will affect its commercial feasibility.  Successful
development of enzymatic hydrolysis technology will be crucial.  The process for
making ethanol from lignocellulosic biomass involves seven major steps: biomass
production, pretreatment, enzyme production, enzymatic hydrolysis, fermentation,
distillation, and by-product processing. (For more on these steps, see
<A HREF="#foody">Foody, 1988</A>.) Since these processes are interdependent,
improving one may decrease the ability to make improvements in another. 
Finally, the ability to market by-products and co-products is crucial to the
economic viability of a commercial system (<A HREF="#international">International
Council on Agriculture, Science and Technology, 1994</A>).</P>
<P>
</P>
<P> 	<I><B>Conservation Reserve Program</B></I></P>
<P>
</P>
<P> The Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) was initiated under the Food
Security Act of 1985, largely to stabilize and improve soils degraded by
overcropping. Almost 15 million ha were idled by this law, primarily in the
Great Plains and Southeast.  Much of this land was replanted to perennial
grasses that were the principal species of the original prairie.  Predominant
species were big bluestem (<I>Andropogon gerardi </I>Vitman), Indian grass (<I>Sorghastrum
nutans </I>[L.] Nash), western wheatgrass (<I>Agropyron smithii</I> Rydb.) and
switchgrass.</P>
<P>
</P>
<P> CRP is at a critical point after 10 years of contracting with agricultural
producers.  Renewal or elimination options are currently being considered in the
1995 Farm Bill.  Critics see it as an unnecessary expense with questionable
benefits to taxpayers.  However, recent consideration of both the resource
conservation benefits of CRP and the cost of subsidies if these lands are
returned to annual crops, notably wheat, suggests that CRP represents a gain to
taxpayers.  An alternative to returning these lands to the very practices that
made CRP necessary would be to use them for energy crops that can both enhance
land quality and provide an economic return to landowners.  This possibility is
strengthened by the fact that the native perennial grasses planted under the CRP
also are excellent for production of liquid fuels.</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<H3><B>Environmental Considerations</B></H3>
<P>
</P>
<P> Perennial grasses grown under CRP conserve the soil and improve its
quality.  They also provide excellent protective cover and food for wildlife. 
The significant reduction in soil erosion is their most obvious advantage over
row crops such as corn.  Soil loss from annual cropping of erodible land can be
very high, resulting in the loss of valuable nutrients and the contamination of
adjoining areas and wetlands by sediments and chemicals.  Typically, soil loss
is several orders of magnitude greater with annual crops than with perennial
grasses (<A HREF="#shifflet">Shifflet and Darby, 1985</A>), especially during
heavy rains.</P>
<P>
</P>
<P> Loss of soil organic matter (SOM) also is greater with annual crops,
because it breaks down faster under tillage and because more SOM-rich topsoil is
removed by erosion (<A HREF="#buckman">Buckman and Brady, 1960</A>).  The
current loss of soil organic matter in the US through annual row cropping is
estimated at 2.7 million t per year (<A HREF="#council">Council for
Agriculture, Science, and Technology, 1992</A>).  This loss is important not
only because it equals 7.5 % of the total carbon released to the atmosphere by
combustion of fossil fuels, but because SOM is critical for soil productivity. 
The soil's moisture-holding capacity, density, aeration, and ability to supply
and conserve plant nutrients all are improved by SOM (<A HREF="#anderson">Anderson
and Coleman, 1985</A>).</P>
<P>
</P>
<P> Recent studies of the changes in SOM during five years of perennial grass
production on CRP lands indicate that perennial grasses added C at an annual
rate of 1.1 t/ha to the upper 100 cm of CRP soils (<A HREF="#gebhardt">Gebhardt
et al., in press</A>).  These additions replaced 23 % of the soil carbon that
was lost during decades of prior tillage.  The source of this carbon is the
large standing pool of roots, which can equal or exceed annual aboveground
production (<A HREF="#anderson">Anderson and Coleman, 1985</A>) and which turn
over rapidly.  Preliminary data from research on switchgrass grown for energy
indicate that belowground root mass is very high, totaling almost 8 t/ha just in
the top 75 cm (<A HREF="#bransby">Bransby et al., 1994</A>).  With Alamo
switchgrass (<I>P. virgatum </I>cv.  'Alamo'), over 1 t/ha was found just in
the interval 60-75 cm.</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<H3><B>Summary</B></H3>
<P>
</P>
<P> Perennial grass production for biofuels offers significant advantages for a
national energy strategy that considers both environmental and economic issues. 
The benefits of using a native prairie species such as switchgrass rather than
annual crops such as corn include: improved soil quality; reduced soil erosion
and associated water pollution; reduced emissions of greenhouse gases; increased
efficiency of land and energy use; and a more equitable distribution of economic
benefits to farmers.  To achieve these benefits in a timely manner will require
us to look beyond the short-term and consider not just the supply of municipal
wastes, crop residues and other wastes that can serve as feed-stocks for
industrial uses; we also should consider growing crops specifically for energy.</P>
<P>
</P>
<P> Our planning should include accelerated commercialization of both ethanol
conversion and grass-fired combustion systems.  We also should study the options
for maintaining landowner participation in a conservation reserve program that
achieves conservation objectives with reduced subsidies, and for involvement of
landowners in energy crop production.  The benefits of these strategies for the
economy and environment of the nation are too obvious to ignore.</P>

<H3><B>Introduction: The Role of Cellulosic Energy Crops</B></H3>
<P>
</P>
<P> This paper presents a broad overview of the potential environmental impacts
of biomass energy from energy crops, particularly the cellulosic energy crops
currently under development. We use the term <I>energy crop </I>to mean a crop
grown primarily to provide a feedstock for biofuels such as ethanol or to be
burned for heat or electricity. Energy crops currently in production include
corn (<I>Zea mays</I>), sugarcane (<I>Saccharum officinarum</I>), and
short-rotation plantations of poplar (<I>Populus </I>spp.), sycamore (<I>Platanus
occidentalis</I>) and eucalyptus (<I>Eucalyptus </I>spp.). We use <I>cellulosic
energy crop </I>to differentiate those grown for their cellulose content from
those grown for carbohydrates (starch or sugars), such as corn or sugarcane.
Cellulose and carbohydrates both can be converted to ethanol, but more cellulose
can be produced per unit land area than carbohydrates. Therefore,
cellulose-based ethanol production is a more efficient use of land.</P>
<P>
</P>
<P> Cellulosic energy crops currently under development in the U.S. include
switchgrass (<I>Panicum virgatum</I>) and short rotation woody crops,
especially poplar and willow (<I>Salix
</I>spp.). Switchgrass is a drought-tolerant prairie grass with an extensive
natural range in North America. It is the model herbaceous energy crop selected
by the U.S. Department of Energy and is well suited for cellulose-based ethanol
conversion (<A HREF="#wright">Wright et al., 1993</A>).  Cellulosic energy
crops also are appropriate for producing heat and electricity.</P>
<P>
</P>
<P> From the perspective of the farmer, energy crop production generally is
compatible with food crop production. Farmers most likely will use energy crops
as part of a mix of several crops. However, introducing them into the larger
farming scheme requires careful planning, because most cellulosic energy crops
are perennials, with stands lasting five to twenty years.</P>
<P>
</P>
<P> Assessing the environmental impacts of biomass energy from energy crops is
complex because two different kinds of impacts are involved: <I>using biomass
for energy </I>must be considered in the context of alternative energy options,
while the environmental impact of
<I>producing biomass from energy crops </I>must be considered in the context of
alternative land uses. Using biomass-derived energy can either reduce or
increase greenhouse gas emissions; growing biomass energy crops can enhance soil
fertility or degrade it. Therefore, one must know the specific circumstances to
be able to make a statement about the environmental impacts of biomass energy.
We focus on the environmental impacts of growing cellulosic energy crops,
especially its impacts on a landscape or regional scale.  However, we first
compare the environmental advantages and disadvantages of using biomass-derived
energy to those of other energy sources, including coal, gasoline, natural gas,
nuclear power, hydropower, and photovoltaics.</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<H3><B>Comparing Biomass Energy with Other Energy Sources</B></H3>
<P>
</P>
<P>
<B>Coal. </B>Biomass energy is most advantageous when compared with coal. Using
it to displace coal in power generation has the greatest benefit in reducing
greenhouse gases and air pollution. A recent analysis calculated that using the
wood from 1 ha of short rotation woody energy crops instead of coal would
displace 5.2 t (metric tons) of fossil C in CO<SUB>2</SUB> (<A HREF="#graham">Graham
et al., 1992</A>). Biomass burns cleanly, with much lower SO<SUB>x</SUB> and
somewhat lower NO<SUB>x</SUB> emissions. Two additional environmental benefits
come from the reduction in coal mining and the avoidance of coal ash disposal.
Wood combustion produces much less ash than does coal, and the ash can be
returned to agricultural soils.</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
<B>Gasoline. </B>Using biomass-derived ethanol to displace gasoline also has a
considerable greenhouse gas benefit, but it is much smaller than the benefit
when biomass displaces coal because gasoline has a much higher energy value per
unit of fossil carbon. The CO<SUB>2</SUB> benefit of using ethanol made from
cellulosic crops to displace gasoline is estimated to be about half as great as
when it displaces coal (<A HREF="#graham">Graham et al., 1992</A>). When the
ethanol is produced from a crop grown with large inputs of fossil fuel, such as
corn, the greenhouse gas saving may be very low; the current process of growing
corn and converting it to ethanol produces 0.6 to 0.8 units of CO<SUB>2</SUB>
for every unit of gasoline-CO<SUB>2</SUB> that is displaced (<A HREF="#marland">Marland
and Turhollow, 1991</A>). The low ratio is due to the heavy use of nitrogen
fertilizers and the use of fossil fuels (coal) in the conversion.</P>
<P>
</P>
<P> Ethanol has air pollution benefits over gasoline as an automobile fuel. It
emits less CO, SO<SUB>2</SUB>, and hydrocarbons, but slightly more NO<SUB>x</SUB>
(<A HREF="#graboski">Graboski, 1993</A>). It emits more aldehydes, but mostly
as acetaldehyde, which is less reactive and less toxic than the formaldehyde
produced by the combustion of gasoline (<A HREF="#macedo">Macedo, 1993</A>). In
general, ethanol emissions are less toxic than gasoline emissions (<A
HREF="#larovere">La Rovere and Audinet, 1993</A>). Compared with reformulated
gasoline to which oxygenates have been added, biomass derived ethanol has no air
pollution advantages or disadvantages other than the reduction in CO<SUB>2</SUB>
(<A HREF="#tyson">Tyson et al., 1993</A>).</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
<B>Natural gas. </B>The environmental advantages of displacing natural gas with
biomass derived electricity are less than for displacing coal, oil or gasoline.
Natural gas contains twice as much energy as coal per unit of carbon. Also,
natural gas power plants are more energy efficient than coal-fired plants (<A
HREF="#turhollow">Turhollow and Perlack, 1991</A>).</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
<B>Nuclear and renewable energy sources (hydro, wind, photovoltaics). </B>Biomass
energy has less of an environmental advantage when compared with
greenhouse-neutral energy types such as nuclear, wind, hydropower, and
photovoltaics. It releases some greenhouse gases, because fossil fuels are
likely to be used to produce energy crops (to power tractors, manufacture
fertilizers, etc.). Although biomass releases only 1/10th to 1/20th as much
greenhouse gases per unit of power as does coal, the emissions still are not
zero (<A HREF="#turhollow">Turhollow and Perlack, 1991</A>). However, biomass
energy avoids the safety and waste disposal problems of nuclear power. Also, it
does not impose the loss of land and the damage to fisheries that occur with
dams and hydropower.</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
<B>Land requirements. </B>Biomass energy's universal disadvantage is its high
land requirement.  An efficient biomass power plant (33 %) will require between
200 and 400 ha of land in energy crops per MW of baseload power, depending on
the biomass yield. Cellulose-to-ethanol technology is expected to require 150 to
300 ha per million liters of annual capacity, assuming moderate cellulosic
energy crop yields (10 to 20 dry t/ha); U.S. ethanol production from corn
requires close to 300 ha per million liters (<A HREF="#hohmann">Hohmann and
Rendleman, 1993</A>). It is important to quantify the environmental impacts of
major shifts in land use to grow energy crops. Shifting from current agriculture
to energy crops could change soil erosion patterns, water quality of regional
streams, wildlife populations, and regional air quality. Characterizing these
impacts is challenging because they depend on many site- and crop-specific
factors.</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<H3><B>Factors Determining the Environmental Impacts of Energy Crop Production</B></H3>
<P>
</P>
<P> 	<B><I>Crop Factors</I></B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P> The type of crop grown is a decisive variable in predicting environmental
impacts from energy crop production; crops have different effects on erosion,
water availability and quality, wildlife habitat, and air quality. For example,
growing corn is likely to cause more soil erosion and use more fertilizers than
growing short rotation poplar. However, because trees use more water than
herbaceous crops, they may reduce stream flow. Wildlife will differentiate among
crop types; for example, tree crops can provide habitat for forest bird species
(<A HREF="#wright">Wright et al., 1993</A>; <A HREF="#hoffman">Hoffman et al.,
1995</A>; <A HREF="#tolbert">Tolbert and Schiller, 1996</A>). Perennial grasses
enhance soil carbon more than do annual crops. Tree crops release more
hydrocarbons into the air than do herbaceous crops (<A HREF="#perlack">Perlack
et al., 1992</A>).</P>
<P>
</P>
<P> How the crop is managed also is important (<A HREF="#cook">Cook et al.,
1991</A>). Interplanting a cover crop between trees early in short-rotation
woody crop production is likely to reduce erosion compared with leaving the soil
bare. The types and amounts of pesticides and fertilizers applied and the timing
of applications will affect water quality. Harvesting trees during the winter
reduces the loss of nutrients from the site because the leaves are not removed. 
Burning crop residues in the field, as is done with sugarcane, can harm air
quality locally and regionally (<A HREF="#larovere">La Rovere and Audinet, 1993</A>).</P>
<P>
</P>
<P> 	<I><B>Site factors</B></I></P>
<P>
</P>
<P> Physical characteristics of the land will strongly influence the
productivity of energy crops and therefore the likelihood that they will be
grown (<A HREF="#liu">Liu et al., 1992; 1993</A>). Soil type, climate, and
topography will affect erosion and runoff (<A HREF="#ota">Office of Technology
Assessment, 1993</A>; <A HREF="#hoffman">Hoffman et al., 1995</A>;
<A HREF="#tolbert">Tolbert and Schiller, 1996</A>). Soil type also will
influence the need for fertilizers and the rate at which pesticides and
fertilizers leach to groundwater. A high organic matter content increases the
soil's retention of pesticides and nutrients. In a warmer climate, pesticides
break down and volatilize more rapidly.</P>
<P>
</P>
<P> The previous use of the land is an especially important consideration when
developing policies to promote or discourage energy crops. The difference
between the environmental effects of the former land use and of the energy crop
determines the environmental value of the energy crop. For example, growing
switchgrass rather than soybeans (<I>Glycine max</I>) has many environmental
advantages. Compared with soybeans, switchgrass will increase soil carbon,
reduce erosion, improve water quality, and provide better animal habitat.  Thus,
a policy that encouraged the production of switchgrass on former soybean land
would have environmental benefits, but a policy that encouraged conversion of
forests to switchgrass would be environmentally damaging. Valuable forest
habitat would be lost and water quality would likely be degraded.</P>
<P>
</P>
<P> Finally, the location of the energy crops in relation to other land uses
will strongly influence water quality and wildlife impacts. Perennial energy
crops such as trees or grasses that receive low levels of fertilizers or
pesticides can serve as filters if planted along streams. These crops can absorb
nutrients coming from more heavily fertilized conventional crops upslope and can
catch sediment as it moves downslope. Both actions can improve local water
quality (<A HREF="#ranney">Ranney and Mann, 1994</A>). If streamside planting
is extensive and nonpoint-source pollution from agriculture is a regional
problem, perennial energy crops could improve regional water quality (<A
HREF="#ota">Office of Technology Assessment, 1993</A>). Planting energy crops
on a small amount of land adjacent to streams could have a much larger influence
on water quality than planting two or three times as much land upslope.</P>
<P>
</P>
<P> If planted in a landscape dominated by annual crops, energy crops may
enhance regional and local wildlife. In particular, woody energy crops add
structural diversity to agricultural landscapes, which should enhance
biodiversity on a regional scale.  Measurements of abundance, type, and number
of bird species have shown that woody crops can serve some of the habitat
functions of natural forests (<A HREF="#ota">Office of Technology Assessment,
1993</A>;
<A HREF="#wright">Wright et al., 1993</A>; <A HREF="#hoffman">Hoffman et al.,
1995</A>). However, woody energy crops are not a substitute for natural forests
(<A HREF="#cook">Cook et al., 1991</A>; <A HREF="#tolbert">Tolbert and
Schiller, 1996</A>).  Producing energy crops can harm wildlife if the crops
displace a food source in the original land use. For example, birds migrating
from Canada to Mexico and South America use the corn left in the fields of the
Midwestern U.S. If switchgrass displaced large areas of corn in this region,
this food source would disappear, with no obvious replacement.</P>
<P>
</P>
<P> 	<I><B>Quantity of land dedicated to energy crops</B></I></P>
<P>
</P>
<P> Clearly, the more land converted to energy crops, the greater their
regional impact.  However, their impact cannot simply be assumed to be
proportional to the amount of land planted to them, particularly for wildlife
and water quality impacts. Even an impact such as erosion, which can be
calculated on a per hectare basis and does not depend on land use changes
elsewhere, will not simply be proportional to the amount of land planted to
energy crops in a region, because soil type, topography, and former land use all
will vary within the region (<A HREF="#graham">Graham and Downing, 1993</A>).</P>
<P>
</P>
<P> 	<B><I>Interactions among factors</I></B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P> These factors cannot be considered in isolation, because they interact
strongly in affecting the environment. For example, soil, climate, topography,
crop type, and crop management all will affect energy crop productivity and
therefore the quantity of land needed to produce a specific supply. Even former
land use by itself can affect energy crop productivity. For example, soil
compaction as a result of pasture use may reduce expected energy crop yields.
Assessing the potential environmental impacts of energy crop production requires
an integrated approach that considers all these factors. To be successful,
however, the approach must also include the economic forces and policies that
will control where energy crops will be grown and what land uses they will
displace.</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<H3><B>Quantitatively Predicting Environmental Impacts</B></H3>
<P>
</P>
<P> It is difficult to predict quantitatively the environmental impacts of
cellulosic energy crop development on a landscape or regional scale because most
cellulosic crops are not yet planted in regionally significant amounts. Thus,
the necessary empirical information on environmental impacts is lacking and a
modeling approach is needed to predict the effects these crops might have if
planted on the scale of a major crop such as corn, or even a less important crop
such as barley (<I>Hordeum vulgare</I>) or oats (<I>Avena saliva</I>). We have
developed a six-stage modeling approach for assessing regional or landscape
scale environmental impacts. It includes economic considerations, since
economics will determine where energy crops are profitable, what conventional
crops they will displace, and what management regimes will be used to produce
them. After briefly outlining the approach, we present some results on the
environmental consequences of growing switchgrass to supply bioenergy conversion
facilities in North Dakota and Tennessee.</P>
<OL>
<LI><I>Characterizing the region. </I>In the first stage, we characterize the
region's climate, topography, soil quality, and the types, location, management
practices and profitability of current land use. If possible, we determine the
relationship between profit and soil type. Understanding this relationship
greatly improves the projections of where energy crops will be grown.</LI>
<LI><I>Developing energy crop management scenarios and production costs. </I>In
the second stage we determine management practices for energy crops and estimate
production costs. This determination is based in part on our characterization of
the region. Some energy crops are more appropriate for certain soils and
climates than others.</LI>
<LI><I>Modeling crop yields and on-site environmental impacts. </I>The third
stage predicts variations in crop yield associated with soils and climates. It
also predicts crop-specific, on-site environmental parameters such as erosion,
runoff, and losses of nutrients and pesticide. This stage uses EPIC (Erosion
Productivity Impact Calculator), a crop simulation model developed by the U.S.
Department of Agriculture (<A HREF="#williams">Williams et al., 1989</A>). The
model is sensitive to many factors that control regional environmental impacts:
soil type, topography, climate, crop type, and crop management. The model can
predict not only crop yield but also the rates of erosion, runoff, and nitrogen
and phosphorus losses in runoff or groundwater, all as functions of climate,
soil, and topography. Changes in the environmental values associated with
switching land to a specific energy crop can easily be calculated with EPIC. The
crop yield information provided by EPIC is combined with empirical crop yield
information to predict variations in yield associated with different soil and
climate conditions.
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P></LI>
<LI><I>Calculating probable farmgate biomass price. </I>Using information
generated in Stage 1 on the profitability of conventional crops and information
on energy crop yields and production costs, we next calculate the price of
biomass at the farm that gives the farmer the same profit as conventional crops.
It does not include the cost of transporting the biomass to where it will be
used. The break-even farmgate price is used to identify the lands most likely to
be converted to energy crop production.
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P></LI>
<LI><I>Determining where land use change will occur. </I>In the fifth stage we
predict land use changes, assuming that with transportation costs to the
conversion facility being equal, land with the lowest farmgate price for biomass
crops will be converted first, since it will produce the least expensive biomass
for a conversion facility.
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P></LI>
<LI><I>Evaluating environmental impacts. </I>Regional impacts on soil
fertility, water quality, and air quality largely depend on how much and what
type of land is converted.  They can be calculated by linking the environmental
impacts per hectare determined in Stage 3 to the land-use changes predicted in
Stage 5. Regional wildlife impacts depend not only on how much and what type of
land is converted, but also on the location of that land in relation to other
land uses. To evaluate these impacts, one must create maps of the changes in
landscape pattern created by the projected land use changes. These maps are then
used as inputs to spatial models of animal behavior and habitat to examine
wildlife impacts. Effects on regional water quality depend on how much and what
type of land is converted, where it is in relation to other land, and the
topographic position of the land in relation to streams and lakes.  Besides
mapping projected land use changes associated with biomass production, one must
also link those maps with topographic maps of the same area. Water quality
models such as AGNPS (Agricultural NonPoint Source pollution), which predicts
stream water quantity and quality as a function of topography, climate and land
use pattern (<A HREF="#engel">Engel et al., 1993</A>), can then be used to
predict regional impacts on water quality.

<P>Some results from two environmental analyses using this six-stage approach
are shown in Fig. 1. Figs. 1a and 1b show the predicted impacts on regional soil
erosion and nitrate loss from growing switchgrass for a hypothetical biomass
energy facility near Fargo, North Dakota (<A HREF="#english">English et al.,
1993</A>). The figures were created by comparing the expected water erosion and
nitrate loss in runoff under two scenarios: 1) only conventional crops (wheat,
oats, barley) are grown on all cropland within 50 km of the facility; 2) this
land also produced switchgrass to supply an energy facility needing varying
amounts of biomass (1,000 to 10,000 t/day). The corresponding land requirement
ranged from 47,000 to 320,000 ha. Switchgrass production is predicted to reduce
soil nitrate loss and water erosion in this region but the absolute amounts are
low because the land is flat and rainfall is low.</P>
<P></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><IMG ALIGN="TOP" SRC="celcr1c.gif" ALT="Graph 1c">
<IMG ALIGN="TOP" SRC="celcr1d.gif" ALT="Graph 1d"></P>
<P>Figs. 1c and 1d show some results from an analysis of the regional
implications of growing switchgrass in two multi-county areas in Tennessee, one
centered in Memphis, the other in Nashville (<A HREF="#graham">Graham and
Downing, 1993</A>). Converting 20% of the cropland in each region to switchgrass
is predicted to reduce regional erosion by almost 20% (Fig. 1c). The absolute
reduction in erosion is predicted to be greater in the Memphis region because of
its significantly higher initial erosion rates. Increased switchgrass production
reduces nitrate losses in both regions. Because of high predicted nitrate losses
from soybeans, the benefits of producing switchgrass are higher in the Memphis
region because of the greater displacement of soybean in that area (Fig. 1d).
Thus, conversion of 20% of the cropland to switchgrass production is predicted
to reduce regional nitrate loss in runoff by almost 20% in the Memphis region,
but by only 10% in the Nashville region.</P>
<P>
</P>
<P> The results illustrate the potential environmental benefits of switchgrass
production, but also emphasize the regional differences that may be expected.
Biomass energy crops have many environmental benefits if they are well managed
and well suited to the site; however, they are not universally advantageous. The
government faces a serious challenge in developing policies and regulations that
take advantage of the potential environmental benefits of energy crops and
minimize their potential negative impacts. The value of the environmental
benefits needs to be quantified and incorporated in cost comparisons between
biomass and other energy sources.</P>

<H3>Abstract</H3></CENTER>
<P> Increasing from research-scale to larger-scale plantings of herbaceous and
short rotation woody crops on agricultural land in the United States has raised
questions about the positive and negative environmental effects of farmland
conversion.  Research currently underway at experimental plot scales enables us
examine runoff quality and quantity, erosion, and changes in soil
characteristics associated with these energy crops compared to conventional row
crops.  A study of the fate of chemicals applied to the different crop types
will enhance our knowledge of uptake, release, and off-site movement of
nutrients and pesticides.  Ongoing biodiversity studies in the North Central
U.S. allow us to compare differences in scale of plantings on bird and small
mammal populations and habitat use.  Plantings of 50-100 or more contiguous
acres are needed to allow both researchers and producers to determine the
benefits of including temporal energy crop rotations in the landscape.  Results
from these larger-scale plantings will help identify 1) the monitoring
requirements needed to determine environmental effects of larger-scale
plantings, 2) the best methods to determine the environmental effects of
rotation length and the best crop management strategies for full-scale
production.  Because of the variations in soils, temperature, rainfall and other
climatic conditions, as well as differences in the types of energy crops most
suited for different regions, monitoring of large-scale plantings in these
different regions of the U.S. will be required to predict the environmental
effects of regional agricultural land-use shifts for full-scale plantings.</P>
<CENTER>
<H3>Introduction</H3></CENTER>
<P> Biomass has the potential to provide significant sources of energy and
fiber in selected regions of the country while providing both economic and
environmental benefits to the agricultural community.  To achieve large scale
biomass production, tens of millions of hectares of primarily agricultural land
will have to be converted to produce large amounts of biomass feedstocks (<A
HREF="#ranney">Ranney and Mann 1994</A>). Because of the variability in
climate, soils, and biomass crops that could contribute to large scale biomass
production , the environmental effects of converting a broad land base to
support biomass production cannot be easily generalized.</P>
<P> Over the past fifteen years, development of both short-rotation woody crops
and herbaceous energy crops has moved from small-scale [&lt; 4 ha (&lt; 10
acres)] research plantings of multiple clonal trials per acre to recent
demonstration plantings of several hundred acres.  Initial studies of the
small-scale plantings of these crops indicate that energy crops can provide
environmental benefits (e.g., soil conservation, increased biodiversity, and
reduced fertilizer runoff) while improving farm income (<A HREF="#wright">Wright
et al. 1992</A>).  Currently available information shows that the environmental
effects from conversion of crop land to biomass production may range from
negative effects of erosion, habitat destruction, and nutrient runoff during
initial site preparation and establishment (<A HREF="#hughes">Hughes and Ranney
1993</A>) to positive effects from decreased long-term erosion, reduced nutrient
requirements, increased wildlife habitat, and increased soil stability.</P>
<P> Recent large-scale plantings of switchgrass and hybrid poplar are providing
research sites to address the environmental effects of land conversion from
traditional row crops and grasslands to dedicated biomass crops at larger
scales.  Data from these large-scale plantings can be used to determine the
accuracy of conclusions drawn from research level plantings of both switchgrass
and poplars. Research on genetic improvements of hybrid poplar in the Pacific
northwest has lead from small-scale clonal trials (<A HREF="#heilman">Heilman
et al. 1990</A>) to commercial plantings of thousands of acres of hybrid poplar
clones in this area; these plantings are serving as fiber sources for the pulp
and paper industry in this region.  Deployment of new switchgrass clones in
additional large-scale plantings can increase production for both warm-season
forage and biomass sources over broad regions of the U.S. (<A HREF="#mclaughlin">McLaughlin
et al. 1994</A>). </P>
<P> Moving from research on small experimental plots to large-scale
demonstration plantings allows the Biofuels Feedstock Development Program (BFDP)
to address questions of scale relative to environmental effects of energy crop
production.  Currently, data do not exist to determine the accuracy of
predictions of the environmental effects of commercial-scale production of
biomass crops based on studies of small-scale research plantings.  Application
of these results to commercial production may not accurately guide crop
deployment to maximize environmental benefits. The potential environmental
effects being addressed for both short-rotation woody crops and herbaceous
energy crops compared to traditional row crops include soil characteristics,
erosion, surface and groundwater movement, nutrient requirements, and use of
biomass plantings by wildlife.  Larger-scale plantings allow validation of
research results from region-specific small-scale trials. The information
derived from these large-scale plantings can facilitate address of potential
effects of wide-spread deployment of biomass plantings as sources of both energy
and fiber.</P>
<CENTER>
<H3>Discussion</H3></CENTER>
<P>Over the past 15 years, research supported by the BFDP has addressed a
number of environmental changes that would be expected to occur with conversion
from traditional agricultural crops to biomass crops (<A HREF="#wright">Wright
et al. 1992</A>). Most of these studies have been associated with conversion of
agricultural lands to tree crop production and have occurred on small-scale
research sites in the Pacific Northwest and the north-central and northeastern
states. Many of the studies were designed to address the viability and growth of
various poplar clones on homogeneous soils and at close spacings and do not
accurately reflect the responses to environmental factors that would be expected
to occur with a variety of soil types and under a variety of environmental
conditions (<A HREF="#hansen91">Hansen 1991</A>).   In addition, these
small-scale plantings do not allow adequate characterization of environmental
changes (e.g., soil carbon, soil composition, and nutrient availability) that
would be expected to occur on sites converted from traditional agricultural
crops to either switchgrass or trees.</P>
<P> Studies of small-scale plantings of hybrid poplar in the north-central
states (<A HREF="#hansen93">Hansen 1993</A>) showed that over time trees grown
on tilled agricultural lands previously in prairie sequestered significant
quantities of soil carbon compared to row crops and grasslands.  Early soil
carbon loss was found to occur during establishing and tending poplar plantings
over the first 2-3 years because of initial erosion and soil exposure but with
canopy closure and increased tree age (6-12 years) a net addition of soil carbon
was found to occur beneath the plantings (<A HREF="#hansen93">Hansen 1993</A>).
  Soil carbon loss occurred primarily from the top 30 cm of the soil horizon as
the result of mineralization. Increases in soil carbon with tree age was most
significant at a depth of 30-50 cm; the depth with the greatest root development
(<A HREF="#hansen93">Hansen 1993</A>).</P>
<P> Two thousand acres of demonstration plantings of hybrid poplar were
established in 1994 and 1995 within 80 km (50 mi) of Alexandria, Minnesota. 
These large-scale planting [12 to 120 ha (30 to 300 acres)] (<A HREF="#kroll">Kroll
and Downing 1995</A>) provide the opportunity to address questions of scale and
logistics of planting and maintenance on a variety of soils and under different
environmental conditions. These plantings also provide the opportunity to
address environmental questions of soil changes, nutrient requirements, and
changes in biodiversity with conversion from agricultural land use to long-term
perennial crops at a larger scale for comparison with data from small-scale
research sites. For example, studies have been initiated on the large-scale
plantings to quantify soil carbon changes over time for comparison with results
of the earlier studies of small-scale research sites in the area (<A
HREF="#hansen93">Hansen 1993</A>). These studies will allow researchers to
determine if there are clonal differences and scale differences in the amount
and timing of soil carbon sequestration beneath poplar plantings.</P>
<P> Studies of soil nutrients have shown that with cultivation and cropping of
annual crops nutrient loss occurs from denitrification, leaching, accelerated
erosion, and nutrient removals at harvest (<A HREF="#heilman">Heilman 1992</A>).
 The addition of significant quantities of organic matter to soils by prolific
rooting systems of perennial grasses have been shown to improve soil structure,
increase water-holding capacity and infiltration through structural and porosity
changes, improve nutrient conservation and availability, and decrease soil
erosion. Switchgrass varieties have been found by Parrish et al. (1990) to add
significant quantities of organic matter to soils following row crops.  Bransby
et al. (1994) found that as much as 8 metric tons of organic matter were added
to the upper 75 cm of southeastern soils. Switchgrass has been found to provide
environmental benefits by requiring approximately half the nitrogen of a
representative agricultural crop (corn) as well as normally requiring herbicide
application only during the establishment year (<A HREF="#mclaughlin">McLaughlin
et al. 1994</A>).  Using fertilizer application rates, crop nutrient use, land
quality, and erosion models, Graham and Downing (<A HREF="#graham">1995</A>)
projected that conversion of row crops to switchgrass improved water quality
associated with both reduced contributions to groundwater and reduced soil
erosion and evapotranspiration.</P>
<P> The Department of Energy through the BFDP began studies in 1995 to develop
the initial comprehensive data on the fate of chemicals applied to herbaceous
crops and tree crops both with and without cover crops for comparison with a
traditional agricultural crop.    These studies, one conducted in Minnesota; the
other in Alabama as part of a three state southeastern project directed by the
Tennessee Valley Authority will quantify movement of nutrients and herbicides
applied to energy crops into the soil and groundwater beneath research-scale
sites.  The southeastern study is also addressing the volume and chemical
composition of surface water runoff from switchgrass, corn, and tree crop
plantings (0.5 and 1 acre bermed sites) with and without a ground cover to
quantify erosion and nutrient movement above ground as well as through the soil.
These research projects will provide information on uptake, release, and
off-site movement of nutrients and pesticides and will help predict the
hydrologic and environmental pathways of chemicals applied to energy crops and
the long-term effects of energy crop systems on the environment. The data on
surface water movement will be used by ongoing efforts by the BFDP to model
surface water movement at a watershed scale.</P>
<P> Energy crops offer opportunities to increase biodiversity in agricultural
landscapes, particularly in areas where forest and prairie grassland
fragmentation is extensive.  How large a role these crops can play has been an
area of active research on small-scale plantings since 1992.  Bird and small
mammal use of small-scale plantings in the North-Central U.S. (<A
HREF="#christian">Christian et al. 1994</A>) has shown that use of young
plantings (1-3 years) by small mammals is more similar to grassland than to
forest habitat.  The number of individuals, species, long-distance migrants, and
permanent residents were higher in forest and shrub habitats adjacent to
plantings than they were in the actual plantings but were more abundant in
plantings than in non-hay crops (<A HREF="#hanowski">Hanowski et al. 1994</A>).
 National Audubon Society surveys of poplar plantings in the Pacific northwest
and Ontario and switchgrass plantings in Iowa determined that short-rotation
tree plantations support large populations of some birds, but not all of the
species that are using the surrounding landscape (<A HREF="#hoffman">Hoffman et
al. 1993</A>).  Hoffman also determined that plantations are used to different
extents by bird species during different seasons.  Christian et al. (<A
HREF="#christian">1994</A>) and Hoffman et al. (<A HREF="#hoffman">1993</A>)
concluded that short-rotation plantations can benefit regional biodiversity if
they are planted as buffers for natural forests or as corridors connecting
forest tracts.  Both research groups concluded that interior habitat is
increased by including some heterogeneous vegetation within the plantations.</P>
<P> The Audubon Society surveys of switchgrass plantings in Iowa showed that
these plantings provided significant habitat for several prairie specialist
birds (e.g., Sedge Wren, Dickcissel, and Grasshopper Sparrow) (<A HREF="#beyea">Beyea
et al. 1995</A>). This habitat availability is particularly important for those
midwestern species which have seen significantly reductions in prairie
grasslands as the result of extensive conversion of prairie to agricultural
lands.  Surveys showed that use of the switchgrass fields by these prairie
species occurred relatively late in the overall nesting season, probably in
response to the seasonal growth patterns of this warm-season grass.  Sedge Wrens
were found to be most numerous in the purest, densest stands, while Grasshopper
Sparrows tended to use more weedy areas.  Continued studies of use of
large-scale plantings of switchgrass by prairie species will address the
deployment, maintenance, and harvesting of this energy crop to provide a biomass
source while enhancing habitat for wildlife.</P>
<P> Biodiversity research in Minnesota is moving from the small-scale plantings
of a few acres to the large-scale sites planted in 1994 and 1995.  These
large-scale plantings are allowing researchers to address the effects of land
use change on the biodiversity of birds and small mammals at a larger scale
starting with the first year of establishment compared to the existing sites for
the small-scale studies of diversity.  The ongoing biodiversity studies are
addressing changes in use of the large-scale plantings by birds and small
mammals as the plantations mature and go from open canopy (1-5 years ) with
varying amounts of ground cover compared to those with closed canopy (6-8 years)
and a limited ground cover.  The Minnesota study of the large-scale plantings is
addressing how size of the plantings can effect nest predation and how plantings
can be used to maximize habitat for interior species.   Additional studies of
these large-scale plantings are addressing whether food source plantings in or
adjacent to planting sites can enhance habitat and increase biodiversity and how
adjacent land use (e.g., row crops, grasslands, or wooded areas) effects
biodiversity. </P>
<P> Studies of both large-scale switchgrass and poplar plantings are addressing
questions of planting design and location within a landscape context to increase
connectedness between fragmented grassland or woodland habitat, respectively.
These studies are examining how the size and shape of plantings and their
location within the existing landscape, i.e., adjacent to existing grassland or
woodland habitat, effect habitat availability and planting use by wildlife
species. </P>
<P> Information from the studies of large-scale plantings will be compared with
the results from the small-scale sites to determine the effects of scale on the
ability to most accurately predict the environmental effects of converting
potentially scattered planting sites to biomass production. The results of these
comparisons of scale can inform how to best design large scale plantings to
maximize both economic and environmental benefits.</P>
<CENTER>
<H3>Conclusions</H3></CENTER>
<P>Environmental research on small-scale plantings funded through the BFDP has
shown that there are significant environmental benefits of biomass crop
production that can contribute to the economic viability of biomass energy crops
and diversification of agricultural communities.  Based on the small-scale
studies, biomass crops, particularly those grown on the more erodible
agricultural lands, have been shown to provide greater soil stability, increased
nutrient retention and soil organic matter, and greater habitat diversity for
wildlife.  Expanding environmental studies to large-scale plantings is enabling
the BFDP to develop the data necessary to address questions of scale as biomass
production moves from research to demonstration to commercialization scale. 
Conversion of agricultural lands to energy crop production is being closely
monitored to determine the environmental effects and benefits of production. 
The data from these larger-scale studies will be used to predict the
environmental effects of commercial-scale plantings of switchgrass and hybrid
poplar and to develop the best crop management strategies to enhance the
environmental benefits from biomass crop production.   The results of the
larger-scale studies occurring primarily in the midwest and northcentral states
can provide initial guidance in determining potential environmental effects of
conversion of agricultural lands to biomass production in other regions of the
U.S.  Addressing these questions in regions of the U.S. that have the greatest
potential for biomass crop production and use can help determine the best
measures to deploy and manage commercial-scale plantings to achieve regional
environmental benefits.</P>

<H3><B>Introduction: Alternative Energy Sources</B></H3>
<P>
</P>
<P> Short-rotation woody crops (SRWC) and herbaceous crops (perennial grasses)
are receiving increasing interest as potential alternative energy sources that
also can provide extensive environmental benefits.  These benefits can be viewed
as occurring on a scale ranging from global (reductions in greenhouse gases) to
a specific site (decreases in erosion and the need for chemicals compared with
traditional row crops).  When grown as biomass feedstocks, these woody and
herbaceous crops can be significant sources of energy and fiber in some regions
of the country.  Besides offering an alternative energy resource, they can
provide crop diversity and both economic and environmental benefits to local
agricultural communities.  The potential environmental benefits of
short-rotation woody crops and herbaceous energy crops compared with traditional
row crops include improved soil quality and stability (reduced erosion), cover
for wildlife, and lower inputs of energy, water, and agrochemicals (<A
HREF="#mclaughlin">McLaughlin, 1992</A>; <A HREF="#wright">Wright et al., 1993</A>;
<A HREF="#tolbert">Tolbert and Downing, 1995</A>).</P>
<P>
</P>
<P> The need to reduce national dependence on imported oil and the opportunity
to develop the nation's potential to produce high-yielding biomass energy crops
have prompted significant research on both the agricultural production and
energy conversion technologies necessary to achieve this potential (<A
HREF="#lynd">Lynd et al., 1991</A>; <A HREF="#wright">Wright, 1994</A>).  To
meet projected energy needs using biomass feedstocks could require tens of
millions of hectares of primarily agricultural land to supply fuel for
electrical generating facilities and for conversion to liquid fuels and
chemicals (<A HREF="#ranney">Ranney and Mann, 1994</A>).  Of the 74 million ha
of cropland that were projected in 1994 as not required to meet U.S.
agricultural needs to the year 2030, only 16 million ha were in regions
determined to be well suited for energy crop cultivation (<A HREF="#graham">Graham,
1994</A>).  An estimated 8 to 16 million ha of this cropland could be converted
to biomass production in the near future without displacing traditional row
crops in any significant way.  Energy crop production could extend beyond this
16 million ha without significantly displacing other crops if the additional
land is drawn from pastureland or former cropland currently in long-term
set-aside programs (<A HREF="#hohenstein">Hohenstein and Wright, 1994</A>).</P>
<P>
</P>
<P> Woody and herbaceous biomass crops are not seen as competing for land with
traditional row crops such as corn and soybeans.  Rather, they are perennial
crops that can be grown on more marginal lands where erosion is a problem, where
soil stabilization is needed, or where the economic returns to the farmer's
labor and capital are low.  Once established, maintaining perennial biomass
crops requires little input of labor or resources compared with annual cycles of
planting and harvesting of traditional row crops.</P>
<P>
</P>
<P> Traditional agricultural crops need good quality soils that are easy to
work and that have adequate water and nutrient availability to produce high
yields and a satisfactory profit for the farmer.  Because market forces and
farmers' economic needs drive how much of each crop is planted, agricultural
production may extend onto marginal sites to meet these needs.  Agricultural
production on these more marginal, erosive sites harms the environment.  In
meeting the need for food, fiber and fuel, agriculture inevitably will affect
the very resources that it relies on for productivity and profitability.  With
the need for alternative fuel feedstocks, biomass crops may become an
economically competitive option for many farmers in the future.  Whether this
will happen is not yet known (<A HREF="#walsh">Walsh, 1995</A>); it will depend
on economics, public acceptance, and other factors that are not included in this
address of the environmental effects of crop production.  State and federal
support and commitments by utilities to purchase biomass feedstocks may be
required initially to encourage production of these crops and to offer growers a
reasonable economic return.</P>
<P>
</P>
<P> This paper focuses on three areas in which biomass crops may provide
environmental benefits while providing income to farmers and agricultural
communities: soil loss, water quality, and native wildlife habitat.  We
highlight physical and management differences between traditional row crops and
biomass crops and the ways that the latter may be environmentally preferable to
row crops.  We also present some results from research supported by the Biofuels
Feedstock Development Program (BFPD) at Oak Ridge National Laboratory to
quantify the potential environmental benefits of biomass crop production.</P>

<P>
</P>
<P> Perennial grass crops potentially can provide farm income as both energy
feedstocks and forages (<A HREF="#mclaughlin">McLaughlin et al., 1994</A>).  An
example is switchgrass (<I>Panicum virgatum</I>), a sod-forming, warm-season
grass that was an important component of the native North American tallgrass
prairie.  After evaluating yield and agronomic data on 34 herbaceous species,
BFDP selected switchgrass for further research and development as a primary
bioenergy candidate.  This choice was based on its high yields and excellent
versatility in early field trials and its many positive environmental
attributes.</P>
<P>
</P>
<P> Switchgrass has the economic advantage that it can be harvested using
traditional agricultural equipment to produce large round bales that can either
be stored on-site until needed or transferred directly to conversion facilities
following harvest.  Depending on the region and the time of harvest, farmers may
be able to get a second growth for use as forage for livestock.  Switchgrass and
other native prairie grasses have become increasingly important as forage
grasses, particularly in the Midwest, because of their ability to grow during
hot summer months when water availability can limit growth of most other species
(<A HREF="#moser">Moser and Vogel, 1995</A>).</P>
<P>
</P>
<P> Because of its extensive rooting system, switchgrass provides environmental
advantages such as increased soil organic matter, soil stability, and lower
requirements for energy, water, and agrochemicals compared with traditional row
crops (<A HREF="#mclaughlin">McLaughlin, 1992</A>).  Its extensive rooting
system increases the efficiency of nutrient and water uptake and provides strong
energy storage reserves that contribute to more stable yields during stress
years.  The extensive rooting system of switchgrass reduces soil erosion and
enhances nutrient storage and availability.  This increases the plant's ability
to persist for a number of years without the annual replanting cycle and soil
and nutrient losses associated with annual row crops.  These attributes make
perennial grasses valuable for reclaiming marginally productive sites that have
been degraded by erosion and soil depletion (<A HREF="#aguilar">Aguilar et al.,
1988</A>).</P>
<P>
</P>
<P> 	<B><I>Short-rotation woody crops</I></B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P> One hundred twenty-five tree species have been examined at various levels
of detail by the BFDP since 1978 to identify those with the greatest potential
for rapid growth, wide adaptability, and resistance to insect pests and
diseases.  To date, the species with the greatest potential for extensive
development are poplar (<I>Populus </I>spp.), willow (<I>Salix</I> spp.),
sweetgum (<I>Liquidambar styraciflua</I>), sycamore (<I>Platanus occidentalis</I>),
and maple (<I>Acer
</I>spp.) (<A HREF="#wright">Wright, 1994</A>).  Experimental yields of SRWC
have been 2 to 5 times those currently obtained in natural forest stands and
conifer pulpwood plantations in the United States.  The increased yields of
these tree species are the result of good matching of species to site, careful
establishment techniques, use of improved clones or carefully selected
seedlings, and recognition of the importance of weed control until the canopy
closes (<A HREF="#wright">Wright, 1994</A>).  Methods for establishing SRWC are
the same as for most other agricultural crops, although no-till establishment
has not been effective because weeds must be removed and any underlying hardpan
must be broken for maximum root penetration.  Wright (<A HREF="#wright">1994</A>)
provides more detailed information on site establishment, maintenance, and
harvesting needs for SRWCs.  A possible obstacle to production of woody crops is
the need for traditional forest harvesting equipment that may not be readily
available to agricultural growers.</P>
<P>
</P>
<P> Studies of small-scale plantings of hybrid poplar in the North Central
states have shown that over time, trees grown on tilled agricultural lands that
previously were in prairie grasses sequestered significant quantities of soil
carbon as organic matter (<A HREF="#hansen">Hansen, 1993</A>).  Unlike
perennial grasses, which can cover the soil surface in one to two years, tree
crops continue to leave most of the soil surface exposed (assuming weeds are
controlled or removed) until the canopy closes in three to five years after
establishment.  Until then, soil erosion and loss of organic matter continue,
although losses are less than with annual crops.  Once the tree canopy has
closed, weed control no longer is required because there is little light
penetration and weed growth, consequently, is low.  Fertilization requirements
for SRWC depend on soil type and fertility.  Studies are currently being
conducted by the BFDP to determine fertilization and irrigation requirements of
hybrid poplars in the Pacific Northwest and of sweetgum, sycamore, and
cottonwood (<I>Populus deltoides</I>) clones in the Southeast to maximize yield
while limiting production costs.</P>

<H3><B>Environmental Enhancement Using Biomass Crops</B></H3>
<P>
</P>
<P> The BFDP's environmental research task currently supports several studies
to help determine the environmental effects of converting agricultural lands to
biomass crop production.  These studies, which are conducted by several
universities under subcontracts with the BFDP, investigate how soil
characteristics change with conversion of agricultural land to biomass crops,
the fate of chemicals applied to energy crops compared with annual agricultural
crops, and the effects on habitat availability for native wildlife species. 
Information from these studies will help identify how environmental enhancement
can be achieved through biomass crop production as part of the existing
agricultural setting.</P>
<P>
</P>
<P> 	<I><B>Soils and nutrients</B></I></P>
<P>
</P>
<P> Studies by the University of Minnesota, Duluth, are characterizing
agricultural soils planted to biomass crops.  These studies will provide
information on how organic matter changes over time and whether biomass crops
can be used to reclaim eroded sites and eventually restore their productivity. 
The study addresses the potential for biomass crops in a farm rotation system to
increase crop diversity, minimize erosion, and increase soil fertility, while
diversifying the economic base of individual farms.</P>
<P>
</P>
<P> Other studies are examining the fate of chemicals applied to short-rotation
woody crops both with and without cover crops, to a herbaceous crop
(switchgrass), and to traditional row crops.  This work will quantify the
movement of nutrients and herbicides across the soil surface as well as into the
soil and groundwater beneath research-scale sites.  The study in Alabama, part
of a three-site southeastern study funded jointly with the Tennessee Valley
Authority, also is addressing the amount and chemical composition of surface
water runoff from switchgrass, corn, and tree crops to quantify erosion and
nutrient movement.  These studies will provide information on uptake, release,
and off-site movement of nutrients and pesticides on various soil types, and
will help define hydrologic and environmental pathways of chemicals applied to
biomass crops and their long-term effects on the agricultural environment.</P>
<P>
</P>
<P> A study conducted by the BFDP in conjunction with an industrial partner in
the coastal plain of South Carolina is determining the growth response of
cottonwood clones, sycamore, and sweetgum to different irrigation and
fertilization regimes.  The nutrient content of water percolating through each
experimental plot is being monitored to develop guides for the application of
nutrients and water to maximize growth and minimize costs to growers.  A related
study by Clemson University, supported by the BFDP and the National Council for
the Pulp and Paper Industry for Air and Stream Improvement, is addressing the
use of paper and pulp sludges applied either alone or in combination with
agricultural wastes as soil amendments for production of hardwood crops.  This
study offers the opportunity to: 1) determine the potential for using
agricultural residues to enhance productivity and soil quality; 2) address the
quantity and composition of the residue required to increase productivity; 3)
provide environmental benefit; and 4) minimize economic costs for agricultural
producers.  All these studies will help address how tree crops' response to
different nutrient regimes varies with species, soils and climate.  Therefore,
they will help us predict the effects of large-scale deployment of biomass crops
in agricultural landscapes.</P>
<P>
</P>
<P> 	<I><B>Biodiversity</B></I></P>
<P>
</P>
<P> SRWCs and switchgrass energy crops can enhance biological diversity by
creating or increasing the habitat for native species.  For example,
fast-growing energy trees planted around existing forest remnants may buffer the
forest habitat from predation by edge-using species such as the raccoon (<I>Procyon
lotor</I>) and the brown-headed cowbird <I>Molothrus ater</I>).  The additional
wooded area provided by these buffers may increase the habitat value of the
adjacent forest remnants for various disturbance-sensitive species, including an
entire suite of migrant birds that need interior forest habitat to survive and
breed.  Many of these interior forest birds are Neotropical migrants that
migrate between breeding areas in temperate North America and tropical wintering
areas in Latin America and the Caribbean.  These migrants are declining as the
result of forest fragmentation and competition from edge-using species (<A
HREF="#wilcove">Wilcove, 1985</A>; <A HREF="#blake">Blake and Karr, 1987</A>;
<A HREF="#robinson">Robinson et al., 1995</A>).</P>
<P>
</P>
<P> Some of these Neotropical migrants, such as the prairie warbler (<I>Dendroica
discolor</I>) and the yellow-breasted chat (<I>Icteria virens</I>), require
large expanses of regenerating forest, and may benefit directly from habitat
created by SRWCs.  Others, such as the sedge wren (<I>Cistothorus platensis</I>)
rely on grassland habitats, and could benefit from switchgrass energy crops or
from switchgrass planted to buffer existing native grasslands from other land
uses, such as traditional row crops.  In other areas, small plantings or
windbreaks of native grasses or SRWCs can provide additional edge habitats in
primarily agricultural landscapes for species that can access different habitat
types near their preferred habitat.  Placing native grasses and SRWCs to buffer
existing forests, to form linear corridors for wildlife movement between
otherwise isolated forests or grasslands, or to provide greater habitat
diversity in agriculturally dominated areas all can enhance biodiversity, but
the benefit will depend on how wildlife species use the habitat provided by
energy crops.</P>
<P>
</P>
<P> The role of these crops in enhancing biodiversity has been an area of
active research supported by the BFDP on several sites since 1992.  Research on
small-scale hybrid poplar plantings in Minnesota has shown that these plantings
support increased bird diversity compared with row crops; however, the young
tree plantations were less valuable as habitat than were the adjacent forests
and shrubs (<A HREF="#hanowski">Hanowski et al., 1994</A>).  Few bird species
that require mature forest habitat have been found in the young woody plantings,
which are dominated by more common bird species (<A HREF="#hanowski">Hanowski
et al., 1994</A>).  In the same plantings, small mammals use sites without
canopy closure more like grasslands than forests; small mammals requiring mature
forest habitat have not yet been found using young woody energy crops (<A
HREF="#christian">Christian et al., 1994</A>).  How the energy crop is managed,
including ground-level vegetation cover and diversity, was found to be important
in determining its value as habitat for small mammals.  In National Audubon
Society studies in Iowa (<A HREF="#hoffman">Hoffman et al., 1993; 1995</A>),
switchgrass plantings extended the habitat for grassland birds, but not all
species in the surrounding landscape used them.  Additional studies of larger
plantings are needed to validate the results of the small-scale studies and to
determine the value of more extensive plantings of biomass crops.</P>
<P>
</P>
<P> Research in the Southeast by the BFDP and the National Audubon Society in
conjunction with an industrial partner is addressing which energy crops,
planting sizes, ages, management regimes, and placement in the landscape are of
the greatest benefit for regional biodiversity.  BFDP-sponsored research has
shown that energy crops provide greater habitat structure and benefits for
native biodiversity than do row crops, and could benefit biodiversity on a
regional level with large-scale production of biomass energy crops.</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<H3><B>Conclusions</B></H3>
<P>
</P>
<P> Conversion of agricultural lands to energy crops is being closely monitored
to determine its environmental effects and possible benefits.  Research on
short-rotation woody crops and herbaceous energy crops conducted or supported by
the U.S. Department of Energy's BFDP has shown that these crops have significant
environmental benefits and can contribute to the economic viability and
diversity of individual farms and agricultural communities.  Studies on a
research scale have shown that biomass crops grown on more erodible agricultural
lands increase soil stability, nutrient retention, and soil organic matter. 
These studies can provide initial guidance in determining the environmental
effects and benefits of converting larger areas of land to biomass crop
production in different regions of the U.S.</P>
<P>
</P>
<P> If biomass crops grown under specific management techniques and located on
more marginally productive or erosive land are found to be valuable for
improving soil and water quality, decreasing chemical use and runoff, and
improving native biodiversity, it will be important to determine cost/benefit
ratios for growers who want to consider planting energy crops to provide both
economic and environmental benefits.  Determining what works best and developing
guidelines on how to produce energy corps at a profit while benefiting the
environment are important priorities.  Information on how wildlife use biomass
crops is important for growers who want to manage their biomass plantings to
provide additional economic value from such activities as hunting and wildlife
viewing leases.  We need to develop an environmental decision structure to help
determine the best locations and management methods for large-scale plantings to
achieve environmental benefits for soil, water, and wildlife diversity while
meeting the economic needs of individual growers and regional and local
agricultural communities.</P>

<H2>Abstract</H2></CENTER>
<P> Following the principles set by the National Biofuels Roundtable, a
workshop was held in March, 1995 which brought together a group of stakeholders
and experts in the field of biomass energy and ecology. The mission of the
workshop was to identify and set priorities for ecological research to ensure
that large-scale biomass energy development in the North Central states occurs
in an ecologically sound, sustainable manner. The workshop found that questions
about the landscape-scale deployment of biomass plantations were most pressing.
The workshop recommended that adaptive resource management principles be applied
in a phased development of increasingly larger plantations. Each phase of
development would help to answer questions about landscape-scale development;
improving the design of subsequent phases. Principles of sustainable agriculture
should also be applied to biomass plantations to minimize impact on soils and
water quality, maintain productivity and benefit the rural economy. Results of
the workshop will be helpful to natural resource and research agencies, as well
as utilities and biomass energy developers.</P>
<CENTER>
<H2>Introduction</H2></CENTER>
<P> One of the barriers to wider development of biomass energy sources is the
lack of information about the environmental impacts of deploying biomass crops
on a landscape scale. The National Biofuels Roundtable (<A HREF="#nbr">1994</A>)
recognized this in developing its broad guidelines for application nationwide.
These would have to be adapted to fit the dynamics of any particular region. The
North Central States, including Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan, Iowa, and
Illinois, have been identified having great potential for developing biomass
energy sources (<A HREF="#ucs">Union of Concerned Scientists, 1993</A>).
Advocates of biomass energy have recognized that a multidisciplinary approach is
needed to produce an acceptable plan for developing biomass energy in the
region.</P>
<P> To that end, a steering committee of major stakeholders and research
institutions sponsored a workshop to develop an agenda for biomass energy
ecological research in the region. The workshop brought together speakers and
stakeholders from the important disciplines to suggest what research will be
needed to answer concerns about the environmental impacts of large-scale energy
plantations. This paper summarizes the major themes of the presentations and the
discussions held by the participants.</P>
<CENTER>
<H2>Presentations</H2></CENTER>
<H3> Full Fuel Cycle Impacts of Energy Technologies</H3>
<P>
<I>Presenters: James Cook; National Audubon Soc., Whenonah Hauter &amp; Paul
Jeffries, Union of Concerned Scientists</I></P>
<P> Conventional generation of electric power imposes a significant toll upon
the environment, from all aspects of the fuel cycle. Extraction of coal, oil,
natural gas and uranium disrupts the environment where they are found.
Transporting these fuels sometimes requires the construction of roads,
railroads, pipelines and other facilities, and the consumption of fuel to move
them. Power plants themselves disrupt the environment, and the transmission
lines that move the electricity also have their impacts. Finally, the emissions
and discharges produced as by-products of generation cause their own pollution
and environmental degradation.</P>
<P> In contrast, producing biomass fuels can be relatively benign, depending on
the source of fuels. Using industrial and urban wood residues can help solve
solid waste disposal problems. Growing plantation crops on current farmland
produces no more, and often less environmental damage than conventional crops.
Transportation distances are shorter, so less fuel is consumed. Conventional and
toxic pollutants are equal to, or less than, natural gas due to low sulfur and
metals concentrations.</P>
<P> Greenhouse gas emissions can be minimized using biomass, especially with
closed-loop plantation systems. With planting to replace consumed fuel
resources, equalization could be possible. At least, biomass cycles &quot;contemporary&quot;
carbon, rather than releasing fossil carbon.</P>
<H3> Sustainable Agriculture and Energy Crops</H3>
<P>
<I>Presenters: Dennis Keeney, Leopold Institute; Bill Berguson, NRRI; Wendell
Johnson, Univ. of Minnesota; and Jerry Hatfield<B>, </B>National Soil Tilth
Inst.</I></P>
<P> Sustainable agriculture seeks to maintain the productivity of agricultural
systems by using cultural methods which minimize the use of chemicals and energy
to sustain production. At the same time sustainable agriculture attempts to
maximize the recycling of organic matter and natural fertilizers. Sustainable
practices attempt to retain the soils, reducing runoff and pollution of water
bodies.</P>
<P> Defining agricultural sustainability is subjective, but extractive
agricultures are always ecologically unsound. The &quot;highest use&quot; for a
farm's land must take into account the farm's economics, the environment of
which it is a part, and the social value of keeping people living on the land.
Time scale is important: long-term soil productivity, for instance, and
long-term avoidance of &quot;boom &amp; bust&quot; economic fluctuations.</P>
<P> Woody or herbaceous biomass can diversify the farmer's income mix. This
gives the farmer flexibility in fluctuating economic conditions, helping to keep
the farm profitable and intact. Biomass crops can be planted on marginal lands
that require vegetative cover for critical periods, or would otherwise provide
very little or no income without significant ecological damage. They can allow
the farm to support a wider variety of wildlife and protect against soil erosion
and nonpoint water pollution.</P>
<P> The amount of energy that the biomass fuel provides must exceed that used
to produce it. Species and varieties utilized must be adapted to the local
cropping conditions and fit into the farm work schedule over the year. Breeding
for higher yields should not be at the expense of pest tolerance and local soil
and climate adaptations. Nutrient budgets, including the ash from crop
combustion, must be computed and soils tested to minimize the use of imported
fertilizer.</P>
<P> Harvest must be timed to allow the farm to protect important wildlife
species and to reduce soil erosion and nonpoint pollution. Leaving residues on
the fields can protect against soil erosion and preserve soil texture. A market
and cash flow must be guaranteed to reduce the risk for the farmer and allow the
farmer the profitability required to think long-term. Regional planning,
monitoring and research to determine impacts and causes would be needed to
optimize placement of biomass crops in the landscape.</P>
<P> For example, biomass crops would grow well on Conservation Reserve Program
(CRP) lands and would provide the protection that they need in addition to the
income that the farmer needs. Biomass crops could also be planted as buffer
strips or filter strips or in drainageways to protect surface waters from
nonpoint fertilizer and herbicide pollution.</P>
<H3> Concepts and Principles of Landscape Ecological Planning</H3>
<P>
<I>Presenters: John Probst, U.S. Forest Service - No. Central Forest Expt.
Station; &amp; Andrew Schiller, Oak Ridge National Lab.</I></P>
<P> Landscape Ecological Planning is a tool to integrate resource use with
biological sustainability. The scale of thinking has to be different -
ecosystems, rather than populations or species. Processes and natural
fluctuations have to be taken into account, and multiple scales of space and
time must be considered.</P>
<P> One approach is to look at the systems present, define the stresses on
those systems, and their sources, evaluate strategies to relieve those stresses,
and build on already successful approaches.</P>
<P> The original and existing landscape features, vegetation patterns, soils,
and hydrology, of an area will suggest patterns and uses that can succeed there.
For example, grasslands and row crops could be the basis of plantation
management in the Southern portion of Wisconsin, which was once dominated by
prairies and oak savannahs. In the North, where forests mixed with wetlands and
lakes were dominant, woody species may be appropriate. In the ecological tension
zone that crosses Wisconsin from northwest to southeast, a pattern of
interspersed grassy and woody crops would be desirable.</P>
<P> In looking at the sizes of plantations, lessons from studies of habitat
patches can be useful. These too have to be considered in the context of the
larger landscape. Patch design and interspersion have to be considered in
relation to defined resource needs and explicit ecological goals: How many
patches in a unit area? How far apart? Can they be contiguous with existing
forests, grasslands, waterways or other ecological features? Do composition and
arrangement hinder or promote stated needs and goals.</P>
<P> Finally, it is important to inventory the resources present at each stage
of development, and to monitor processes as they develop. Constant assessment is
needed both to successfully manage on a landscape basis and to inform future
projects.</P>
<H3>Adaptive Resource Management Approaches to Research</H3>
<P>
<I>Presenters: Tom Nudds, Univ. of Guleph; Christine Ribic, Univ. of Wisconsin;
&amp; James Cook, Nat'l Audubon Soc.</I></P>
<P> Adaptive Resource Management attempts to combine research and policy
making. It recognizes that change is inevitable, systems are too complex and
dynamic to easily predict the effects of management decisions, but that
decisions must be made before complete understanding is achieved. Each policy is
itself a hypothesis about how a system will respond. Thus it can be tested, and
modified to account for what happened in the real world. This knowledge can then
be applied to the next decision, hopefully improving its effectiveness.</P>
<P> It is important to test hypotheses that reveal trade-offs between
alternative land uses under biomass energy scenarios. Would increased demand for
biomass fuels result in the conversion of marginal lands? Would the impacts be
the same, more, or less than leaving those lands to natural restoration
processes? Adaptive Resource Management approaches would allow these questions
to be investigated concurrent with the scale-up of biomass plantations.</P>
<P> A collaborative approach among stakeholders can muster the resources needed
to carry out the necessary research. Current ecological studies in Minnesota and
Iowa exemplify this method. Comparisons of bird species diversity parameters
between plantations, natural forests, and croplands are helping to refine basic
hypotheses such as: &quot;Bird diversity and presence of forest-interior birds
in plantation interiors is lower than woodlands of similar size but higher than
in most agricultural crops and pastureland&quot;.</P>
<P> The results should help to design plantation layouts that maximize the
potential habitat value of energy plantations.</P>
<H3> Ecological Lessons and Implications for Large Scale-Up Projects</H3>
<P>
<I>Presenters: Don Christian, Univ. of Minnesota-Duluth; Arthur Petersen, Univ.
of Wisconsin-Madison; Tom Houghtaling, Minnesota Power; &amp; Eric Vance, NCASI</I></P>
<P> Experience from studies of existing small scale plantations, and from
similar production systems can point out opportunities and pitfalls for attempts
to develop biomass plantations on a large commercial scale.</P>
<P> Studies of bird and small mammal populations indicate that plantations will
be ecologically intermediate between woodlands and croplands. Landscape context,
patchiness and size are important factors. Further research is needed to refine
these indications and develop predictive capacity.</P>
<P> Reducing soil erosion and resulting water pollution, especially on highly
erodible lands should be an important direction for demonstration and research.
Methods of cropping that both reduce the need for fertilizers and pesticides,
and retain soil should be tested. Alternative nutrient sources such as sewage
sludge (biosolids) may be useful.</P>
<P> The balance between environmental protection and economics should also be
considered. Landowner rights and preferences have to be accounted for in
designing plantation systems. The economic and social costs of alternative
management practices need to be acknowledged.</P>
<P> Experience from the pulp and paper industry has shown that intensive
management can be compatible with environmental quality. Following Best
Management Practices for erosion control, such as leaving buffer zones along
waterways, can protect water quality. Landscape-level analyses of biomass crop
development will facilitate preserving or enhancing the environmental values of
adjacent lands. Using alternative soil amendments could maintain soil structure
and fertility.</P>
<CENTER>
<H2>Discussion Results - Research Priorities</H2></CENTER>
<P> Three work groups were given instructions to identify needs, priorities and
implementation steps for the following research topics: 1) Ecological Research;
2) Environmental Quality Research; 3) Agricultural Sustainability Research; and
4) Policy Requirements to Support Research. Group facilitators directed the
discussions in each group to try to elicit the most involvement, and reflect
perspectives from all of the stakeholders participating in the Workshop.</P>
<P> Each group reported the results of their discussion to the participants.
The Steering Committee then organized the recommendations into topic areas.
These are presented below. Priorities were not explicitly set by all of the work
groups, but these issues came up several times in discussions, and most groups
made similar recommendations.</P>
<H3> Landscape Issues and Biological Studies</H3>
<P> Investigate the effects of placing biomass crops in the landscape. Attempt
to enhance patterns and features already present. Develop siting guidelines to
maximize benefits and minimize disruptions. Develop tools to assess and predict
water quality impacts of siting strategies. Develop Best Management Practices
(BMP) for all plantation crops, at all spatial scales. Develop protocols to
match crops to sites. Study options for the use of short rotation woody crops
(SRWC) and herbaceous energy crops (HEC) in riparian areas.</P>
<P> Study the role of habitat inclusions within plantations, both in terms of
wildlife and economics. Determine location and structural features of planting
that maximize habitat values. What is the optimum shape and arrangement of
stands (blocks vs. corridors, size &amp; number) for given species and species
mixes? Investigate the benefits of heterogeneity in plantings (vs. monotypes).
Establish a desired state (goal) for the landscape, including visual as well as
biological aspects.</P>
<P> Set priorities for species of concern: 1. Protected (threatened &amp;
endangered) species. 2. Local interest species. Gather data on occurrence and
distribution, and design landscape-scale studies. Investigate wildlife
source-sink relationships in herbaceous and woody crops.</P>
<H3> Production Practices</H3>
<P> Establish impacts of nutrient and herbicide application on poplars and
grasses, soils and water quality. Research and develop methods to minimize short
and long term chemical inputs. Transfer experience and knowledge of pulp and
paper industry to energy plantations. Study trade-offs between residue left on
ground, use of cover crops, and productivity of energy crops. Evaluate harvest

<CENTER>
<H2>Summary</H2></CENTER>
<P> Biomass energy development has great potential for reducing the life-cycle
impacts of our energy production system. We are early enough in the deployment
of these technologies to direct them in an ecologically sound, sustainable
manner. Applying the principles of sustainable agriculture and landscape
ecological planning are an important part of this process. Many questions about
ecological impacts need to be answered, but there is no need to wait until the
component elements have been researched one by one. Applying an adaptive
research management framework will allow the research to proceed along with
deployment by establishing a feedback loop between research, policy and
development.</P>

<TITLE>SRWC Operations Working Group Charter</TITLE></HEAD>
<BODY BGCOLOR="ffffff">
<H2>SRWC Operations Working Group Charter</H2>
<H2>Background</H2>
<P>Short rotation woody crops (SRWC) are an environmentally acceptable and
potentially economically efficient method of producing wood for fiber and fuel. 
As demand increases for hardwood fiber, new readily available sources are needed
to reduce demands on upland and bottomland forests.  SRWC plantations can reduce
demands on national forests, improve local rural economic development, and
ensure future wood supplies.  The environmental benefits of woody crops when
grown in a renewable fashion are also important.  Woody crops can reduce the
rate of atmospheric CO<SUB>2</SUB> buildup by sequestering carbon and by
substituting for fossil fuels.  The combustion of woody crops can also reduce SO<SUB>2</SUB>
and NOx emissions relative to fossil fuels.  At the local environmental level,
woody crops can reduce soil erosion, filter soil leachates from water entering
streams and ground water, and promote greater wildlife habitat and biodiversity.</P>
<P>With the advent of successfully developed genetically superior clones of
woody crops interest has substantially increased in the entire scope of SRWC
operations.  At a recent mechanization conference hosted by the DOE and the USDA
Forest Service, a number of impediments were underscored as deficiencies to the
development of commercialized woody crops:</P>
<UL>
<LI> the stalled development of practices, equipment, and implements to
establish, maintain, and utilize large plantations (i.e., commercialization
operations);
</LI>
<LI> the lack of consideration of the diversity of operations and machinery
required by different feedstock producers; and
</LI>
<LI> the necessity of commercializing SRWC for differing end-users.
</LI></UL>
<P>Successful commercialization of SRWC as either a source of fiber or as an
energy feedstock material, depends on a diversity of practices and equipment for
these highly specialized crops.  </P>
<H2>Mission and Objectives</H2>
<P>In a mutually beneficial and collaborative fashion, the USDA Forest Service,
DOE's Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), and the Electric Power Research
Institute (EPRI) have established a SRWC Operations Working Group to consider
the efficient development of practices and equipment to culture, harvest and
handle large-scale woody biomass plantations.</P>
<P>The mission of the Working Group is to promote collaborative efforts in
developing needed operations for SRWC plantations that comply with the
principles of economic viability, ecological soundness, and social acceptance. 
To fulfill its mission, the Working Group has the following objectives:</P>
<UL>
<LI> understand and communicate the SRWC operational needs for different
end-users and end-products; and
</LI>
<LI> promote the development of cost-effective and environmentally sound SRWC
plantation operations and refinement of existing practices (equipment, systems,
and technologies).
</LI></UL>
<H2>Scope</H2>
<P>The Working Group will serve as a venue for information exchange and for the
management, promotion, evaluation, and development of SRWC operations that are
low-cost and environmentally acceptable.  The Working Group will serve as a
liaison among forest industries, equipment manufacturers, electric utilities,
DOE, USDA Forest Service, International Energy Agency and researchers.  The
Working Group will also interface with researchers in plant development and
propagation (e.g., nurseries) as well as end-product users and conversion
technology developers.  The Working Group will primarily be national in scope. 
It will focus on all operational aspects of growing and harvesting SRWC
plantations including site preparation, planting, cultural management,
harvesting and extraction, handling and processing, hauling, and plantation
design) managed for tree stems 3-10 inches in diameter. </P>
<H2>Activities</H2>
<P>A primary purpose of the Working Group is to foster communication and
enhance cooperation, identify issues and concerns (<A HREF="#ANNEX">see annex</A>),
promote collaborative action and research, and facilitate funding support for
equipment and systems development and demonstrations.   Specific activities will
include:</P>
<UL>
<LI> Maintaining a mailing list
</LI>
<LI> Sponsoring a newsletter
</LI>
<LI> Serving as an information clearinghouse (database, internet home-page,
etc.)
</LI>
<LI> Sponsoring workshops, conferences, and demonstrations
</LI>
<LI> Promoting and prioritizing collaborative research and development
</LI>
<LI> Establishing protocols for the evaluation, reporting, testing, and design
of equipment and systems
</LI>
<LI> Assisting in research funding
</LI></UL>
<H2>Structure</H2>
<P>The Working Group will be ad-hoc in structure and be open to all
organizations and individuals with an interest in the commercialization of SRWC.
 The Working Group will be managed by a Steering Committee.  The immediate
responsibilities of the Steering Committee are to organize the Working Group,
plan and execute an organizing conference, assess issues and needs, establish an
information clearinghouse and network for exchange, and seek funding for Working
Group activities.  The Steering Committee members as well as specific functions
will be re-assessed at annual meetings of the Working Group.</P>

<H3><I><A NAME="Welcome">Welcome</A>!</I></H3>
<P>This is the first ever newsletter for the SRWC Operations Working Group. 
Hopefully, it will be published regularly and improved significantly over time. 
The newsletter is for those who have an interest in the operational aspects of
establishing, growing, and utilizing woody crops under intensive management for
either fiber, biomass fuel, or both products.</P>
<P>The newsletter is now just an information source concerning activities of
the Working Group.  In the future, hopefully it will be a venue for the sharing
of technical and scientific information and a resource for managers,
researchers, and manufacturers involved with SRWC.</P>
<H3><I><A NAME="Background">Background</A></I></H3>
<P>An international conference, Mechanization in Short Rotation, Intensive
Culture Forestry, was held in Mobile Alabama in March, 1994.  The conference was
unique in that it brought together from around the globe those interested in a
special aspect of short rotation forestry.  The meeting provided an arena to
exchange scientific and technical information, to learn the current status of
such activities, to identify additional resources and collaborators, and to
stimulate a growing interest in the problems and opportunities associated with
mechanization in short rotation forestry.  A total of 69 persons attended,
representing seven countries.  A proceedings was published that included 18
papers.</P>
<P>At the conclusion of the conference, it was obvious that interest in the
subject was widespread and that several issues remained unresolved. There was
discussion on continuing the exchange of information and improving collaboration
in short rotation mechanization.  It was resolved to begin the process of
establishing an informal working group to sponsor additional conferences and
provide for increased technical exchange and collaborative research.</P>
<P>In a mutually beneficial and collaborative effort, the USDA Forest
Service-Southern Research Station and DOE's Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL)
agreed to help organize and sponsor a SRWC Operations Working Group. The Working
Group will be administered by ORNL.</P>
<P>A steering committee was selected by the organizers to develop a charter,
propose structure and functions, and plan a conference.  A draft charter is
enclosed for your review.  It will be discussed and adopted at the first
organizational meeting.  Presently, the intent is to have an informal structure
without having a formalized set of by-laws.  Hopefully the Working Group can be
administered by the sponsors and led by a steering committee until the interest
and participation is sufficient to formalize the organization.</P>
<H3><I><A NAME="Working">Working Group Membership</A></I></H3>
<P>The Steering Committee recommends that membership is open to anyone with an
interest in SRWC operations. There are no dues associated with being a member.
Administrative costs are now being borne by the sponsors. A person can become a
member by either sending name and address information, or by attending the
sponsored conference.</P>
<P>Currently, this newsletter is being mailed to a large audience.  To reduce
mailing costs, only those people who specifically request to will remain on the
mailing list and be a member of the Working Group.  Please complete and return
the following information before July 31.  If you are registering for the
September 1996 Conference, you do not need to complete the form.</P>
<H3><I><A NAME="Steering">Steering Committee</A></I></H3>
<P>The initial Steering Committee was organized to represent many sectors and
interests.  The role of the Steering Committee is to provide leadership in
organizing a Working Group, develop mechanisms to conduct activities, to
organize Working Group conference, and to initiate a clearinghouse for
information.  </P>
<P>An organizing meeting of the Steering Committee was held in September, 1995.
 A preliminary charter was developed and a conference was planned.  Several
items of business will be handled at the first organizational meeting of the
Working Group in September, 1996.  One item is finalizing the Steering Committee
structure and roles.  Please come prepared to discuss these issues.  The current
Steering Committee recommends that additional members be considered:
producer/harvesters, agricultural equipment manufacturers, and university
researchers.  Regional representation may be needed as well.</P>
<H3><I><A NAME="September">September Workshop</A></I></H3>
<P>The First Conference of the Short-Rotation Woody Crops Operations Working
Group will be September 23-25, 1996 at Paducah, Kentucky. This will be an
organizational meeting of the SRWC Operations Working Group. The conference
includes a general session with keynote speakers who will present different
perspectives of SRWC and discuss future issues. There will also be three
technical sessions in which speakers will review current operations and discuss
state-of-the-art production systems, new research results and technological
advances will be presented.</P>
<P>An all-day field trip is planned to visit a cottonwood nursery, an
agroforestry/waterfowl management program, cottonwood and sycamore plantations
with several activities being demonstrated, and a state-of-the-art plantation
with drip irrigation. The tour is being hosted by Westvaco.</P>

<CENTER><A HREF="../IMAGES/WEIRDATA.GIF"><IMG
SRC="../IMAGES/SMWEIR.GIF"></A></CENTER><br>

This image shows bottom profile and sub-bottom sediment densities at
the subsurface weir located just below the confluence of the Emory and
Clinch rivers.  The subsurface weir was installed to divert more cold
deep water up the Emory River for use by the Kingston steam plant.  The
weir itself is the obvious feature in the middle of the image; river
flow is from left to right.  The darker colors represent heavier, more
dense sediments.  Notice the collection of soft material just to the
right of the weir structure.<P>

<CENTER><IMG SRC="../IMAGES/WEIRSED.GIF"></CENTER><br>

This image was created by a side-scanning SONAR, and shows the same
area around the subsuface weir.  The soft sediments behind the weir
appear as the dark area to the left of the linear weir.  We have used
the GIS to ``drape'' this sonar image over a <A
HREF="../IMAGES/WEIRSONR.GIF">3-dimensional representation</A> of the
weir.<P>

<HR>

<CENTER><A HREF="../MOVIES/WEIRFLY.MPG"><IMG
SRC="../IMAGES/WEIRFLY.GIF"></A></CENTER><br>

Click on this 3D image of the weir to see an animated movie of an
imaginary trip up the Clinch River and over the weir.  The elevation
surface was interpolated from known depths at sounding points, in
concert with other data sources.  The interpolated elevation surface is
draped with colors representing the output from a spatial filter which
estimates the potential erosion or deposition which could occur at each
spot on the bottom.  Red and yellow colors represent locations which
are higher than the local surroundings, and are therefore potential
erosion sites.  Green and blue colors are found at points that are
lower than their immediate surroundings; such areas are potential
deposition sites.  Flat areas are colored white and are neither
potentially erosional or depositional.<P>

We are flying at a fixed elevation of 720 feet above mean sea level,
and, because the top of the weir is about 725 ft, the viewpoint passes
right through the solid weir!<P>

The viewpoint is fixed on the weir itself, so that we pivot around as
we pass through, and then recede backwards up the Clinch.<P>

In this movie, the viewer starts near the outfall of White Oak Lake, in
the Clinch just upstream of Jones Island.  This is the outfall which
contributes the Cesium contaminant to the river.  As the movie
proceeds, the viewer is given a <I>bobsled ride</I>, floating 10 feet
above the local bottom, all the way to Brashear Island.<P>

The viewpoint is always forward in this animation.  The draped colors
are again the potential erosion/deposition.<P>

These sequences are the simple results of preliminary experimentation
with these tools.  Ultimately, as sub-bottom density data arrive from
the Army Corps, we hope to interpolate 3-dimensional volumes of
sub-bottom sediments, and to visualize these sub-bottom sediments by
flying over and through them in ways that would not otherwise be
possible.  We hope that such visualization tools and techniques will
permit and promote intuitive understanding of the data and allow model
results to be understood as well.  These tools tie the sampling, data,
and modeling activities together in a way which may provide new
insights.<P>

Click on this 3-D image to see a flying/submarine visualization of the
Clinch River portraying the total Cesium 137 inventory in core samples
taken by <A HREF="../DOCS/REFS.HTM#Oakes-1982">Oakes</A> <STRONG>(6.8
MB mpeg movie: Be Patient!)</STRONG>.  In this sequence, we begin high
above the Clinch river, and the topography surrounding the river can be
seen.  <A HREF="../IMAGES/WWWDEM3.GIF">Two 30m resolution 7.5 minute
USGS Digital Elevation Models</A> provided the information for this
surrounding topography.  These DEMs were spline-smoothed to 5m
resolution to match that of the riverbed data.  The vertical relief has
been exaggerated fivefold relative to the horizontal.<P>

The topography surrounding the river has been draped with a <A
HREF="../IMAGES/WWW3212.GIF">Landsat satellite image</A> taken on April
13, 1994.  This false color image is composed of bands 3, 2, and 1 for
red, green and blue, respectively, and represents most closely how this
landscape would appear to the human eye from space.<P>

As we approach the splashdown point, Jones Island looms in the
foreground.  Tennessee Highway 95 can be seen running left to right
where it crosses the river.  We have omitted the bridge, which should
appear at the juncture between white and blue water, for clarity.
Interstate 40 is also visible near the left corner of the region.<P>

The water itself is transparent.  The water color comes from <A
HREF="../IMAGES/WWW5322.GIF">Landsat bands 5, 3, and 2</A> for red, green,
and blue, and the color of the water can be seen to change,
particularly near the confluence of Poplar Creek, from a dark blue to a
lighter blue-green.  This probably reflects a temperature differential
registered by band 5, which is in the near-infrared range.<P>

As we splash through the water surface, the draped colors of the <A
HREF="FILTER.HTM">potential erosion/deposition filter</A> become more
vivid on the bottom.  Red and yellow areas are local high spots, and
are therefore potential erosion zones.  Green and blue areas are local
lows, and may potentially collect sediments.<P>

Ridges surrounding the Clinch can still be seen up through the water
surface.  A map inset appears in the upper left corner to show progress
down the Clinch with a growing red line.<P>

Spherical black buoys floating on the water surface mark <A
HREF="../IMAGES/WWWBUOYS.GIF">standard river miles</A>.  The first visible
black buoy marks Clinch River mile 21, and river miles decrease
downstream as the movie progresses, ending at river mile 9.<P>

The oblong and spherical objects on the bottom represent locations of
sample cores taken by <A HREF="../DOCS/REFS.HTM#Oakes-1982">Oakes</A>
in 1982.  The <A HREF="../DOCS/REFS.HTM#Oakes-1982">Oakes</A> cores
were stratified into vertical sections with depth, and were counted for
Cs-137.  The color and shape of the icons on the bottom reflect the
total inventory of Cs-137 (pCi/cm*cm) found within the entire length of
the core sample at that bottom location.  White spheres mark cores
which contained no cesium.  As Cs-137 content increases, the icons
change color from green (100 pCi/cm*cm) through yellow (400 pCi/cm*cm)
to red (13000 pCi/cm*cm), and grow from round spheres to tall pointed
``stalagmites''.  Some of these stalagmites are tall enough to project
well above the surface of the water.<P>

We pass to the right of the submerged tip of Jones Island around <A
HREF="../SUB/SUB021.GIF">frame 60</A>.  The shallows around the back
side of Grubb island are visible on the right in <A
HREF="../SUB/SUB106.GIF">frame 145</A>, and we pass the far end of
Grubb Island near <A HREF="../SUB/SUB125.GIF">frame 164</A>.<P>

We pass just to the left of a pair of yellow stalagmite cores near <A
HREF="../SUB/SUB221.GIF">frame 260</A>, near river mile 16.  Around <A
HREF="../SUB/SUB271.GIF">frame 310</A> we approach some taller red and
yellow cores in the Grassy Creek area, just before river mile buoy 14.
We pass another yellow core around <A HREF="../SUB/SUB375.GIF">frame
410</A>, and then, after we round the corner, the mouth of Poplar Creek
becomes visible where it joins the Clinch (<A
HREF="../SUB/SUB380.GIF">frame 417</A>).<P>

Lighter blue warmer water can be seen flowing from the mouth of Poplar
Creek in <A HREF="../SUB/SUB391.GIF">frame 430</A>, and this warmer
water slowly encroaches from the right side of the Clinch channel.  By
<A HREF="../SUB/SUB411.GIF">frame 450</A>, the surface water color has
changed to light blue across the entire width of the Clinch.<P>

We approach a prominent submerged sandbar upstream of Brashear Island,
near river mile 11 (<A HREF="../SUB/SUB432.GIF">frame 471</A>).
Because our elevation is fixed at 730 feet elevation, we pass right
through this sandbar, travel briefly below the underside of the bottom
``surface,'' and emerge unscathed on the other side.   Several yellow
stalagmite cores can be seen around the shallows just upstream of
Brashear Island, which comes into view around <A
HREF="../SUB/SUB468.GIF">frame 507</A>.  Notice how the shading of
the bottom changes as we pass around the northwestern side of
Brashear.<P>

Finally as we pass river mile 9 buoy, we leave the map and emerge into
blackness ...<P>

Several conclusions are obvious from this visualization:<P>

<OL>
<LI> Most of the Olsen cores contain relatively little total inventory
of Cesium-137.<P >

<LI> Many of the Olsen cores are spatially arranged in pairs.   Often,
even when one member of a pair shows some inventory, its partner will
be free of contamination.  This indicates that the presence of Cesium
is highly variable spatially.<P>

<LI> Despite the high local variability of Cesium inventory, there
appear to be meso-scale areas, on the order of single river miles,
where higher inventory cores are clumped or grouped.  One such area is
near Grassy Creek; another is the area just upstream of Brashear
Island.<P>
</OL>

We will continue to use visualization to determine whether the trends
indicated by this single historical data set are supported by more
recent Clinch River Cesium sampling.  The inclusion of the near-shore
sediment samples, along with the Phase II sediment samples, will more
than triple the number of data points available for analysis and
visualization.<P>

Click on the above 3-D image to see a simulated helicopter ride over a
drained Clinch River bed with virtual push-pins visualizing elevation
error in the splined riverbed <STRONG>(10.2 MB mpeg movie: Be VERY
Patient!)</STRONG>.<P>

In this sequence the river has been drained to make the riverbed
visible.  We are flying at a fixed elevation of 750 feet above MSL.
The river bed elevation has been interpolated using a <A
HREF="http://www.cecer.army.mil/grass/viz/interp.html">3-D spline with
tension</A> (<A
HREF="http://www.cecer.army.mil/grass/viz/rsst.html">Mitasova and
Mitas</A>, 1993).  The spline surface acts as a bending and twisting
flexible surface which is trying to pass close to all known data
points.  A tension parameter controls the flexibility of the surface,
changing its behavior from that of a thin rubber membrane to a thick
inflexible plate.  Riverbed colors are again the <A
HREF="FILTER.HTM">potential deposition/erosion filter</A> results.<P>

Virtual push-pins mark locations where actual river depth was supplied
to the spline interpolation program.  Two types of depth data were
available; high quality ``primary'' data from the <A
HREF="PROPOSAL.HTM">Army Corps of Engineers depth soundings</A>,
sedimentation cross-section readings, and depths recorded at actual
sampling locations, and ``secondary'' depth data, such as contour lines
scanned from pre-impoundment USGS quad maps.<P>

In order to minimize dilution of the primary data with secondary
information, a 20 m buffer zone was placed around all primary data
points, and only secondary data points that fell outside this buffer
zone were included in the input to the spline interpolator.  Thus the
secondary information was used to fill in spatial ``gaps'' for which no
primary data existed.  In addition, to minimize computation time, only
points at least 10 m apart were included in the spline.<P>

At each of these locations, the height of the interpolated surface was
subtracted from the true depth.  A green pin indicates that this delta
was positive, and a red pin indicates that this difference was
negative.  The absolute value of this difference was added to the
height of the surface, and the pin heads were positioned at this
height.<P>

Thus, the head of the virtual push-pin is green if the interpolated
bottom surface should have been higher at the pin location, and red if
the surface should have been lower at this spot.  The surface should
have passed through the center of the heads of the green pins; it
should have passed through a spot as far below the surface of the red
pins as the red pins are tall.<P>

Short alternating red and green pins, which are often seen in the
center of the bottom, indicate a nearly perfect fit of the interpolated
surface with the actual known depths.  Alternating red and green pins
of greater height indicate that the spline has ``smoothed out'' a rough
bottom (or a series of noisy depth measurements).  A perfect match (to
the nearest hundreth of a foot) between spline depth and actual depth
data is indicated by white pins whose heads rest on the bottom.<P>

Often throughout the sequence there are two rows of green pins on each
bank, while the next inner rows of pins are red.  Depths for the
outermost rows of pins were established by the known water surface
elevation at the shoreline.  The red rows surrounded by green rows at
the banks indicate that the tension setting used was too high to allow
the surface to bend deep enough for the red row, then come up quickly
enough to meet the outer green rows.  This is exacerbated where the
river is narrow and deep.<P>

Moreover, smaller islands, like Grubb Island (frame 94) and Brashear
Island (frame 470), have a mesa-like appearance, with straight vertical
sides and a flat top.  The flat top is because the portion ot these
small islands which projects above the waterline is smaller than the
30m resolution of the DEM data which were used to provide the
above-water vertical relief; the vertical sides result from a spline
tension setting that is too low.<P>

Click on the above 3-D image to see the pinhead movie of the drained
Clinch River bed with virtual push-pins visualizing elevation error in
the splined riverbed <STRONG>(11.1 MB mpeg movie: Be VERY
Patient!)</STRONG>.<P>

It seemed apparent from the <A HREF="HELI.HTM">Heli animation</A> that
the tension setting used for the spline interpolation was resulting in
a surface that was too ``stiff'' to respond quickly enough to
adequately represent the bottom, particularly in places where the
channel is narrow.<P>

However, lowering the tension setting indiscriminantly, while it might
provide a better fit in some places, could result in overshoots, in
which the surface reacts so quickly in complex bottom locations that it
shoots above the water level, creating islands where none actually
exist.<P>

A series of 10 interpolations were sequentially performed in one small
bottom location through a range of tension settings, and the residual
errors examined using virtual push-pins as before.  It was found that a
tension setting of 130, along with a smoothing factor of 0.5, produced
a bottom surface which appeared to minimize the residual errors.  The
entire bottom of the Clinch River was re-interpolated using these
parameters.<P>

Another animation was produced to examine the residuals for all
portions of the Clinch bottom, as before.  The spatial trend in
residuals which was evident at narrow places in the Heli animation,
where 2 rows of red pins surround the centerline of the bottom and are
flanked by 2 rows of green pins at each shoreline, is no longer present
with the new interpolation.<P>

Moreover, the visualization shows that these settings also provide a
good fit for most of the center bottom, as well as the broader,
shallower wide sections of the river bottom.  These shallower, broader
locations are the places where the water is slowing, and potential
deposition of contaminants is likely to occur.<P>

The improved splined surface seems be representative of the general
bottom shape as indicated by available depth data.  If a more accurate
bathymetric surface is required, further investment should be made in
obtaining more depth data rather than tweaking the spline tension
parameter.<P>

Click on the above 3-D image to see the tennis movie <STRONG>(29.5 MB
mpeg movie: Be VERY Patient!)</STRONG>.<P>

In this animation, the bottom surface is represented by a white
wire-mesh screen, through which the sub-bottom sediments can be seen.
Each stack of ``tennis'' balls represents the acoustic echo of a single
dual-frequency signal.<P>

Ball colors represent sediment type as classified according to wet
density as measured by acoustic impedance, and range from red, for the
softest fluid mud, through yellow for intermediate density silty clays,
to green for densest material like sand, gravel, and rock.  Successive
balls are about half a foot apart in each stack.  Locations of surface
density measurements, most made with the Army Corps fathmometer, are
shown as x's whose colors represent the sediment type indicated by this
instrument.<P>

It is very unusual for a stack to indicate high density sediments on
top of less dense material.<P>

Small hills and bumps on the bottom, like those near Brashear Island
close to the end of the animation, are comprised of and underlain by
mostly harder material, while stacks in low spots and depressions are
usually capped by red balls, indicating a layer of softer, less dense
material.<P>

Notice how quickly your eye tries to construct horizontal connections
among stacks to establish horizontal transitions between sediment
types.<P>

We are extending our interpolation and visualization efforts into the
third dimension in order to investigate the shape and position of the
horizontal transition planes between each of these sediment types.
Because the softer sediments have the greatest potential for sorption
of contaminants, their location is important.  Moreover, a 3D
interpolation will allow estimation of the volume of potentially
contaminated sediment, as well as the volume of overburden which
covers it.  These estimates are important considerations for evaluation
of possible remediation and selection of remediation techniques.<P>

<h2><a name="abstract"></a>Abstract for the Tracer Study</h2>
</b><p>

<b>At Waste Area Grouping 4, a site at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory that was used in
the 1950's for disposal of radioactive wastes, recent studies have suggested that most of the
90Sr being released from the site originates in a few trenches.  During the period February
- May, 1995, roughly 40% of the 90Sr release from the area passed through surface flow
collection systems at two seeps.  Previously gathered 90Sr concentration data for points
along the stream draining the site suggested that these same two seeps also contribute most
of the subsurface releases from the site.<p>

Although trenches upslope from the seeps have been examined using drive-point wells to
define the apparent localized sources of 90Sr causing the releases, it was desirable to show a
direct link between the sources and the seeps where releases occurred.  To accomplish this
goal, noble gas tracer injections were conducted in small-diameter wells at or near the
primary 90Sr sources.  Passive samplers were used at down-gradient locations, where
sampling wells already existed, to attempt to determine flow pathways and approximate
travel times for groundwater in- and downslope from- trenches.<p>

Some limited success was achieved in spite of very dry conditions and the short time
interval available for conducting the work.  At each of three areas of interest, Argon, Neon
and Helium were injected for about three months.  In the area of the strongest 90Sr
releases, both Neon and Helium were detected in the Argon injection well, roughly 140 feet
away.  Time from the start of the injection was about one month for the Helium and nearly
three months for the Neon.  The implication was that elevated 90Sr values near the Argon
injection well probably resulted from the sources in the vicinity of the Helium and Neon
injection sites and that the pathway from the Neon injection well is more tortuous.  At a
second study area, Helium was detected in a downslope well after about 70 days, at a
distance of about 40 feet.  In the third area, gas tracers were only observed in the injection
wells.  This site was shown to have relatively minor contributions of contaminant to the
seep and stream, hence it is likely that flows are small.<p>

The results suggest that much longer periods are needed for definitive testing at the field
scale for this study.  It is also possible that degassing of the tagged groundwater occurred
near the seeps and prevented detection there.  In spite of the limited success, the method
was shown to be suitable for similar site characterization work, although it may be
preferable to use tagged micro-spheres rather than noble gases for these conditions. 
Microspheres are not slowed by diffusion into the surrounding matrix, and would not
escape into the atmosphere when groundwater emerged at seeps.</b><a href="w4trcip.htm"></u><img src="back.gif" alt="back"></a><b><p>

<h2><a name="conclusions"></a>Conclusions:</h2>
	<b>Overall, the limited detection of tracers in sample wells failed to provide conclusive
evidence of movement from suspected sources to seep discharge points.  Positive detections
in both the SCS 6 and SCS 4 areas showed, however, that the basic approach has merit. 
Because conditions were very dry, it is likely that movement simply was too slow to achieve
complete success during the time available for the test.  It is also possible that the sample
zones available from existing drive point wells were not located within predominant flow
pathways.  Finally, because of potential interaction with the atmosphere along the flow
pathway, it is also possible that the tracers were degassing from groundwater before they
reached the detection points at the seeps.  The fact that the greatest movement (over 140 ft
in one month) occurred at SCS 6, which is the strongest overall contributor to 90Sr mass
flows, is consistent with other results.  The pathway that was identified also shows that
some 90Sr detected in groundwater to the southwest of the seeps at SCS 6 originates in the
contaminated regions identified near wells 4322 and 4340, where Neon and Helium were
injected.</b><a href="#recommendations"></b></u><b><img src="next.gif" alt="next"></a><p>

<hr>
<p>

<h2><a name="recommendations"></a>Recommendations:</h2>
The observation that the noble gas tracers moved at rates that ranged between about 0.5
feet per day to nearly 3 feet per day suggests that a three month study period is not
adequate to allow movement and detection of tracers at distances in excess of 150 feet along
the slowest pathways.  For a typical wet season in Tennessee, injection should begin in early
December, and continue through April.  Detection sampling would continue through early
June to provide reasonable assurance of success.  The question of whether noble gas tracers
will degas from groundwater at a rate sufficient to defeat detection at emerging seeps
remains.  New advances in tagged micro-sphere tracers provide the possibility of evaluating
this question.  Since the microspheres will neither diffuse into the formation matrix along
the flow path nor be lost to the atmosphere when the groundwater emerges at seeps, a dual
noble gas and microsphere tracing experiment should be conducted at this site to advance
understanding of the limitations of the approach, and provide sufficient travel time to give
reasonable prospects for success.<a href="w4trc1.htm"></u><u></b><img src="home.gif" alt="home"></a><b></b><p>

<P>The Department of Energy's (DOE's) Biofuels Feedstock Development Program
(BFDP) leads the nation in the research, development, and demonstration of
environmentally acceptable and commercially viable dedicated feedstock supply
systems (DFSS). The goals of the program include technology development and
technology implementation. BFDP's overriding goal is to develop a variety of
dedicated biomass feedstock technologies that could supply as much as 15% (up to
20 GJ) of the primary energy produced in the United States. A second goal is to
ensure successful technology acceptance and implementation.
</P>
<P>DFSS have the potential of providing a very large renewable source of
biomass supplies for energy, fiber, and chemicals. DFSS incorporate the
production of specialized tree and grass crops with appropriate systems for
harvest, storage, and delivery. With appropriate technology and planning, DFSS
can meet high standards of environmental quality on a wide variety of cropland
types, including some types of environmentally sensitive land. Production of
DFSS for energy on a large scale could provide a significant source of renewable
energy that could enable reduced reliance on fossil fuel sources. Several
evaluations of solutions for preventing or delaying global warming indicate that
biomass energy must become a significant energy resource. Production of DFSS for
a large energy market could revitalize the rural economy and remove some of the
burden of federal subsidy payments to farmers. The BFDP has been charged by DOE
with leading the research, development, and demonstration required to convert
potential benefits into real benefits.
</P>
<P>The BFDP has been managed by staff in the Environmental Sciences Division
(ESD) of Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) for DOE's Biofuels Systems
Division since 1978. Most of the technology research and development work has
been performed by subcontractors in academic, private, and government
institutions. The information development and technology transfer activities
required for ensuring technology acceptance has been performed by both ORNL
staff and subcontractors or cooperators. The program complements and
collaborates with biomass conversion research supported by at least three
different divisions and offices within DOE.</P>
<P>BFDP researchers have evaluated a wide variety of plants that could be used
as dedicated biomass feedstocks and the types of land on which they can be
produced. Numerous cropping and harvesting methods have been considered, and the
production costs associated with each have been evaluated. Exciting new
techniques for crop improvement and modification have been developed. The
program currently coordinates an extensive network of integrated research on
crop development (<A HREF="92append.html">Appendix 1</A>), maintains a unique
data base on crop production techniques, and performs resource and economic
analysis of DFSS. The environmental implications of biomass feedstock production
are being evaluated on local, national, and global scales.
</P>
<P>The BFDP shares the responsibility of capturing the potential of biomass
energy with biomass conversion research programs supported by DOE. The BFDP is
most closely linked to the biomass-to-liquid fuel research conducted by the
National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) and supported by the Biofuels
Systems Division under the DOE Office of Transportation Technology. The U.S.
interest in reducing oil imports places a high priority on developing biofuels.
</P>
<P>Utility interest in biomass-to-electricity technology is expanding rapidly
because of increased global warming concerns and pending regulations on CO<SUB>2</SUB>
emissions. Thus, the technology and information resources developed by the BFDP
are also being heavily relied upon by the Solar Thermal and Biomass Power
Program under the DOE Office of Utility Technologies.
</P>
<P>A third source of interest in biomass feedstocks is emerging within DOE's
Office of Industrial Technologies as programs to increase industrial energy
efficiency recognize the potential of biomass feedstocks and as new ways are
found to produce chemicals from biomass feedstocks.</P>
<P>Industries interested in biomass resources indicate that dependability and
reliability of biomass feedstock supplies are two of their largest concerns.
With biomass conversion technologies approaching demonstration phases, with
global environmental concerns accelerating, and with farmers searching for new
crops and markets, the importance of the research managed by the BFDP is
expected to increase dramatically. The past 14 years of research management has
given ORNL the experience and knowledge needed for leading a well-focused effort
in converting the potential of biomass energy to a reality.
</P>
<P></P>
<H3>APPROACH</H3>
<P>The BFDP provides leadership in the development of DFSS in the following
ways. It integrates agriculture, energy, and environmental objectives in
developing concepts of integrated biomass energy systems. It seeks and fosters
the best research, development, and demonstration projects in the private,
academic, and government sectors. It strives to ensure that information on
biomass supply systems is timely, accurate, understandable, and accessible.</P>
<P>The BFDP has organized its research, analysis, and management resources to
meet near-term needs and to prepare for future expectations. Research in 1992
was conducted under five task areas including woody crop development, herbaceous
crop development, environmental research and analysis, economic analysis and
integration, and information management. Each task leader managed a mixture of
subcontracts, supervised internal work, and conducted relevant individual
research and analysis. All of the efforts have been focused on facilitating the
commercialization of integrated, environmentally sound, biomass energy systems.</P>
<P>The woody and herbaceous crop tasks both have three key deliverables:
development of (1)  plant culture technologies, (2) appropriate, superior plant
materials, and (3) developed germ-plasm resources. Research is currently being
focused on two general regions, the north central/midwest region and the
south/southeast region for the development of superior plant materials,
germ-plasm resources, and cropping systems technology. Other technologies such
as tools for genetic manipulation and improvement, site quality/site index
prediction functions, vegetative propagation techniques, and physiological
characterization of root growth are being developed at specific locations with
generic application to any region of the United States. The current program
strategy is to develop new varieties of switchgrass and new clones of poplars
for the north central/Midwest and the South/Southeast regions. Two breeding
centers for switchgrass currently exist--Oklahoma State University and the USDA
Agricultural Research Service at Lincoln, Nebraska. The breeding centers are
assembling breeding materials and developing superior seed sources for
evaluation by collaborators. Collaborators are concentrating on testing
currently available varieties, improving agronomic techniques, and developing
tissue culture techniques. Two breeding centers for <I>Populus</I> also exist,
and a third is being planned in FY 1993. The oldest center is led by the
University of Washington in collaboration with Washington State University and
industry collaborators. The newer center is led by Iowa State University in
collaboration with several other universities. The
<I>Populus</I> breeding centers involve integrated crop research connected with
a breeding program focussed on assembling breeding materials, developing
superior pedigrees, and releasing clones for widespread testing. The connected
supportive <I>Populus
</I>research consists of applicable physiology, molecular biology, pathology,
entomology, and silviculture. These crop development strategies should result in
prompt, cost-effective gains in research knowledge as well as production of the
deliverables noted above for switchgrass and <I>Populus</I>. Crop development
centers for additional species need to be established but are not planned at
this time.</P>
<P>The BFDP economic and environmental tasks are closely linked. The key
deliverables of these tasks are to (1) define energy crop price-quantity
relationships, (2) identify and document the ecologically important and
environmentally regulated effects of biomass commercialization, and (3) bring
these efforts together to address citing issues and define viable ways to
optimize environmental benefits within economic constraints. Data collection and
analysis aimed at predicting potential environmental and economic changes
(positive and negative) resulting from commercialization of energy crop
production is gaining more attention. The economic and environmental tasks also
include the development of concepts of integrated biomass energy systems that
could contribute to the successful demonstration of integrated biomass energy
systems. These concepts are being developed in close linkage among (1) 
researchers from NREL working on both liquid fuel and biomass electric
technologies, (2) analysts from the Electric Power Research Institute and
individual utilities, (3) environmental groups such as the Audubon Society and
the Nature Conservancy, (4) fiber feedstock production managers in the wood
products industry, and (5) managers of similar research programs in other parts
of the world. The linkages are occurring through cost-shared research,
presentations at workshops and meetings, roundtable discussions, data and
information exchange, and site visits. This dialogue with diverse interested
parties is considered necessary at this time to ensure that the broadest public
interest is considered in the development of biomass energy technology.
</P>
<P>The BFDP information management task has a vital role in meeting customer
needs for research information on energy crop systems. Better information
management and tracking systems are being developed. Other information centers
are being evaluated as models for enhancing our technology transfer efforts. The
newsletter, <I>Energy Crops Forum</I>, being produced by the information task
leader is facilitating the necessary communication among energy crop
researchers, potential energy crop producers, and potential energy crop users.
</P>

<H3>SHORT-ROTATION WOODY CROP RESEARCH</H3>
<P><B>Background and Research Strategy</B>
</P>
<P>Dedicated wood energy crops generally consist of deciduous hardwood tree
species that have been selected for qualities suitable for biofuels conversion,
such as rapid early growth, pest resistance, broad general adaptability, high
cellulose content, and the ability to regenerate via coppice sprouts.
Historically, research in the BFDP has involved breeding and genetic
improvement, physiological characterization, cultural management testing, and
cultivar/clone site trials for several model species. Through this research, dry
average yields in some regions of the United States have increased from 4.5 to
20  Mg&#183;ha<SUP>-1</SUP>&#183;year<SUP>-1</SUP> on 6- to 10-year rotations,
and end-use costs have decreased from $4.00 to $3.10 per GJ.
</P>
<P>There are currently 13 ongoing short-rotation woody crops (SRWC) research
projects within the BFDP. These projects are designed to develop specialized
wood energy crops for the regions of the United States where land availability
and climate are favorable for the establishment of biomass-based energy
industry. In the past, four model species have been selected for research and
development based on their potential to be highly productive on a broad range of
sites under environmentally sound management practices and wood quality
characteristics suitable for economical conversion to liquid fuels. Because of
budgetary reductions, the scheduled closing of several projects, and a slight
redirecting of several projects, the majority of the SRWC research in FY 1992
has dealt with <I>Populus</I>.
</P>
<P>Although much is known about the <I>Populus</I> genus, opportunities exist
for improved productivity, energy qualities, and adaptability to site variation
and environmental stresses. To achieve these goals, selection and breeding based
on traditional tree breeding criteria have been used to provide immediate gains,
while physiological research in association with biotechnology has been used to
delineate traits for long-term improvement of
<I>Populus</I> species as energy feedstocks.
</P>
<P><B><I>Populus</I> Research Progress</B></P>
<P>Several separate but connected activities were completed or initiated in FY
1992 related to Populus improvement and crop development. Two of these
accomplishments primarily involve in-house activities, two primarily involve
subcontracted activities, and two others involve multiple agency activities.
These six activities reflect (1) a greater emphasis being placed upon <I>Populus</I>
improvement and crop development by the BFDP and (2) a larger effort by the BFDP
to integrate existing in-house and subcontracted research.
</P>
<P>In-house, ESD's biotechnology laboratory is now operational as a result of
DOE capital equipment investments over the last 2  years. The purpose of this
laboratory is to integrate the techniques of plant tissue culture, DNA isolation
and characterization, and genetic transformation into existing, ongoing research
activities related to SRWC improvement. As a result of these investments, the
BFDP received a 3-year, $200,000 per year grant through the Laboratory
Director's Research and Development funds to introduce plant hormones genes into
hybrid poplar in an effort to enhance <I>Populus</I> feedstock quality.
</P>
<P>The second in-house activity involves the completion of the physiological
and biochemical evaluation of drought tolerance in hybrid poplars. Through the
use of a six-clone pedigree, developed as part of the BFDP activity at the
University of Washington, drought tolerance via osmotic adjustment as been
demonstrated in hybrid poplar. In this pedigree, water stress-tolerant clones
under stress were able to grow at a rate of approximately 55% of well-watered
plants, compared with intolerant clones, which grew at approximately  45% of
well-watered plants. Pressure volume analysis indicates that water
stress-tolerant clones show an osmotic adjustment of 0.25 MPa not seen in the
intolerant clones. Two separate manuscripts and a possible joint experiment with
the University of Washington/Boise Cascade in eastern Washington have resulted
from this work.
</P>
<P>A study with the U.S. Forest Service in Grand Rapids to examine the
relationship between plantation productivity and soil and climatic
characteristics in the north-central region was completed. Soil and climatic
condition varied greatly across the plantation network. Of all the climatic data
examined, cooling degree days was found to be significantly related to tree
biomass, based on a curvilinear model. The validity of this model was supported
by the below average growth witnessed in all poplar plantings in the
north-central region under this summer's cooler than average growing conditions.
Unexpectedly, soils data were generally not related to tree growth. Depth to
water table, however, was weakly related to tree biomass. Future analyses will
have to be conducted before soils information is excluded as a factor
influencing poplar productivity.
</P>
<P>Iowa State University has completed its 1992 evaluations of the 1991 entries
in a nursery screening study. In total, 74  clones were screened for leaf
diseases, insect feeding preference, growth rate, branching habit, and rooting
success. The best clones in terms of growth rate were pure <I>P. deltoides</I>;
the best hybrid clone was a <I>P. maximowiczii</I> x <I>P. nigra</I>. All
clones in the 1991 screening trial will be screened again in 1993 in larger
clonal blocks before the poorer performing clones are eliminated. After the
second screening, the better clones will be released into small regional
screening trials to identify the top 1-2% of the clones for release into
operational testing. A total of 42 clones from the 1990 larger clonal block test
have been released into the small regional screening trials. The University of
Washington, along with numerous collaborators, has been awarded a 3-year,
$150,000 per year grant from the DOE/NSF/USDA Joint Program on Collaborative
Research in Plant Biology to coordinate the molecular genetics research on
<I>Populus</I>. As a result of this award, the University of Washington will
coordinate the completion of a genetic linkage map for <I>Populus</I>,
disseminate information and plant materials to researchers, and facilitate the
integration of research results. These activities will benefit the BFDP at no
cost by expanding the network of researchers studying on the
<I>Populus</I> pedigree developed with BFDP funding.
</P>
<P>The second multiagency activity involves the formation of the North-Central
<I>Populus</I> Research Consortium. The purpose of this consortium is to
integrate <I>Populus</I> research activities that are currently taking place in
the north-central region in an effort to remove duplication and to increase
research output per unit dollar invested. There are 5  research agencies and 12
researchers involved in the consortium. The first year's activity involved the
exchange of collected germ plasm and the coupling of the breeding research with
the laboratory and field testing research. A second meeting is scheduled for
early FY 1993 to set consortium objectives for the upcoming year.
</P>
<P><B>Additional SRWC Research Progress</B></P>
<P>As has been shown in other countries, research solely on a single species
invites failure and limited application of results. Thus, continued research
related to the genetic improvement of a minimum of two model species for each of
the four major short-rotation energy crops regions in the United States remains
critical to the successful implementation of a national biomass program for
liquid fuels production. This effort, however, remains unfunded. The following
summaries report on the four remaining SRWC species under investigation by the
BFDP in FY  1992.
</P>
<P><B>Genetic variation in silver maple (Southern Illinois University). </B>
Four tissue-culture propagated silver maple provenance field tests have been
established in three midwest states; two in 1991 and two in 1992. Clones in
these tests represent 4 genotypes from 15 different provenances from across the
natural range of silver maple. Each field test contains five replications of
four tree plots for each selected clone. First-year survival at all sites was
high, averaging 85+% at each site. The high survival rate is attributed, in
part, to the use of 1.25-mil polyethylene mulch within the plantings. Soil
moisture condition remained high, and weed competition was eliminated as a
result of this mulch. At the end of the first growing season, the best clone
within the best provenance reached an average height of 2.3 m in two growing
seasons, more than doubling the average growth for nonselected silver maple
seedlings. Deer browsing within the plantations has been successfully controlled
through the use of a three-dimensional deer fence.
</P>
<P><B>Willow monoculture viability trial (State University of New York).</B>
The BFDP began participating in a monoculture viability trial with State
University of New York (SUNY). SUNY is coordinating efforts to establish two
100-acre hybrid willow demonstration farms. This is a cooperative effort
involving Electric Power Research Institute, Empire State Electric Energy
Research Cooperation, Niagara Mohawk Power Corporation, New York Electric and
Gas Corporation, New York State Electric Research and Development Agency, and
the University of Toronto. The silvicultural system used in these farms will be
modeled after the Swedish system of 3- to 4-year rotations, twin-row planting,
coppice regeneration, and mechanical harvesting. Clonal material and site
selection for the first 100-acre plantation have been completed; nursery
scale-up and site preparation will continue in FY  1993.
</P>
<P><B>Early selection and clonal propagation of sycamore (Mississippi State
University).</B> Dry weight yields in a 3-year-old clonal sycamore planting have
been analyzed. Average aboveground dry weight was 12.8  dry Mg&#183;ha<SUP>-1</SUP>&#183;year<SUP>-1</SUP>
(44% of the total tree dry weight). Total tree dry weights have been partitioned
among the component parts, with 40% of the fixed carbon occurring belowground;
half of this dry weight occurred as fine roots. Early selection statistics
indicated that 7-month seedling variables such as height and ground-line
diameter can be used to predict 2-year field performance. Further data is needed
to test rotation age correlations before final recommendation can be made.
Rooted cutting experiments have been completed. Hardwood cuttings taken before
bud break from 2-year-old sprouts produced the greatest height (desirable),
diameter (desirable), root length (desirable), and mean sprout number
(undesirable). Apomixis (i.e., the formation of viable seed in isolated,
nonpollinated flowers) is being investigated and verified by genetic
fingerprinting techniques. If valid, apomixis may prove to be the most reliable,
useful method of vegetatively propagating mature sycamore genotypes.
</P>
<P><B>Genetic improvement of black locust (University of Georgia).</B> Third-
and fourth-year field measurements have been obtained from the irrigated,
fertilized, north central Georgia progeny test containing 24 open-pollinated
families of black locust. The best family in the best plots produced 8 dry Mg&#183;ha<SUP>-1</SUP>&#183;year<SUP>-1</SUP>.
Procedures for obtaining rooted cuttings have been established, with greenwood
cuttings dipped for 5 s in 8000+ ppm IBA and placed in Oasis rooting medium
under intermittent mist producing 80% or higher rooting success across 23
different clones. Somatic embryogenic cultures have been established from
excised immature embryos placed on WPM with 3 mg/L 2,4-D and 0.25 mg/L BA. The
somatic embryogenic cultures have been used in gene transformation experiments.
Biolistic transformation techniques have led to transient expression of two
selectable marker genes, NPT II and GUS. Ultimately, stable transformation
involving stem borer-resistance genes will be the long-term goal of this
research.
</P>
<P><B>Future Plans</B></P>
<P>The long-term health and security of a renewable, dedicated biomass energy
crop industry will depend on actions taken today. As commercialization
approaches, the BFDP SRWC research mission needs to provide those agencies,
institutions, and/or corporations interested in commercialization with three
deliverables: (1) developed silviculture technologies; (2)  appropriate,
superior plant materials; and (3) developed germ plasm resources. Developed
technologies would include systems for genetic manipulation and improvement,
silvicultural systems, harvesting systems, etc. Appropriate plant materials
would include adapted, high-yielding, pest-resistant, environmentally stable
clones. Developed germ plasm resources would include broad, systematically
selected, managed collections of species' germ plasm. Short-term, crisis-driven
research approaches will not allow this to happen, regardless of how appropriate
or necessary these short-term approaches are.
</P>
<P>A desirable approach to achieving these deliverables would involve
restructuring SRWC research into seven centers of crop development, three for
<I>Populus</I> and four for alternate species such sycamore, silver maple,
black locust, and
<I>Salix</I>. These centers would engage in integrated crop research focussed
around a breeding program that focuses on genotype assembly, pedigree
development, and clonal release. The associated, supportive research would
consist of applicable physiology, molecular biology, pathology, entomology, and
silviculture. This research approach would not only lead to the requisite
deliverables but should also result in the fastest, most cost-effective gain in
terms of understanding these processes. Currently, two such centers exist, with
a third planned for <I>Populus</I> in FY 1993. No crop development centers for
species other than <I>Populus</I> are currently being funded by the BFDP.
</P>
<P>Anticipated accomplishments with poplars include the development of insect-
and disease-resistant poplars. This research will remain a high priority through
1996, when a set of new clones will be identified based on greenhouse and
nursery studies. Field testing of the clones should result in public release
throughout 1998 to 2002. It is anticipated that selection of superior
<I>Populus</I> hybrids will be possible based on molecular marker-assisted
selection. Early selection criteria based on physiological parameters will also
be available to poplar breeders by 1996. Increased emphasis on selecting and
breeding poplar clones for high yields under less than optimum soil and climatic
conditions will be required to ensure that SRWC can potentially supply
significant quantities of energy to the United States. With the initiation of
the woody crop breeding program in the Southeast, it is anticipated that new
plant materials may be available by 2002. With accelerated breeding efforts in
all regions, it is anticipated that superior selections would be capable of
producing 22 dry Mg&#183;ha<SUP>-1</SUP>&#183;yr<SUP>-1</SUP> under optimum
conditions and 1 to 6 dry Mg&#183;ha<SUP>-1</SUP>&#183;yr<SUP>-1</SUP>under
average conditions.
</P>
<P>In addition to the Crop Development Centers, the SRWC research will need to
support short-term task-specific projects that (1) need not be duplicated in
each center, (2) have broad application, or (3)  are exploratory in nature. The
following list includes some of the anticipated task-specific areas for which
projects should be initiated.
</P>
<P></P>

<LI>Development of site quality/site index prediction functions for poplars in
the Midwest and elsewhere in the United States.
</LI>
<LI>Vegetative propagation of selected sycamore genotypes, including
examination of apomixis as a mechanism of clonal propagation.
</LI>

<H3>HERBACEOUS ENERGY CROPS RESEARCH</H3>
<P><B>Background and Research Strategy</B>
</P>
<P>Research on the biofuels potential of herbaceous crops has developed much
more recently than has that for woody crops. The objectives have been very
similar in some respects with a common emphasis on high-yielding crops that can
be grown economically over a wide area with minimum adverse effect on the
environment. Although herbaceous crops do not currently provide quite as wide a
spectrum of product endpoints as woody crops do, their very high productivity,
high adaptability, and landowner compatibility provide important incentives for
their incorporation into the BFDP.
</P>
<P>In 1984, a series of ten herbaceous research projects began at widespread
locations across the eastern and midwestern United States. A total of 35 
species was examined in these initial screening studies, which were designed to
examine yield potential, biochemical composition, and best management practices
across a wide diversity of sites. The completion of several of these studies and
the examination of data on yield potential, production economics, and regional
site potential, led in 1991 to the selection of a perennial forage grass,
switchgrass (<I>Panicum virgatum</I>), as a model species for further research.
 The rationale for selection of a single species was to concentrate and thereby
improve the overall efficiency of the many interrelated aspects of research that
were seen as requisite for biofuels production. Although more than one species
will certainly be required ultimately, switchgrass was seen as an excellent
beginning with the available programmatic resources.
</P>
<P>The selection of switchgrass as a model species was based on several
important considerations. As a widely adapted endemic species of the tall grass
prairies, switchgrass has demonstrated a capacity for high yields on relatively
poor quality sites. Maximum yields on test plots in Auburn, Alabama, have been
33 dry Mg&#183;ha<SUP>-1</SUP>&#183;year<SUP>-1</SUP>, well above the
production level considered prerequisite for a successful biofuels industry. A
large and deep root system is the key to high production and soil improvement on
poor quality sites. Research at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State
University has shown that soil organic carbon was increased by 30% during a
4-year cycle, indicating that switchgrass has a significant capacity to improve
soil quality by sequestering carbon belowground. Improved erosion control,
reduced fertilizer and pesticide requirements, and a capacity for providing
wildlife cover are additional positive environmental attributes.  An important
quality of switchgrass is its strong potential appeal to landowners, for whom
cultivation of a perennial crop that can be grown, harvested, and stored with
conventional equipment represents an easy interface with current agricultural
practices.
</P>
<P><B>Summary of Preceding Cultural and Variety Selection Research Progress</B></P>
<P>During the past year, research on herbaceous biofuels crops has included the
completion of species screening and productivity research (at Auburn University
and the University of Kentucky) and the continuation of three projects designed
to evaluate cultural and genetic attributes of predominantly perennial grass
species and associated cultural practices for the upper Midwest (at USDA
Lincoln, North Dakota State, and Iowa State).
</P>
<P><IMG SRC="methods.gif" ALT="Productivity Research graph" ALIGN="RIGHT">A
review of the past 7  years of herbaceous crop screening research, some of which
will be completed during the current year, reveals several significant measures
of progress. A summary of progress in productivity research that has resulted
from this work is provided in Fig. 1. It generalizes the relative improvement of
yields or establishment success in research plots with various cultural
treatments and/or selection procedures. Obviously, these improvements do not
have linear additive potential in terms of final yield attained, but do
demonstrate on a relative scale gains that can be made through productivity
research. Most notable are the yield improvements (110%) made in the choice of
our initial principal switchgrass cultivar, Cave-in-Rock, compared with average
yields for hay, and the further improvement (180%) made with selection of the
highest-yielding variety to date, Alamo. Site quality, harvest frequency, and
weed control all have been shown to be important factors in promoting or
protecting switchgrass yields. Nitrogen fertilization to date has been effective
only on poorer quality sites with typically little or no effect at levels above
70 Kg/ha. On more fertile sites, effects have typically been negative to
neutral. Nitrogen use efficiency and its relationship to root/rhizosphere
function remains an area of future interest and utility for ecological/economic
interactions.
</P>
<P>Plant breeding represents the only approach not previously used within the
program. In previous grass breeding research, genetic gain in yield has been
approximately  5% per cycle. Test of genetic variability in yield and in
biochemical constituents known to be related to foliar nutritional value of
switchgrass for cattle have been evaluated within the program as a basis of
future breeding effort. Significant genetic differences in tissue biochemical
content have been found across 23 wild accessions of switchgrass and in 20
developed cultivars. Such information may form the basis of future breeding
efforts to select for both yield mass and quality. The utility of several of
these nutritive indicators for ethanol yield is currently being evaluated in a
collaborative project with NREL biochemists.
</P>
<P> Overall, the initial species screening studies provided the data on which
to select the model perennial species, switchgrass, for further programmatic
emphasis. In addition, several other promising species were identified,
including sorghum and sorghum-sudangrass for the Midwest and tropical grasses
for the deep South. The remaining research in this initial screening effort will
be completed in three projects in the upper Midwest during the current year.
These sites include North Dakota State, Iowa State, and the USDA-ARS site at
Lincoln, Nebraska. The new research described in the following subsections
builds heavily on progress made in these and other first-phase screening work.
</P>
<P>Important logistical aspects of switchgrass production and handling relative
to its use as in biofuels production were also evaluated during the past year. A
collaborative study between Purdue University and NREL led to important
estimates of the integrity of switchgrass bales under long-term storage
practices. Their estimate of a very low 5% loss rate over 10 months (with proper
storage conditions) provides encouraging indications of more flexible
supply/demand relations for this seasonal perennial crop.
</P>
<P><B>Initiation of New Research Projects</B></P>
<P>With the release of a Request for Proposals in November of 1991, the process
of building on and extending the results obtained during the first research
phase began. Important findings from the earlier research that aided in the
focus of this new research included the following: (1) selection of
best-yielding varieties, (2)  estimates of consistency of high yields across
soil types and climatic conditions, (3) optimization of fertilization responses
and harvesting strategies, and (4) quantification of impacts on soil erosion and
soil organic matter. Six new projects were selected by March of 1992 with a
focus that was divided between near-term, production-oriented research on the
best available varieties and the longer-term breeding, physiology, and
biotechnology requirements for protecting and improving future yields.
Collectively, these six new research projects combine both near-term production
research with longer-term development needs in an approximate 3:2 ratio.
</P>
<P>The six new research projects included three regional field trials to verify
and improve yield potential of selected cultivars, a breeding project to search
for new improved varieties, a physiology project to develop indices of yield
potential, and a tissue culture project to develop advanced techniques for plant
propagation. Progress in each of these areas is highlighted below.
</P>
<P><B>Regional field trials and cultural improvements. </B>Three projects, at
Virginia Polytechnic Institute, Auburn University, and Texas A&amp;M University,
were selected to represent, respectively, the mid-Atlantic, Southeast, and
southcentral subregions of the targeted southern United States. A total of 18 of
the planned 19 field sites for switchgrass variety evaluations were established
in 1992. Research on establishment techniques, fertilization requirements,
cultural management, and harvesting strategies are important components of this
research. In addition, at most sites initial soil characterization will allow
measurement of changes in soil nutrient status, including soil organic carbon,
over time.
</P>
<P><B>Plant breeding. </B>A single project at Oklahoma State University was
selected for efforts to improve existing lines of switchgrass for biomass
potential. Initial efforts are focusing on breeding across four populations
representing upland and lowland ecotypes. Both hexaploid and tetraploid
genotypes are represented within each ecotype. A new detached culm technique has
been successfully tested for switchgrass for the first time in this work and has
allowed the first of three breeding cycles of Recurrent Restricted Phenotypic
Selection to be completed in the first growing season. A switchgrass nursery has
been established, with 63 accessions having been obtained to date from several
sources.
</P>
<P><B>Physiology. </B>Plant physiological studies are centered at ORNL and
emphasize the development of physiological indicators for selection and
evaluation of superior plant growth potential. To date, measurements of foliar
gas exchange, photosynthesis and dark respiration, and biomass partitioning have
been used in greenhouse studies. These indicators have been used to contrast the
carbon gain potential of six upland and six lowland ecotypes over two cutting
cycles. A lack of significant differences among genotypes under these conditions
suggested that genotype-site adaptation in the field plays a very important role
in yield potential and will lead to increased emphasis on parallel physiological
evaluation in field studies during the upcoming season.
</P>
<P><B>Tissue culture studies. </B>Tissue culture studies begun at The
University of Tennessee in July of 1992 have already achieved remarkable
success. Although no formal procedures had developed for producing switchgrass
from tissue culture before the project began, a variety of techniques for
producing switchgrass callus have already been successfully tested. Node
culture, shoot culture, and mature embryo culture of two cultivars have all been
shown to produce callus tissue from which seedlings have been regenerated.
Flower production from callus, in one case, has provided some indication that
tissue culture systems for selection as well as propagation may be an important
tool in future switchgrass yield improvement research.
</P>
<P><B>Future Plans</B>
</P>
<P>The new switchgrass research projects offer some exciting challenges for
integrating production, breeding, propagation, and physiology research in the
future. As newly established research plots across the Southeast move into their
more productive postestablishment years, the associated basic and applied
research on yield limiting factors will increase the amount of information
gained from these studies. Opportunities for integrating physiology,
breeding,and tissue culture techniques will increase as breeding cycles are
applied and propagation techniques increase available test material for
selection and validation. In parallel with the southeastern research, plans are
under way to extend research with the USDA-ARS research team at Lincoln,
Nebraska, to develop parallel ongoing research for the upper Midwest. This will
probably include establishment, management, cytogenetic, and breeding research.
</P>
<P>In addition to production-oriented research, it has become increasingly
clear that interfacing available production techniques with landowner
preferences will be a critical consideration for development of the technology.
Both a landowner survey and a regional case study of land and harvesting
strategies will be completed during the coming year to help identify and
consider the important links between herbaceous biofuels production, landowner
opinions, and current agricultural systems.

<H3>Environmental Research: Background and Research Strategy</H3>
<P>ORNL has proactively pursued the quantification of environmental
implications of Dedicated Feedstock Systems. Areas of evaluation include biomass
production, harvest, delivery, and storage. Concerns and opportunities fall into
three major categories: emissions, sustainability, and biodiversity. ORNL is
pursuing collaborative inquiries with environmental groups, business, regulatory
groups, and other research institutions alike to document environmental benefits
and resolve environmental issues before they become problems.
</P>
<P>The Electric Power Research Institute, the National Wood Energy Association,
the National Audubon Society, NREL, DOE, and the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency all agree that if biofuels are to contribute more than several gigajoules
of energy, the use of dedicated cellulosic crops will be necessary. This may
involve tens of millions of hectares of agricultural land. Consequently, much of
ORNL's analysis effort is concentrated on understanding the environmental
effects of energy crop deployment.
</P>
<P>Full biomass energy fuel cycle analyses in which ORNL has participated
indicate that the major environmental benefits and risks associated with energy
crop production stem from agricultural land use change. The rapid development of
a biomass energy industry could also lead to concerns about excessive forest
harvesting, agricultural and forest residue utilization (beyond sustainable
limits), energy conversion facility emissions, and water quality impacts.
Analogies to biofuel systems are scarce. DFSS based on energy crops differ from
both traditional agriculture and forestry practices, and cellulosic biofuel
conversion facility technologies are different in many respects from pulp and
paper facilities. Wood-burning utilities that already exist are a poor analogy
for the more efficient biomass systems that are likely to be commercialized in
the future. Comparison of the possible environmental risks of bioenergy systems
with the known environmental risks of fossil fuel systems indicate that
responsibly implemented biomass energy systems can offer significant benefits.
</P>
<P>In FY 1992 and into FY 1993, ORNL has targeted research efforts in three
areas. The first addresses how energy crops may compete for agricultural land
and what condition that land is in. This is necessary to understand the
environmental implications of energy crops as well as cost-supply relationships.
The second effort is to identify wildlife and ecosystem diversity associated
with energy crop deployment. This involves the collection of field data on
biodiversity of energy crops, alternative land uses, and whole landscapes. The
third effort has been to develop a better grasp of energy crop sustainability
and interaction of energy crops production with controversial issues such as
wetlands use, forest harvesting, agrichemical movement, and valuation of
environmental externalities. Because there is yet no cellulosic liquid fuels
industry, ORNL has found working partners in research with utilities,
agribusiness, and the forest products industry for field investigations.
</P>
<P><B>Environmental Research and Analysis Highlights</B></P>
<P><IMG
SRC="price.gif" ALT="Graph - Price of delivered wood" ALIGN="RIGHT" WIDTH="400" HEIGHT="318"><B>Cost-supply
relationships and land use change</B>. ORNL is using its GIS and resource
assessment capabilities, in collaboration with other groups, to predict where
energy crops may be grown. The methodologies for analyzing energy crop
cost-supply relationships were first developed by using an East Tennessee
conversion facility that requires 400-dry Mg/d of wood. Land projected to be
brought into energy crop production varied as a function of amount needed,
hauling expenses, yields, and income from other crops.  Figure 2  illustrates
the relationship between biomass price, amount of land (biomass supply), and
distance from the East Tennessee conversion facility. The lower the region
number, the closer the land is to the facility. Net changes in percentage of
cropland utilized, net change in fertilizer use, change in erosion rates, and
farm income were calculated from this study. One important finding was that the
most-productive croplands would be converted to woody crops before
less-productive croplands. The conversion of this type land, however, would
result in reduced erosion and chemical use in the region closest to the power
plant.
</P>
<P><B>Documentation of energy crop biodiversity and landscape issues</B>.
<IMG SRC="transect.gif" ALT="Regional Site Map" ALIGN="RIGHT">An elaborate
interagency network was established to assess bird and small mammal diversity
within short-rotation wood energy crops. Although efforts are concentrated at
ten sites at seven locations simulating a regional transect (Fig. 3), additional
sites in Canada and the Pacific Northwest are under study to validate the
Midwest findings. Findings show that by the fourth or fifth growing season, bird
diversity is greater in woody crop plantations than in pine plantations,
rowcrops, pastures, hayland, and native vegetation in early successional stages.
However, bird diversity is less in woody crop plantations than in mature
woodland. Small mammal censuses yielded mixed results. Effects of woody crop
plantations on landscape diversity appears to be most pronounced where 80 to 90%
of the vegetation is in either agriculture or forests. Where more equal mixes
occur, woody crop plantings do not add or detract from the landscape patterns.
</P>
<P>Additional work has been directed toward plant diversity beneath energy
crops. The Michigan State Long Term Ecological Research Site (LTER), the only
agricultural LTER, has provided important data toward this end. Results indicate
that the understory vegetation in SRWC is statistically as diverse as old field
succession and no-till corn for the first 3  years. Trends in diversity,
especially of shade-tolerant species, suggest that understory diversity will
continue to increase during the 6- to 10-year rotation of a SRWC stand.
</P>
<P><B>Assessment of energy crop sustainability</B>. Nutrient cycling occurs to
a greater extent in most energy crops than in most agricultural crops. However
sustained soil nutrient availability is not well documented in these crops
because of the time and expense involved in experimentation. ORNL recently
completed a study that evaluated the effect of fertilizer timing on nutrient
cycle efficiency in an American sycamore plantation. This study indicated very
high nitrogen retention rates (no groundwater pollution), except for the
one-time-only treatment of 450 Kg/ha urea in the first year. The fertilization
treatment that started at low rates and increased with tree size appeared to be
most efficient. Spring and fall leaf phenology were unaffected by fertilization
strategy. Of many possible nutrient stress indicators, nitrogen concentration in
leaves appeared to be the most reliable, but better indicators are needed.
American sycamore did not increase nitrogen concentrations in wood but tended to
recycle the nutrient externally through leaf fall and root capture to attain
higher productivity.
</P>
<P><B>Other Environmental Issues</B></P>
<P>Because woody crops perform best on moist sites and appear capable of
tolerating some amount of flooding, an interesting question arises about energy
crop deployment might interact with the use of natural wetlands, farmed
wetlands, and wet croplands. A draft synthesis paper has been prepared that
reviews wetland types, wetland definitions, wetland functions, causes for
wetlands destruction, and wetlands programs. The paper also discuss
characteristics of energy crops with respect to habitats, chemical use, and land
requirements and speculates on the effect energy crops would have on modifying
the habitats of wet croplands. The report concludes that many wetland functions
could be restored to &quot;farmed and prior converted&quot; wetlands by slightly
modified energy crop production techniques. However, this would be problematic
for landowners if their farmed or prior converted wetlands were to be
reclassified and made subject to wetlands regulations. The relative value to
society of potential energy crop benefits such as soil conservation, increased
biodiversity, improved farm incomes, and reductions in nonpoint agrichemical
pollution such as fertilizer runoff deserves special attention.
</P>
<P><B>Future Plans</B></P>
<P>Environmental assessment and research are areas of the program in which
major expansion in work effort is needed and anticipated. As utilities and
eventually biofuel conversion facilities begin to evaluate seriously the option
of using cellulosic feedstocks, many questions will need to be immediately
answered to facilitate the permitting process. ORNL is trying to anticipate
these questions and to begin the research and assessments that will be needed to
answer the questions. Environmental assessments will be conducted under the
newly formed &quot;Integrated Systems&quot; task, whereas environmental research
requiring data collection will stand alone as a separate task.
</P>
<P>As part of the Integrated Systems task, plans are under way to use
environmental risk analysis methodologies developed at ORNL to assess biomass
energy systems risks. The considerable expertise available at ORNL on National
Energy Policy Act (NEPA) regulations will be drawn upon to determine NEPA
implications for energy crop production, handling and storage, and conversion
facility citing. It is our hope that a guideline for biomass energy systems
feasibility assessments, which considers the full range of economic,
environmental, and social effects, can be prepared in the relatively near
future.
</P>
<P>Because the north central region and the Midwest are considered to be prime
areas for energy crop deployment, three more cost-supply curves are under
development in Illinois, Minnesota, and North Dakota. This will not only provide
site-specific information but will allow us to determine whether cost-supply
patterns will differ greatly from location to location or enough similarities
exist for making broad generalizations in a region. Once the cost-supply
relationship are integrated with information from field investigations and
models on biodiversity, agrichemical retention, and soil carbon, much better
estimates of environmental risks and benefits can be made.
</P>
<P>A regionwide study of energy crop supply has been initiated with the
Tennessee Valley Authority for its electric service region. The study is
evaluating the potential availability of wastes and residues as well as
dedicated energy crops within reasonable haul distances of several facilities
that may be candidates for burning biomass in combination with fossil fuels
(co-firing). Preliminary data indicate that relatively large quantities of
energy crops could potentially be available at less than $50/dry Mg. Full
results should be published within the next year.
</P>
<P>The Environmental Research task will work to collect needed data.
Insufficient data on fates of chemicals in energy crop systems and soil nutrient
sustainability exists to predict the long-term impacts of energy crop systems.
An interagency agreement with USDA's Tilth Laboratory in Iowa will initiate
preliminary effort toward understanding how chemicals applied to energy crops
will move through hydrologic and ecological pathways. Identifying water quality
effects of energy crops is a high priority. More comprehensive efforts are
anticipated in FY 1993. To address soil nutrient sustainability questions, some
modest effort is being directed toward the study of belowground diversity and
dynamics (soil ecology). Soil ecology may be the best single integrated
indicator of ecological function, sustainability, and biodiversity.
</P>
<P>Even if the case can be made that biomass energy systems that use dedicated
energy crops produce overall benefits relative to fossil fuels systems and
alternate land uses, there will still be considerable interest and concern about
the environmental or ecological impacts of energy crop systems. For instance,
concern exists about the increase in nuisance species that might inhabit energy
crops. These types of questions cannot be answered until large plantings exist.
As large plantings begin to be established by utilities or the biofuels
industry, the Environmental Research task will plan studies to document results
and assist in the development of best management practices.

<H3>Economic Analysis and Integration: Background and Strategy</H3>
<P>The Economic Analysis and Integration component seeks to ensure that all
activities affecting the overall viability of biomass-based fuel cycles are
understood and considered in program planning and research. This task includes
the translation of research results into projections of estimated biomass
production costs. Conversely, research in this task also indicates levels of
production parameters that must be achieved to achieve the program cost goal.
</P>
<P>Activities undertaken last year included starting on a project to develop
energy crop supply curves for ethanol produced from corn; estimation of the
energy inputs used in fertilizers and pesticides; and estimation of biomass
transportation costs. Also, a synthesis study based on existing information for
the Office of Technology Assessment of the U.S. Congress on biomass supplies,
employment impacts, and environmental consequences; and estimation of supplies
of biomass from existing forestry activities or forest resources. The goals of
these activities are to estimate biomass resource availability and resource
requirements (e.g.,  land, energy, soil erosion).
</P>
<P><B>1992 Research Highlights</B></P>
<P><B>National supply and environmental modeling</B>. One often asked question
is how much biomass can regionally be supplied? To this question should be added
at what price. A project under way in conjunction with The University of
Tennessee is going to give us an answer to this question. On a regional basis,
we are estimating what quantity of energy crops, and also corn, can be grown at
what price. We are looking at corn because this is now the primary feedstock for
ethanol production. In the future, we expect energy crops to play a larger role
than corn.
</P>
<P><IMG
SRC="arims.gif" ALT="ARIMS supply model" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="500" HEIGHT="369">The
basic scheme of the modeling system is presented in  Fig. 4.  The Agricultural
Resource Interregional Modelling System (ARIMS) is a linear programming model of
crop and livestock production in the United States. As a linear program, ARIMS
has the disadvantage of having fixed quantities of production regardless of the
price. To deal with this shortcoming, we have linked ARIMS with an econometric
model of U.S. agriculture known as POLYSIM. Inputs to ARIMS are provided from
the Erosion Productivity Impact Calculator (EPIC) and Budget Planner, a model
that generates crop budgets.
</P>
<P>The purpose of this modeling system is to develop a framework that will
produce price-quantity data so that simple supply curves can be estimated for
biomass feedstock production and impacts on soil erosion and chemical use can be
estimated. By providing enough data points, we can econometrically estimate a
supply curve that, once estimated, can be used without having to run the large
modeling system. Supply curves will be estimated for energy crops and corn.
</P>
<P><B>CO<SUB>2</SUB> and Biomass Production</B></P>
<P><IMG SRC="co2.gif" ALT="CO2 emissions graph" ALIGN="LEFT">Papers were
published in FY 1992 on CO<SUB>2</SUB> emissions associated with
corn-to-ethanol production (Marland and Turhollow 1991) and from energy crop
production (Turhollow and Perlack 1991). For corn to ethanol, about 25% of the
CO<SUB>2</SUB> emissions are from producing the corn grain and 75% from fossil
fuels used in the process of converting it from grain to ethanol. How the
by-products from the process are treated is important in determining CO<SUB>2</SUB>
emissions allocated to the ethanol. In the base case, CO<SUB>2</SUB> emissions
(as C) for ethanol from corn are estimated at 16.45 kg/GJ. As a point of
reference, gasoline has CO<SUB>2</SUB> emissions of 20.76 kg/GJ. The base case
assumes that coal is the source of energy for the conversion process, and the CO<SUB>2</SUB>
credit for the by-products is based on displacement of soybean meal on a protein
equivalent basis. Net CO<SUB>2</SUB> emissions can be as low as 4.73 kg/GJ of
ethanol if biomass is used as the fuel for the conversion process  (Fig. 5).
</P>
<P><IMG
SRC="fig6.gif" ALT="Emission comparison graph" ALIGN="RIGHT" WIDTH="450" HEIGHT="335">Energy
crops provide greater energy output per unit of energy input than corn and,
hence, CO<SUB>2</SUB> output is relatively lower. Estimates of CO<SUB>2</SUB>
emissions were made for a SRWC (hybrid poplar), an annual grass (sorghum), and a
perennial grass (switchgrass). Standing yields (i.e., yields before accounting
for all losses) are assumed to be 14, 15.8, and 13 dry Mg/ha for hybrid poplar,
sorghum, and switchgrass, respectively, under current production technology.
After accounting for losses, which are assumed to be 19, 16, and 31%, CO<SUB>2</SUB>
emissions were 1.30, 1.84, and 1.93 kg/GJ for hybrid poplar, sorghum, and
switchgrass, respectively, under current production technology. For future
technology, for which we assume higher yields, lower transportation energy
requirements, and slightly lower energy losses, CO<SUB>2</SUB> emissions are
between 1.1 and 1.7 kg/GJ, significantly lower than that for fossil fuels  (Fig.
6).
</P>

the energy crops are used for electricity production, then Fig. 6 represents a
fair comparison of energy crops to fossil fuels (if the fuels have equal thermal
conversion efficiencies to electricity). For liquid fuels, the biomass must be
processed and thermal conversion efficiency is most likely to range from about
40% today to as high as 70% in the future. CO<SUB>2</SUB> emissions from
producing ethanol from energy crops with an assumed thermal conversion
efficiency of 40% and no exogenous energy sources required are less than 25%
those of gasoline  (Fig. 7).  There may also be differences in fuel efficiency
between ethanol and gasoline that are not accounted for in Fig. 7.
</P>
<P><B>Future Plans</B></P>
<P>The Economic Analysis and Integration task will become part of the
Integrated Systems Task. During 1993 our estimation of baseline national supply,
and environmental monitoring will be finished. From this, we will develop simple
supply curves that can be widely used. The work with the Energy Information
Administration and the Office of Technology Assessment of the U.S. Congress will
be completed; from existing data we will have developed supply curves for
conventional wood sources (e.g., whole tree chips, logging residues, mill
residues). These are basically national-scale assessments, although there are
regionalized supply curves. When commercialization occurs, it will be at a local
scale.
</P>
<P>Assessments must also be made at the local scale. We will undertake more
site-specific analyses that will focus on impacts on the local economy, such as
the impact of a single or small number of conversion facilities on a multicounty
area. Among the impacts of interest are job creation and local business
activity.

<H3>Information Management</H3>
<P>During this reporting period, increased emphasis was placed on information
management and dissemination activities as it became apparent that formal
mechanisms would be needed to retrieve the massive amount of information
available at ORNL as well as to respond to an ever-increasing number of
information requests. To this end, several activities were undertaken or
enhanced. Personal computer-based data bases were either created or expanded to
serve as repositories and analysis tools for the data and materials supplied by
principal investigators. Publication of
<I>Energy Crops Forum,</I> a newsletter, commenced. The extensive collection of
multimedia resources was organized and catalogued, and the development of
customized information packages was begun.</P>
<P>Since ORNL began acting as the technical manager for the DOE in 1978 for
what is now the BFDP, more than 50 universities, USDA Forest Service
laboratories, private individuals, and commercial organizations have funnelled
information and research data to ORNL in fulfillment of contractual obligations
as well as for use in regional and national assessments.</P>
<P>This information has been received in many different forms: numeric data
reporting on research results, journal articles and reports, slides and
photographs, unpublished papers and letters. In addition, the program staff has
amassed a voluminous collection of materials related to all aspects of
production and use of energy crops to assist them in analyzing the results of
the funded work.</P>
<P>In 1984, in response to the need to be able to simultaneously analyze
numeric data from more than one research project at a time, the Short Rotation
Woody Crops Data Base project was begun. The data base contains the location and
type of field trials established with programmatic funding or co-funding, tracks
actual and estimated growth and biomass yield data and cultural practices, and
transforms the information previously reported in various units and styles into
units of information that can easily be compared and analyzed. This data base
currently has almost 14 year's worth of information for more than 300 separate
data elements for more than 25 projects.</P>
<P>A companion effort to computerize field data in a centrally available
location was begun for herbaceous energy crops projects during this reporting
period. This data base will also contain the location and type of field trials,
growth and biomass yield data, and cultural practices will standardize the
measurement units. Although the current data base design is being reviewed, data
have been entered for seven completed projects with plans to incorporate data
from two additional completed projects and new switchgrass research in the near
future.</P>
<P>These two datasets, both alone and singly, are unique in their regional and
national scope. As an example of the readily retrievable data, Table 1 provides
an overview of recently reported biomass data for woody and herbaceous field
studies.

<P></P>
<P>The principal investigators, under contract to the program and the staff at
ORNL, have been extremely prolific writers, resulting in more than 2000 reports,
journal articles, papers, theses, and dissertations. In 1988, a bibliographic
data base was created to index these materials for two reasons to ensure
accessibility and to document program activities. Additional books, reports,
conference proceedings, and reprints have also been collected to support
in-house analyses and assessments. During this reporting period, a graduate
student in library science from The University of Tennessee designed a subject
category shelving system for this exceptional collection of materials, as well
as creating another bibliographic data base. Recently, the two data bases were
combined, resulting in a file with more than 3500 keyworded entries that will be
the cornerstone for an all-inclusive update to a bibliography originally
published in 1989.</P>
<P>Because ORNL is recognized as the premier authority on feedstock production
issues, there are frequent requests for information. Not only is the
bibliographic data base searched on an almost daily basis to identify and
retrieve relevant materials, as is the 2700 record data base of slides and
photographs that illustrate programmatic achievements. Work has just been
initiated on the creation of subject-specific information packages composed of
relevant reprints and reports, which will facilitate quick response to the
numerous information requests.</P>
<P>In the early part of 1991, a decision was made to begin publishing a
newsletter. The objectives were to (1) facilitate communication and an awareness
of ongoing research among the research community, (2) transfer research results
to those outside the research community, and (3) identify and develop a
constituency for energy crops research. Initial efforts consisted of the
identification of members of the target audience, which was defined as an
international community of researchers in academia, government organizations and
private industry, policy and decisionmakers at all levels of government, private
citizens, public interest groups, and media contacts. The first issue of
<A HREF="../../forum/91fall.html"><I>Energy Crops Forum</I></A>, published in
the fall of 1991, was sent to approximately 1200 people. The reaction to the
newsletter exceeded all expectations, with almost 75% of the original recipients
indicating a desire to continue receiving it as well as yielding more than 300
additional subscriber names. Referrals by current recipients and citations in
other publications resulted in additional subscribers. The distribution list is
hovering just beneath the 2000 level, and new subscription requests are being
received almost daily.</P>

<BODY
BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" TEXT="#238E23" LINK="#855e42" VLINK="#5c3317" ALINK="#000000">
<H3>Future Directions</H3>
<P>Research, development, and demonstration of dedicated feedstock supply
systems is needed at a much broader scale than is currently planned by ORNL's
BFDP. For the past 14 years, BFDP has been developing a technology for a future
in which large amounts of biofuels are desired for energy self-sufficiency,
global carbon mitigation, and rural economic enhancement. That future is
approaching rapidly. There is a need to apply the knowledge already gained to
demonstrate that our vision of significant contribution of biofuels to the U.S.
economy can be a reality. This demands that a near-term integration and
demonstration effort be added to ongoing long-term research and development
activities.
</P>
<P>The near-term research needs can best be understood by considering the
efforts needed to facilitate commercial success at a single-facility level. The
question currently being asked by both federal funding agencies and private
sector investors is &quot;what locations offer the greatest opportunity for
success with the current technology?&quot; Integrated systems assessments could
answer this question. Such assessments are required so that the complex
interactions between and among energy markets, energy crops and cropping
systems, the environment, economics, supply logistics, National Environmental
Policy Act requirements, agricultural programs, and energy policies can be
defined and evaluated. The newly planned Integrated Systems task within BFDP
will include such activities as GIS analysis; complete fuel cycle analysis;
economic, environmental, and sociological impact studies; landscape modeling;
national and regional cost-supply modeling; tax effect studies; CO<SUB>2</SUB>
assessments; and nonmarket benefit valuations. Some of these activities will be
conducted by cooperating in feasibility studies for specific studies, whereas
others will be more generic. The combined knowledge provided by these
assessments will provide the ORNL staff with a holistic understanding of biomass
energy systems that can be used to guide the development of commercial projects
both in the United States and internationally.
</P>
<P>Assuming that one or more specific sites are selected for federally funded
scale-ups or demonstrations of integrated biomass energy systems that use
dedicated biomass feedstocks, energy crop technologies previously developed for
the general region will need to be adapted to the specific site. It will be
important to synthesize energy crop information already available for the
general region into &quot;how-to&quot; guides specifically designed to assist
farmers and industry in making decisions on which and what levels of energy
crops to produce. Demonstration plantings should be established, and extension
efforts should be initiated through traditional farmer's networks and
information resources. Organization of field days to demonstrate planting and
management techniques will be important. The best available tree seedling and/or
herbaceous crop seed mixtures will need to be made available to local nurseries
or seed producers to begin the process of multiplying the best available
materials. Demonstrations will have the greatest likelihood for success if
expertise on energy crop production (developed by previous BFDP-funded research)
is already available in the region. Although it may be reasonable for ORNL staff
to be involved in the development of one or two specific projects, the role of
ORNL staff is anticipated normally to be that of advisors and providers of
general information to local project developers. The ability of BFDP to fund
site-specific demonstration activities will be severely limited at current
budget levels. BFDP will be seeking ways to participate in such demonstrations,
however, so that environmental data can be collected and used for environmental
impact analysis and for designing more environmentally sound biomass energy
systems.
</P>
<P>To maintain a program with a national and long-term focus, technology
development strategy is needed that is diverse and broad in its approach. A
critical element is developing additional energy crops and cropping systems for
several regions of the country. The crops and cropping technology available
today simply will not supply the amounts of biomass desired at the costs desired
on the national scale. New crops will be needed to suit different soil types, to
reduce risks, to optimize environmental benefits, to more effectively utilize
farm labor, and to provide feedstocks in areas with serious climate and/or soil
limitation. Along with the development and genetic improvement of new crops,
research on the ecology of the crops and cropping systems needs to be expanded
to ensure the development and implementation of environmentally sound production
techniques. Because the development of new crops and environmentally sound
cropping systems is a long-term process, it cannot be delayed. This is a large
effort that could and should be shared by both USDA and DOE and as many state,
local, and private research organizations as possible. BFDP's crop development
task will focus on just a few crops so that the value of crop development
efforts can be more quickly demonstrated. Likewise, the environmental research
task will limit its evaluations to (1) those locations and cropping systems with
a high probability of relatively near-term commercial potential and/or (2)
existing commercial plantings.
</P>
<P>To the extent that reducing the risks, both biological and economic, of
producing large acreages of energy crops will become more and more important as
more acres are planted, basic biological research on energy crops will be
necessary to support the emerging industry. Integrated breeding, biotechnology,
and physiological research on selected energy crops will provide both
crop-specific information and new methodologies and tools for addressing
problems associated with pests, diseases, droughts, and other climatic stresses.
This is also a large effort that is expected to need and utilize the resources
of many different research groups. ORNL's BFDP anticipates supporting this type
of effort only in conjunction with crop improvement research.
</P>
<P>The development of biomass energy on a large scale both demands and
justifies the development of specialized harvesting and handling equipment.
Reduction of harvest and handling system costs will be critically important to
making the prices of dedicated feedstocks competitive with other sources of
energy. It will be necessary for the research community to define the equipment
specification, to conduct sufficient engineering systems analysis to clearly
define the systems conditions under which the equipment should be expected to
operate, and to identify the potential market. Private industry, however, is
expected to play a large role in actual equipment production and testing.
</P>
<P>Both near-term and long-term research and implementation activities can be
enhanced by ensuring that information already available is put in the hands of
the people who need it. ORNL has a tremendous resource of materials on energy
crop technology produced through research contracts and gathered by program
staff over the past 14 years. This material needs to be made more accessible to
potential users through efficient information management and value-added
information synthesis products. BFDP has begun serious efforts to effectively
manage biomass energy systems information and to generate useful information
products. Cooperative efforts with NREL are being initiated so that the
information can be presented with a complete biomass energy systems focus.
</P>
<P>ORNL has unique expertise in the biomass energy arena as a result of the
experiences acquired by its BFDP program managers. Four members of the staff
have been with the program for more than 10  years, and most have been
associated with the program for more than 5 years. Consequently, most members of
the BFDP staff are in constant demand for giving presentations to local, state,
national, and international groups; reviewing papers and proposals;
participating in planning meetings and national roundtables; and giving advice
to individuals and groups in the private sector. These activities are presumed
to be valuable to DOE and will be continued to the extent possible. However,
such activities are not always compatible with efficient and effective
management of a diverse research program with projects located across the
nation. ORNL will strive to seek an appropriate balance between technology
transfer and research management activities within the funding limits available.

<H1>Case Study Experiences with Short-rotation Plantations</H1>
<P> Short-rotation plantations are characterized by the establishment of
hardwood species; planted at relatively dense spacings (2,000 to 10,000
trees/ha); closely tended like an agricultural crop with the control of weeds
and pests and the management of nutrients; and harvested on a 2 to 12 year
rotation.<A HREF="notes.html#8">8</A> However, the minimum requirements for
successful commercialization are economically and biologically rigorous. These
minimum requirements include good land, fast-growing plant materials, technical
expertise, and experience. The requirement for experience is not to be taken
lightly, as it is critical to understanding and dealing with all of the
challenges associated with establishing and maintaining short-rotation
plantations.</P>
<P>
</P>
<P> Before discussing the technical and economic aspects of short-rotation wood
plantations, this chapter presents three actual case studies -- the Philippines,
Hawaii, and Brazil. The inclusion of these case studies not only provides
background information on the technical requirments for short-rotation forestry,
but also highlights the importance of experience. For each case study, issues
related to plantation management including establishment, maintenance,
protection, growth and yield, harvesting, and wood transport are discussed.
Chapters that follow will refer back to these case studies as needed and present
addtional experiences as relevant.</P>

<H2>Philippines Case Study</H2>
<P><A HREF="notes.html#9">9</A></P>
<P> In 1979, the Philippine government, recognizing the increased demand for
fuelwood generated by a growing population, and hoping to substitute wood for
imported fuel in some industrial processes, initiated programs aimed at
developing and managing plantations for wood-energy. The government efforts
favored action-oriented programs over those demanding extensive preliminary
research -- over 60,000 ha in energy crops were planted. Planners recognized
that mistakes would occur, but believed that corrections could be made as
programs evolved. Significant problems did emerge and the Philippine experience
offers important insights into factors influencing the success of programs to
support wood-energy plantation development.</P>
<P>
</P>
<P> Various government agencies at the federal level implemented programs
encouraging the development of energy plantations. These included the National
Electrification Administration (NEA), the Farm Systems Development Corporation
(FSDC), the Ministry of Human Settlement (MHS), and the Bureau of Forest
Development (BFD). Programs established ambitious goals and were well-funded.
Provincial, municipal and village plantations were attempted as well, although
few successful plantations developed under local government programs. Private
corporations and individuals also established tree plantations for fuelwood in
areas where markets were dependable.</P>
<P> Programs differed in target audiences (which ranged from small farmers to
corporations), level of financial and technical support provided, and intended
energy markets. For example, the NEA's Dendro Thermal Power Program used wood to
generate electric power for rural power grids, the FSDC's program produced wood
for conversion to charcoal, and the NEA's TANGLAW Program produced wood for a
variety of purposes with the marketing strategy dependent upon the location of
the plantation. </P>
<P>
</P>
<P> While BFD programs are the largest in terms of acreage, the Dendro Program
has been more extensively documented. The Dendro Program anticipated the
development of 60 to 70 wood-fired electric powerplants that would be supported
by multiple energy crop plantations of 1,100 ha or more. Wood to supply the
powerplants would be grown by upland farmers recruited by the NEA rural electric
cooperatives that would manage the projects locally. Farmers were organized into
associations of 10 families each. Support to farmers included: leases of
government land at concessionary rates, loans to defray the costs of plantation
establishment and management, technical assistance, infrastructure development,
guaranteed markets, and health and medical benefits.</P>
<P>
</P>
<P> A report on the Dendro program covering the period 1980 to 1984 indicates
that while planting success improved over time, tree survival and plantation
cost effectiveness varied dramatically. Of 44 project sites, 13 had not yet
established 100 ha of plantations, and five sites had survival rates below 10%.
However, six sites had established more than 400 ha of plantation and nine sites
had survival rates above 80%. Managers attributed this success to site
suitability and secure land tenure. Managers suggested the following as
contributors to failures: unfavorable soil conditions, free-roaming cattle,
inadequate institutional support and poor organization, and the discontinuation
of the farmer loan program. Plantations developed under private initiatives
noted above were often more successful than government projects. Reasons
reported include the establishment of plantations on better quality land and the
provision of more protection to young plantations.</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<H3>Plantation Management</H3>
<P>
<B>Site Selection.</B> While procedures for plantation establishment vary
throughout the Philippines with climatic, edaphic, social, and economic
variations, commonalities may be discerned. The high population density of the
Philippines means that there is a high demand for land in lowland areas with
quality soils. Energy plantations and associated forestry production activities
are usually relegated to roadless sites that are steep, rocky, and infertile.
Surveys of NEA and FSDC energy plantation sites indicate that planting
frequently occurs on 40 to 60 degree slopes, and soils with a pH below 5.0
predominate in some areas. The dry season at many project sites lasts 5 to 7
months. The lack of roads and trails at mountain sites complicates seedling
distribution, silviculture activities, and marketing. Most of the land developed
under NEA, FSDC and MHS programs was previously under BFD management. The BFD
has been accused of refusing to relinquish the better lands under its control.
In some areas, political forces have determined the location of plantations;
these sites have generally produced poor results.</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
<B>Species Selection.</B> One species, the giant ipil-ipil (<I>Leucaena
leucocephala</I>), represents more than 90% of the total area planted. While the
tree grows rapidly, fixes nitrogen in the soil, is easy to manage, coppices
readily after harvesting, produces excellent fuelwood and leaves that provide
high protein livestock feed, it grows poorly at altitudes above 500 m or in
soils with a pH below 5.5. Use of ipil-ipil in inappropriate settings has in
some instances been disasterous. One Dendro Project site lost 1,021 of 1,031 ha
planted. Efforts to diversify the species used are now underway.</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<H3>Plantation Establishment, Tending and Protection</H3>
<P> Plantations are usually established on areas of grass or brush, although
secondary forests are occasionally converted. Clearing, therefore, can usually
be accomplished without chain saws or heavy equipment. Competing vegetation is
removed by slashing with machetes followed by burning. Virtually all tree
planting is done by hand. The recommended spacing is 1 m x 1 m (10,000
trees/ha). Although container grown seedlings have the highest survival rates,
direct seeding is more common. With favorable soil and water conditions, direct
seeding can be as successful as planting seedlings. In some cases, direct
seeding results in overstocked stands because farmers tend to plant several
seeds at each planting mound. Overstocked stands mean few stems grow to desired
diameters. Little thinning occurs for various reasons. Some managers fear
thinning would lead to overcutting, while some farmers feel that returns would
not offset associated labor costs. In many places, upland crops are planted
along with (or before) seedlings and harvested before the tree canopy closes.
Cultivating crops tends to lead to more effective suppression of competing weeds
and grasses and more active protection of trees from fire and livestock. Plowing
is expensive and most slopes are too steep or rocky to permit its use.</P>
<P>
</P>
<P> Plantations require weeding frequently until the trees reach a height of
1.5 to 2.0 m or until the canopy begins to close. At least three weedings at two
month intervals are necessary before trees overtake grasses. Grasses and weeds
are typically cut by hand and placed at the base of young trees for mulch. Upon
reaching 2 m in height, little maintenance is required. Plantations may be
checked two to three times a week to guard against livestock, fires and illegal
woodcutters. Fertilizer is not commonly applied because of its high cost.
Serious psyllid infestations have been encountered in many leucaena plantations;
however, farmers are reluctant to invest in insecticides to protect trees. While
most trees survive, growth may be severely curtailed.</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<H3>Growth, Production, and Harvest</H3>
<P> Growth rates of energy plantations vary greatly, depending on the quality
of the site and plantation management. The NEA plantations experienced annual
growth rates that range from less than 20 m3 (8 tonnes)/ha to 90m3 (36
tonnes)/ha.<A HREF="notes.html#10">10</A> Annual growth averages 40 m3 to 60 m3
(16-24 tonnes)/ha. Under average conditions, trees used for charcoal or firewood
are harvested after 3 years. Subsequent coppice crops may be harvested after 2
years. Plantations producing fuel for dendrothermal powerplants have been
harvested at 3 to 5 years. At this point the trees have a diameter at breast
height of 5 to 13 cm. Coppice crops reach harvestable size in 2 to 4 years.</P>
<P>
</P>
<P> Harvesting and transport are difficult and expensive. At harvest, most
energy crop plantations are clear cut 15 to 25 cm above the ground. Small
branches and tops are trimmed and left in the field. Harvesting is done with
chain saws, machetes or both. In some cases, harvesting with chain saws has been
abandoned in favor of machetes. Unfamiliarity, fuel costs, and maintenance
problems are identified as reasons. A 1981 study by the International Labor
Organization found that handtools were cost competitive with small chain saws.
Harvesting production rates vary with equipment, topography, and the skill,
strength, and stamina of operators and laborers. At the Panalco I site,
individual laborers harvest 1.5 m3 (600 kg) on average each day using machetes.
At Casureco IV, workers with chain saws fell about 30 m3 each day. Trees are
trimmed and stacked by other workers. Daily wages for wood cutters reflect
prevailing rates for unskilled labor. Chain saw operators are considered
semiskilled and receive a wage premium. The pakayao method (pay for work
performed) is applied at most sites.</P>
<P>
</P>
<P> Forwarding wood from the point of harvest to loading stations is a
significant challenge because of rugged topography and the lack of roads and
trails. Initial plans called for the use of motor driven skylines at a number of
plantations. Twenty winch systems were purchased at a per unit cost of
approximately $27,000. However, Durst found that the feeder winches system was
still in use at only one plantation. Experience at Casureco, the plantation
continuing the use of the winches, indicates that considerable time and skill
are required for setup, the winches are not easily transported to rugged
roadless areas, and fuel and maintenance costs are significant.<A
HREF="notes.html#11">11</A> Mono-cable systems have also been criticized for
their high investment cost. Most forwarding is therefore done by manual labor;
workers carry or skid logs down slopes without animal or mechanical assistance.
The process is difficult, time consuming and dangerous. Proposals to aid in the
problem of forwarding logs include suggestions for hand winches, low-cost motor
driven swing winches, skidding using water buffalo, water buffalo powered cable
yarding, and slides constructed of polyethylene pipe. Water buffalo are
practical only where slopes are not steep or unstable. Trucking is the primary
means of transporting wood to markets with truck size and type determined by
road quality. Trucks are loaded and unloaded manually.</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<H3>Observations</H3>
<P> Significant problems were encountered in the Philippine wood-energy
programs in the 1980's. Many plantations failed and overall the Philippine
program would be judged to have been unsuccessful. For plantations that survive,
yields and incomes are often less than expected. Factors contributing to the
failure of these programs include actual yields that fell short of forecast
yields, problems related to the difficulty and cost of forwarding and transport,
irregularities in the administration of project funds, and, in some areas,
problems related to peace and security. Additional problems are specifically
related to the biomass powerplant projects. These include power plant design
deficiencies (particularly related to fuel preparation and handling), and
contracted wood suppliers who sold wood to other markets.</P>
<P>
</P>
<P> Durst suggests that additional research into problem areas is needed for
future program viability.<A HREF="notes.html#12">12</A> Such research would
include: alternative native species; the economic effect of plantation stock
density (maximized biomass vs. increased planting, tending and production
costs); optimal tree size at harvest; alternate forwarding and transport
mechanisms; effects of repeated biomass harvest on soil fertility; and
opportunities for improved project analysis (by adjusting market prices for
distortions due to taxes, subsidies, trade restrictions, etc.).</P>
<P>
</P>
<P> Today the Philippine Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR)
is attempting to attract the private sector to plant trees on open and denuded
government lands. Affordable long term leases are offered on substantial areas
(up to 40,000 ha), on the condition that trees are planted on a specified area
within a specified period of time.</P>
<P>
</P>
<P> Although groups in the Philippines have generally shown little interest for
renewed efforts to produce electricity from biomass, one private sector group is
currently working toward the development and operation of 10 MW electric
powerplants fueled by biomass. Fuel supply is considered the most formidable
hurdle. The plants would be fueled by wood chips and it is estimated that each
10 MW plant would require approximately 155,000 tonnes of green wood chips
annually. About 14,000 ha of marginal land would be needed to sustainably supply
this fuel volume. The proponent proposes a five year crop rotation program, and
desires a long-term fuel supply agreement with a supplier holding at least
30,000 ha under a DENR reforestation program. Fuel delivery would be the
responsibility of the supplier. The proponent indicates that the key criteria in
fuel supplier selection would be a track record in establishing and operating a
tree plantation of at least 15,000 ha, and the financial resources to guarantee
fuel supply. Potential fuel suppliers include logging companies, and pulp and
paper mills.</P>

<H2>Hawaii Case Study</H2>
<P><A HREF="notes.html#13">13</A></P>
<P> Hawaii's current dependence on petroleum as a source of energy, its
distance from sources of fossil fuel, and its history of electric power
generation from bagasse (residue from sugarcane processing) contribute to the
appeal of energy crop production in Hawaii. In 1978, a joint research and
development project to produce woody biomass for energy was initiated between
BioEnergy Development Corporation and the U.S. Forest Service. The U.S.
Department of Energy funded this effort for 10 years through its Short-Rotation
Woody Crops Program. The project resulted in the establishment and management of
289 ha of eucalyptus tree farms.</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<H3>Plantation Management</H3>
<P>
<B>Site Selection.</B> The Hawaii Department of Lands and Natural Resources
inventoried lands within the state for their potential to support forestry
activities. Two categories, prime 1 and prime 2, are most suitable for intensive
culture of <I>Eucalyptus</I> or other fast growing tree species. More than
243,000 ha are included in these categories. Of the 243,000 ha, approximately
93,000 ha now lie fallow or are in sugarcane, brush, range or pasture. Nearly
all the remaining acreage is in forest. Although the bulk of lands suitable for
growing short-rotation energy crops are located on the island of Hawaii, each
major island has significant forest development potential.</P>
<P>
</P>
<P> Field trials were established in two areas on the island of Hawaii, along
the east (Hamakua) coast and south coast (the Ka'u District) at elevations from
300 to 600 m. The Hamakua sites receive 5080 to 6220 mm of rain each year; the
soils are highly weathered silty clay loams developed on volcanic ash. The Ka'u
sites receive 1020 to 2290 mm of rain each year with four or more dry months;
the area has rocky, organic soils that have low nutrient retention capacity.
Total soil nitrogen concentrations vary widely, in both areas. At each of the
two major locations, eight different sites were chosen to represent variations
in elevation, soil characteristics, topographic and climatic conditions. Land
used included recently harvested caneland, abandoned caneland, ranch lands,
wasteland, and forest land. <A HREF="notes.html#14">14</A></P>
<P></P>
<P>
<B>	Species Selection.</B> Ten species trials were established between 1979 and
1984. Thirty species in total, including 15 <I>eucalyptus</I> species and
twelve nitrogen-fixing species, were screened. As a result of the trials, <I>Eucalyptus
saligna</I> and <I>E. grandis</I> were used most extensively in the plantings.
<I>Albizia falcataria</I>, a nitrogen-fixer was chosen for use in mixed
plantings. <I>A. falcataria</I> performed well on wetter areas, but its
performance in the dry sites at Ka'u was judged unsatisfactory. Additionally,
the dense foliage of the species contributed to breakage or blowdown in high
winds, which was a factor at certain test planting locations. Test plantings
indicate that poorly to somewhat poorly drained soils produce low biomass, as do
locations with shallow soils or soils that have experienced substantial erosion.
Researchers concluded that fertilizer application was unlikely to increase
productivity in these settings.</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
<B>Plantation Establishment, Tending and Protection.</B> Planting stock is
raised in small containers (or dibble tubes) at a nursery. The approach is labor
intensive because the size of the operation did not justify investment in a
automated system. About 450,000 seedlings can be produced annually; 150,000 in
each of three four month cycles. The dibble tubes have a volume of 65 cm3, and
are filled with a 2:1 mix of vermiculite and peat moss. After seeding, racks of
tubes (100 tubes/rack) are stored in a roofed shadehouse and watered by an
automated sprinkler several times a day. Germination occurs in 5 to 7 days;
thinning to one plant per tube is done at 3 to 4 weeks. At 4 to 6 weeks (7.5 to
10 cm), seedlings are moved outside to harden off under full sunlight. At the
nursery, rainfall is over 5000 mm/year and, therefore, it is not possible to
harden (acclimatize) the seedlings by withholding water. Outplanting occurs 3.5
to 4.0 months after sowing when seedlings are 30 to 38 cm tall.</P>
<P>
</P>
<P> On abandoned caneland (which had been out of production for periods ranging
from 3 months to 25 years) and wasteland, a low ground-pressure tractor equipped
with wide gauge shoes is used to pull a heavy-duty off-set cutaway harrow. On
very rocky soils, a heavy roller is used to crush vegetation. In areas with
particularly heavy vegetation and brush (e.g., those that had been abandoned for
many years), a tractor equipped with a bulldozer blade is used to knock down
brush so that the harrow or roller can then be used. Vegetation on cleared land
is allowed to regrow 6 to 8 weeks. Similarly, volunteer cane on recently
harvested caneland, is allowed to regrow for 6 to 8 weeks. At this point, the
area to be planted is sprayed with a contact herbicide/pre-emergent herbicide
mixture by a tractor drawn spray rig. However, the pre-emergent herbicide is
ineffective and not used if the soil is mostly covered by mulch.</P>
<P>
</P>
<P> Seedlings are transported to the site in enclosed trucks or trailers to
avoid wind exposure. Because of the small scale of operation, planting is done
manually. A two person crew is used; one worker opens holes with a metal dibble
or spade-like bar and the second worker places the seedling in the hole and
compacts the soil around the hole. About 600 seedlings can be planted per
person-day at Hamakua sites. Planting in the rocky soils at Ka'u requires about
twice as much time (300 seedlings per person-day).</P>
<P>
</P>
<P> Plantings generally receive two fertilizer applications and two herbicide
applications within the first year. Fertilizer is applied at, or soon after,
planting and also at six months following planting. A nitrogen, phosphorus, and
potassium fertilizer (14-14-14) is used. Subsequently, only nitrogen is needed
at most sites. Experiments with mixed plantings of Eucalyptus and Albizia
falcataria, a nitrogen fixer, showed that at some sites it is possible to
eliminate nitrogen applications beyond the first year by establishing
appropriate admixtures of these two species. </P>
<P>
</P>
<P> The first herbicide treatment is provided 2 to 3 months after planting; the
second application is performed only where needed at 5 to 6 months. Manual
backpack sprayers are used. Additional herbicide applications may be needed with
larger tree spacings as crown closure occurs later, however, the larger spacings
also allow the use of mechanized mowing to control competing plants. Special
care is required to avoid spraying the seedlings with herbicides because the
young foliage is extremely susceptible to herbicide damage.</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<H3>Growth, Production, and Harvest</H3>
<P> The spacing of trees in short-rotation plantations affects individual tree
growth rates, stand productivity, plantation management cost, and harvest costs.
Higher planting densities have higher wood production rates in early years, but,
in addition to higher planting costs, an associated decrease in the growth rate
of individual trees results in higher harvesting costs. Although stands planted
at densities of 1.5 m2 and 3.0 m2/tree had the highest biomass production, the
trees were small and, on average, did not attain the minimum acceptable diameter
for cost effective harvesting (15 cm). Increasing growing space had little
effect on tree height in the first two years, but resulted in substantially
taller trees in later years. Tree diameter growth was even more strongly
affected by increased spacing than was tree height. At an age of 6 years, trees
planted with 12 m2 of growing space weighed 2.5 times as much as trees with 3 m2
of space. On a per hectare basis, however, the wider spacing produced only
three-fourths as much biomass by age 6.</P>
<P>
</P>
<P> The accelerating growth of trees (age 5-6 years) that are planted at larger
spacings is an important consideration in decisions on rotation length,
especially if tree size is a significant factor in the cost of harvesting or in
product value. In some cases, the productivity difference between spacing
treatments begins to close rapidly in plantings of this age both in terms of
total biomass and mean annual biomass. At the Chin Chuck test planting, for
example, trees planted with 12 m2 of growing space are adding biomass at the
rate 45 to 50 kg/tree annually, while trees at a 4 m2 spacing are growing at
about 15 kg/tree.</P>
<P>
</P>
<P> Studies on the research plantings have defined the &quot;operating&quot;
maximum diameter density line, the maximum number of trees (tree density) that
can be grown to a given mean stand diameter without incurring levels of
competition that result in a significant number of dead or unusable trees.
Researchers concluded that to achieve a minimum acceptable mean stand d.b.h.
(diameter breast height; approximately 1.4 m above the ground) of 15 cm at 5
years, the initial spacing should allow at least 6.7 m2 of space per tree.</P>
<P>
</P>
<P> Factors, other than growth patterns, affect plantation management and
decisions on issues such as rotation length. Some of these factors, which
include product requirements, nutritional effects, environmental impacts (e.g.,
soil loss), and economic factors, are discussed briefly below. Product
requirements in the use of biomass as fuel do not place significant constraints
on rotation length as the total biomass is usable. In the production of high
quality pulp, however, leaves, bark, and limbs are removed. As bark and foliage
increase as a percent of total biomass as rotation length decreases, the use of
a crop as pulpwood would favor longer rotation periods. Shorter rotation cycles
have the disadvantage of removing more nutrients from a site. Longer rotations
effect nutrient drain in two ways: nutrients are removed from the site less
frequently, and on a per unit biomass basis lower levels of nutrients are
removed. This is the case because Eucalypts appear to have efficient internal
nutrient cycling mechanisms, and, consequently, larger trees have lower average
nutrient levels than do smaller trees.<A HREF="notes.html#15">15</A> With
regard to soil erosion, longer rotations in energy crop production reduce the
potential for erosion because harvesting, which would be performed by clear
cutting, is less frequent. However, compared to current agricultural practice in
many areas suited for Eucalyptus culture, the potential for soil erosion with
tree farms would be low. Sugar plantations on the Hamakua coast currently
harvest to bare soil on a two year cycle, and soil loss can equal or exceed 2.5
to 5 cm/cycle.</P>
<P>
</P>
<P> Harvesting is the single largest cost item in short-rotation tree crops. In
limited harvesting trials in Hawaii, felling, chipping and hauling represented
more than 50% of total wood chip delivery costs. Harvest experience indicates
that logistics and tree size are major determinants of harvesting costs.
Harvesting systems that allow equipment to operate near full capacity will be
important in covering equipment costs. The development of smaller, less
expensive harvest equipment that is more suited to the requirements of
harvesting small diameter trees would also help reduce costs. Studies indicate
that during harvest, tracked equipment caused less damage to tree stumps and
soils than did wheeled equipment. Conventional logging equipment that was
designed for larger trees handled the research trees without difficulty, but the
felling heads caused extensive damage to stumps and this contributed to
unsatisfactory coppicing.</P>
<P>
</P>
<P> Based on information available to date, researchers in Hawaii believe that
three short-rotation management regimes for Eucalyptus are particularly
promising. The first regime consists of pure Eucalyptus stands under the
shortest rotation (5 years) to yield a minimum acceptable tree size (15 cm
d.b.h.). This is achieved with trees planted at a density of 6.5 m2 and regular
fertilizer applications during the rotation cycle. Total biomass yield at
harvest is estimated at 100 dry tonnes/ha (or 20 dry tonnes/ha/annual
productivity). The second regime also consists of pure Eucalyptus stands, but
tree spacing, rotation cycle, and final tree diameter breast high are greater
(11 m2, 6 years, 20 cm d.b.h.). As with Regime No. 1, regular fertilizer
applications are required during the rotation cycle. Total biomass yield is
estimated at 112 dry tonnes/ha or 18.6 dry tonnes/ha/annually. The third regime
is a mixed planting of Eucalyptus and <I>Albizia</I>. The Eucalypts and <I>Albizia</I>
are planted in alternating rows 3 m apart. Within rows, Eucalypts are spaced 3 m
apart; <I>Albizia</I> plants are spaced 2.1 m apart. In an eight year rotation
without the application of fertilizer after the first year, this regime produced
Eucalypts with a 23 cm d.b.h. and <I>Albizia</I> with a 11.4 cm d.b.h. Biomass
yield, excluding <I>Albizia</I>, is estimated at 180 dry tonnes/per ha or 22.4
dry tonnes/ha/annually. Including Albizia, total biomass yield is estimated at
235 dry tonnes/ha or more than 29 dry tonnes/ha/each year.</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<H3>Observations</H3>
<P> The Hawaii case study is extensive with many significant results, which are
applicable to locations throughout the world. However, despite the results and
high growth attained, the competitiveness of plantation biomass for energy is
not favorable. The price of competing fuels, coal and oil, at present represent
significant challenges to the development of biomass for fuel on a larger scale.
Australian coal can be delivered to Hawaii at a price of just under $60/tonne.
Given the relative heat contents of biomass and coal, biomass needs to be
produced, harvested, and transported at costs under $40/dry tonne. Another
obstacle to the commercial production of plantation hardwoods has been the
inability of any group to obtain large tracks of land of 12,000 ha or more. In
late 1994 this obstacle was removed by the sale of the Hamakue Sugar Company
land to Bishop Estates and agreement with the state to gain access to an
adjacent 2000 ha. Bishop Estates anticipates establishing plantations on the
land but final use of the wood has not been determined.<A HREF="notes.html#16">16</A></P>

</P>
<H2>Brazil Case Study</H2>
<P><A HREF="notes.html#17">17</A></P>
<P> Although Brazil represents half the land area of South America, its
reserves of oil and coal are relatively small. Further, Brazilian coal is high
in sulfur and ash and of relatively low quality. Brazil's search for alternative
energy sources began with the passage of the Forest Code of 1965 and Public Law
5106 in 1966. These laws implemented incentive programs that affected the forest
products sector and, as a result, the area of planted forest increased from
470,000 ha before incentives to 6.5 million ha in the 1993. A major fraction of
the charcoal used in steel production and nearly all of the feedstocks used in
the pulp and paper industry are now derived from these plantations. Eucalyptus
plantations represent 51% of the planted forest area; the genus Pinus accounts
for an additional 32% of plantings. A native species, bracatinga <I>(Mimosa
scabrella</I>), is also used extensively in wood energy plantations in southern
Brazil. The scale of short-rotation forest plantations in Brazil dwarfs the
experience in other countries. Nonetheless, these plantations provide only 39%
of the wood used for industrial purposes in Brazil.</P>
<P>
</P>
<P> Fiscal incentives were important factors in the development of a pulp and
paper industry and a charcoal-based iron and steel industry in Brazil. The
cement and composite board industries are also large consumers of plantation
grown wood products. The growth of the pulp and paper industry, however, was
probably the single most significant factor that promoted the development of
large-scale eucalypt plantations in the 1970s. Brazil has become a net exporter
of short-rotation based wood products including pulp and paper, plywood,
hardboard, and pine lumber. Forest products production accounts for 5.6% of
Brazil's Gross Domestic Product (GDP), 4% of Brazilian exports and approximately
2.5 million jobs in rural areas.</P>
<P>
</P>
<P> Another dimension of Brazil's experience with plantation forestry is the
growing importance of farm forestry, including intercropping (agroforestry) of
trees and food crops.<A HREF="notes.html#18">18</A> Today farm forestry
accounts for as much as 20% of the total plantation area, with some forestry
companies expecting to raise this fraction to 50%. In the mid-1980s with the
removal of federal tax incentives and objections by environmentalists to
large-tract plantations, forestry companies began contracting with private
farmers as a means to expand wood supplies. Typically, the forestry company
provides the material (seedlings, fertilizers, herbicides) and technical
know-how for establishing the trees on the farmer's land and contracts with the
farmer to buy some or all of the first harvest for an agreed upon price that
incorporates repayment for the initial inputs and services. Farmers are willing
cooperators as the trees provide an additional source of income from a certain
market, allow the productive use of marginal areas, stimulate cooperation with
fellow farmers, and make available more wood for on-farm use. Forestry companies
like farm forestry because capital requirements are lower (i.e., lower
establishment costs), there are no direct tending or maintenance costs, and
transport costs can be lowered because farms are usually within close proximity
to mills.</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<H3>Plantation Management</H3>
<P>
<B>Site Selection.</B> When incentives were first introduced, no ecological
zoning and no comprehensive body of scientific work existed to aid in choosing
the best species for each region and site. Plantations were established in
savanna-like regions in the central-west and southeast primarily because of low
land prices. Climatic conditions in these areas, low annual rainfall and a 5-7
month dry season, were inappropriate for <I>Eucalyptus grandis</I> and <I>E.
salingna</I>. These conditions, in concert with the remoteness of sites from
potential product users, resulted in some major failures. In some cases,
plantations never became well established because of limited groundwater
availability or the presence of subsurface gravel layers that roots were unable
to penetrate. Today much greater attention is given to site characteristics
including existing vegetation, slope, chemical and physical characteristics of
the soil, availability of water and energy, and distance from consumers. </P>
<P>
</P>
<P> Although native forest ecosystems have in the past been cut and burned to
establish &quot;reforestation&quot; plantations, plantations are no longer
established in areas with native forest cover. Further, rising land prices in
industrialized regions over the last decade, and regulations by some states have
made it difficult for forest companies to expand plantations in areas near their
existing mills. Thus, companies have begun to emphasize higher productivity
through genetic improvement of trees and careful soil management. Most
plantations today are established on abandoned or degraded agricultural lands or
on land previously occupied by eucalypt stands. Companies also prefer land that
is flat or gently rolling to land with steeper slopes.</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
<B>Species Selection.</B> The most widespread Eucalyptus species in Brazil is
<I>E. grandis</I>. Others include <I>E. salinga</I>,<I> E. urophylla</I>,
<I>E. camaldulensis</I>, and<I> E. citriodora</I>. Hybrids, particularly
urophylla X grandis, are showing very promising results in several parts of the
country. The federal government, state governments, and forest product companies
carry out active genetic improvement programs for these species. Controlled
hybridization, cloning and micropropagation are used to achieve homogeneous
stands that provide high productivity, natural resistance to pests and diseases,
and uniform raw material.<I> E. camaldulensis</I> is the preferred agroforestry
species because of its more vertical canopy, which leads to less shading of the
food crop planted between tree rows. Beans are preferred crop to plant with the
trees.</P>
<P>
</P>
<P> Bracatinga, a native nitrogen-fixing tree, is a key plantation species in
the cold highlands of southern Brazil. Although bracatinga has lower yields than
Eucalyptus, it is preferred by many farmers because it can be grown at a much
lower cost than Eucalyptus, a large capital investment is not required, and
there is no need for fertilization, tending and control of leaf-cutting ants.
Stands are generally planted at a density approaching 20,000 seedlings/ha and
later thinned to 3,000-4,000 seedlings/ha. On a seven-year rotation, Bracatinga
yields about 13 m3/ha/annually. By the time a bracatinga plantation is
harvested, seeds have been naturally incorporated into the soils and there is no
need for replanting. Bracatinga has been collected locally by provenances and,
like Eucalyptus, is the subject of genetic improvement trials.</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
<B>Plantation Establishment, Tending and Protection. </B>Vegetative propagation
using stool beds or tissue culture is used to produce clonal seedlings.
Seedlings are grown in dibble tubes filled with vermiculite or a vermiculite,
compost, ground charcoal mixture. The nursery process for Eucalyptus seedlings
requires 70 to 80 days. Seedlings spend the first half of the nursery period
under shade; the second half in the sun. Most planting is done by hand.
Seedlings are watered immediately after planting, and again after about a week,
if rainfall has been limited. </P>
<P>
</P>
<P> Slash burning to prepare sites is rare today although it was common in
earlier plantation establishment efforts. In early operations, harrowing,
plowing and furrowing was conducted without regard to slope or runoff direction.
The result was an enormous amount of erosion. Such intensive agriculture-like
preparation is now being abandoned in favor of minimal cultivation techniques
that reduce soil and nutrient loss. This approach involves the use of herbicides
followed by furrowing that follows the contours of the site.</P>
<P>
</P>
<P> Plantings for short-rotation coppicing stands generally have spacings of 3
m x 3 m (1,100 plants/ha) or 3 m x 1.5 m (2200 plants/ha). Fiscal incentives
initially favored denser plantations, but many early plantations, with densities
of 5000 to 10,000 trees/ha, were failures because mortality was high, final
diameter was small, and the percentage of bark to wood was too high. Brazilian
experience indicates that the mean annual increment increases with wider
spacings. Wider spacings also reduce wind damage, facilitate harvesting and weed
control, and allow the intercropping of agricultural crops when desired. Today,
spacing is adjusted to produce a tree of a specified diameter at harvest, given
site quality, plant genetics and rotation period.</P>
<P>
</P>
<P> Because Eucalyptus is an efficient nutrient user, it ultimately contributes
to nutrient depletion which must be corrected with fertilization. Short
rotations cause more nutrient loss because nutrient uptake is higher in young
<I>Eucalyptus</I> plants. Seedlings normally receive an initial fertilization
of 120 g of NPK. Unlike early operations that applied a standard fertilizer
formulation to sites indiscriminantly, companies today have specific
formulations for each site, species, hybrid and clone.</P>
<P>
</P>
<P> In <I>Eucalyptus</I> plantations weed control is performed twice a year,
and is considered critical until canopy closure occurs, usually after the first
two years. Initially, Brazilian plantations used discing between rows, and
hoeing within rows, to control weeds. Discing, however, contributed to erosion
(since rows were usually oriented downslope) and also cut the surface roots of
the trees, retarding growth and sometimes killing the tree. Today weeds are
controlled by methods that do not disturb the ground surface, such as herbicides
and mowing. Herbicides are applied just before planting and again at 4 to 8
months. Research has shown that sheep and cattle can also be used for the
control of weeds, and that intercropping with agricultural crops can eliminate
the need for tending operations during the first year. </P>
<P>
</P>
<P> Resistant clones, hybrids and species are used to control fungal diseases.
The control of leaf-cutting ants is an expensive cultural treatment in <I>Eucalyptus
</I>plantations. Leaf-cutters, once established, can destroy a young plantation
in a few days. Consequently, plantations require careful monitoring to detect
colonies at an early stage. The dodecachlor-based baits previously used to
control ant populations were banned in 1992. A sulfluramid-based bait is now
used.</P>
<P>
</P>
<P> Local insects, particularly the families <I>Lepidoptera</I> and <I>Coleoptera</I>,
have caused problems for some eucalypts. Control was initially attempted via
pesticides but environmental effects, growing insect resistance to pesticides
and cost limited the effectiveness of this approach. The problem was partially
alleviated through selection of species appropriate to sites and silvicultural
practices such as pruning, but a major breakthrough occurred when the potential
of biological controls was recognized. This is now the principle method of
control used for insect problems. For example, many insects are controlled by
encouraging the maintenance of local bird populations (by intermixing native
vegetation with the eucalypts).</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<H3>Growth, Production, and Harvest</H3>
<P> Eucalyptus harvesting is becoming increasingly mechanized. The felling of
trees is usually done manually with chain saws. An average operator cuts 120
trees/day. Crowns are lopped off; trees may be cut into sections or left whole
depending on the equipment used to move trees to the landing. Loading is done
with grapple loaders. Nearly 70% of transport to mills is done by truck; the
remainder occurs by rail. The haul distance averages 70 km one way, with maximum
hauls in the range of 200-300 km. Transport fuel expense is a major concern to
forest companies.</P>
<P>
</P>
<P> Bracatinga culture is an activity of smaller farms. Harvesting is generally
done by axe. Logs are cut into 0.8 to 1.2 m lengths with a minimum 4 cm
diameter. Horse carriers or tractor trucks transport logs to the roadside. Logs
typically are sold from the roadside.</P>
<P>
</P>
<P> Productivity of short-rotation, large-scale <I>Eucalyptus</I> plantations
in Brazil has increased dramatically over the past 2 decades. In some areas,
annual yields rose from 35 m3/ha (16.5 dry tonnes/ha) in 1970 to 70 m3/ha (33
dry tonnes/ha) in 1993. <A HREF="notes.html#19">19</A> The increased
productivity is the product of a substantial research effort, particularly in
genetics and biotechnology, reinforced by better silviculture and management
practices. Yields from farm forestry are somewhat lower, but establishment costs
are lower as well.</P>
<P>
</P>
<P> Costs for one hectare of Eucalyptus on a seven-year rotation vary widely
depending on the region, soil fertility, species, and technology. Logging and
transport costs, for example, vary with region and terrain from 51% to 70% of
total delivered wood costs. <A HREF="notes.html#20">20</A> The planting and
cultural costs of bracatinga are low and, consequently, logging and transport
costs may reach 93% of total operational costs.<A HREF="notes.html#21">21</A>
Because most farm forests were planted only recently (late 1980s), harvesting is
just beginning. Indications are, however, that delivered costs will be about the
same as those from forest company operations.</P>
<P>
</P>
<P> After harvest, logging slash is burned or used for energy purposes. If
coppicing is used for regeneration, the area may be disced and the site is
broadcast fertilized. Stump sprouts normally appear within 2 to 3 weeks. If the
stand is to be replanted, stumps are removed or are covered with soil, and
seedlings are planted in the rows between stumps. In the 1970s and 1980s,
declines were observed in the yield of <I>Eucalyptus</I> stands established by
coppicing. Factors that contributed to the declines included the establishment
of plantations on inappropriate sites, inappropriate provenances, large genetic
variation in the seeds used, the incidence of canker, leaf cutter ant attacks on
sprouts, and the damaging of stumps by harvesting. Most problems with coppicing
have been solved and coppicing systems may be applied with reasonable success.
Lower costs of coppicing (about 10% of planting costs) offset, at least in part,
the reductions in coppice yields (reductions of approximately 15% for the first
coppice and 30% for the second). Brazilian companies, however, are moving to the
practice of renewing stands after the first harvest because the rapid
improvement of genetic stock makes replanting a more cost-effective option.</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<H3>Observations</H3>
<P> Brazil's experience indicates that successful plantation establishment
efforts have direct links to an existing or planned end user. Further,
successful reforestation efforts require a fully funded government oversight
organization and existing educational and research institutions.</P>
<P>
</P>
<P> Environmental groups in Brazil now exert considerable pressure to limit
further eucalypt plantation establishment. Federal, state and municipal forest
legislation is becoming more restrictive. Critics of monocultural <I>Eucalyptus</I>
plantations claim that these plantings reduce biodiversity, encourage soil
erosion, reduce soil nutrients, lower local water table levels and compete with
the production of food crops. Reis proposed the following actions to minimize
the environmental impact of Eucalyptus plantations:<A HREF="notes.html#22">22</A></P>
<P>
</P>
<P> 
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Use ecological zoning to select species and appropriate management
practices.</LI>
<LI>Augment biodiversity through management that increases the use of
agroforestry systems.</LI>
<LI>Conduct research on ecological systems of native forest species that may
substitute for
<I>Eucalyptus</I>.</LI>
<LI>Implement more biological, as opposed to pesticide based, pest control.</LI>
<LI>Use less mechanized approaches on steep slopes.</LI>
<LI>Institutionalize a process of environmental impact assessment. </LI></UL>
<P> The forest companies have responded by emphasizing forest management that
is increasingly directed at the sustainable use of forest resources that include
water, air quality, erosion control, wildlife, recreational and scenic values in
addition to wood products. Many of the large forest product companies now have
environmental departments to address environmental concerns. The efforts of
these companies include tree farmer programs in which small farmers are included
in the forest company's supply planning and operations. These programs are
expanding and will become more important supply sources in the future. Companies
are also conducting research on agroforestry to provide the biological,
technical and economic information needed to support such programs. Agroforestry
programs, support of local education programs and donations made for the
preservation of endangered ecosystems have enhanced the public image of forest
product companies. These small farmer programs are also seen as a means to
promote rural economic development, reduce migration to urban areas, and limit
the growth in concentration of land ownership by forest companies.</P>
<P>
</P>
<P> There has always been intense public scrutiny of bracatinga use. Harvesting
is permitted only for mature stands and only on a sustained yield basis.
Widespread clearcutting of bracatinga is not allowed to reduce soil erosion and
preserve water tables. The policy has contributed to a stabilization of fuelwood
supply during a period of rising demand and, consequently to a rise in the real
price of bracatinga. This has increased the income of thousands of small
farmers.</P>

<H1>The Production of Short-rotation Woody Crops</H1>
<P> Eucalyptus species constitute about 38% of all short-rotation plantations
worldwide and hardwoods in general make up about 63% of all plantations. In
temperate regions, poplar, willow, and black locust predominate. Ranney
estimates that about 10 million ha could be classified as short-rotation
plantations.<A HREF="notes.html#23"> 23</A> However, he notes that less than
half of this planted area could be termed as successful or commercially viable.
Ranney's technical criteria for successful plantations for energy use are
described as follows (with slight modification):</P>
<P> 
</P>
<UL>
<LI>more than 80% survival of planted materials;</LI>
<LI>annual productivity greater than 10-12 dry tonnes/ha of harvested wood and
bark;</LI>
<LI>uniformity in diameter, height and straightness;</LI>
<LI>less than $50/dry tonne in delivered cost;</LI>
<LI>and less than 2 tonnes/ha in erosion each year.</LI></UL>
<P> This chapter discusses the factors to consider in site and species
selection, plantation establishment, maintenance and protection as well as yield
expectations to achieve the above measures of success. In addition, some of the
distinctive aspects of producing trees on short-rotations versus practices used
for producing timber in longer rotations will be addressed. More detailed
technical information suitable for landowners or companies considering woody
crop establishment may be located in some of the references provided in the
notes to this chapter.</P>

</P>
<H2>Site Selection</H2>
<P> It is often assumed that tropical countries have a major advantage over
temperate regions with regard to biomass production, but this is not necessarily
true. While total annual biomass production does increase from higher latitudes
towards the equator, the increase is primarily in leaf production rather than
wood production </P>
<P><IMG ALIGN="RIGHT" SRC="fig2_1.gif"><B>Fig. 2.1. Annual production of wood
and leaf biomass of natural forests across a latitudinal gradient from the
Boreal Zone to the Tropics.</B><A HREF="notes.html#25">25</A></P>
<P></P>
<P>  In general, the annual wood production of native tropical forests is
slightly less than that of high latitude native forests. Reasons for the lower
production rates of lowland tropical forests include acidic, highly leached
soils and warm temperatures that increase respiration rates and burn off carbon
that would otherwise be used to produce wood. Fortunately, well-managed
plantations on good sites in tropical and temperate zones can achieve yields 2
to 10 times higher than natural forests. Examples of plantation yield levels
currently being achieved around the world are summarized in Table 1.</P>

<P> At a global scale, soil fertility generally decreases toward the equator.
At a regional scale there is variation in soil properties relevant to tree
growth at scales ranging from 10's of meters to entire continents. Any farmer or
forester is familiar with variations in soil fertility that produce great
differences in crop production across areas as small as a hectare. Factors such
as soil depth, water availability, pH, texture and slope are all extremely
important to crop production potential. While naturally fertile soils are most
desirable, there are instances where poorer soils can be managed.<A
HREF="notes.html#24">24</A> Soils with moderate limitations can be used, if
technologies are available to manage the soils effectively. These lands with
moderate limitations require careful planning and management to avoid problems
related to erosion and water quality, and soil nutrient deficiencies.</P>
<P>One of the first challenges for any commercial activity requiring
short-rotation plantations is to determine where suitable and available lands
are located. A favorable site may allow a project to survive initial mistakes or
miscalculations, while an unfavorable site requires great technical expertise,
and even simple errors can result in major setbacks or failure. In site
selection, there is no substitute for test plots of the potential tree species
on the range of soils present on the prospective sites. A potentially disastrous
consequence of over-estimation of yield is the under-estimation of planted area
needed to support a power plant. With the increased plantation area needed on
unfavorable, low productivity sites comes increasing expenses for road and
harvesting infrastructure, increasing haul distances, less efficient harvesting,
and greater potential impacts on the environment, society, and biodiversity.
</P>
<P>Site selection must consider and balance a wide range of biological,
economic, and societal factors. The biomass decision tree shown in Fig. 2.2
summarizes the information required and decisions that need to be made to
determine whether a biomass plantation may be feasible. Site selection and
planning at the national, regional, and local level requires geographically
located information on soils and geology, natural vegetation, current land uses,
topography, watershed boundaries, stream/river systems, roads, local political
jurisdictions, land ownership and tenure information, location of cultural and
historical resources, location of nature preserves and rare habitats and
species. It is also very valuable to have site-specific research data on the
yields that can be expected from the preferred species. The information is
particularly helpful if it can be conveniently summarized, compared, and
presented on maps using computer-based geographical information systems (GIS).
The HNRIS database developed for the state of Hawaii is an excellent example of
the type of data and GIS systems that is very valuable for making decisions
regarding the best locations for biomass plantations.<B><A HREF="notes.html#27">27</A></B></P>
<P><A HREF="fig2_2.gif">Fig. 2.2. Biomass project decision tree</A>.<B><A
HREF="notes.html#28">28</A></B></P>
<H3>Species Selection</H3>
<P>Once a site is chosen, the next key to the success of the plantation is the
selection of genetically superior tree species, varieties or clones suitable for
the climate, soils, and desired products of the plantation. Most species achieve
their best growth under a fairly narrow range of climate and soil conditions,
and failure to match species to site has been the cause of the failure of many
plantation projects. Even within a species that is suited to a particular site,
there can be great variation in the growth and wood characteristics from
different seed sources or regions within the species range.&quot; The largest,
cheapest, and fastest gains in most tree improvement programs can be made by
assuring the use of the proper species and seed sources within species.&quot;<B><A
HREF="notes.html#29">29</A></B> Many of the problems of plantation health,
productivity, tree quality, and the economic viability of early plantation
programs were the result of use of inappropriate species or clones and
suboptimal plant materials. For example, Jari Cellulose S/A of Brazil is
currently replacing all of the pines and gmelina planted on over 90,000 ha due
to the poor growth.</P>
<P>Although indigenous species would be preferable from an environmental
perspective, a large number of the plantations being successfully established in
tropical regions are using exotics such as <I>E. grandis</I> and <I>P.
caribaea</I>. Several acacia species, which are native to many tropical areas
are showing good performance. In the U.S. and Europe, hybrid poplars and willows
are, in most cases, outperforming native poplar species, although fast-growing
native poplar clones have also been identified. The best hardwood species and
clones for lumber and veneer are likely to be different than those that are best
for energy or hardwood pulp.</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In some temperate agricultural regions, herbaceous energy crops are being
investigated. One advantage of such crops is that they can be planted and
harvested using standard agricultural equipment rather than specialized forestry
machinery. Perennial herbaceous crops, such as certain native prairie grasses,
have the advantages of providing quick erosion control and wildlife habitat,
quickly reaching full production, and providing continuous harvests without
replanting. The best tropical analogy is sugar cane, although other tropical
grasses or canes might have potential as well.<B><A HREF="notes.html#30">30</A></B></P>
<P>Normal variation in topography, soils, and moisture conditions dictates that
more than one species may be desirable to optimize sustainable production. While
it may be desirable to use both grasses and trees as feedstock options from an
environmental standpoint. Use of mixed tree species plantings would also provide
more desirable habitat for wildlife than single species plantings. Where the
conversion technology or product depends on feedstock uniformity, site
differences can be partially compensated for by using many clones of the
preferred species. Pulp companies such as Aracruz Celulose S/A in Brazil have
developed a working set of 40 to 80 clones for taking advantage of small site
differences, and attaining functional diversity for pest management and risk
spreading</P>
<P>Nitrogen-fixing species, or fast-growing nurse species could be beneficial
components of the overall species mix. Such species are likely to be
particularly important where plantations are being established on degraded or
abandoned agricultural lands though plantings would likely need to be subsidized
since returns to the land owner may be limited due to low yields. In such cases,
the initial species mix used to reclaim the site is likely to be different than
the preferred species mix once the site has been improved by the initial
rotations. Conversion technologies which can adjust to changing species
composition over time will offer the greatest opportunity for producing
environmentally sound, low-cost feedstocks. </P>
<P>Species and clonal selections cannot be made exclusively from a study of
literature. Unless a research program exists in the vicinity of a desired
project, some trials of promising species will have to be part of the project
development process. As described by Evans, these trials will normally be of
four different types:<B><A HREF="notes.html#31">31</A></B></P>
<UL>
<LI>Step 1. Species screening and elimination trials to identify the most
promising species.</LI>
<LI>Step 2. Species refinement trials to examine genetic variation among
provenances, families, and clones.</LI>
<LI>Step 3. Larger production trials to provide stand growth data, test
cultivation methods.</LI>
<LI>Step 4. Tree improvement activities including breeding and clonal
propagation.</LI></UL>
<P> This sequence takes time and often decisions are made after only step 1.
Steps 2 and 3 may be carried out while a project is being established and result
in changes along the way. Step 4 is an ongoing commitment that is required once
significant investment in a project has been made.</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<H2>Plantation Establishment, Tending, and Protection</H2>
<P> Plantation establishment is a critical phase of a large-scale biomass
energy project, since the timing of wood supply must be coordinated with the
construction of a complex and expensive power plant. Mistakes or miscalculations
at any one of many stages can result in expensive delays in power generation.
Issues that must be addressed include: site preparation, seedling or cutting
supply and quality, availability of required soil microorganisms, nursery
operation, spacing of plantings, fertilization, watering, weed control, road
construction, protection of nursery stock and plantings from insect pests,
disease, animals, humans, fire, and other threats.</P>
<P>
</P>
<P> The particular properties of each plantation site and the species selected
will affect how each of the above issues should be addressed.</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<H3>Site Preparation</H3>
<P> Site preparation is the key phase of establishing a short-rotation woody
crop plantation. Site preparation on land not already used for cropping includes
demarcation of boundaries, planning and construction of access roads, and
installation of erosion control measures. While alteration of drainage to
improve conditions for tree growth and minimize negative effects on the quality
of water leaving the plantation may be needed, care should be taken that
wetlands and or water quality regulations are properly addressed. The primary
goal of site preparation is to create the best possible conditions for the
growth of the tree species that will be planted. Site preparation requirements
vary greatly among tree species and with variation in climate and soils. Most
current recommendations suggest using land already cleared or planted in tree
crops both for economic and environemental reasons. The most suitable sites for
biomass plantations and the least expensive to prepare are lands recently or
currently being used for agriculture. On many agricultural sites, ripping may be
necessary to break-up hard pans that have devoloped over many years.</P>
<P></P>
<P> On recently abandoned agricultural lands, the main problem is often
competition between planted seedlings or cuttings and pre-existing vegetation.
Consequently, the goal of site preparation is to kill or remove as much as
possible of the vegetation without degrading the site and creating erosion. For
species that are extremely sensitive to competition from grasses, including most
fast-growing eucalypts, poplars and willows, complete kill of the competing
vegetation is essential. Figure 2.3 indicates the strategies that may be
required depending on existing vegetation. </P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B><A HREF="fig2_3.gif">Fig. 2.3. Steps in a recommended site preparation
strategy</A>.</B><A HREF="notes.html#32">32</A></P>
<P> Both herbicides and cultivation may be required if mowing is not
sufficiant. This is particularly important in areas that have been invaded by
aggressive grasses, such as <I>Imperata cylindrica</I>. Other species,
including <I>Acacia mangium</I>, alder, and many pines, are tolerant of some
competition from grass, and do not require such intensive site preparation, but
also usually fail to produce high yields at a young age.</P>
<P>
</P>
<P> Experience in the U.S. suggests that site preparation should begin at least
one full year in advance of planting short-rotation crops, if cultivation is
required. Soil cultivation aids in reducing weeds, but also can be used to
improve soil structure for root penetration in areas with compacted soil,
impervious clay layers, or poor drainage. No-till site preparation may be
appropriate if herbicides can be effectively used to achieve total grass and
weed kill in strips where trees are to be planted. In some situations, clearing
and burning may be appropriate, although this is usually ineffective for grasses
because they have adapted to fire. Inadequate site preparation is the most
common mistake made by companies and researchers initiating a new short-rotation
woody crop project.</P>
<P>
</P>
<P> On severely degraded sites, competition with grass and weeds is less an
issue than is the nutrient content and available moisture in the soil.
Appropriate establishment methods may include leaving weeds, planting grasses in
strips, applying organic matter, establishing a cover crop, and/or building
berms or other structures to concentrate water.</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<H3>Seeds, Cuttings, and Nursery Operation</H3>
<P> Many first time plantings fail because high quality plant materials are
scarce and poor quality planting materials are used. The materials may be too
small, too big, diseased or too weak. Guidelines for optimal seedling and
cutting size and handling requirements are available for the most commonly
planted species. A common problem is that insufficient quantity of select
material is available so the tendency is to use the poor quality material just
to meet planting goals. Obtaining rapid growth early is so important for
short-rotation systems that time and money should not be wasted on planting poor
quality or unhealthy material.</P>
<P>
</P>
<P> Large centralized plant propagation and nursery operations that are owned
by the power companies (or their subsidiaries) may be required for large-scale
biomass power projects. Nursery operations are a standard component of most pulp
and paper operations which depend on plantation grown wood. For smaller power
project operations, it may be easier and more cost-effective to purchase
seedlings or cuttings from commercial nurseries.</P>
<P>
</P>
<P> If plants are to be established from seed, the issues of seed availability,
seed quality, seed storage, and germination requirements must be fully resolved
in the project planning stage. The quality of seeds is particularly important,
and success may depend on having a good supply not just of the desired species,
but of the specific variety or provenance of that species that is best suited
for the plantation site. To assure continuing supplies of improved high quality
seeds, some investment in seed orchards and long-term breeding programs is
necessary.</P>
<P>
</P>
<P> Most hardwood species receiving serious consideration as biomass
plantations species can be propagated without seeds, from cuttings of twigs and
branches that can be induced to grow roots, from root sections or branches that
can be placed directly into the ground, or from tissue culture and
micropropagation methods. A major advantage of vegetative propagation is that
the individual trees that have the most desirable properties, disease resistance
or rapid growth under specific local site conditions, can be rapidly multiplied
as part of a tree improvement or clonal expansion program. Species vary greatly
in their suitability for vegetative propagation, with some easily sprouting
roots and leaves, and others only surviving under the most favorable conditions.
Species that sprout and grow readily include: many <I>Eucalyptus and Populus
species, Acacia cyanophylla, Azadiracta indica, Cassia siamea, Chlorophora
excelsa, Cordia alliodora, Dalbergia sissoo, Gmelina arborea, Leucaena
leucocephala, Nauclea diderichii, Paraserianthes falcataria, Pterocarpus spp.,
Triplochiton scleroxylon, and Tectona grandis</I>.</P>
<P>
</P>
<P> Depending on whether the species being planted are most effectively
established as bareroot seedlings, containerized stock, or hardwood cuttings,
propagation and nursery procedures will be quite different. Larger-seeded
species can be sown in large beds and root- pruned to produce bare-root stock
for planting. Trees being clonally propagated require stool beds of clearly
identified clones for generating cuttings. Sprouts species such as poplars and
willows are then harvested from the stool beds, sectioned, graded for size,
packed, and kept in cool temperatures until planting season. Eucalypts which are
produced from small seeds or small cuttings and species produced through
micro-propagation, require well-run seed or propagule handling,
containerization, and hardening operations to produce adequate sized planting
stock. In general, container grown plants have a higher survival rate, than
bareroot seedlings or cuttings, particularly in drier areas. However, container
grown plants may cost from 25% to 250% more to produce than bare-root seedlings
or hardwood cuttings. In all nursery operations, particular attention must be
paid to fertilization and the prevention and control of fungal diseases and
insect pests, as well as plant size and root quality/quantity.</P>
<P>
</P>
<P> Many species may have unique properties and problems at the nursery stage.
Consequently, the experience that has been gained around the world with
particular species under specific climate conditions should be utilized in
nursery design. Local practices that work perfectly well for some species may
result in total failure with different species. When Shell International chose
to establish a eucalyptus plantations in Chile, local builders failed to follow
exact specifications from Shell staff with previous experience in South Africa.
This resulted in major problems and loss of much of the planting stock in the
first year of operation. Once the buildings were reconstructed according to
specifications, propagation was successful.<A HREF="notes.html#33">33</A></P>
<H3>Spacing</H3>
<P> A primary question during the planning phase is the spacing (or density).
Planting density affects the total cost of planting stock, the rate at which the
tree canopy closes, the growth form of the trees, the optimal rotation age and
the size at optimal rotation or harvest age. While production of large saw logs
is most effective at large spacings or in thinned stands, plantations for
biomass or pulp generally use narrower spacings ranging from about 4 x 4 m down
to about 1 x 0.5 m.<A HREF="notes.html#34">34</A> The tightest spacings are
characteristic of willow plantings, which are cut after 1 year to generate many
sprouts, thereafter being harvested on a 2 to 3 year schedule. The widest
spacings are more characteristic of plantings where the trees are expected to
reach a 15 to 20 cm diameter (d.b.h.) by harvest age.</P>
<P> Within a certain range, maximum short-rotation plantation yields are not
particularly sensitive to spacing, if weeds are effectively controlled and the
stand is allowed to grow. The spacing does, however, affect weed competition.
Tight spacings minimize weed problems by closing canopy within the first year.
Wider spacings require weed control for 2 to 3 years, however, weeds can be
effectively controlled by cultivation, and herbicides.</P>
<H3>Planting</H3>
<P> Planting techniques will vary depending on the type of material being
planted and the terrain. Hand planting is probably the most common approach even
in industrialized countries. Hand planting by an experienced crew can be nearly
as fast as mechanized planting with fewer mistakes. Unrooted cuttings offer the
greatest flexibility in choosing hand or machine planting methods. However, it
is suggested that painting or marking tops of unrooted cuttings will ease
planting efforts and ensure that the right side is planted up.</P>
<H3>Weed and Pest Control</H3>
<P> Weed competition can be severe in the establishment phase of plantations
and most establishment methods involve some use of cultivation and herbicides.<A
HREF="notes.html#35">35</A> It is most important to eliminate weeds close to
the trees. Cultivation is most effective if the spacing is square and wide
enough to allow cultivation. Application of herbicides over the trees, prior to
leaf out, may accomplish the control needed close to the trees. Mulching is
another alternative. In countries where labor costs are low and chemical costs
may be high, manual labor is likely to be used to reduce weed growth immediately
around trees. Depending on the relative costs of labor, machinery, and
chemicals, the most cost-effective weed control practices can differ greatly
from one area to another.</P>
<P>
</P>
<P> Another weed control alternative is agroforestry in which manual labor is
used to tend food crops grown between rows of trees for one to two years.<A
HREF="notes.html#36">36</A> This practice can provide both subsistence and cash
crops to the local community, while accomplishing weed control without harmful
chemicals.<A HREF="notes.html#37">37</A> Because of the economic and
environmental advantages shown by agroforestry experiments in Brazil, some
forest companies are beginning to recommend agroforestry in their tree farmer
programs.<A HREF="notes.html#38">38</A></P>
<P>
</P>
<P> Insect and fungal pests tend to be most serious when plants are stressed by
poor soils, crowding, or other unfavorable environmental conditions. Pests can
spread rapidly and cause extensive damage in single species plantations. The
incidence of pest problems and thus the need for toxic chemicals could be
reduced by use of multispecies plantings, either intermixed or blocked, by
selection of resistant species and clones, and by carefully matching species and
clones to site conditions to minimize stress. A combination of biological and
chemical controls of pests using the principles of Integrated Pest Management
(IPM) is usually much more effective and much less costly than large-scale
pesticide application. </P>
<H3>Protection from Fires and Animals</H3>
<P> Fires are a major risk factor that must be considered in planning the
layout of short-rotation woody crops. Separation of planting blocks with strips
of natural vegetation may assist in reducing fire hazard as well as increase
local biodiversity. The roads needed for harvest access and wood removal should
be made wide enough to serve as fire breaks.</P>
<P> Large animals, such as deer and moose, can create problems by browsing the
tender shoots of young plants. While solar-powered electric fences could be used
for keeping out large animals, this would normally be too expensive for
large-scale operations. It may simply be necessary to accept some level of
damage and claim credit for game populations in the region. Hunting is
considered to be the most effective means of protecting plantations from
excessively large populations of browsing animals.<A HREF="notes.html#39">39</A></P>
<P> Rabbits and rodents can damage or kill trees by gnawing the bark and
girdling the base of the trees. There is little protection for such animals in
well managed plantations with low weed cover, thus providing another rationale
for good weed control. There are no other suitable methods for protecting
plantations against small rodents.<A HREF="notes.html#40">40</A></P>
<H3>Stand Renewal</H3>
<P> The initial planting strategy should include a plan for stand renewal after
harvest. Most short-rotation species being planted or under evaluation offer the
option of stand renewal through resprouting or coppice growth. Although it was
originally conceived that plantations would use the natural coppicing ability of
hardwood trees, researchers growing poplar in the U.S. and eucalypts in Brazil
are now suggesting that planting new and higher-yielding clones after each
harvest will increase production and more than offset the increased costs
associated with stump removal and site reestablishment. Continuous introduction
of new clones also reduces risks associated with the buildup of pests and
diseases.</P>
<H2>Summary</H2>
<P> As stated at the beginning of this section, the requirements for successful
production of short-rotation woody crops are rigorous. Unless experienced
personnel are available, a new project should include some learning time with
smaller plantings before an aggressive planting schedule is initiated. The crop
production techniques will likely vary at least slightly for every project and
experimentation needs to be a part of any commercial activity. A new project
must take into account harvest and handling, environmental, end-use and cost
considerations, which are dicussed in the following chapters.</P>

<H1>Use of Plantation-grown Biomass for Power Generation</H1>
<P> The conversion of wood energy feedstocks to energy beginning with
harvesting and ending with export of power to the electric grid is depicted in
<A HREF="fig3_1.gif">Fig. 3.1, Process diagram: plantation-grown biomass to
power generation</A>. Post-harvest fuel preparation, transport, storage, and
fuel preparation and handling are key steps linking fuel production with
conversion. These process steps influence the efficiency of the conversion
facility through feedstock quality (moisture content, size, uniformity) as well
as overall system cost. Figure 3.1 also shows feedstock handling and long-term
storage losses. These losses can be significant and must be accounted for in
determining total feedstock requirements for the conversion facility. Harvest,
transport, storage, and fuel preparation techniques and requirements are
discussed in the following section. A second section provides a brief overview
of conversion processes.</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<H2>Harvesting, Transport, Storage, Handling and Fuel Preparation</H2>
<P> Harvesting is a significant cost and a technical barrier to
commercialization and use of plantation-grown biomass for power generation. In
the industrialized countries, considerable efforts have been expended to develop
equipment for harvesting plantation-grown trees. Results of studies conducted
during the mid-1980s conclude that cost-effective harvesting requires equipment
be appropriately sized and be able to cut and handle large numbers of relatively
small diameter trees. Conventional forest harvesting equipment tends to be
inappropriate because it is designed for single-stemmed severance of large
trees. Such equipment is also high-powered and expensive relative to the value
of plantation-grown trees.</P>
<P>
</P>
<P> Much of the work on harvesting systems in the industrialized countries has
been based on the development of feller bunchers, often as attachments to
standard tractors. These harvesters have three functions: severing or cutting,
accumulating, and offloading.<A HREF="notes.html#41">41</A> For example, the
prototype Hyd-Mech FB-7 continuous feller-buncher uses two counter-rotating saws
for severing. Accumulating arms push severed trees off into holding areas. Once
the holding areas are filled (8 to 10 trees), the trees are dumped alongside and
parallel to the feller buncher. Other equipment (forwarder, grapple skidder, or
tractor with grapple) is then used to move the piled trees to a landing area.
Here the trees can be chipped and blown directly into a trailer or van for
transport or simply loaded in whole form and hauled to a conversion facility. In
the latter situation, chipping or size reduction is done at the conversion
facility.</P>
<P>
</P>
<P> Stokes and Hartsough analyzed the productivity and cost of three systems
for harvesting a small diameter and large diameter plantation stand.
<A HREF="notes.html#42">42</A>Their analysis was based on studies conducted on
7.6 cm sycamore stand in south Alabama and a 10.2 to 15.2 cm eucalyptus stand in
central California. The systems included a continuous feller-buncher, a
three-wheel feller-buncher, and chainsaw harvesting. A grapple skidder or
tractor with winch and a whole-tree chipper were also configured into a balanced
harvesting system. Their results are displayed in Fig. 3.2a and Fig. 3.2b.<A
HREF="notes.html#43">43</A> </P>
<P><IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" SRC="fig3_2a.gif"><B>Fig. 3.2. A comparison of
productivity and cost of harvesting systems for a large diameter (15.2 cm) and

<P></P><IMG SRC="fig3_2b.gif" ALIGN="MIDDLE">
<P></P>
<P></P>
<P>The first panel shows how tree diameter influences harvest system
productivity. For the continuous feller-buncher system, productivity was
significantly higher when harvesting the larger diameter stands. In contrast, a
chainsaw harvesting system was more efficient for the small diameter stand. The
second panel shows a similar relationship -- the continuous feller-buncher is
more cost-effective for the larger diameter stands with chainsaw harvesting more
cost-effective for small diameter stands. Although not specifically shown in
Fig. 3.2, the Stokes and Hartsough data indicate that chainsaw felling is about
2.5 times more productive than the continuous feller-buncher for the
small-diameter trees. However, bunching and skidding the cut trees to a landing
greatly diminishes the productivity of the chainsaw system. A comparison of the
production rates achieved on other felling machines is shown in Table 3.1. These
data also show a fundamental relationship between tree size (spacing or planting
density) and productivity. A research team at the University of Hawaii (Manoa)
has modeled this relationship and used it to identify optimum spacing and
rotation age for short-rotation eucalyptus.<A HREF="notes.html#44">44</A></P>

<P><B>a</B>Productivity converted from green tonnes to dry tonnes assuming 50%
moisture content.</P>
<P> The productivity and cost of plantation harvesting systems are quite
variable. In industrialized or high-labor cost countries, estimated harvesting
costs generally range from about $18 to $35/dry tonne for felling, skidding, and
chipping.<A HREF="notes.html#45">45</A> The low-end costs tend to presume the
availability of prototype plantation harvesters while the high-end costs tend to
be based on the use or modification of conventional forestry equipment.<A
HREF="notes.html#46">46</A>  A large component of total harvesting system cost
(about 30 to 40%) is tree handling or skidding of bunched trees to a landing for
chipping or loading.</P>
<P>
</P>
<P> In an effort to minimize handling operations, whole-tree energytm (WTEtm)
technology is under development.<A HREF="notes.html#47">47</A> In the WTEtm
system, trees are severed, accumulated, and loaded directly onto specially
designed trailers for transport. This concept differs from conventional
approaches in following respects. First, whole-tree harvesting eliminates tree
skidding or forwarding, a major cost of plantation harvesting systems. Second,
trees are not chipped or processed in the field. Instead, feedstock size
reduction is done at the conversion plant. Third, the minimization of tree
handling steps reduces significantly, if not eliminates, feedstock handling
losses. Fourth, whole-tree harvesting equipment is optimized for single-stem
severance (not coppice growth) and is utilized year-round. These factors have
potential to reduce greatly harvesting costs.<A HREF="notes.html#48">48</A>
However, a WTE system as now envisioned is likely to be limited to sites that
are relatively flat and accessible. Soil compaction is also a potential concern.</P>
<P>
</P>
<P> In contrast to the industrialized countries, where harvesting and handling
operations have been focused on the development of dedicated plantation
harvesting machinery, developing countries are basing their harvesting systems
on the availability of low-cost and underutilized labor. In Brazil, most felling
is done with chainsaws. A typical harvesting operation has chainsaw operators
cutting three rows of trees at a time, directionally felling the trees so that
they line-up.<A HREF="notes.html#49">49</A> The trees are then crowned and cut
to length or left whole for moving to a landing area. Production rates for an
experienced chain saw operator can reach 120 trees/day. This is about 60 m3 or
28 dry tonne (0.47 dry tonne per m3) per day (3.5 dry tonnes/hour). After
felling and cutting to length, grapple loaders are used to forward the logs to a
landing for loading onto trucks (tractor-trailers) for transport to the
conversion facility.</P>
<P>
</P>
<P> For some applications, the availability of excess labor in rural areas, low
wage rates, and scarcity of capital for equipment, maintenance and repairs, and
fuel dictates that all harvesting operations (felling and forwarding) be done
manually. For example, in Southwest China, Perlack et al. estimate that 75
workdays per hectare are required to fell, trim, carry, and stack logs at a
roadside.<A HREF="notes.html#50">50</A> Each hectare is assumed to yield 30 dry
tonnes of wood energy at harvest excluding the smaller limbs and branches, which
are left for nutrient recycling and fuelwood purposes. This production scenario
implies a harvest rate of 0.4 dry tonnes/day. In the Philippines, Durst
estimated that over 130 days would be required to cut, top, and stack one
hectare using handtools.<A HREF="notes.html#51">51</A> This translates into a
production rate of about 0.6 dry tonnes/day. A similar rate is provided by
Denton, (100 kg/hour or 0.5 dry tonnes/day assuming a 10 hour workday).<A
HREF="notes.html#52">52</A> In general, it is difficult to summarize production
rates for manual harvesting operations because estimates are highly dependent 
upon local site conditions  (topography, plantation density, tree size,
forwarding distances, climate, season, etc.). However, relative to capital
intensive harvesting systems, costs are generally a smaller percentage of total
delivered feedstock costs.</P>
<P>
</P>
<P> Harvest and handling operations will result in losses in product yield (<A
HREF="fig3_1.gif">Fig. 3.1</A>). The significance of these losses depend on
local factors including the degree of mechanization used in harvest operations.
Some studies have conservatively assumed that felling, forwarding, and chipping
operations can result in a 5% loss in the total standing dry weight yield. In
manual harvesting operations, losses can be higher depending on how tree crowns
and smaller limbs are treated. It is more likely that these smaller pieces are
left on-site for use as fuelwood (plantation by-product) and for nutrient
recycling purposes.</P>
<P>
</P>
<P> When wood is harvested it normally contains about 50% moisture (wet basis).
Moisture and other physical properties of wood should be taken into account when
designing and operating wood-fired power systems. The presence of moisture in
wood can affect combustion by absorbing heat during evaporation; increasing the
time it takes for wood to burn, and reducing the temperature of the combustion
gases. Operational experience suggests that there can be significant decreases
in boiler efficiency when moisture content begins to exceed 50%. If feedstocks
are allowed to air-dry to 30% moisture, there can be usable net heat gains.
However, if the feedstock is allowed to absorb moisture during storage, a point
can be reached where combustion can no longer be sustained. In this instance
boiler blackouts can occur and auxiliary fuel will be needed to sustain
combustion. Boilers specifically designed to handle high moisture content fuels
do not have these problems, but they tend to be higher in cost.<A
HREF="notes.html#54">54</A> Moisture in wood feedstocks also creates problems
in storing fuels for later use. These other problems include decomposition,
self-heating, spontaneous combustion, and buildup of spores and moulds.<A
HREF="notes.html#55">55</A></P>
<P>
</P>
<P> Research on plantation-grown wood feedstocks in temperate climates has
shown that harvest during the dormant growing season will be required to obtain
good coppice regrowth. An added benefit is that leaves will be left on site to
enhance nutrient recycling.<A HREF="notes.html#56">56</A> Under such a scenario
several months of storage is required to ensure a continuous supply of feedstock
to the conversion facility.<A HREF="notes.html#57">57</A> When feedstocks are
stored for long periods decomposition losses can be high. Decomposition can be
especially high under conditions of high humidity, rainfall, and
evapotranspiration. How the feedstocks are stored (covered or uncovered) and in
what physical form (chips or as bundles of whole-tree) also affects
decomposition and the moisture content of the feedstock. Under less than ideal
conditions, decomposition losses can easily reach 2% per month of storage. One
option to avoid storage problems and decomposition losses is to harvest
year-round. With year-round harvesting crop decomposition losses do not occur as
trees are in effect stored on the stump. This practice may not promote good
regrowth and new stands may have to be established. Moreover, there may be
periods during year, especially in tropical climates, where the plantation may
not be accessible or roads not passable (e.g., during moonsoon periods).</P>
<P>
</P>
<P> There are numerous factors that must be considered in designing fuel
storage facilities. These include:</P>
<P> 
</P>
<UL>
<LI>the available storage area and its proximity to the boiler;</LI>
<LI>the physical properties of the fuel (chips, chunks, whole-trees, etc.);</LI>
<LI>additional fuel preparation requirements;</LI>
<LI>back-up storage capacity and reliability of the fuel supply;</LI>
<LI>seasonal weather conditions; and</LI>
<LI>operational requirements of the boiler.</LI></UL>
<P> Fuel storage systems that are in use include both open and covered systems.
For the open systems, the fuel is stored either directly on the ground or on a
concrete pad. The covered systems can include plastic on slab (or on ground),
open sheds, closed sheds, silos, and air bags. A typical operation is likely to
include two types of storage facilities. An inactive area (open or covered on
slab) where fuel is received and an active area (usually covered) that can store
about 3 days supply. Front-end loaders and manual labor are most often used to
move chipped wood feedstocks between inactive and active storage areas. The
WTEtm technology uses a very large shed (air supported) to store and dry a
30-day supply of whole-trees using waste heat from the power plant.</P>
<P>
</P>
<P> Fuel-feed systems are used to transfer wood from the active storage area to
the fuel hopper for metering and feeding into the boiler. This handling
equipment can include various types of conveyors (belt, drag, screw, pneumatic)
and elevators. Fuel hoppers are usually designed to avoid bridging and clogging
(e.g., sloped walls), and they are covered to prevent sparks and smoke from
escaping to the storage area. Screens and knife hogs or hammermills may also be
used to remove unwanted material (e.g., rocks and debris) and to ensure
appropriate particle sizes and uniformity. Uniform feedstock size helps to
ensure more efficient fuel handling and combustion.</P>
<P>
</P>
<P> The characteristics and quality of biomass feedstocks greatly influences
the design, choice, and performance of conversion technologies as well as the
requirements for feedstock storage, fuel handling, and ash disposal. Biomass
feedstocks that are variably sized and high in moisture or ash content can
reduce boiler efficiencies, increase O&amp;M costs, and lower capacity factors.</P>
<P>
</P>
<P> There is a variety of equipment on the market that can be used for sizing.
This equipment ranges from small-scale chippers that are towed or trailered to a
site to large-scale equipment. The large-scale equipment can be mobile
(trailered or self-propelled) or stationary. This equipment is usually
configured with grapples for fuel feeding. Whether small- or large-scale, chips
can be blown directly into a van or trailer for transport or piled at the
conversion facility for storage.</P>
<P>
</P>
<P> There also exists a number of options regarding fuel preparation and
handling systems. The wood feedstocks can be chipped &quot;green&quot;
immediately after harvesting. Because many conversion systems are designed to
burn green or high moisture materials (&lt;50%) and a variety of fuels, storing
fuels to reduce the moisture content may not be necessary. Some conversion
systems require that the feedstocks be dried significantly below 50% moisture.
In this case, green chips would then have to be stored. Alternatively, felled
trees can be stored in whole form (or chunks) for storage and drying. This
practice would reduce decomposition losses. However, drier wood is more
difficult to chip and to ensure uniform size.</P>
<H2>Power Generation Options</H2>
<P> The use of plantation-grown biomass can be used for power generation in
three general applications, these include:</P>
<P> 
</P>
<UL>
<LI>stand-alone, grid-connected biomass-based power plants using plantation
grown feedstocks or mixed with agricultural residues;</LI>
<LI>cogeneration at agricultural (e.g., sugar mills and rice mills) and
forestry processing facilities for on-site heat and power needs with export of
excess power to the local distribution grid using a combination of mill wastes
(bagasse, rice hull, wood waste) and plantation-grown biomass;</LI>
<LI>and co-firing at fossil-fired electric generation facilities.</LI></UL>
<P> For each of these applications, the current conversion technology of choice
is the steam-turbine cycle (Rankine cycle). The technology is relatively simple
to operate and it can accept a wide variety of biomass fuels. However, at the
scale appropriate for biomass, the technology is expensive and relatively
inefficient when compared with fossil fuel power plants.<A HREF="notes.html#58">58</A>
As such, the technology is relegated to applications where there is a readily
available supply of low-, zero-, or negative-cost feedstocks.</P>
<P>
</P>
<P> The low efficiency of biomass-fired power plants, relative to fossil-fuel
plants, is due in part to the use of more moderate steam conditions. Biomass
steam-turbine plants use lower pressures and temperatures because of the strong
scale dependence of the unit capital cost ($/kW).59 Biomass plants can not be
built at sufficiently large sizes to take advantage of scale economies (&gt;300
MWe) because the cost of supplying fuel to the plant would be excessive. Woody
biomass has an energy density of slightly less than 20 GJ/dry tonne. When
freshly cut, wood contains about 50% moisture. The high moisture effectively
reduces the energy content of the wood by half. Relative to coal, a tonne of dry
wood has about one-third less heat value than a tonne of coal. The high costs
associated with handling, transporting, and storing large quantities of biomass
effectively will this negate any scale economies associated with building large
conversion facilities.</P>
<P>
</P>
<P> The remainder of this section examines several combustion technologies for
biomass power generation.<A HREF="notes.html#60">60</A> The technologies can be
classified into currently available technologies that are in operation at the
present time or capable of being in operation with minimal developmental
barriers, and emerging technologies that are expected to require overcoming some
technical barriers, before commercialization can be considered.</P>
<H3>Currently Available Technologies<I></I></H3>
<P>
<B>Conventional steam turbine systems.</B> Except for differences in fuel
handling and preparation and emissions control, wood-fired steam turbine power
systems use essentially the same technology as that found in coal-fired plants.
However, the lower density and heating value of wood relative to coal means that
biomass systems require more combustion and heat transfer surface area. The
tradeoff between additional costs of fuel handling and extra boiler combustion
area for wood, and simpler emissions controls relative to coal translates into
approximately the same installed costs ($/kWe) for biomass systems.</P>
<P>
</P>
<P> In a conventional biomass-fired combustion steam turbine, wood is first
prepared (sized and possibly dried) then burned in a boiler to produce
pressurized steam. The steam is expanded in a turbine to generate electricity.
For power production, a fully condensing turbine is used. If process heat is to
be produced in addition to electricity, a condensing-extraction (or
back-pressure) turbine is used instead. In this <I>cogeneration</I> mode, some
steam after producing electricity is taken from the turbine for process heat.</P>
<P>
</P>
<P> Specific boiler types used to generate steam include pile burners (dutch
oven), grate burners (stationary or traveling grate), suspension burners, and
atmospheric fluidized-bed combustors (bubbling-bed or circulating-bed). These
combustion methods will produce boiler efficiencies ranging from 65 to 75% with
net plant efficiencies from 20 to 25%.</P>
<P>
</P>
<P> The most commonly used boilers for wood-fired systems are grate burners.
The grates can be either stationary or traveling. Stollers are used to fuel wood
into the boiler. For wood-fired systems, the spreader-stokes is most often used
decause it can easily handle a wide variety of fuels. A second combustion design
available for biomass are <I>fluidized beds</I>. In these designs wood
(biomass) is injected into the combustion chamber through ports and burned in
suspension. Air entering the boiler fluidizes a bed of hot, granular, inert
material. The inert material heats the biomass quickly to ignition temperature,
stores the thermal energy, and provides the appropriate residence time for full
combustion.</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
<B>Co-firing biomass feedstocks with coal.</B> Co-firing plantation-grown
biomass feedstocks with coal in existing utility steam boilers is a potentially
useful process to reduce SO2 emissions. The addition of scrubbers to a
coal-fired plant would sharply reduce SO2 emissions, but at a high cost. If only
a moderate amount of SO2 emissions reduction is required, co-firing wood and
coal can be a very cost effective alternative. Additions of new fuel handling
equipment, modifications and improvements to boilers and electrostatic
precipitators are required to co-fire with coal, but these changes would likely
be less costly than installing scrubbers, switching to low sulfur coal, or
purchasing emission allowances. Because of the moisture present in wood, some
derating of the boiler may occur.</P>
<H3>Emerging Technologies</H3>
<P> The currently available biomass conversion technologies are relatively
robust with minimal operating problems.<A HREF="notes.html#61">61</A> However,
a significant limitation of these technologies are low operating efficiencies
that are due in part to the high moisture inherent in biomass feedstocks. One
technology under development and testing that offers higher conversion
efficiency is <I>Whole Tree Energy (WTEtm)</I> technology. WTEtm is an
innovative steam turbine technology that uses an integral fuel drying process.<A
HREF="notes.thml#62">62</A>  Waste heat, preheated by the flue gas at 54C is
used to dry the wood stacked in a large, air-inflated building for 30 days
before it is conveyed to a boiler and burned. Allowing the waste heat to dry the
wet whole tree fuel can result in furnace efficiency approaching 87% with a net
plant efficiency comparable to that of a modern coal-fired plant (35%). WTEtm
also reduces wood harvesting and handling costs as well as the need for
equipment such as hammer mills, screens, and chippers that are used for reducing
the size of the wood feedstock. In the Lake States region of the U.S., busbar
electricity costs from WTEtm are projected to be about $0.043/kWh or about
$0.015/kWh less than that of a coal-fired plant.63 WTEtm can be built in sizes
as small as 25 MWe; however, it is more likely that the market for this
technology will be utility-scaled systems. Although there exists technical
potential to increase the conversion efficiency of WTEtm technology and other
steam-turbine cycle systems, these developments are unlikely to be
cost-effective.<A HREF="notes.html#64">64</A></P>
<P>
</P>
<P> According to some experts the most promising technologies for wood-fired
power generation lie in the development of gas turbine cycles.<A
HREF="notes.html#65">65</A> Gas turbines (or Brayton cycles) have already been
developed for natural gas and clean liquid fuels. A key advantage of gas turbine
technology is the potential for substantially reduced capital costs, which are
relatively insensitive to scale, higher conversion efficiencies (upwards of
45%), and greater modularity. Adapting the technology for biomass (i.e., <I>Biomass-gasifier/gas
turbine -- BIG/GT)</I> would require the use of a gasifier to thermochemically
convert wood to a gas. The resultant gas would then be cooled and cleaned before
being burned in a gas turbine. There are a number of technology choices for both
the gasification and power generation portions of the BIG/GT cycle.</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
<B>BIG/GT gasification.</B> There are two principal gasification options for
use with biomass or plantation-grown wood. These are the <I>fixed-bed</I> and
<I>fluidized-bed</I> gasifiers. The most promising of the <I>fixed-bed
gasifier</I> designs for biomass are updraft designs. In these gasifiers, wood
is fed from the top of the gasifier undergoing drying, pyrolysis, and char
gasification and combustion as it moves to the bottom of the gasifier. The gas
is removed from the top side of the gasifier with air and steam injected into
the bottom sides of the gasifier. Fixed-bed gasifiers are simple to operate and
efficient when used with uniform and appropriately sized, high bulk density
(e.g., wood chips) feedstocks. The most important technical issue associated
with these gasifiers is hot-gas cleanup, primarily the removal of alkali
compounds and particulates. Controlling the temperature of the gas and using
cyclones for particulate removal can be used to provide a gas suitable for the
turbines.</P>
<P>
</P>
<P> Relative to fixed-bed gasifiers,<I> fluidized-bed gasifiers</I> have
greater throughput and can handle a greater variety of fuels including
low-density materials such as agricultural wastes. This fuel flexibility
characteristic may make fluidized-bed gasifiers the more appropriate choice for
biomass applications.<A HREF="notes.html#66">66</A> However, the resultant gas
from fluidized beds is more problematic for gas cleaning. The exit gas has a
temperature about 300oC higher than that for fixed-beds (500 to 600oC). The
higher gas temperature requires gas cooling to condense the alkali compounds.
Particulate control is also likely to be more problematic and require the use of
advanced filtering techniques.</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
<B>BIG/GT turbine cycles.</B> There are a number of alternative turbine cycles
available and under development that can use clean fuel gas. In a simple-cycle
configuration, fuel gas is burned in air pressurized by a compressor. The hot
combustion gases are then used to drive a turbine. The exhaust gases from the
turbine can be discharged (<I>open cycle</I>) or used in a heat recovery steam
generator to raise steam for industrial or agricultural processing needs (<I>cogeneration
cycle</I>). Because waste heat is used, the overall efficiency of the
cogeneration cycle is higher than that of the simple cycle.</P>
<P>
</P>
<P> Both the open cycle and cogeneration cycle can generate electricity with an
efficiency of about 32% (less than that from a modern, large-scale steam-turbine
cycle). There are a number of cycles under development and/or demonstration that
have the potential to increase significantly the efficiency of the power
generation side of the cycle. One of these is the BIG/GT <I>combined cycle
(BIG/GTCC)</I>. This cycle is similar to the simple cycle except that steam from
the heat recovery steam generator is used to generate additional power in a
conventional steam turbine.<A HREF="notes.html#67">67</A> About one-third of
the total power output of a BIG/GTCC would come from the steam-turbine side of
the combined cycle.</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
<B>Steam injected gas turbine systems (BIG/STIG)</B> are another option under
development. In the BIG/STIG system waste steam from the heat recovery steam
generator that is not needed for process uses is injected back into the gas
turbine combustor, and at additional points along the flow path the gas is
reheated to turbine inlet temperature, and then passed through the turbine. The
additional steam mass injected into the turbine increases the total power output
of the system and does not consume power at the turbine's compressor. Full steam
injection allows the total system efficiency to approach 40%. An advanced form
of the STIG is the intercooled steam-injected gas turbine (ISTIG). This
variation of the STIG can raise both thermal efficiency (from 47% to 50%) and
shaft power output.</P>
<P>
</P>
<P> In addition to gas turbines, <B>fuel cells</B> are also under development.
Fuel cells convert energy produced by electrochemical oxidation of a fuel like
biomass into electricity. The operation of a fuel cell has gaseous fuels being
fed continuously to the fuel cell's negative electrode (anode), while oxygen or
air (oxidant) is fed continuously to the positive electrode (cathode). A
continuous electrochemical reaction occurs which produces an electrochemical
potential or voltage and electric current similar to that of a conventional
lead-acid battery. Several fuel cell types are currently under development.
However, the phosphoric acid fuel cell (PAFC) is closest to commercialization.<A
HREF="notes.html#68">68</A> The PAFC fuel cell operates at approximately 390F
and has a cycle efficiency of as high as 45%. Advanced fuel cell designs could
reach efficiencies of about 57% by 2020.<A HREF="notes.html#69">69</A></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
<B>Biocrude</B> oils can also be produced from wood using a pyrolysis process
similar to that used in gasification. The wood feedstocks are thermochemically
converted to a sulfur free mixture of biocrude oil vapors, non-condensible
gases, water vapor, and char particles. The biocrude oil vapors are condensed to
form a higher viscosity mixture of organic compounds with a heat value of 8,000
Btu/lb. After the residual non-condensible gases exit the condenser, the gases
are collected and burned as process heat for drying the feedstock or supplying
heat to the reactor. Approximately 60% to 80% of the feedstock can be converted
to biocrude. Biocrude can be used as a substitute for fuel oil for gas turbine
cycles. Biocrude can also be co-fired with other fossil fuels. The pyrolysis
process does not have to take place at the power generation site since the
biocrude can be stored and transported.</P>

<H1>Environmental and Social Benefits/Costs of Biomass Plantations</H1>
<P> Tree biomass plantations potentially offer many direct and indirect
environmental benefits, but they may have negative environmental impacts as
well. As recently discussed by Graham, ascertaining the environmental impacts
are complex because the impacts of using biomass for energy must be considered
in the context of alternative energy options while the impacts of
<I>producing energy crops</I> must be considered in the context of alternative
land uses.<A HREF="notes.html#70">70</A></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
<B>Globally significant environmental benefits<I></I></B> may result from
using wood for energy rather than fossil fuels. The greatest benefit is derived
from substituting biomass energy for coal.<A HREF="notes.html#71">71</A> The
degree of benefit depends greatly on the efficiency with which the wood is
converted to electricity. If the efficiency of conversion of wood to electricity
is similar to coal conversion to electricity then the benefits are several.
Airborne pollutants such as toxic heavy metals, ozone-forming chemicals, and
releases of sulfur that contribute to acid rain will be reduced. The ash and
waste products from burning will, in most cases, be sufficiently benign to
return to the soil. There will be a considerable reduction in net carbon dioxide
emissions that contribute to the greenhouse effect. For example, one dry tonne
of wood will displace 15 GJ of coal. The 15 GJ of coal will have the equivalent
of 0.37 tonnes of carbon assuming the wood is converted at an efficiency of 25%.</P>

<H2>Tree Plantations and Soil/water Issues</H2>
<P> The beneficial effects of forests on water quality, soil erosion
prevention, and the reliability of water supply have long been recognized. The
oldest forest reserve in the Western Hemisphere was established in Trinidad and
Tobago in 1765 with the designation &quot;Reserved in Forest for the Rains,&quot;
followed by further assessments in the 1880s into &quot;Forest Conservation and
the Maintenance of Water Supplies.&quot; Many natural forest reserves have been
established around the world in mountainous areas for the protection of
municipal water supplies. Biomass plantations can also serve this purpose,
particularly if the negative effects of harvest on soils and water supply can be
minimized. Plantations are particularly valuable in improving the water supply
on land that has been degraded by deforestation or desertification.<A
HREF="notes.html#78">78</A></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><IMG ALIGN="LEFT" SRC="fig4_1a.gif"><B>Fig. 4.1a.  Effects of land-cover
type, precipitation, and slope on surface runoff at four tropical sites.</B> The
positive effects of plantations on soil and water conservation results primarily
from protection of the soil surface from the direct impact of rain and from the
improvement of soil structure through root penetration and the addition of
organic matter from decomposing leaves, roots, and wood. In comparison to either
crops or bare soil, forest greatly reduces the proportion of rainfall that is
lost as runoff, thus leaving much more water available to feed springs and
streams during dry periods (Fig. 4.a).  The positive effects of trees on water
retention tend to increase over time, so long rotations and practices that
enhance organic matter input into the soil are particularly favorable.</P>
<P></P>
<P>
</P>
<P> Tree species vary greatly in their effect on soil properties and on water
cycling. Some tree species, such as <I>E. globulus</I> and <I>E. tereticormis</I>,
tend to use water very rapidly, leading to reduced water yield from watersheds,
stress during dry seasons, and creation of unfavorable conditions for
interplanting with food crops.<A HREF="notes.html#79">79</A> On the other hand,
studies on <I>Eucalyptus grandis</I> in Brazil have found the annual variation
in soil water to be similar to that for <I>Pinus caribea </I>and savanna-like
native forests.<A HREF="notes.html#80">80</A> Tree plantations have also been
shown to reduce wind erosion, reduce evaporative losses of water, and improve
soil moisture conditions sufficiently to allow cropping on degraded lands.<A
HREF="notes.html#81">81</A> Nitrogen-fixing species, such as acacias and
leaucena, can improve the soil, reduce the need for expensive nitrogen
fertilizer, and produce fodder for farm animals.</P>
<P> A primary difference between short rotation plantations, and forests
harvested for timber with regard to erosion and water issues is the frequency of
harvesting and replanting. Because 40% of tropical rainfall falls at erosive
rates (greater than 25 mm/hr), soils exposed during and after harvesting are
susceptible to serious erosion. <A HREF="notes.html#82">82</A>
</P>
<P> Harvesting and reestablishment practices thus become a very important
determinant of the potential for environmental damage. When reestablishment
occurs through coppice resprouting, risk of soil loss is minimized by rapid
regrowth. The use of cover crops or grass strips between the rows can reduce
erosion when replanting is required.</P>
<P><IMG ALIGN="RIGHT" SRC="fig4_1b.gif"><B>Fig. 4.1b.  Effects of land-cover
type, precipitation, and slope on erosion at four tropical sites.</B><A
HREF="notes.html#84">84</A>  The potential for soil loss increases greatly with
increasing precipitation and on hilly or mountainous land (Fig. 4.1b).
Harvesting with heavy equipment during rainy seasons is especially likely to
cause serious soil erosion and soil compaction and may destroy the long-term
productivity of a plantation. Due to both equipment constraints and erosion
hazards, biomass plantations that are likely to be harvested every 5-10 years
should not be located on steep, erodible soils. In general, tropical soils are
much more subject to degradation from harvesting than forests on younger soils,
such as those found in much of the temperate zone.<A HREF="notes.html#83">83</A></P>
<P>
</P>
<H2>Tree Plantations and Biodiversity</H2>
<P> Biodiversity refers to the number of different kinds of plants and animals
that are found in a particular area such as a hectare of forest, and entire
country, or the earth. Concern about the loss of biodiversity is based on the
idea that each organism, even those that are unknown and unnamed, has some
value. Many plants and animals are valued for the medicinal chemicals they
produce or for their importance to forestry or agriculture. Other species are
valued for their beauty or other special properties. Many species, even obscure
organisms in the soil, may play important but poorly understood roles in
improving soil fertility, in preventing diseases and pests from affecting crops,
or otherwise maintaining a balance of nature that is favorable to human
existence. For these and many other reasons, there is a broad consensus among
scientists, citizens, and politicians that biodiversity should be preserved by
preventing the extinction of species wherever possible.</P>
<P> Because many birds, mammals, insects, and other animals depend on one to
several particular tree species, extensive biomass plantations of a single tree
species can be extremely destructive to biodiversity when displacing natural
habitats. Clearing natural forests to establish plantations usually destroys
biodiversity and should be avoided. Many of the forests with high biodiversity
occur on soils that are too poor to support productive plantations, so there is
usually no economically or biologically sound reason to replace them with
plantations. Establishment of plantations on degraded lands that were previously
deforested will usually have a positive effect on local biodiversity by
improving the habitat for plants and animals that cannot survive deforested
areas and may have other benefits such as improvement of water quality and
quantity and soil improvement.</P>
<P>
</P>
<P> Tree plantations can be beneficial to biodiversity if properly designed or
can be destructive of biodiversity when designed inappropriately.<A
HREF="notes.html#85">85</A> The effect of biomass plantations on biodiversity
may depend as much on how they fit into the landscape as the particular species
and management systems selected. Studies in the United States on hybrid poplar
plantings have shown varied use by wildlife, depending on the surrounding
landscape. For example, plantations adjacent to natural forest seem to reduce &quot;edge
effects&quot; and expand the usable areas for forest interior bird species in
predominately agricultural areas.</P>
<P>
</P>
<P> There is considerable controversy on the use of non-native species on the
scale that might be required for biomass energy. Plantations based on non-native
species, such as eucalyptus outside of Australia and teak outside of Asia, are
generally believed to provide little suitable habitat for native animals,<A
HREF="notes.html#86">86</A> although research on this issue is continuing.
Depending on the planned energy conversion technology, plantations for biomass
may be able to utilize a wider variety of tree species and thus may support a
higher biodiversity of plants and animals than single-species hardwood or pulp
plantations that must produce a crop that is extremely uniform in form and other
properties.</P>
<P> Biomass plantations can have a positive effect on biodiversity if their
design includes preserving areas of natural forest of different types within the
overall plantation area. Research has shown that areas of natural forest
included within plantations is favorable for many native species of plants and
animals.<A HREF="notes.html#87">87</A> Properly designed plantations should
include areas of natural vegetation, appropriate wooded buffers for waterways
and corridors for wildlife movement, as well as protection of historical areas.<A
HREF="notes.html#88">88</A> Since the 1960s Brazil has required forest
companies to either leave 10% of the managed area in natural vegetation or
ensure that 1% of the trees planted are native species. The 10% option has
normally been preferred and has resulted in positive benefits for both bird
diversity and insect pest control. <A HREF="notes.html#89">89</A></P>
<P> Specific guidelines developed by the National Biofuels Roundtable in the
United States for improving habitat are:</P>
<P> 
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Match native ecosystem cover types as much as possible (e.g., perennial
grasses in prairie regions and trees in woodland regions). In addition, emulate
natural vegetation patterns and functions when establishing energy crops on
agricultural lands.</LI>
<LI>Locate, plant, and harvest tracts of energy crops in ways that help improve
pathways for animals to move between habitats and across landscapes in any
particular year.</LI>
<LI>Employ energy crops in ways that minimize the fragmentation of desirable
habitats and improve overall habitat quality of the landscape for native
species.</LI></UL>
<P>
</P>
<H2>Tree Plantations and Chemical Pollution</H2>
<P> The previous use of the land will determine the extent to which chemical
pollution is an issue. Plantations generally require fewer inputs of
fertilizers, herbicides, and pesticides than more intensive forms of
agriculture.<A HREF="notes.html#90">90</A> In regions of extensive agricultural
activity where non-point pollution of streams is a problem, tree plantations may
improve water quality by serving as a filter of agricultural chemicals.</P>
<P> Establishment of plantations on pasture land, as may occur in many parts of
the developing world, would result in additional use of some chemicals unless
hand labor is used to control weeds. As described in Chapter 2, methods are
available to minimize chemical use such as mulching and applying chemical only
in strips around the trees though the relative costs of these measures have not
been well established. Pest control can occur with minimal chemical use if
frequent monitoring and biological control methods are used. The most effective
method of pest control is to maintain ongoing breeding and genetic selection
program so that susceptible trees can be eliminated and replaced with resistant
varieties. Brazilian pulp and paper companies have been successful in
controlling pest problems though genetic selection programs.</P>
<H2>Tree Plantations and Social Economics</H2>
<P> Successful woody crops can provide multiple economic, social, and
environmental benefits to a state, region, country if properly planned and
integrated into the multiple landuse opportunities within the country. In
regions where the amount of good quality soil is limited, use of the best soils
for biomass crop production will displace other land uses. The concern expressed
most often is that use of land to produce biomass crops will reduce food
availability. Such a concern was expressed in the mid-eighties when sugarcane
establishment was accelerating in the agricultural state of S&atilde;o Paulo,
Brazil as a result of subsidies provided by the National Program for Alcohol
production (commonly referred to as ProAlcool). The article entitled &quot;Brazilian
Alcohol: Food versus Fuel&quot; by Rosillo-Calle and Hall describes the
complexity of food production and export policies in Brazil as well as details
on the sugar cane expansion.<A HREF="notes.html#91">91</A> The food versus fuel
controversy was exaggerated in their view. They conceded that the ProAlcool
might be part of a larger overall problem which would best be described as a &quot;commodity
export crop production versus domestic food production&quot; issue. With 64% of
the sugar cane expansion in the state of S&atilde;o Paulo occurring on pasture
land owned by large land-holders, displacement of primary food production was
not the major issue. </P>
<P>
</P>
<P> Tree plantations always exist in a social and cultural setting based on the
inhabitants of the area before the plantation was created, and the inhabitants
who arrived after the plantation was established. To be economically successful,
and to avoid negative effects on society and the natural environment, each
plantation must be designed for its own specific social, cultural, and
environmental setting. Factors that must be considered include</P>
<P> 
</P>
<OL>
<LI>preexisting land uses;</LI>
<LI>local agricultural practices; </LI>
<LI>local political systems and hierarchies of authority;</LI>
<LI>local cultural divisions of labor and authority between men and women;
</LI>
<LI>local traditions of land tenure and stewardship including private property
right; and</LI>
<LI>local cultural values.<A HREF="notes.html#92">92</A></LI></OL>
<P> Because plantations must depend on local labor, it is desirable to maintain
the structure of the local community in a way that provides a steady supply of
reliable workers. The more the plantation can be integrated into the daily
economic and social life of the community, to the mutual benefit of both the
community and the plantation, the more likely it is to succeed in the long run.
For this reason, Brazil and China are leaders in investigation of agroforestry
techniques for large scale use. Tree establishment can be enhanced, and the need
for dangerous chemicals reduced, through the interplanting of agricultural crops
during the first years after planting. This type of agroforestry benefits the
plantation as well as the local community by providing food and/or cash crops.</P>
<P>
</P>
<P> The use of multipurpose trees that provide energy products, animal fodder,
and enrich the soil through nitrogen fixation are viewed as the ideal energy
tree.<A HREF="notes.html#93">93</A> It is likely this is the reason that
leucaena was the species selected for use in the Philippine Dendrothermal
program. Research has continued around the world on leucaena, acacias and other
nitrogen fixing trees such as black locust. However, there has been an
unfortunate tendency for these species to be susceptible to insect pests.
Leucaena plantings have largely been destroyed by a psyllid pest and black
locust is susceptible to a stem borer. These problems may be solved through
genetic selection, biotechnology or biological control agents ,but at present,
the widespread planting of nitrogen fixing trees for energy or pulp is not
occurring. Even so, the multipurpose tree concept is a good one that deserves
continued consideration. One success story is occurring in Brazil with a company
that has a specialized conversion technology to produce pulp, alcohol, cattle
feed and even electricity from a bamboo (Bambusa vulgaris) species.<A
HREF="notes.html#94">94</A></P>
<P>
</P>
<P> In summary, plantations for production of biomass energy have numerous
potential environmental benefits. Conclusions from a roundtable of industry,
academic, and government participants in the United States found that &quot;if
energy crops are included in the general mix of agricultural crops in a
considered and informed way, environmental damage can be avoided; in fact, there
could be significant environmental and ecological benefits achieved in tandem
with the development of a fully sustainable energy resource.&quot;<A

<H1>Economics of Plantation-grown Fuels for Power Generation</H1>
<P> Feasibility studies tend to show that plantation-grown biomass to
electricity projects can be financially viable provided local resource
conditions are favorable and that the cost of conventional power supplies are
expensive. Improving the competitiveness of plantation-grown fuels for power
generation will require:</P>
<P></P>
<UL>
<LI>lower cost and sustainable feedstock production systems,</LI>
<LI>and more efficient and lower capital cost conversion technologies at scales
appropriate for biomass energy applications.</LI></UL>
<P> This final chapter discusses the costs of producing plantation-grown
biomass and the costs of generating electricity from these fuels.</P>
<P></P>
<P></P>
<H2>The Costs of Producing and Harvesting Plantation Fuels</H2>
<P> Key to producing low-cost plantation feedstocks is the land base and the
quality of sites. The land base and the quality of sites determine to a
significant extent the degree of site preparation necessary; the choice of
species, spacings, and rotations (cutting cycles); required cultural management
and soil amendments (fertilization, weed control, animal control, and pest
management); and fuel transport and logistics.<A HREF="notes.html#96">96</A>
Land and site quality also defines biomass productivity, the major determinant
of total feedstock cost. Productivity is also a key factor in determining the
total size of the plantation, annual feedstock production, and the size of the
conversion facility that can be supported. Some of these land and site quality
tradeoffs are illustrated in Fig 5.1. , <B>the effect of biomass plant scale on
feedstock requirements and transport distances.</B></P>
<P><IMG
ALIGN="RIGHT" SRC="fig5_1.gif" ALT="Fig 5.1. The effect of biomass plant scale on feedstock requirements and transport distances"></P>
<P> The right-hand portion in Fig. 5.1 shows how the total plantation area
required to meet a given feedstock requirement is affected by productivity (dry
tonnes/ha/yr). Greater plantation productivity directly translates into reduced
land requirements. Alternatively, a given plantation land area will be capable
of supporting more conversion facility capacity at higher levels of
productivity. The left-hand panel shows a similar relationship with net plant
efficiency. Higher conversion efficiency translates into more installed plant
capacity for a given feedstock requirement or less required plantation area for
a given installed capacity.</P>
<P></P>
<P> In North America and Europe, developers of short-rotation plantation
forestry initially assumed that marginal cropland, poorly stocked forest land,
and pasture would be the land base for growing energy crops. This focus
gradually changed when it became apparent that there was excess and
underutilized cropland not needed for food production, and plantation-grown
feedstocks could be a potentially important alternative crop to conventional
agriculture.<A HREF="notes.html#97">97</A> Economic studies also showed that
the use of good cropland for energy plantations was more cost-effective than
using marginal cropland or poorly stocked forest land. The additional cost of
the land was offset by lower establishment costs and, more importantly, higher
biomass productivity. In addition, the use of cropland for energy plantations is
thought to have positive environmental benefits in terms of reduced erosion and
chemical use relative to the marginal row crop agriculture it would displace.
And, in some locations, the use of cropland could improve habitat and
biodiversity.<A HREF="notes.html#98">98</A></P>
<P></P>
<P>In contrast, the land base for plantation-grown feedstocks in tropical,
developing countries is primarily cleared and degraded forest lands, forest
lands occupied by low-value commercial species or brush, marginal forest lands
that have many physical limitations (e.g., poor soils, low rainfall, high
elevations and steep slopes) and, possibly, non-forest land including
extra-marginal cropland, savannah, and arid wastelands.<A HREF="notes.html#99">99</A>
Growing populations and increasing needs for food production makes it unlikely
that plantation feedstocks will be grown on cropland.<A HREF="notes.html#100">100</A>
The biomass productivity potential of marginal land is likely to be lower, and
may not be sufficient to warrant investments in trees crops for power generation
unless the opportunity cost or land rent of these lands is also low.</P>
<P></P>
<P> In a recently completed assessment of the economic status of energy crops
in the U.S., total plantation establishment costs on cropland were estimated at
about $580/hectare.<A HREF="notes.html#101">101</A> This estimate included
factor costs for site preparation (plowing and disking), planting, and weed
control (cultivation and herbicide spraying). Planting is the single largest
establishment cash expense. The estimate is generally applicable for a variety
of woody crops (hybrid poplar, silver maple, sweetgum, black locust, and
sycamore) grown in the Northeast, Southeast, Midwest, Lake States, and Pacific
Northwest.</P>
<P></P>
<P> The relatively low-cost of plantation establishment is because the land
does not require clearing or extensive tillage and weed control, and there are
essentially no site limitations or the need for significant quantities of soil
amendments, such as fertilizers. However, when extensive site preparation and
fertilization is required, establishment costs can easily exceed $1000/hectare.<A
HREF="notes.html#102">102</A> For plantations in Hawaii, establishment costs
approach $1400/hectare.<A HREF="notes.html#103">103</A> Because land is a
combination of recently harvested sugar cane land, abandoned cane land, and
waste land that is steep, poorly drained, and rocky, factor costs for clearing
and weed control are high (about 55% of total establishment costs). Labor and
fuel costs are also higher relative to the U.S. mainland. However, high
establishment costs can be economically justified provided productivity is also
commensurately high.</P>
<P></P>
<P> After the second year of growth, the management of plantations is not
intensive requiring only one or two applications of fertilizer to maintain soil
nutrient levels. These costs are minimal for the U.S. on good cropland (about
$80/hectare during each rotation of 5 to 7 years). Because of the poorer site
conditions, higher factor costs, and the need for greater quantities of
nutrients to support higher biomass productivity, fertilization costs are nearly
$500/hectare over a five-year rotation for plantations in Hawaii. Prior to
harvest, total establishment and maintenance costs (undiscounted) are about
$660/hectare on good cropland on the U.S. mainland and about $1850/hectare on
caneland in Hawaii.</P>
<P></P>
<P> In Brazil, plantation establishment practices for large-scale industrial
operations involve the use of disks and the construction of tree beds and check
dams to prevent erosion.<A HREF="notes.html#104">104</A> Following preparation,
sites are planted and watered. As in the industrialized temperate regions, weed
control is critical and done at least twice each year until canopy closure
occurs. These establishment practices usually involve manual labor except in
larger-scaled operations where herbicides are used for weed control. The costs
of plantation establishment in Northeast Brazil range from about $580 to
$1170/hectare with maintenance costs varying from about $140 to $860/hectare
over a seven-year rotation.<A HREF="notes.html#105">105</A> Much of the
variation in establishment costs is due to planting costs. Carpentieri et al.
cite planting costs ranging from $371 to $811/hectare for Northeast Brazil.<A
HREF="notes.html#106">106</A></P>
<P></P>
<P> Where sites have been degraded or have physical limitations, site
preparation must be more intensive. For example, severely degraded plantation
sites in Southwest China require the construction of pits and terraces to halt
further erosion and hold moisture.<A HREF="notes.html#107">107</A> Composts are
also used to supply nutrients and condition the soils.<A HREF="notes.html#108">108</A>
On grasslands and brushy sites in the Philippines, site preparation involves
extensive land clearing (slashing and burning) prior to digging tree pits and
planting. Owing to the scarcity of capital, equipment, and materials, site
preparation and maintenance is done manually with hand tools. The number of
labor days required to establish and maintain a wood energy plantation in
Southwest China can range between 150 to 300 workdays/hectare depending on the
degree of site degradation.<A HREF="notes.html#109">109</A> In the Philippines,
the average labor requirements for establishment and maintenance are about 170
days/hectare with most of this for clearing and brushing.<A
HREF="notes.html#110">110</A></P>
<P></P>
<P> The productivity and costs of plantation harvesting systems were discussed
previously. These costs can be variable, generally ranging from about $18 to
$35/dry tonne for mechanized felling, skidding, and chipping. For manual
operations, the amount of labor required to harvest one hectare can vary
considerably among sites. For the Southwest China and Philippines examples,
these rates range from about 75 to over 130 workdays/hectare on average. The
costs of harvesting (felling, cutting, and forwarding to a landing) for both
examples are about $5/dry tonne. In the case of Brazil, harvesting costs (not
including chipping) are slightly higher (about $7/dry tonne).</P>

<P> Because of different factor input and financial assumptions, these
estimates are not entirely comparable. For example, the developing country
examples do not include chipping. Feedstock size reduction is part of the fuel
preparation process at the conversion facility. The Southwest China example does
not include land rent since there is little opportunity cost associated with
degraded hillside land. In spite of these caveats, these estimates can be used
to provide a general indication of cost and how competitive plantation feedstock
production is likely to be. On the basis of the costs of coal, currently at less
than $2.00/GJ in most of the world, these feedstocks are not competitive. Where
coal is unavailable at low cost, plantation feedstock production can be
competitive with other alternatives.</P>
<P>
</P>
<P> The costs of plantation-grown feedstocks in any given country will vary
considerably because of localized variations in land quality or biomass
productivity, land rents, and other factor inputs. This localized variation in
delivered feedstock costs can be illustrated by the data from Northeast Brazil,
where average wood costs range from a low of about $1.00/GJ to $4.60/GJ across
five bioclimatic regions. This relationship is displayed in Fig. 5.2 for the
five bioclimatic regions. </P>
<P><IMG
ALIGN="LEFT" SRC="fig5_2.gif" ALT="Fig 5.2. Variation in delivered feedstock costs by bioclimatic region in Northeast Brazil"></P>
<P>The high and low estimates of delivered feedstock costs are based on the use
of high and low estimates for land, planting costs, and productivity
differences, which range between 3 and 21 dry tonnes/ha.<A HREF="notes.html#111">111</A>
The costs of producing biomass in each bioclimatic region can be associated with
land availability to determine the average cost of supplying plantation-grown
feedstocks in Northeast Brazil. This feedstock supply curve is shown in Fig.
5.3. <A HREF="notes.html#114">114</A></P>
<P><IMG
ALIGN="RIGHT" SRC="fig5_3.gif" ALT="Fig 5.3 Average cost of plantation-grown feedstocks in Northeast Brazil"></P>
<P></P>
<P>The curve is upward sloping indicating the quantities of feedstock that are
available at any given delivered cost are limited. For example, about 5000 GJ of
feedstocks are potentially available at costs of about $1.25/GJ. An additional
7000 GJ are available annually for costs of about $1.60/GJ. Due to the scarcity
of land, the cost of plantation feedstocks increase sharply beyond annual
production of 12000 GJ.</P>
<P>
</P>
<H2> The Costs of Power Production from Plantation Fuels</H2>
<P>
</P>
<P> Biomass-based power generation is often competitive with fossil
alternatives provided a low-cost supply of feedstock is available. This fact
tends to hold true even considering that conventional biomass steam-turbine
technology is capital intensive and inefficient at scales appropriate for
biomass. Figure 5.4 illustrates the relationship betwen the cost of power
($/kWh) and fuel cost ($/GJ). The low efficiency line in Fig. 5.4 represents a
conventional steam-turbine facility having an installed cost of about $1900/kW
with an efficiency of about 23%. Generating power at costs (busbar) of $0.05/kWh
would require a feedstock supply costing less than $1/GJ.</P>
<P><IMG ALIGN="LEFT" SRC="fig5_4.gif"><B>Fig. 5.4 The effect of fuel costs
for low-efficiency (conventional steam turbine) technology and a
high-efficiency, low-capital cost technology.
</B></P>
<P> In the U.S. and Europe, efforts are underway to develop lower capital cost
and higher efficiency biomass conversion technology. This technology would make
the use of plantation-grown fuels much more competitive with currently available
fossil-fired alternatives. Figure 5.4 illustrates the effect of lower capital
cost and higher efficiency technology. This example is based on biomass
integrated gasifier/combined cycle (BIG/CC) technology currently under
development and demonstration in Northeast Brazil. The line labeled high
efficiency is for a plant costing $1300/kW installed with a system efficiency of
slightly more than 35%. Comparing this high efficiency technology with the
conventional, low effieciency technology shows a difference of about $0.02/kWh
in power costs or about $2/GJ in terms of fuel cost. This example indicates that
power could be produced at $0.05/kWh with fuel costs of about $2.80/GJ. At this
fuel cost, plantation-grown feedstocks would be much more competitive with
conventional alternatives even before considering the other environmental and
developmental benefits of biomass energy.</P>
<P>
</P>
<H2>Conclusions</H2>
<P>
</P>
<P> In this report, the biologic, environmental, economic and operational
issues were stressed for plantation-grown woody crops. The report did not stress
conversion technology. Those interested in learning more about conversion
processes may want to consult the references contained in the end-notes to this
Report. It is hoped that this Report will help planners and decision makers when
they consider the use of woody crops for power generation as a either a
dedicated feedstock or as a supplement to an existing residue or waste fuel.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P> The background used in highlighting the worldwide experience with
plantation-grown feedstocks was drawn from firsthand observations, personal
contacts, and secondary information and data sources. Although the authors have
attempted to incorporate as much as information as possible on the status of
plantation-grown fuels for power generation, there is, no doubt, that some
relevant experiences with plantation fuels should have been included in this
report. Oak Ridge National Laboratory would greatly appreciate receiving any
information that would be relevant to include in an updated version of this
report. As can be inferred from this report, biomass systems (feedstock
production, handling and logistics, and conversion) are very complex and
potentially difficult to implement; however, biomass energy offers many benefits
both locally and globally. Sharing common experiences is one-way to overcome the
inertia in getting plantation-grown fuels from the research and demonstration
stage to initial commercialization and eventually wide-scale use.</P>

biomass-fired electric generating capacity increased more than thirty-fold
during the 1980s. Total installed capacity is now about 9 GW with nearly 90% of
this generating capacity connected to utility grids. This growth in biomass
energy use was a direct result of the Public Utility Regulation Policy Act
(PURPA) of 1978, which requires utilities to purchase power from independent
power producers at avoided costs.</P>

in cane production. This land is steep, poorly drained, and rocky. Forest land
is secondary forest zoned for agriculture. Little development of forest land
occurred, however, because the cost of clearing and developing access roads was
too costly.</P>

<P>
</P>
<P>  The economic and supply structures of energy crop markets have not been
established.  Establishing the likely price and supply of energy crop biomass in
a region is a complex task because biomass is not an established commodity as
are oil, natural gas, and coal.  In this study, the cost and supply of
short-rotation woody crop (SRWC) and switchgrass biomass for the Tennessee
Valley Authority (TVA) region--a 276-county area that includes portions of 11
states in the southeastern United States--are projected.  Projected prices and
quantities of biomass are assumed to be a function of the amount and quality of
crop and pasture land available in a region, expected energy crop yields and
production costs on differing soils and land types, and the profit that could be
obtained from current conventional crop production on these same lands.  Results
include the supply curves of SRWC and switchgrass biomass that are projected to
be available from the entire region, the amount and location of crop and pasture
land that would be used, and the conventional agricultural crops that would be
displaced as a function of energy crop production.</P>
<P>  Finally, the results of sensitivity analysis on the projected cost and
supply of energy crop biomass are shown.  In particular, the separate impacts of
varying energy crop production costs and yields, and interest rates are
examined.</P>
<H2> <A NAME="intro">1.  INTRODUCTION</A></H2>
<P>
</P>
<P>  The goal of this project was to provide the Tennessee Valley Authority
(TVA) with information with which to evaluate land base capabilities in terms of
supplying sufficient biomass from energy crops at a price that would allow it to
compete with coal.  Specifically, the objective of this research was to
determine how much biomass could be grown, where it could be grown, how much it
would cost to produce, and what the price would be. </P>
<P>  The potential land base for energy crop production was defined by TVA and
encompassed the 201 TVA service counties plus 75 additional counties that were
within a 75-mile radii of existing TVA coal-fired power plants.  The energy
crops considered in this analysis were SRWCs (short-rotation woody crops) and
switchgrass.  SRWCs are trees grown at tight spacings with weed control and some
fertilizer application.  The wood and bark of the boles and branches are
harvested at 6- to 10-year rotations, whereas the leaves, stumps, and roots
remain on the site (<A HREF="supplref.html#wright92a">Wright et al. 1992a</A>).
 A variety of hardwood tree species (hybrid poplar, sweetgum, sycamore, and
black locust) was considered in the analysis.  Switchgrass (<I>Panicum
varigatum</I>) is a native perennial tallgrass-prairie species.  It is a C4
plant and a bunchgrass.  Switchgrass can take several years to become
established.  Stands are ready for harvest during their second growing season
and annually thereafter.  Switchgrass is harvested and baled like any other hay
crop and, like other grasses, provides good erosion control.  For maximum
production, it requires some fertilizer application.  Four production scenarios
were examined in the analysis:  (1)  SRWC production on agricultural land,
assuming current expected SRWC and conventional crop yields; (2)  switchgrass
production on agricultural land, assuming current expected switchgrass and
conventional crop yields; (3)  SRWC production on agricultural land, assuming
current conventional crop yields and a 25% in SRWC yields; and (4)  switchgrass
production on agricultural land, assuming current conventional crop yields and a
25% increase in switchgrass yields.</P>

<H2>POTENTIAL SUPPLY AND COST OF BIOMASS FROM ENERGY CROPS IN THE TVA REGION:
METHODS</H2>
<P></P>
<H3><B>2.1  INTRODUCTION</B></H3>
<P> 	Because energy crops<A HREF="supplref.html#f1"><I>[1]</I></A> are not
currently grown in the TVA region, organized markets for SRWC and switchgrass
feedstocks do not exist.  Consequently, quantity and price information for
biomass energy crop feedstock must be modeled.  The model of energy crop price
and supply used in this analysis is based on the assumption that farmers will
convert their agricultural land to biomass production when the profit received
from producing biomass meets or exceeds current profit margins received from
producing conventional agricultural crops or using their land for pasture
[Equation (1)].</P>
<P> ( YLD<I>c</I> * PRICE<I>c</I> ) - COST<I>c</I>  = ( YLD<I>w</I> * BEP )
- COST<I>w</I> , <BR>  where <BR> 
<I>c</I>	= conventional crop displaced by the energy crop,<BR>
<I>w</I>	= type of energy crop (switchgrass or SRWC species), <BR> YLD<I>c</I>	=
yield expected for conventional crop c (bushels or bales per acre),<BR> PRICE<I>c</I>	=
expected market price of the conventional crop <I>c</I> ($ per bushel or bale),<BR>
COST<I>c</I>	= cost of producing conventional crop <I>c</I> ($ per acre),<BR>
YLD<I>w</I>	= annual harvested yield of energy crop w (tons per acre per year),<BR>
BEP	= break-even price of harvested energy crop biomass ($ per ton),<BR> COST<I>w</I>	=
annual cost of producing energy crop <I>w</I> ($ per acre).<A
HREF="supplref.html#f2"><I>[2]</I></A></P>
<P> The left side of the equation may be considered land rent or returns to
land and management from growing conventional crops on cropland or maintaining
pastureland in pasture production.  Agricultural commodity payments or other
government subsidies are not included in this land rent because existing
programs are likely to change in the near future.</P>
<P>	The right side of the equation, along the same line, is the land rent
received from growing biomass crops on the same land.  If all other variables
can be quantified, the break-even price can be solved.</P>
<P>	For cropland, the farm-gate price of biomass--the price a utility would
have to pay a farmer for harvested biomass (not transported)--was assumed to be
the same as the biomass break-even price associated with the most profitable
dominant conventional crop that could be grown on the land.  Using the
break-even price associated with the most profitable crop rather than the
actually grown crop provided some assurance that the farm-gate prices were not
underestimated.  Dominant conventional crops (such as corn, soybeans, wheat, and
cotton) were used to define the farm-gate price under the assumption that these
crops, rather than minor crops such as barley, rye, and sorghum, would define
the regional economics of energy crop production.</P>
<P><IMG ALIGN="LEFT" SRC="fig1.gif"> 	The analysis is also based on the
assumption that differences in soil quality, climate, and land use across the
region will create geographic variation in the cost and potential supplies of
energy crop feedstocks.  Yields of both conventional crops and energy crops are
sensitive to land quality and climate.  Consequently, farm-gate prices of
biomass should show geographic variability reflective of that sensitivity. 
Energy crop supplies will be a function not only of yields but also of the
availability of agricultural land.  The geographic distribution of agricultural
land should also be very important in defining regional supply patterns.  Thus,
the model structure is designed to capture the effect of these three spatial
factors on energy crop price and supply.</P>
<P>	Two elements not incorporated in the model structure were transportation
costs from field to conversion plant and agricultural risk to farmers. 
Transportation costs are conversion plant specific, and other analyses for this
region have shown over-the-road transportation costs for wood to range from $10
to $20 per (dry) ton, depending on transport distance (<A
HREF="supplref.html#noon">Noon 1993</A>).  Transportation  costs for
switchgrass have not been projected for this region but are assumed to range
from $5 to $20 per ton (Cundiff, J. S., Virginia Polytechnic Institute,
Blacksburg, unpublished data, 1993).</P>
<P>	The impact of agricultural risk on farmer's decision-making processes is
difficult to quantify.  Its effects would depend on the supply/demand
infrastructure which is unknown at this point.  If risk is lower than it is for
conventional crops, the farm-gate price could be lower than projected using the
concept of a break-even price.  If risk is perceived as the same or higher, the
farm-gate price might be higher.</P>
<P><IMG ALIGN="RIGHT" SRC="fig2.gif"> 	The approach used to project potential
biomass supplies in the TVA region is diagrammed in  and described in the
following five sections of text.  The approach is divided into five
interconnected stages.  In Stages 1-3, geographic-specific values for the
components of Eq. (1) are derived and the TVA region land base is characterized.
 In Stage 4, the farm-gate prices for switchgrass and SRWC wood are calculated. 
In Stage 5, the projected farm-gate prices and energy crop yields are linked
with data on land use and land quality in the region.  The potential supply of
grass or wood feedstock from energy crop production is projected at the county
level, and regionwide supply curves of energy  crop feedstock are derived.</P>
<P></P>
<H3>2.2  CHARACTERIZE LAND BASE AND CROPS--STAGE 1</H3>
<P><IMG ALIGN="LEFT" SRC="fig3.gif">  	In this stage, land use, soils, current
crops, and crop yields in the 276-county region are characterized.  To capture
intraregional physiographic and climatic differences that influence energy crop
and conventional crop yields, the region is broken into eight subregions. 
Boundaries of subregions are based on current land use and physiographic
features and largely followed the U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA's)
Major Land Resource Areas (MLRA) (<A HREF="supplref.html#usda81">USDA 1981</A>).
 The three most dominant conventional crops (in terms of acreage planted) in
each of the eight subregions are identified by using national agricultural
statistics for 1988-1989 (<A HREF="supplref.html#usda89">USDA 1989</A>).  In
the Northwest, Nashville, Plateau and Delta/Coastal Plain subregions, the crops
are corn, soybeans, and wheat.  In the Ridge and Valley and North Alabama
subregions, the crops are corn, cotton, and soybeans, and in the Smokies and
Western Uplands subregions, they are cotton, soybeans, and wheat.  National
Agricultural Statistical Service data at the county level for 1988, 1989, and
1990 are also used to calculate the average yield of the three dominant crops
within each subregion (<A HREF="supplref.html#usda89">USDA 1989</A>).</P>
<P>	Soil Conservation Service (SCS) agricultural capability classes are used to
characterize soil quality.  The classes signify limitations in crop choice and
are based on soil and site characteristics.  There are eight general classes
ranging from 1 (few limitations restricting cropland use) to 8 (precluded from
cropland use).  Classes 5-8 are generally unsuitable for growing crops.  Within
classes 2-8, four subclasses define the primary cause of cropland limitations. 
These subclasses are w (excessive water), e (erosion potential), s (soil
restrictions--salinity, shallowness, or texture problems), and c (climate
restrictions).  For the analysis, the 29 SCS classes are aggregated into nine
soil categories by grouping classes 5-8 into one category and grouping classes
3w and 4w together and classes 3s and 4s together.  This grouping results in
nine categories--1, 2e, 2s, 2w, 3e, 3-4s, 3-4w, 4e, and 5+.  No
climate-restricted soils are present in the study area, and 2s and 3-4s soils
are rare or absent.</P>
<P>	The 1982 National Resources Inventory (NRI) data base (<A
HREF="supplref.html#scs">SCS 1984</A>) is used to determine (1) the relative
distribution of cropland and pastureland across the nine soil categories in each
subregion, (2) the relative proportion of the cropland planted to each of the
three most dominant crops in each soil category in each subregion, and (3) the
SCS soil name most commonly (in terms of acreage) associated with a particular
soil category in each subregion.  The most common soil name for each soil
category in each subregion is further characterized by means of the SCS SOILS5
database.</P>
<P>	Land-use data from the 1987 Agricultural Census (<A
HREF="supplref.html#usdc">U.S. Department of Commerce 1989</A>) are used to
quantify the amount of cropland and pastureland in each county.  In the
analysis, &quot;cropland&quot; includes all cropland categories in the census,
except for cropland used for grazing and pasture or planted to tobacco,
horticulture, orchards, or vegetables.  The latter cropland is excluded because
it is highly profitable and unlikely to be converted to energy crops.  Pasture
is defined as the sum of two census categories--permanent pasture and cropland
used for grazing and pasture.  The resulting county-level acreage for cropland
and pasture is then apportioned among the nine soil categories according to the
soil category/land use relationships derived from the NRI for the county's
subregion.</P>
<P>
</P>
<H3>2.3	DEVELOP CROP MANAGEMENT AND PRODUCTION COSTS--STAGE 2</H3>
<P> 	For conventional crops--soybeans, cotton, corn, and wheat, The University
of Tennessee (UT) Agricultural Extension Service publication <I>Guide to Farm
Planning</I> manual (<A HREF="supplref.html#johnson">Johnson 1990</A>) is used
as the basis for defining crop management activities and crop production costs. 
These include application and timing of fertilizer, harvest date, labor costs,
and equipment usage.</P>
<P>	In lieu of determining the value of production from pastureland and the
costs of maintaining pasture [left side of Eq. (1)], the USDA Economic Research
Service's dollar-per-acre value of pastureland rent is used (<A
HREF="supplref.html#usda90">USDA 1990</A>).  These values are specific to each
state.  The pasture rent value for the state that dominates a subregion defines
the pasture rent value for that subregion.  Thus for pastureland, the left side
of the break-even equation is a constant, sensitive only to subregion.</P>
<P>	Several tree species are suitable for SRWC production within the TVA
region:  sweetgum (<I>Liquidambar styraciflua</I>), poplar (<I>Populus spp</I>.),
sycamore (<I>Platanus occidentalis</I>), and black locust (<I>Robinia
pseudoacacia</I>).  In this analysis, each species is assigned to the soil
categories for which it is projected to have the best growth relative to the
other species.  Poplar is assigned to the 1 and 2w soil categories, sweetgum to
the 2e and 2s soil categories, black locust to the 3e and 3-4s categories, and
sycamore to the 3-4w category.  No SRWC species is considered suitable for
growing on soil categories 4e and 5+.</P>
<P>	Previous information collected by field researchers from experimental field
production of SRWC was used to outline management scenarios and construct
production costs for each of the species.  Rotations varied in length from 6 to
10 years, and coppice rotations were assumed for poplar, sweetgum, and sycamore.
 Although species are managed differently, all species are assumed to have
uniform harvest loss of 15% of the standing yield.  The management schemes for
pasture conversion are the same as for plantation establishment on cropland but
include more site preparation.  The SRWC management schemes do not vary between
the two SRWC production scenarios (current yields and 25% increase in current
yields).</P>
<P>	Two management schemes were developed for switchgrass--one for
establishment on pasture and one for establishment on cropland.  Both are based
on work by Bransby and Parrish (<A HREF="supplref.html#bransby">Bransby et al.
1990</A>;
<A HREF="supplref.html#parrish">Parrish et al. 1990</A>).  In both cases,
harvest/storage losses of 14% are assumed and switchgrass is reestablished every
10 years.  Unlike SRWC, switchgrass production is considered possible on all
nine soil categories, including 4e and 5+.  Thus, the potential land base for
switchgrass production is slightly larger.  As with SRWC, management schemes for
switchgrass do not vary for the two switchgrass scenarios (current and 25%
increased yields).</P>
<P> 	Production costs for both SRWC and switchgrass include materials
(seedlings or seeds, fertilizer, and pesticides), equipment, and hourly labor
costs.  SRWC production costs also include contract aerial spraying of
pesticides and contract harvesting and chipping.  The discount rate is set at
6%.  Machine labor rates are assumed to be fixed at $7.80/h.  Harvesting and
chipping costs  account for nearly half of the total cost of SRWC production and
are sensitive to the amount of wood harvested per acre.  SRWC harvest and
chipping costs are assumed to be $17 per (dry) ton if 30 (dry) tons are
harvested per acre and to increase if fewer tons are harvested (Anthony
Turhollow, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Oak Ridge, personal communication). 
Harvesting costs account for about 40% of the production costs for switchgrass
and are sensitive to the amount harvested per acre.</P>
<P>
</P>
<P></P>
<H3>2.4  MODEL YIELDS--STAGE 3</H3>
<P> 	The Erosion Productivity Impact Calculator (EPIC) model developed by the
USDA Agricultural Research Service (ARS) is used to predict the yields
associated with the four conventional crops and switchgrass (<A
HREF="supplref.html#sharpley">Sharpley and Williams 1990</A>).  EPIC is a
simulation model of erosion, plant growth, and related soil and water processes.
 It has a daily time step and is designed to simulate agricultural crop growth
and soil responses to management practices on various soils under various
climatic conditions.  Because erosion impacts on crop productivity can develop
slowly, the model is designed to simulate up to hundreds of years of cropping
practices.</P>
<P>	The EPIC model was initially developed by ARS to assist in the 1985 status
report on the nation's soil and water resources as required under the Soil and
Water Resource Conservation Act.  Because the purpose of the model was to
address the wide variation in crop productivity and soil resources that exist in
the United States, the model was designed to be as mechanistic as possible. 
Inputs to the model include soil characteristics, daily weather data
(precipitation, maximum temperature, minimum temperature, solar radiation, and
wind speed), crop parameters (e.g., maximum leaf area index, maximum root depth,
and optimal nitrogen concentration in plant tissue), and management practices
(date of planting, date of harvest, date and amount of fertilizer application,
tillage practice, etc.).  The model considers only one crop at a time, although
crop rotations over time are allowed.  It also assumes uniform field conditions.
 The model can accept up to ten different soil horizons.</P>
<P>	The EPIC model has been widely used and adapted for many crops (<A
HREF="supplref.html#sharpley">Sharpley and Williams 1990</A>).  One of the
convenient features of the model is that it comes with related crop parameter,
weather, and soil data bases.  Thus the user does not need to develop all of the
input parameters.</P>
<P>	 Crop parameters developed for EPIC by ARS were used to model the four
dominant conventional crops.  The parameters used for switchgrass were adapted
from EPIC hay parameters by Burton English (UT Department of Agricultural
Economics, personal communication), working with ARS researchers.</P>
<P>	The EPIC model, used to simulate 30 years of continuous crop production,
uses weather data uniquely characteristic of each subregion, soils specific to
each subregion and each of the nine soil categories, and management practices
specific to each crop.  A total of 288 EPIC runs were simulated.  Average values
(over 30 years) were calculated for annual crop yield (dry tons, bushels, or
bales per acre per year).  For each of the conventional crops in each subregion,
the yields predicted by EPIC were adjusted by the actual average yield in the
subregion (as characterized in Stage 1) by applying the following formula:</P>
<P>
<IMG ALIGN="TOP" SRC="EQU.GIF">(2)<BR>   				     where<BR> 
<I>Y</I>i = adjusted crop yield for soil category <I>i</I>,<BR>
<I>E</I>i	= EPIC predicted yield for soil category <I>i</I>,<BR>
<I>P</I>i	= proportion of crop in the subregion planted on lands of soil
category<I> i</I>,<BR>
<I>Y</I>avg	= average yield of crop within the subregion.
</P>
<P>In this manner, the sensitivity of conventional-crop yields to soil quality
was predicted.</P>
<P>	The soil- and subregion-specific switchgrass yields projected by EPIC were
used without modification as estimates of switchgrass yield on former cropland. 
Estimates of switchgrass yield on former  pastureland were developed by
decreasing the projected cropland switchgrass yields by 10%.</P>
<P>	Because EPIC does not yet include a simulation module for any of the SRWC
species and little SRWC field data are available specific to the 276-county
region, expert opinion was used to derive expected yields for SRWC plantations.</P>
<P>
</P>
<P></P>
<H3>2.5  CALCULATE BREAK-EVEN PRICE FOR BIOMASS--STAGE 4</H3>
<P>
<B>2.5.1  Pastureland</B></P>
<P> 	For each soil category in each subregion, pasture rent values and energy
crop production costs determined in Stage 2 and the energy crop yields
determined in Stage 3 were used to calculate the break-even price for
energy-crop biomass produced on pastureland.  This break-even price was then
used as the farm-gate price for biomass grown on pastureland of that soil
category.</P>
<P>
<B>2.5.2  Cropland</B></P>
<P> 	Crop yields and production costs generated in Stages 2 and 3 were used to
develop break-even prices for biomass for each soil category in each subregion. 
Equation (1) and the market price of conventional crops were used to calculate
the prices.  The market price was calculated as the average of the years 1989,
1990, and 1991 and does not vary across the region or with soil category (corn =
$2.55/bu, wheat = $3.38/bu, soybeans = $6.53/bu, and cotton = $274.50 per bale).
 The break-even price associated with the most profitable of the three crops
(i.e., the highest break-even price) was used as the farm-gate price for
harvested energy crop biomass.  If conventional crop yields were such that Eq.
(1) predicted a negative land rent, a land rent value of zero was used to
calculate the farm-gate price.  This ensures that the farm-gate price is
sufficient to cover the production costs of the energy biomass.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<H3>2.6  CALCULATE REGIONAL COST AND SUPPLY OF BIOMASS--STAGE 5</H3>
<P> 	The farm-gate prices for harvested energy-crop biomass calculated in Stage
4 were merged with information from Stage 1 on the acreage of land in each
county (by land use and soil category) and information from Stage 3 on energy
crop yields to determine the county-specific potential supplies of biomass at
the farm-gate price specific to each soil/land use category.  This price and
supply information was then linked with locations, species, and  acreage
information to produce county-level maps of potential energy-crop biomass
supplies at various farm-gate prices and for various regional biomass supply
curves.</P>

<H2>POTENTIAL SUPPLY AND COST OF BIOMASS FROM ENERGY CROPS IN THE TVA REGION:
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION, CONCLUSIONS</H2>
<P></P>
<H3>3.1  YIELDS, PRODUCTION COSTS, AND FARM-GATE PRICES</H3>
<P> 	Information on the yields, production costs, and farm-gate prices for both
SRWC and switchgrass are presented in this section.  They are discussed in the
context of subregions and soil categories and from an agricultural rather than
an energy perspective.</P>
<P>	Some discussion of land rents is useful to this section because they
strongly influence the projected farm-gate prices for both SRWC wood and
switchgrass.  Land rents, as calculated on the basis of conventional crop
production and market prices, range from $0 to $182 per acre per year, with most
land rents below $100 per acre (<A HREF="table1.gif">Table 1</A>).  With few
exceptions, land rents are highest on the best cropland (category 1) or on
wetter soils (category 2w).  The North Alabama and Delta/Coastal Plain
subregions have low land rents on all soil categories, whereas the Northwest
subregion has notably higher land rents than the other subregions.  Every
subregion except the Northwest and Western Uplands subregions has at least one
common soil category with a land rent below $10 per acre per year.  These
projected low land rent soils figure prominently in the supply maps presented in
this section, and the validity of their valuation is worth discussing.</P>
<P>	Evidence exists to support the projected low land rents.  First, farmland
in the TVA region has recently been shifting to pasture use, suggesting that
conventional crops are not profitable on many soils.  Second, the lowest land
rents occur in subregions that have very little agricultural land, whereas the
highest land rents occur in a subregion that has considerable agricultural land.
 Third, a previous projection of SRWC prices in East Tennessee found that
inclusion of commodity payment programs increases the price of SRWC wood by $5
to $10 per (dry) ton (<A HREF="supplref.html#graham">Graham et al. 1992</A>),
suggesting that existing commodity programs typically contribute $20 to $40 to
land rent in East Tennessee.  The same study estimates the average agricultural
land rent to be around $60 per acre per year, with the inclusion of commodity
payments (English, B. C., The University of Tennessee, Knoxville, unpublished
data, June 1992).  To summarize, the projected land rents appear to be realistic
reflections of agricultural land values across the region.  However, although
the overall land rent patterns projected by the analysis are probably reliable,
the specific land rent for any one soil category in any one subregion should be
viewed with some skepticism.</P>
<P><B>3.1.1  SRWC</B></P>
<P> 	SRWC harvested yields are projected to range from 2.4 to 4.3 (dry) tons
per acre per year.  They vary by land use and soil category, but not by
subregion (<A HREF="table2.gif">Table 2</A>).  SRWC yields on former pasture
are assumed to be 80% of those on cropland of the same soil category and reflect
yield losses due to the compaction and lower fertilizer levels associated with
pastureland.  The lack of variability across subregions reflects the paucity of
SRWC field experience in this region; experts are reluctant to differentiate
yields by both subregions and soil categories.  SRWC experience in
better-defined regions of the United States, such as the midwest, suggests that
soil quality has significantly greater effects on SRWC yields than do subtle
shifts in climate.  Although specific SRWC yields used in the analysis do not
vary by subregion, the average SRWC yield of a subregion does vary because the
relative dominance of soil categories and land uses varies between subregions. 
Some subregions have more high-yielding land than others.</P>
<P>	Per-acre yield and per-ton production costs vary by land use and soil
category because SRWC management practices are soil and land-use specific (<A
HREF="table2.gif">Table 2</A>).  On former cropland, SRWC production costs
range from $29 to $46 per (dry) ton.  Production costs on pastureland range from
$44 to $63 per (dry) ton.  The production costs on pastureland are higher than
on cropland because of the additional site preparation associated with
converting pasture to SRWC plantation and because lower SRWC yields are expected
on former pastureland.  Sweetgum production costs (soil categories 2e and 2s)
are lower than those of other species because three rotations are assumed,
whereas two are assumed for poplar and sycamore and one for black locust.  Thus,
establishment costs are distributed over considerably more tons of harvested
wood for sweetgum than for the other species.</P>
<P>	The profitability of conventional crop options, and thus the projected land
rent, varies by subregion.  Thus, farm-gate prices for SRWC wood do vary by
subregion in addition to soil category and land use (<A HREF="table3.gif">Table
3</A>).  The lowest-cost SRWC biomass [$29 per (dry) ton] is associated with
soil category 2e in the Nashville, North Alabama, and Delta/Coastal Plain
subregions and soil category 2s in the Western Uplands subregion.  The North
Alabama and Delta/Coastal subregions have the lowest overall farm-gate prices
for SRWC biomass, and the Northwest subregion has the highest.  Increasing SRWC
yields by 25% decreases farm-gate prices by 20%.</P>
<P><B>3.1.2  Switchgrass</B></P>
<P> 	Because projected switchgrass yields are derived by means of the EPIC crop
simulation model, which includes weather variables specific to each subregion,
they vary by subregion as well as soil category and land use (<A
HREF="table4.gif">Table 4</A>).  Projected switchgrass yields are highest on
soil categories 1 and 2w across all subregions, ranging from 5.8 to 8.8 tons per
acre per year.  The majority of the yields on other soil categories range from
5.5 to 6.0 (dry) tons per acre per year.  However, yields as low as 4.3 (dry)
tons per acre per year are projected for a few soil categories.  The subregions
do not display identical patterns of high and low yields.  Half of the
subregions have one or two soil categories that have significantly higher yields
than their other soil categories, and half of the subregions have one or two
soil categories that produce significantly lower yields than their other soil
categories.  Specifically, the Nashville, Plateau, Smokies, and Western Uplands
subregions have higher yields on categories 1 or 2w, whereas the Northwest,
Nashville, Plateau, Ridge and Valley, and North Alabama subregions have
relatively low yields on category 4e and/or category 5+.</P>
<P>	Although the per-acre production costs of switchgrass vary only by land use
($188 per acre per year for cropland and $250 per acre for pastureland), per-ton
costs vary by soil category and subregion because of variations in yield (<A
HREF="table5.gif">Table 5</A>).  Switchgrass production costs range from $28
per (dry) ton to $64 per (dry) ton and are higher for pastureland than for
cropland of the same soil category.</P>
<P>	As with SRWC, switchgrass farm-gate prices vary by soil category, land use,
and subregion (<A HREF="table6.gif">Table 6</A>).  Except for soil category 1
in the Northwest, Nashville, Smokies, and Plateau subregions, pasture farm-gate
prices are higher than cropland farm-gate prices for the same soil categories. 
This is because the higher per-ton production costs on pastureland are not
sufficiently outweighed by lower land rents.  Cropland farm-gate prices are
lowest in the Delta/Coastal Plain [$29 to $37 per (dry) ton] and Ridge and
Valley subregions [$34 to $47 per (dry) ton] because the projected land rents
are low and switchgrass yields are moderate.  The farm-gate prices for cropland
in the North Alabama subregion are also low [$32 to $45 per (dry) ton] primarily
because of high switchgrass yields compared with low land rents.  Although the
Smokies and Western Uplands subregions have a few soil categories with low
farm-gate prices, most of their soil categories have fairly high farm-gate
prices [$47 to $52 per (dry) ton].  The Northwest, Nashville, and Plateau
subregions generally have very high farm-gate prices as well as relatively high
switchgrass yields.</P>
<P>	As with SRWC, increasing switchgrass yields by 25% decreases farm-gate
prices by nearly 20%.  Consequently, the least-cost switchgrass supplies cost
$21 to $24 per (dry) ton vs $26 to $29 per (dry) ton if yields are increased by
25%.</P>
<P></P>
<P></P>
<H3><B>3.2  REGIONAL SUPPLY PATTERNS</B></H3>
<P> 	In considering the potential for biomass energy in the TVA region from a
power production standpoint, it is useful to characterize the potential supply
of biomass in terms of its energy content rather than its mass.  Characterizing
price and supply in terms of energy content facilitates comparisons among
qualitatively different supplies such as coal, wood, and grass.  For this
analysis, it is assumed that SRWC wood has an energy content of 17 MBtu per
(dry) ton (<A HREF="supplref.html#wright92b">Wright et al. 1992b</A>) and that
switchgrass has an energy content of 13 MBtu per (dry) ton [<A
HREF="supplref.html#ota">Office of Technology Assessment (OTA) 1980</A>]. 
Figures 4 and  5 show the projected potential county supplies of SRWC wood or
switchgrass from agricultural land at three farm-gate prices--&lt;$2.00/MBtu, &lt;$2.50/MBtu,
and &lt;$3.00/MBtu.</P>
<P>	It is important to recognize the influence of subregion boundaries (<A
HREF="fig3.gif">Fig. 3</A>) and county land use (<A HREF="fig1.gif">Fig. 1</A>)
on these patterns when interpreting the supply-cost patterns evident in these
maps.  Subregion boundaries strongly influence projected farm-gate prices across
the entire region through their influence on determinants of land rent value of
different soil categories.  The specific conventional crops grown, their
production costs, and their expected soil-specific yields are unique to each
subregion.  The conventional crop yields on specific soil categories are
particular to each subregion because subregion-specific information is an input
in the crop simulation program (EPIC) used to project these yields.  This
information includes management activities, soil names representing soil
categories, and climate.  In the case of switchgrass, subregion boundaries also
influence farm-gate prices through their influence on switchgrass yield. 
However, subregion boundaries do not affect all determinants of farm-gate price.
 Certain elements, such as SRWC yields on different soil categories, per-acre
production costs for either SRWC or switchgrass, and crop market prices, are
uniform across the region.</P>
<P>	The subregion boundaries also affect the potential amount of feedstock
supply but to a lesser extent, especially for wood feedstock.  Boundaries affect
supply amount not only because they directly affect switchgrass yield but also
because they are used to define the proportions of county cropland and
pastureland acreage associated with each soil category.  These proportions
affect biomass supply because different biomass yields are expected on the nine
soil categories.</P>
<P>	The potential amount of biomass feedstock is most affected by the acreage
of cropland and pastureland potentially available for growing biomass.  Those
values are, however, defined by county rather than subregion (<A HREF="fig1.gif">Fig.
1</A>).  Thus, although the proportion of cropland or pastureland acreage in a
particular soil category is uniform for all counties in that subregion, the
actual acreage of that soil category is unique to a county as are the total
cropland and pastureland acreages.  Therefore, because the farm-gate price is
unique to a soil category, the potential feedstock supply at a particular
farm-gate price is unique to a county.</P>
<P><B>3.2.1  Projected SRWC Supplies at Current Biomass Yield Level</B></P>
<P> 	Assuming current technology and a farm-gate price of less than $2.00/MBtu
[$34 per harvested (dry) ton @ 17 MBtu per (dry) ton] the potential supplies of
SRWC wood are greatest in the North Alabama subregion, far-western portions of
the Delta/Coastal Plan subregion, and the eastern portion of the Nashville
subregion (<A HREF="fig4.gif">Fig. 4</A>).  This level of production in these
counties is a consequence of subregion soil categories with low farm-gate prices
and relatively high densities of agricultural land.  The Ridge and Valley
subregion also has a low-cost soil category; however, this does not influence
the regional supply pattern because none of the counties of this subregion have
much agricultural land.</P>
<P>	At $2.50/MBtu (<A HREF="fig4.gif">Fig. 4</A>), the Western Uplands
subregion is also projected to provide substantial SRWC wood supplies because of
the availability of plentiful 2e soils with a farm-gate price of $2.28/MBtu. 
The Smokies subregion also has 2e land with a farm-gate price under $2.50/MBtu,
but sparseness of agricultural land in that subregion results in small projected
potential supply per county.</P>
<P>	At $3.00/MBtu (<A HREF="fig4.gif">Fig. 4</A>), all counties are projected
to have some potential for supplying SRWC wood, but the potential supply is
greatest in the western and southwestern counties of the region where
agriculture is the dominant land use.  The far-western counties in the
Delta/Coastal Plain subregion are projected to be able to supply millions of
tons of SRWC wood.  Although the counties of the Northwest subregion are also
dominated by agriculture, many of the subregion's soil categories have projected
farm-gate prices exceeding $3.00/MBtu because conventional crops have high
yields in that subregion.</P>
<P><B>3.2.2  Projected Switchgrass Supplies at Current Biomass Yield Level</B></P>
<P></P>
<P>	Assuming current technology and a farm-gate price of less than $2.00/MBtu
[$26 per (dry) ton<A HREF="supplref.html#f3"><I>[3]</I></A>), switchgrass
production is not projected for any county (<A HREF="fig5.gif">Fig. 5</A>).  At
$2.50/MBtu, potential switchgrass production was mainly relegated to those
counties in which land with low returns from conventional crops (low land rent)
can produce moderate to high yields of switchgrass (<A HREF="fig5.gif">Fig. 5</A>).
 The potential supplies of switchgrass in counties in the Northwest and Smokies
subregions are due to a single uncommon soil category (4e in the Northwest
subregion and 3-4s in the Smokies subregion) with a low projected land rent and
moderate switchgrass yield.  Potential supplies are projected to be fairly
abundant in the Delta/Coastal Plain subregion because all the cropland soil
categories except for the wet-soil categories 2w and 3-4w have farm-gate prices
under $2.50/MBtu, largely because of very low land rents in this subregion.  The
wet-soil categories have higher land rents and consequently higher farm-gate
prices for biomass.  The higher supply in the western counties of Delta/Coastal
Plain subregion reflects the greater abundance of agricultural land in that
portion of the subregion.  Unlike the subregions with potential switchgrass
supplies caused by low land rents, the Western Uplands subregion has a fairly
high supply because one of its common soil categories has a very high
switchgrass yield [8.5 (dry) tons per acre], which creates a low farm-gate
price, even though the net returns for conventional crops on that soil are
moderate to high (about $80 per acre).  Four subregions (Nashville, Plateau,
Ridge and Valley, and North Alabama) show no supply at a farm-gate price of
$2.50/MBtu or less because switchgrass yields are low on the soil categories
with projected low land rent.</P>
<P>	At $3.00/MBtu (<A HREF="fig5.gif">Fig. 5</A>), all counties in all
subregions can potentially supply some switchgrass.  Most of the counties in the
Delta/Coastal Plain and Western Uplands subregions are capable of supplying
large quantities of switchgrass, especially in the far western counties of
Missouri, Arkansas, and Tennessee.  At this farm-gate price, the Ridge and
Valley subregion becomes a much more significant potential source of switchgrass
feedstock because  of its abundance of land with moderate switchgrass yields,
low land rents, and farm-gate prices between $2.50/MBtu and $3.00/MBtu.  In
contrast, raising the farm-gate price from $2.50/MBtu to $3.00/MBtu does not
increase potential switchgrass supplies in the Smokies subregion because of
relatively low amounts of agricultural land in that subregion, much of which is
pastureland with high switchgrass production costs.  The lack of switchgrass
supply in the Nashville subregion is due to very low switchgrass yields
projected for most of the soil categories.</P>
<P><B>3.2.3  Projected SRWC and Switchgrass Supplies at a 25% Higher Yield
Level</B></P>
<P> 	A 25% increase in biomass yields, as might be expected with future
production technology, decreases farm-gate price by nearly 20%.<A
HREF="supplref.html#f4"><I>[4]</I></A>  Consequently, the spatial patterns of
SRWC and switchgrass biomass supplies at $2.00/MBtu at the 25% higher yields are
very similar to the spatial patterns of biomass at $2.50/MBtu at the original
yields (Figs.<A HREF="fig6.gif"> 6 </A>and
<A HREF="fig7.gif">7</A>).  At $2.50/MBtu or $3.00/MBtu and a 25% increase in
yields, the spatial patterns in supply observed at the original yields (Figs.<A
HREF="fig4.gif"> 4 </A>and<A HREF="fig5.gif"> 5</A>) are simply strengthened.</P>
<P></P>
<P></P>
<H3><B>3.3 PROJECTED REGIONAL SUPPLY CURVES</B></H3>
<P> 	Figures<A HREF="fig8.gif"> 8 </A>and<A HREF="fig9.gif"> 9</A> portray
the TVA regional supply curves for SRWC and switchgrass grown on agricultural
land in the TVA region.  Each point on the curves depicts the cost per MBtu to
supply different levels of energy (million MBtus) in the form of wood (in the
case of SRWC) or grass (in the case of switchgrass).  The curves, like the
analysis, do not take into account any effect that changing land use (by growing
energy crops) might have on land rents across the region.  These curves are
useful in projecting the total potential supply of energy from biomass crops
across the entire region.</P>
<P>	Assuming all determinants of supply (e.g., market price, land rent, and
production costs) are held constant and that all crop and pasture acreage in the
region can be converted to SRWC or switchgrass, the agricultural crop and
pastureland in the TVA region can produce 1.26 &#215; 10<I>(9)</I> MBtu of SRWC
wood or 2.08 &#215; 10<I>(9)</I> MBtu of switchgrass.  Increasing energy crop
yields per acre by 25% increases total potential by supply 25% and lowers the
price of the supply by nearly 20%.  Figures<A HREF="fig10.gif"> 10</A> and<A
HREF="fig11.gif"> 11</A> show the same supply curves in $/(dry) ton and
millions of (dry) tons of biomass.</P>
<P></P>
<H2><B>4.  CONCLUSIONS</B></H2>
<P></P>
<P> 	Agricultural land in the TVA region can potentially support 18 GW if wood
is the sole fuel and 30 GW if switchgrass is the sole fuel.  (This projection
assumes an efficiency of 10,000 Btu of biomass per kilowatt hour, an efficiency
achievable with existing technology.)  Farm-gate prices in the range of $40 to
$50 per ton for wood or $35 to $45 per ton for switchgrass are needed to ensure
landowners of profits commensurate with current land use.  Although switchgrass
farm-gate prices are lower than those of SRWC, switchgrass is a slightly more
expensive fuel because of its lower energy content.</P>
<P>	From a regional perspective, energy crop supplies are projected to be
greatest in the western portion of the region, largely because of the high
density of agricultural land combined with low land rents.  However, there are
clusters of counties elsewhere that can produce supplies sufficient to support
production of 100 or 200 MW of power.</P>
<P>	This is a regional analysis of potential biomass supplies.  Caution is
required when interpreting the study results at the county scale because of the
aggregation and generalization used in the analysis.  In particular, the
definition of subregion boundaries play a critical role in determining the
spatial pattern of biomass supplies.  For energy crop demonstration or
individual plant site studies, the approach developed in this regional analysis
can be used if finer and more localized data on soils, land use, and crops were
used.</P>

<TITLE>Short-Rotation Eucalypt Plantations In Brazil: Introduction</TITLE></HEAD>
<BODY

<H2>Introduction</H2>
<P>Exactly where and when the first eucalypt tree was planted in Brazil is very
difficult to determine.  The event has been reported to have occurred in 1824 at
the Botanical Garden of Rio de Janeiro and to have been carried out by the
Garden's director, Frei Leandro do Sacramento (<A HREF="eucaly6.html#sampaio75">Sampaio
1975</A>).  However, no one will deny that it was Edmundo Navarro de Andrade
who, in 1904, started the first truly scientific work around introducing <I>Eucalyptus</I>
in Brazil.  His work included the establishment of the first commercial
plantations of that genus in the country.  After earning his diploma as an
agronomist in Coimbra, Portugal, Andrade brought some seeds of <I>Eucalyptus
globulus</I> to Jundia&iacute;, S&atilde;o Paulo.  He planted these along with
some other exotic and native tree species.  At that time, Andrade was working
for the Paulista Railroad Company to provide firewood for the company's
steam-powered engines and sleepers.  In a few years the eucalypt test plots
outgrew all the other tree species being tested, encouraging Andrade to import
seeds of various species of this genus to be tested in S&atilde;o Paulo.  As a
result of his efforts, a total of 217 species of <I>Eucalyptus</I> were
introduced in Brazil (<A HREF="eucaly6.html#spinelli93">Spinelli 1993</A>).</P>
<P>From 1909 to 1965, about 470 thousand hectares of <I>Eucalyptus</I> were
planted in Brazil by government and by privately-owned companies.  Eighty
percent of these plantations were in the state of S&atilde;o Paulo.  The
eucalypts were introduced in Brazil to substitute for native forests in
providing firewood for the railroad companies.  Because extensive cutting of
native forests for firewood, forests were receding further and further from
consumption centers.  Other energy sources, such as coal, were not available in
Brazil, and the cost of importing them was high.  In 1948, Cia Belgo-Mineira in
Minas Gerais established the first eucalypt plantations to provide wood for
charcoal production to be used by the charcoal-based iron and steel-making
industry (<A HREF="eucaly6.html#magalhaes93">Magah&atilde;es 1993</A>).  Until
1965 there was no major concern about the negative effects these eucalypt
plantations might have on the environment.</P>
<P>Environmental groups are now exerting considerable pressure to make it
unfavorable for the establishment of eucalypt plantations in Brazil.  These
groups have affected certain decisions the forest companies have made concerning
the effects of their activities on the environment (<A
HREF="eucaly6.html#lima93">Lima 1993</A>).  The concept of production forestry
has given way to that of sustainable forestry, in which the multiple uses of
water, air quality, erosion control, wildlife, recreation and landscape are
considered as valuable as timber production (<A HREF="eucaly6.html#coufal89">Coufal
1989</A>).  Integrated forest management takes into account the relationships
between the various components of the forest ecosystem so that management
practices minimize the environmental impacts of the plantations (<A
HREF="eucaly6.html#duerr90">Duerr 1990</A>).  Aspects deserving attention are
(1) the hydrologic and ecological processes; (2) the capacity of the soil to
produce on a sustainable basis; (3) the biodiversity of the area; and (4) the
sustainability and preservation of species, habitats, and the genetic pool. 
This paper presents an overview of the social and environmental aspects related
to the establishment of large-scale eucalypt plantations in Brazil.</P>

<H2> 2.  ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES</H2>
<P>In the 1960s, little if anything was known about the silvicultural and
ecological needs of the introduced eucalypt species in Brazil.  Eucalypts were
established across the country in varying soil and climatic conditions. 
Availability of land and low land prices stimulated most of the reforestation
projects at that time.  Ecological zoning or use of certified seeds of the
correct provenance to ensure the success of the plantations was not considered. 
Because <I>Eucalyptus grandis</I> was the most popular and fastest-growing
species at that time, it was used indiscriminately by most of the companies. 
Consequently, survival was very low for some plantations, some of which were
located in regions having very low annual rainfall, a key factor for growth.</P>
<P>In the 1970s, criticism concerning the alleged harmful effects of the
eucalypts on the environment grew.  By that time, large plantations (encouraged
by the fiscal incentives for reforestation) were wide-spread in S&atilde;o
Paulo, Minas Gerais, Esp&iacute;rito Santo, Bahia, Mato Grosso do Sul, and Rio
Grande do Sul as well as in other Brazilian states.  Eucalypts were said to
adversely affect the soil, the water cycle, wildlife, biodiversity, and local
vegetation.  These concerns were being expressed in India, Portugal, Spain, and
the United States where <I>Eucalyptus</I> also had been introduced. </P>
<P>No provenance tests had been established in Brazil, thus a species would
grow well in one place and very poorly elsewhere.  Productivity in some places
ranged from 6 to 12  m3 of wood per hectare per year and other regions, from 25
to 30 m3 of wood per hectare per year.  Coppicing was not responding as
expected, and even when successful, second-rotation yields were lower than
first-rotation yields.  Often, yields would decrease 20 to 40% from one rotation
to another.  In the early years, very intensive insect and fungal attacks also
occurred, mainly on the <I>Eucalyptus grandis</I> plantations.  No adequate
site-preparation technologies were used.  In most areas, fire was used to help
eliminate the existing vegetation, and soil preparation was similar to the
system used for agricultural crops that sometimes led to erosion and silting of
streams.  No attention was given to any physical or chemical impediment in the
soil layers that could jeopardize the growth of the newly established eucalypt
plantations.  No adequate fertilization formulas or methods of application were
available, and correct spacings and rotation lengths were unknown at that time.
</P>
<P>In the late 1970s, this situation changed drastically as a result of
ecological zoning for reforestation with eucalypts and pines done by Lamberto
Golfari, an expert from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United
Nations (FAO).  He established a network of species and provenance trials
throughout the country with the help of the Brazilian Enterprise for
Agricultural Research (EMBRAPA).  He used Thorntwaite's water balance to compare
eucalypt species and provenances in the various regions in Brazil.  Currently,
Golfari's ecological zoning for reforestation with eucalypts is being improved
and refined by EMBRAPA in the South and by the Department of Forestry of the
Federal University of Vi&ccedil;osa in the Southeast.  This new technology is
incorporating climatic
<A HREF="eucaly6.html#martins92">(Martins et al. 1992</A>), ecological and
edaphic (<A HREF="eucaly6.html#tristao92">Trist&atilde;o 1992</A>) variables
into the ecological zoning by means of multivariate analysis technique (<A
HREF="eucaly6.html#reis93">Reis and Reis 1993</A>).</P>
<P>With ecological zoning and the introduction of new species and provenances
tested by EMBRAPA and the forest companies (combined to better silvicultural and
management practices), productivity levels of the eucalypt plantations during
the 1980s improved substantially.  The average growth of the plantations
increased 18 to 22  m3 per hectare per year, with some hybrids and clones
producing almost twice that.  Today, the average productivity is around 35 m3
per hectare per year, but in some places plantations can grow at the incredible
rate of 90 to 100 m3 per hectare per year (<A HREF="eucaly6.html#reis93">Reis
and Reis 1993</A>).</P>
<P>Current knowledge allows much more environmentally responsible establishment
of eucalypt plantations, such as those recently established in the south of
Bahia and northern Esp&iacute;rito Santo.  At the same time, environmental and
forestry legislation is limiting the options that companies have for plantation
establishment, forcing the companies to associate with universities and research
institutions in searching for new techniques by which to establish eucalypt
plantations.</P>
<H3>2.1  CLIMATE</H3>
<P>One criticism of eucalypt plantations is that they can promote a change in
the local climate.  This is because of the very high evapotranspiration rate of
eucalypts, which drains water from the soil leading to a lower water table. 
This high evapotranspiration rate is claimed to adversely affect local rainfall
levels, resulting in possible desertification of the area.  Others point out
that the contribution of the continental water evaporation to the hydrologic
cycle is known to be very small compared with that of the oceans (<A
HREF="eucaly6.html#lee80">Lee 1980</A>).  Further, the mere presence of a
forest in a certain area does not necessarily affect the occurrence of rainfall
in that area (<A HREF="eucaly6.html#penman63">Penman 1963</A>).  The subject
merits more study.</P>
<P>In some regions, such as the Amazon basin, the forest can influence local
precipitation.  The canopy can affect the air-circulation pattern that flows
from the Atlantic Ocean into the basin (<A HREF="eucaly6.html#shuttleworth88">Shuttleworth
1988</A>).  There are also situations in which the forests are located in hilly
regions along the coast and are subjected to a constant fog, which condenses on
the canopy and falls to the forest soil adding to the rainfall level (<A
HREF="eucaly6.html#lima93">Lima 1993</A>).  This effect also has been observed
in some native eucalypt forests of Australia (<A HREF="eucaly6.html#costin61">Costin
and Winbush 1961</A>).  This could indicate that Brazil's eucalypt plantations
may have the same effects on the climate as a native forest located in the same
region.  Thus, the effect of planting a large area with eucalypts is likely to
be the same as if other vegetation of similar structure and albedo were planted.
 In summary, certain research studies have shown that differences in the
microclimate within eucalypt plantations may exist compared with those of other
species and native forests, but the data are not conclusive (<A
HREF="eucaly6.html#poore85">Poore and Fries 1985</A>).  </P>
<H3>2.2  WATER</H3>
<H3>2.2.1  Canopy Interception</H3>
<P>One of the primary concerns about eucalypt plantations is that they lead to
a diminished rainfall in their area of influence.  The most significant
hydrologic effect of a eucalypt plantation, as well as any other tree
plantations or forest cover, is its interception of rainfall.  A portion of this
rainfall reaches the ground, while some remains in the canopy and is lost by
direct evaporation (<A HREF="eucaly6.html#lima93">Lima 1993</A>).  When
comparisons are made between forests and open areas, such as pastures and native
grasslands, a higher evaporation rate can occur in the forest cover, thus
diminishing the water supply of the watershed (<A HREF="eucaly6.html#calder85">Calder
1985</A>). 
</P>
<P>The total loss of water by canopy interception is equal to the sum of the
evaporation that occurs during the rainfall and the evaporation that occurs
after the rainfall from the water retained in the canopy.  Because precipitation
is likely to be heavy in the tropical regions and occur over a very short time
period, losses during rainfall are smaller than losses after.  The capacity of a
forest canopy to store or hold water can be measured by using a leaf area index.
 The typical leaf area indexes of some eucalypt species are smaller than those
of other forest species, which suggests that the total interception by eucalypts
may be comparatively low (<A HREF="eucaly6.html#gash79">Gash 1979</A>). </P>
<P>A study in S&atilde;o Paulo indicated that a 6-year-old <I>Eucalyptus
saligna</I> plantation lost 12.2% of rainfall water by canopy interception.  Two
13-year-old pine plantations (<I>Pinus caribaea</I> and <I>P. oocarpa</I>)
have shown losses of 12% (<A HREF="eucaly6.html#lima76">Lima 1976</A>), and
savanna-like vegetation showed a loss of 27% (<A HREF="eucaly6.html#lima83">Lima
and Nicolielo 1983</A>).  Secondary Atlantic forests varied from 12.4% (<A
HREF="eucaly6.html#castro83">Castro et al. 1983</A>) to 18.2% (<A
HREF="eucaly6.html#cicco86">Cicco et al. 1986</A>), and the range in Amazonian
rain forest was 8.9% (<A HREF="eucaly6.html#lloyd88">Lloyd et al. 1988</A>) to
19.8% (<A HREF="eucaly6.html#franken82">Franken et al. 1982</A>).  Given the
number of existing eucalypt species and the diversity of species existing in the
tropical forests, it is premature to draw any final conclusions about the loss
of rainfall resulting from canopy interception by forests in the tropics.  This
subject merits more attention from researchers (<A
HREF="eucaly6.html#shuttleworth88">Shuttleworth 1988</A>).  However, a review
of the work and data available in Brazil as well as other parts of the world
suggests that, on the average, the water interception loss by eucalypt
plantations is less than that of other tree plantations or native forests (<A
HREF="eucaly6.html#lima93">Lima 1993</A>).
</P>
<P><B>2.2.2  Runoff</B></P>
<P>It has been demonstrated that watersheds covered by natural forests of
eucalypts in Australia produce good quality water (<A
HREF="eucaly6.html#hatch76">Hatch 1976</A>).  Charley and Richards (<A
HREF="eucaly6.html#charley83">1983</A>) showed that the most positive effect of
forest cover on watershed water quality occurs during rapid tree growth.  This
correlation may suggest that eucalypt plantations in Brazil may have a
beneficial effect on the water quality by virtue of their very fast growth rate
and short rotation.</P>
<P>Although some variation exists in the influence of various eucalypt species,
native forests, and other tree species on water quality, studies have shown that
watershed water quality depends more on the geology, soil, and precipitation
regime of the region (<A HREF="eucaly6.html#lima93">Lima 1993</A>).  In the
valley of Para&iacute;ba river in S&atilde;o Paulo, a study conducted in two
small watersheds covered by <I>Eucalyptus saligna</I> showed that the nutrient
balance and quality of the water was not unlike that found in similar studies in
other parts of the world (<A HREF="eucaly6.html#ranzini90">Ranzini  1990</A>).</P>
<P>The substitution of the forest cover by pastures and agricultural crops will
normally promote a change in the water quality and water balance.  The water
often becomes saltier because of the concentration of minerals.  However,
afforestation of the area probably will restore the initial condition over time
(<A HREF="eucaly6.html#borg88">Borg et al. 1988</A>).  Therefore, it is
possible to conclude that establishing forest plantations can be a positive
factor in watershed management.  However, care must be taken because inadequate
site preparation, clearcutting, fertilization, and slash burning can have
negative effects on water quality (<A HREF="eucaly6.html#lima93">Lima 1993</A>).</P>
<P><B>2.2.3  Uptake</B></P>
<P>Perhaps the most controversial water-related issue relating to eucalypt
plantations is the effect on the water content of the soil.  It is claimed that
eucalypt trees absorb more water from the soil than any other tree species.  The
uptake of soil water depends mainly on the architecture of root systems and the
depth of root penetration (<A HREF="eucaly6.html#lima93">Lima 1993</A>).  The
capacities of the more than 600 eucalypt species for water uptake vary depending
on the type of root system; some have superficial root systems and others have
deeper systems (<A HREF="eucaly6.html#jacobs55">Jacobs  1955</A>).  As in most
natural forests and forest plantations, the roots of most eucalypt plantations
are concentrated in the superficial layers of the soil (<A
HREF="eucaly6.html#reis85">Reis et al. 1985</A>).  However, some eucalypt roots
can grow to 30 m in depth (<A HREF="eucaly6.html#jacobs55">Jacobs 1955</A>) and
extract water from 6 to 15 m deep (<A HREF="eucaly6.html#peck87">Peck and
Williamson 1987</A>).</P>
<P>The growth of the eucalypt root system depends on the environmental factors,
mainly soil compaction (<A HREF="eucaly6.html#nambiar81">Nambiar 1981</A>). 
This has been verified for <I>E. urophylla, E. pellita, E. camaldulensis, E.
grandis, E. cloeziana</I> and <I>E. citriodora</I> in the state of Bahia (<A
HREF="eucaly6.html#krejci86">Krejci et al. 1986</A>).  Of these, only <I>E.
citriodora</I> and <I>E. pellita</I> were able to develop fine enough roots to
penetrate a compacted layer of soil in the research area. </P>
<P>A study carried out in Minas Gerais compared soil moisture in a 5-year-old
<I>E. grandis</I> plantation, a 5-year-old <I>P. caribaea</I> plantation, and
a savanna-like native forest.  A similar pattern of annual variation in soil
water was found for the three forest covers.  However, in terms of timber
production, the eucalypts used water more efficiently than did the natural
vegetation (<A HREF="eucaly6.html#lima90">Lima et al. 1990</A>).</P>
<P>Eucalypts seem to behave as any other tree plantation or natural forest
cover with respect to the  soil water dynamics and with respect to the water
balance of the watersheds.  As with most timber harvesting, soil water increases
during cuttings and decreases after afforestation is complete.  Thus, eucalypt
plantations (as any other managed vegetation) can have both positive and
negative effects on the water quality and quantity.  Whether the sum of these
effects is positive depends largely on management practices.</P>

<H3>2.3  SOIL</H3>
<P><B>2.3.1  Litter Effects</B></P>
<P> The effects of eucalypts on the soil have been studied in several countries
over many years.  Most of the concerns related to soil effects deal with
depletion of nutrients and allelopathy caused by the litter, which is said to
exert an antibiotic effect on soil microorganisms.  This concern was verified by
research that showed a very low concentration of nitrifying bacteria in eucalypt
plantations litter (<A HREF="eucaly6.html#florenzano56">Florenzano 1956</A>). 
However, many of the litter problems can be alleviated by alternating rotation
or mixing species and clones to promote decomposition.  An extensive literature
review demonstrated that afforestation with eucalypts improved soil fertility in
the long term in several areas of the world (<A HREF="eucaly6.html#philliphis56">Philliphis
1956</A>, <A HREF="eucaly6.html#ricardo85">Ricardo and Madeira 1985</A>,
<A HREF="eucaly6.html#karshon61">Karshon 1961</A>).  However, long-term
sustainability and site fertility still needs to be a key concern in any
plantation scheme.</P>
<P>In the state of Minas Gerais a comprehensive study was undertaken to analyze
the effects of the short-rotation eucalypt plantations on soil properties in 8-
to 10-year-old <I>Eucalyptus grandis</I> stands established on lateritic and
sandy soils.  Samples of soils were collected at varying depths of up to 0.60 m
on eucalypt plantations as well as on a nearby savanna-like stand.  Chemical,
physical, and biological analyses of the soil samples showed no statistically
significant differences between eucalypt and savanna soils.  Further, in an
experiment in which eucalypts soils were used in a greenhouse to grow beans no
allelopathic effects were detected (<A HREF="eucaly6.html#cetec84">CETEC 1984</A>).</P>
<P>Identical work was carried out in Minas Gerais on 25-year-old <I>Eucalyptus
citriodora</I> and <I>E. paniculata</I> plantations.  The chemical, physical,
and biological soil analyses of these plantations were compared with those of
nearby native forests and pastures.  The eucalypt soils contained 27 tons of
litter per hectare compared to only 12 tons produced by the native forest and
had more microorganisms and nutrients (<A HREF="eucaly6.html#fouseca84">Fouseca
1984</A>).</P>
<P>
<B>2.3.2  Reclamation</B></P>
<P>Afforestation has been recognized as one of the most effective means to
reclaim marginal, eroded, or mined land (<A HREF="eucaly6.html#vangoor85">Van
Goor 1985</A>).  A plantation of a single species can have a positive effect on
soil if it is established on land having no cover or having been impoverished by
misuse.  However, the high growth rates and short rotations of most of the
commercial eucalypt plantations result in a very high nutrient uptake from the
soil.  In fact, nutrient use for an intensively managed eucalypt plantation can
be comparable to that of an agricultural crop (<A HREF="eucaly6.html#miller89">Miller
1989</A>).  However, agricultural crops normally require more total nutrients
than do the short-rotation intensive culture eucalypt plantations (<A
HREF="eucaly6.html#lima93">Lima 1993</A>).</P>
<P>
<B>2.3.3  Protection</B></P>
<P>Eucalypt plantations are also sometimes accused of not providing adequate
soil protection.  This lack of protection can lead to less water infiltration
and greater runoff, resulting in soil erosion and watershed sedimentation.  This
was probably true in the 1970s when site preparation for establishment of the
eucalypt plantations was similar to that for agricultural crops.  Vegetation was
burned, and the soil was plowed and harrowed.  This resulted in exposure of the
soil to rainfall for at least the first 6 months, before seedling crowns had
grown sufficiently to cover the soil.  Today silvicultural practices have
essentially eliminated the use of fire, as well as plowing and harrowing of the
entire area, for site preparation.  These practices have been replaced by soil
preparation in strips or by 3-m-spaced furrows in which seedlings are planted
every 2 to 3 m (<A HREF="eucaly6.html#lima90">Lima 1990</A>).  Properly managed
eucalypt plantations can provide soil protection.  As always, sensitive sites
need to be treated carefully to avoid adverse effects on soils.</P>
<H3>2.4  BIODIVERSITY</H3>
<P>In a native forest ecosystem a balance exists among the main components of
the system and among the energy flows of the food webs.  One of the most
important factors in the stability of the system is its biodiversity (<A
HREF="eucaly6.html#evans92">Evans 1992</A>).  Plantations are specialized but
generally simplified ecosystems.  Establishment of monoculture short-rotation
eucalypt plantations has been criticized as detrimental to the environment
because of its negative effect on biodiversity (i.e., reduction in the number of
plant and animal species).   However, these effects can be minimized by adequate
management of both the plantations and the remaining native forests and
vegetation (<A HREF="eucaly6.html#berndt92">Berndt 1992</A>).</P>
<P>
<B>2.4.1  Fauna</B></P>
<P>One of the criticisms of eucalypts in Brazil is, being an exotic species, it
does not provide shelter and food for the native fauna.  This is probably true
not only for eucalypt plantations but any monoculture, be it an exotic or
native.  Compared with multispecies plantations,  single-species forest
plantations may reduce the availability of diverse food and shelter for the
local wildlife (<A HREF="eucaly6.html#evans92">Evans 1992</A>).  Besides these
direct effects, forest plantations may create indirect effects that promote
modifications in food webs in other areas of the region that can lead to the
disappearance of some faunal species (<A HREF="eucaly6.html#avery89">Avery 1989</A>).
 However, it has been noted that faunal species will adapt to the new conditions
generated by a forest plantation whether eucalypts or native species (<A
HREF="eucaly6.html#rochelle79">Rochelle and Brunnel 1979</A>).  Thus, the
existence of eucalypt plantations per se are not necessarily detrimental to
wildlife (<A HREF="eucaly6.html#lima93">Lima 1993</A>).  The controversy
dealing with the impact of plantations on fauna is fed by conflicting research
results.  For example, in Vi&ccedil;osa, Minas Gerais, a study was conducted to
determine the number of small mammals in four different types of forest.  While
some mammal species were found in a 10-year-old <I>Eucalyptus saligna</I>
plantation, a much larger number was found in a 31-year old <I>Araucaria
angustifolia</I> stand and in 15- and 52-year-old mixed natural forests (<A
HREF="eucaly6.html#dietz75">Dietz et al. 1975</A>).  On the other hand, in
Aracruz, Esp&iacute;rito Santo, a survey comparing bird populations in a
9-year-old <I>E. citriodora</I> (having a relatively well-developed understory)
and an adjacent natural forest found 50 birds (28 species) in the eucalypts, 17
birds (10 species) in the native forest, and 22 birds (11 species) in the border
between the two (<A HREF="eucaly6.html#almeida82">Almeida and Laranjeiro 1982</A>).
</P>
<P>Avoiding or diminishing silvicultural treatments after stand establishment
allows birds to occupy the area in search of food.  This bird population
consists mainly of species that feed on insects (<A
HREF="eucaly6.html#almeida81">Almeida 1981</A>).  As a consequence, there is a
direct benefit to these birds as well as to the plantations in that birds help
control insect populations.  In a study conducted in Tel&ecirc;maco Borba, Paran&aacute;,
bird population was appraised in <I>Araucaria angustifolia</I> and <I>Eucalyptus
sp.</I> plantations and in mixed native forests.  The results showed a greater
bird population density in the plantations compared with the natural forest;
however, species diversity was greater in the native vegetation.  The greater
biodiversity in the adjacent native forests and a higher population density in
the plantations can combine to show an overall positive benefit (<A
HREF="eucaly6.html#berndt93">Berndt 1993</A>).</P>
<P> One of the major problems related to short-rotation eucalypt plantations
and animal populations has to do with species that require habitat that consists
of old trees or mature forests.  Three actions have been suggested to help
alleviate this problem: (1) leave some trees in the plantation at the time of
harvesting, (2) extend the rotation period, and (3) leave natural vegetation
intermixed with the short-rotation plantations (<A HREF="eucaly6.html#loyin85">Loyin
1985</A>).  The last has been the preferred action of Brazilian forest companies
(<A HREF="eucaly6.html#almeida82">Almeida et al. 1982</A>).  However,
consideration is also being given to extending the rotation period (<A
HREF="eucaly6.html#spinelli93">Spinelli 1993</A>).</P>
<P>Since the beginning of the reforestation programs in the 1960s, forest
companies had two options in attempting to preserve natural forests:  plant 1%
of the total number of trees using only native species or leave 10% of total
area in the original vegetation (<A HREF="eucaly6.html#reis92">Reis and Reis
1992</A>).  The latter option has been preferred because in most of the
afforested  areas at least 10% of the area in riparian vegetation or forest
cover was located along the rivers and streams or on very steep slopes, which
could not be harvested according to the National Forest Code.  Further, it was
difficult to get seeds of native species with which to accomplish the first
(planting) option.  Since reforestation programs that require the preservation
of native forests began, regions where plantations are established are typically
mosaics of plantations, pastures, grasslands, croplands and native vegetation. 
This diversity of habitat is very important to faunal preservation (<A
HREF="eucaly6.html#evans92">Evans 1992</A>).  Plantations certainly have helped
to alleviate the harvesting pressure on native forests and have provided for
habitat that otherwise would have been lost.</P>
<P>Other management practices that are very important to the success of a
conservation program for fauna involve leaving native areas undisturbed (<A
HREF="eucaly6.html#moss79">Moss 1979</A>), planting fruit trees, and
constructing small ponds throughout in the plantation area.  Such practices have
been carried out recently by most of the forest companies in Brazil.</P>
<P>It is possible to identify three stages in the development of a
short-rotation eucalypt plantation in relation to faunal habitat.  The first
stage is the initial establishment phase, when the stand is subjected to
intensive silvicultural practices such as weeding, cultivation, and herbicide
spraying.  In this phase, the eucalypt plantations may provide occasional
shelter for the animals living in the adjacent plantations or natural forests. 
The second stage is the crown competition phase, when shading restrains the
establishment of understory vegetation and the plantation offers limited
understory shelter for fauna from adjacent areas.  The last phase is the natural
pruning phase, where the understory reappears (provided seeds of native species
are present in the ground), leading to better conditions for the local fauna (<A
HREF="eucaly6.html#reis93">Reis and Reis 1993</A>).  Intermixing plantations in
varying phases helps create better habitat conditions.</P>
<P>In general, (1) plantations have a less diverse fauna than indigenous
forests, (2)  plantations composed of exotic trees have a less-diverse fauna
than plantations of indigenous species, (3) plantations can be made more
favorable for animals and plants by appropriate management practices that
provide desired habitat, and (4) planting in treeless areas can provide shelter
that would not otherwise be available to faunal populations (<A
HREF="eucaly6.html#poore85">Poore and Fries 1985</A>).</P>
<P>
<B>2.4.2  Flora</B></P>
<P>Planting eucalypts and replacing natural vegetation has an effect on the
flora of an area.  This effect may result from shading, competition for
nutrients and moisture, site disturbance, allelopathic effects, or the
cumulative effects of changes in the soil.  The extent of the impact will depend
on the nature of the community the plantation replaces and the ecological
characteristics of the region.  For example, in an arid region eucalypt may
suppress ground vegetation by competing for water, but this is unlikely to occur
in an area of high rainfall (<A HREF="eucaly6.html#poore85">Poore and Fries
1985</A>).</P>
<P>Critics of short-rotation commercial eucalypt plantations assume that
eucalypts have an allelopathic effect on the other plants, resulting in the
disappearance of the original native plants and local ecosystems (<A
HREF="eucaly6.html#poore85">Poore and Fires 1985</A>).  For the same reason,
there is concern that agricultural crops cannot be cultivated on lands
previously occupied by eucalypt plantations or even on lands nearby (<A
HREF="eucaly6.html#lima93">Lima 1993</A>).  It is believed that eucalypts can
affect other plants directly through the inhibitory influences of leaf litter
and root exudates or through the effect of litter on nutrient mineralization and
soil microflora (<A HREF="eucaly6.html#florence86">Florence 1986</A>).</P>
<P>However, a survey of the worldwide literature reveals that direct
plant-chemical interactions in natural communities are probably rare (<A
HREF="eucaly6.html#willis80">Willis 1980</A>).  Regeneration of native species
in the understory of eucalypt plantations is not restricted by allelopathic
effects of the litter (which can occur for a limited number of species).  Native
species regeneration is instead a function of (1) the amount of sunlight that
reaches the ground through the eucalypt canopy; (2) competition for soil-water;
and (3) the supply of seeds of native species in the soil. </P>
<P>Some feel that management practices on plantations will enhance conditions
for native flora.  For example, an intense fire in the eucalypt forest may
provide, at least temporarily, a more biologically favorable soil environment
for plant growth.  This more favorable environment is caused by many factors,
including the removal of plant competition, an increase in soil pH and
availability of ash nutrients, breakdown of inhibitory compounds, stimulated
mineralization of nitrogen and phosphorus in soil, and the effect of partial
soil sterilization on soil microflora.  Thus, it seems that many observed
effects of fast-growing eucalypt plantations might be attributed primarily to
competition for soil nutrients and water during the rapid growth phase rather
than any direct toxic influences the eucalypt may have on soils and other plants
(<A HREF="eucaly6.html#florence86">Florence 1986</A>).</P>
<P>Newly planted eucalypt seedlings are very sensitive to weed competition
during the first few months of establishment.  Therefore, it is common in Brazil
to use intensive silvicultural practices such as herbicides, mechanized weeding,
and other methods of site preparation, before planting begins.  These practices
allow the eucalypt seedlings to grow free of weed competition, at least during
the earlier stage of their lives.  Because of these practices, understory
vegetation in the intensively managed short-rotation commercial eucalypt
plantations does not normally reappear until the fourth year.  Most understory
vegetation will also be eliminated to facilitate harvesting and to provide 
proper establishment conditions for new plantation or the sprouts of the
eucalypt stumps.  Thus, the occurrence of understory species may be reduced in
plantation areas (<A HREF="eucaly6.html#reis93">Reis and Reis 1993</A>).</P>
<P>In some regions very aggressive grasses, such as <I>Brachiaria humidicola</I>,
<I>Panicum maximum</I>, and <I>B. decumbens</I>, can occur under the eucalypt
canopy.  The presence of these grasses makes it difficult for other understory
species to become established.  However, if the eucalypt plantation is allowed
to grow for longer periods of time, the original native species or ecosystems
probably will reappear in the understory, as was observed in a 50-year-old <I>Eucalyptus
saligna</I> plantation in Itatinga, S&atilde;o Paulo (<A
HREF="eucaly6.html#lima93">Lima 1993</A>).</P>
<P>There is no doubt that management practices, the eucalypt species used,
length of the rotation, and the existence of nearby native vegetation will all
influence understory composition in eucalypt plantations (<A
HREF="eucaly6.html#reis93">Reis and Reis 1993</A>).  For example, in a study
conducted in Belo Oriente in the state of Minas Gerais, a 16-year-old <I>Eucalyptus
paniculata</I> plantation had 47 native species (30 families) in the understory,
whereas a 6-year-old <I>E. saligna</I> plantation had 26 native species (20
families).  The density of the native understory increased with time, and the
density of the original eucalypt plantations decreased with age as a result of
natural mortality.  This decrease in stand density allowed more sunlight to
reach the ground, increasing the regeneration of native species (<A
HREF="eucaly6.html#calegario93">Calegario 1993</A>).  The amount of understory
also varies among eucalypt species.  For example, it has been shown that <I>E.
torreliana</I>, which has a larger and thicker canopy, has less native
understory than <I>E. grandis</I> or <I>E. saligna</I>.  Further, leaves of
<I>E. torreliana</I> do not decompose easily in the litter, restricting
germination of the native species seeds in the soil (<A
HREF="eucaly6.html#reis93">Reis and Reis 1993</A>).  As with other
environmental aspects, the impact of eucalypt plantations on local flora will
vary with local conditions and management.  It is necessary to match species to
site, particularly with reference to climate and soil.</P>
<P>Several studies have been conducted on the environmental aspects of the
large-scale eucalypt plantations in Brazil.  Walter de Paula Lima of Piracicaba,
S&atilde;o Paulo, observed recently that the existing scientific work indicates
that
