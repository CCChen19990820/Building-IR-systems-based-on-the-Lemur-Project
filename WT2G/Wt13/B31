<FONT color="#000080"><STRONG>TroubleShooter Column:  Prize Scams</STRONG><BR></FONT>
<FONT size=2>
<STRONG><EM>4/19/96</EM></STRONG><P>Congratulations you've won a prize.
By now, unless you live in a cave,
you've received at least one of these
mailers.<P>
They're the hottest schemes going
today, and they are impressive.
Some are fancy certificates with gold
embossing.
They say you're guaranteed to win one
of four or five exciting prizes:  a new
car, an exotic vacation, jewelry.<P>
Or you might receive a mailer from a
prize or sweepstakes clearinghouse
saying you're in line to win cash, big
cash.
It's locked in a vault with your name
on it, they imply.<P>
So, what's the catch?
The telephone number they invite you
dial, that's what.
A "900" phone line, that will cost you
anywhere between three and six dollars
a minute.
Dial the number you get a recorded
message, or often referred to another
number to learn if you are indeed the
grand prize winner.
All the while the clock is ticking, and
your phone bill is growing.<P>
When all is said and done, I'm afraid,
you wind up being nothing more than a
grand prize sucker.
That's how these operators make their
money.<P>
And for the most part, these mailers
with their "900" numbers are legal.
That's because they do identify
themselves as sweepstakes and they do
list your odds of winning.
Of course the print is usually very
small, or very light compared to the
banner headline, "You've won a prize."
Your odds, by the way, are usually even
for winning one dollar.<P>
The average phone bill for that "900"
call is $27.
It's a moneymaker.
So, next time you go to the mailbox,
wear your coat of armor and a sense of
humor.
If that impressive mailer tells you,
"You've won a prize," it's definitely
too good to be true.<P>

If you uncover a scam or scheme in your
community, we'd like to hear from you.

<FONT color="#000080"><STRONG>TroubleShooter Column:  Trash to Treasure</STRONG><BR></FONT>
<FONT size=2>
<STRONG><EM>4/26/96</EM></STRONG><P>They turn trash into treasure.
A new breed of thieves is contributing
to one of the hottest scams, and one of
the hardest to stop:  identity theft.
Thieves will dig through your trash,
steal your mail, and "shoulder surf" at
the ATM for your PIN number.
They stop at nothing to get personal
and financial information they can use
to create a whole new you.<P>
This scam has gone beyond stealing
wallets and going on a shopping spree
with hot credit cards.
Identity thieves are very
sophisticated.
They can turn a pilfered checkbook, or
a social security number into an entire
credit profile, bouncing checks and
charging thousands of dollars in
merchandise on fraudulent accounts.
And the bill goes to you, the victim.<P>
Usually victims learn they've been
"cloned" when the telephone rings with
angry creditors or collection agencies
threatening to sue.
And the onus is on you, the victim to
clean up the mess, often while the con
artist is still out there creating new
bills.<P>
So what can we do to protect ourselves?<P>
Shred.<P>
Shred anything that could potentially
be used by a thief:  credit card
statements, offers of instant credit,
any banking information, even junk mail
if it has personal information on it.
And make sure your bank or other
financial institutions shred as well.
Demand to see their shredder.<P>
We recently went dumpster diving in a
commercial area of San Diego and found
to our dismay banks and stock brokers
throwing away confidential client
information including credit reports,
account statements, and new account
applications without shredding them.
A mother lode for an enterprising
identity thief.
The businesses were rightfully
embarrassed by our find, and promise
not to do it again.<P>
There are other ways to protect
yourself.
Contact your credit card company and
credit reporting bureaus.
Have them take your name off mailing
lists they sell to direct marketers.
Most now offer an "opt-out" option.
You should take it.<P>
And if you find you are a victim of
identity theft act immediately.
Report the crime to police.
Close credit and bank accounts.
Call the fraud units of the three
credit reporting companies:  TRW,
Equifax, and Trans Union.
Let them know what's happened.<P>
And if you use an ATM, replace your
card and get a new pin number.
Then brace yourself for what could a
difficult ride.  
This is one crime where the victim is
often considered quilty until proven
innocent.<P>Until next time,<BR>

<FONT size=2>
<STRONG><EM>5/6/96</EM></STRONG><P>If you run a business, here's one more
reason your left hand should know what
the right hand is doing.<P>
Scammers are relying on your lack of
communication or organization to slip
their hands into your pockets.
And they are succeeding.
Invoice scams are moving across the
country in waves.
Here's how they work.<P>
In the daily crush of mail, your front
office will receive what looks like a
typical invoice.
It may be for office supplies, toner
for the copy machine, or what looks
like a bill for advertising.
They look so convincing, your front
office may cut a check, no questions
asked.
It's only on closer inspection you find
these invoices are not bills at all.<P>
One recent example is a mailer from the
Eastern Lighting Company with a
corporate address in Gibbsboro, New
Jersey.
Eastern Lighting sells flourescent
light bulbs.
Their mailer looks like a typical
invoice with an I.D. number, shipping
date, and a big "Thank you for your
business," printed up the middle.
It's not until you scan to the very
bottom of the page, and look very
closely at the small print you see the
disclaimer:  "This is a solicitation. 
This is not a bill."
Eastern Lighting offers sixty,
four-foot light bulbs for $970.  That's
about three times what you'd pay at the
hardware store.<P>
We go looking for the Eastern Lighting
Company with questions about their
mailers.
The corporate address on their invoice
turns out to be an apartment.  And
nobody answers the door the day we come
calling.<P>
The Better Business Bureau has received
inquiries about the Eastern Lighting
Company and is all too familiar with
these invoice schemes.
They say the best way to protect
yourself is through knowledge and
vigilance.
Establish internal controls for paying
invoices.
That includes channeling all invoices
through one department.
Check all invoices against goods or
services received.
And never place an order over the
phone, unless you know who you're
dealing with.<P>
If you are the victim of an invoice
scam report it to Postal Inspectors and
your local Better Business Bureau.<P>

<STRONG><EM>5/14/96</EM></STRONG><P>We can travel the world in an hour,
solve the most vexing scientific
riddles, or access public records with
the snap of a mouse.
Such are the marvels of the internet.<P>
The World Wide Web is making the world
smaller and certainly more convenient,
connecting us to people, places, and
resources once beyond reach.
But, the Web is also fertile ground for
fraud, a way to reach prospective victims
without so much as leaving your
computer keyboard.<P>
The scams emerging on the internet are
nothing new.
They are the same cyclical and trendy
schemes raking in money in our own
communities.
What's different is the internet's
reach: virtually millions of consumers
doing business often blindly over the
computer.
Some of the more common internet scams
include advance fee schemes, phony
investment or purchase opportunities,
work at home, even diet scams.
These scams tend to flourish in tight
economic times.<P>
Take for example, the advance fee scam.
It comes in many flavors.
For money upfront the conman promises
an overseas job, a loan to get you over
the hard times, or help repairing a
blotchy credit report.
The sucker sends money or relinquishes
a credit card number, only to be left
hundreds of dollars in the hole with
nothing to show for it.<P>
Investment "opportunities" also follow
the economy, and trends.
They may be gold-in-the-ground or other
precious metals investments, real
estate deals, or the chance to invest
in fledgling high tech ventures.
Again, money upfront the investor will
never see again. 
This is not to say every business
opportunity pitched on the internet is
a scam.
But, every pitch should be greeted with
skepticism and plenty of homework.<P>
A helpful guide is now available
through the United States Consumer Information
Center.
It's called "Online Scams: Road
Hazards on the Information
Superhighway."
It costs fifty cents, and is available
by mail: Consumer Information Center, Department
377C, Pueblo, CO  81009.
Or you can e-mail the Consumer
Information Center with the message
"send info" to:  <A href="mailto:  cic.info.@pueblo.gsa.gov">cic.info.@pueblo.gsa.gov</A> for
directions to their bulletin board
system (202-208-7679) and internet

<FONT color="#000080"><STRONG>TroubleShooter Column:  Internet Scams II</STRONG><BR></FONT>
<FONT size=2>
<STRONG><EM>5/16/96</EM></STRONG><P>Last week in this space we revealed
the evils of Internet scams, how the World Wide Web is now a fertile
new frontier for fraud.
Cyberthieves are lurking to steal your
credit card numbers, entice you with
bogus investment opportunities, or
prize scams.
Whatever is hot on the street is now
revving up on the superhighway.
And what's worse, there are few if any
laws on the books to thwart this fraud.
The Federal Trade Commission has
standards for telemarketers, state's
regulate business and profession codes.
But, just try to find a statute that
fits the Internet.
It's tough to do and may prove tougher
to enforce.
That doesn't mean consumer advocates
aren't ready to try.<P>
The California state legislature is now
considering a bill by Assemblywoman
Jackie Speier, a Democrat from
Burlingame.
The bill would require persons selling
anything on the Internet to reveal
their street address, their refund
policies, and a cost-free method for
consumers to contact them and resolve
disputes.
Essentially, the bill would expand on
current standards for direct mail
businesses.<P>
Assemblywoman Speier calls this a
"gentle approach" to protecting
consumers from thieves and protecting
the Internet from an erosion of public
confidence. 
While the Internet is worldwide, Speier
says California and other states can
(and should) set standards for any
business reaching out to consumers
within their borders.
In Speier's words, <EM>"Excessive
government regulation will harm,  not
help, the positive benefits
attributable to the Internet.  But,
left unchecked, the specter of
cyberthieves will deter use of the
Internet."</EM>
Speier's bill is up for Assembly vote
May 23.<P>
In the meantime, how to recognize a
potential scam.
The California Alliance for Consumer
Protection warns us to be suspicious of
web sites that ask for a lot of
information about the consumer
accessing the site.
Be leery when you can get little
information about the firm running the
site, or those that appear to infringe
on well-known trademarks.
Michael Ross of the Alliance says, <EM>"You
should not have to register to enter a
web site.  You don't know who you are
hooking into."</EM>  And he says, <EM>"You
should never give out your credit card
number on a web site.  Never, period."</EM><P>

Consumer watchdogs are trolling the Internet in search of scams and cyberthieves.  For information contact National Consumers League Watch at <A href="http://www.fraud.org">http://www.fraud.org</A> or via E-mail at <A href="mailto:nfic@internetmci.com">nfic@internetmci.com</A>.

<FONT color="#000080"><STRONG>TroubleShooter Column:  Pyramid Schemes</STRONG><BR></FONT>
<FONT size=2>
<STRONG><EM>5/31/96</EM></STRONG><P>In all the history of all the scams in
the world, none has been more
successful than the Ponzi.  It's better known as the pyramid scheme. 
It's successful because friends entice
friends to invest in a "real
moneymaker," the big kahuna of
payoffs, money chasing money, fueled by greed
and unquestioned trust in the friend or
relative recruiting new investors.
But, most investors will never pocket
those fat profits.
They will never even get their initial
investment back.
Such is the sad truth about the pyramid
scheme.<P>
With our new technology the pyramid has
moved from clandestine meetings in
homes and neighborhood coffee shops to
the Internet.
Now, you can get ripped off in a Ponzi
without ever seeing the thief who picks
your pocket.
And this has Internet supporters and
law enforcement on the offensive.
This past week the Federal Trade
Commission shut down a major pyramid
advertising on the Internet, it's
largest enforcement action yet against
cyber-fraud.<P>
The Fortuna Alliance, head quartered in
Bellingham, Washington, used claims
such as, "What if you paid $250 a
month, which produced a minimum of
$5,250 income each month for you, while
you simply watched?"
The FTC says thousands of consumers
took the bait, paying between $250 and
$1750 to join the pyramid, trusting
they would receive $5000 a month simply
by getting others to "enroll" in the
Alliance.
The FTC says the scam netted more than
six million dollars before authorities
shut them down.  Investigators say at
least half that money is sitting in a
bank in Antiqua, West Indies.
So much for those fat monthly checks
to members of the Fortuna Alliance.<P>
Schemes like these have Internet
boosters worried.
Organizations like the Internet
Consumers Action Network, based in San
Diego, are concerned cyber-scams will
have a chilling affect on honest
Internet trade, by scaring business and
consumers away.
ICAN is now lobbying to expand
California laws covering mail order
businesses to include the Internet.
A bill is pending in the state
legislature that would require a street
address for business, state refund
policies, and a cost-free way for
consumers to resolve complaints.
ICAN and other consumer groups are also
are setting up hot lines.
The biggest nationwide hot line is
operated by the National Consumers
League out of Washington, D.C.   
The E-mail address for their Internet
Fraud Watch is <A href="mailto:  nfic@internetmci.com">nfic@internetmci.com</A>.
They also have a toll-free telephone
number:  1-800-876-7060.

Grocery shopping is about to get a lot
easier for those who surf the Internet.
Just dial up your favorite store or
manufacturer, get the latest sales at
your neighborhood market, and print
your own coupons and recipes.
These are a taste of the options
available from Supermarkets Online.
This new cyber-shopping service kicks
off June 14 with 1600 supermarkets in
California, including all the major
grocery chains:  Von's, Ralphs, Lucky,
and Food 4 Less, to name a few.
As usual, California is a the first state to give this service a
try.  And no doubt, much of the nation
will be watching.<P>
Consumers across the country have
sampled the services of the company
behind Supermarkets Online.
That company is Catalina Marketing,
based in St. Petersburg, Florida.
Catalina's forte is in-store marketing.
 They provide money-saving coupons at
the check out stand, representing 130
consumer goods companies.    The Catalina
Marketing Network is installed in more
than 9700 supermarkets across the
United States.<P>
Supermarkets Online seems a natural
outgrowth.
Beginning next Friday, consumers on the
Internet will be able to dial up the
Supermarkets Online web page and select
the following from their main menu:

Print money-saving coupons.
Review specific manufacturer offers.
Compare local supermarkets' weekly
specials.
Access and download recipes.
Plan meals.
Create shopping lists.
View product nuitritional information.

Shopping has never been easier.  At
least that's the promise of
Supermarkets Online.

<FONT size=2>
<STRONG><EM>6/21/96</EM></STRONG><P>
Many scams are seasonal.
During the holidays charity scams, and
loan schemes flourish.
Rounding the corner into Spring,
travelling roofers and pavers rip off
homeowners.
And as Spring gives way to Summer,
watch out.
The cons target brides with wedding
scams.
And graduating high school students are
targets of schemes ranging from
scholarship come-ons to photo rip-offs.
And now a new one on us:  "The
graduation party scam," for want of a
better title.<P>
Here's how it works.
An invitation arrives in the mail.
A graduation party is planned.
Please attend or send your check to the
address on the invitation.
Only problem, you don't know who this
young graduate is. 
Could be a distant relative, you're
just not sure.
So not wanting to offend, you write a
check and send it off.
We're seeing one letter in particular
that has us intrigued.<P>
Mim Myers in Boston receives an
invitation from Jennifer Lynn Shapiro,
a senior, the announcement says, at
Newport Harbor High School in Newport
Beach, California.
Mim knows some family with that name in
California, but she's suspicious.
"Who are they," she wonders.  "Long
lost relatives?"  So, she does a little
checking and finds nobody in her family
who fits this profile.
"I feel it's a money scam," says Mim,
disgusted with this squirrelly attempt
to get her money.<P>
Cleveland residents also report
receiving these letters, addressed
mainly to people with Jewish sounding
surnames.
David Weiss of the Cleveland Better
Business Bureau says this is really a
very clever scheme.
"Graduation gifts usually come in the
form of a check," he says.
Weiss says if one in twenty people send
a check, averaging $25 or $50, this
"graduation invitation" can be a money
maker. 
Weiss says law enforcement is now onto
this scam.<P>
Here's what we know.
There is a Jennifer Shapiro at Newport
Harbor High.
But she and her family did not send the
invitations, and are frankly very
embarrassed and upset Jennifer's name
is being used this way.
We've also learned the return address
on the invitation is a mailbox drop in
Newport Beach.
Not a private home at all.
Postal inspectors have now closed the
box, seizing mail as evidence.<P>
If you've received one of these
invitations, or a similar one we'd like
to hear from you.
Drop us a line at our web site.
And remember, never send money to
someone you don't know.<P>

Until next time,<BR>

Television on the fritz?
No problem, just toss it and buy a new
one.
Sounds like a dandy idea, but not very
practical.
Yet that's what California's Governor
Wilson would have us do.
No sense repairing our TVs and VCRs.
It's cheaper to just replace them.
I know you think I'm exaggerating.
But it's true.
This is the reasoning, at least the
public verbiage behind a bill written
by California State Assemblyman Howard
Kaloogian from Carlsbad.
It's supported by Governor Wilson and his
budget cutters.<P>
A bill that would kill a little known,
but important consumer protection
agency: The Bureau of Electronic and
Appliance Repair, an agency originally founded forty odd
years ago to regulate vacuum tubes,
that ran our TVs and radios.
Today, BEAR, as the agency is
affectionately known, protects
consumers from shady repairmen.
And does pretty fair job of it.
But, the Wilson administration is
looking for places to cut the state
budget.
And consumer protection is on the
block.
Many of California's consumer
protection agencies must either prove
they can make money for the state, or
they risk the "Sunset."  
That's a scenic way of saying they will
be written out of the budget.
Granted, some agencies have outlived
their usefulness.
But, BEAR is not one of them.<P>
Nearly every household has a television
set, VCR, radio or stereo system.
We buy increasingly more sophisticated
appliances:  stoves, microwaves,
refrigerators.
And personal computers are becoming
standard equipment in homes and
offices.
Sales and repair of these important
tools are regulated by Bear.
Warranties are protected and enforced
through BEAR.
And BEAR is self-sufficient, funded by
registration fees and fines.
It's interesting to note:  the biggest
opponents of Assembly Bill 2520, the
measure to gut bear, are electronic
repairmen, who say their industry needs
policing.
This is for their own good and to protect
consumers.
And for now, at least their voices are
heard: Assembly Bill 2520 has just died a quiet
legislative death.
And Howard Kaloogian and Governor
Wilson and their pals need to let this
bill rest in peace, for the sake of consumers, the
industry, and a public agency that's
actually doing it's job.<P>Until next time,<BR>

<FONT color="#000080"><STRONG>TroubleShooter Column:  Timeshares</STRONG><BR></FONT>
<FONT size=2>
<STRONG><EM>7/12/96</EM></STRONG><P>
Beware the scam masquerading as the
deal of the decade, an opportunity to sell your timeshare,
guaranteed.  There's only one catch--this deal is a big,
fat lie.
But an enticing lie.
Remember all the excitement back in the
1970's and 1980's over timeshares?
The best vacation deal going, the
pitchmen said.
And, wow, what an investment.
Only the bottom fell out of the economy
and the market.
Soon there was a glut of timeshares
sitting empty, begging for buyers.
And sellers anxious to rid themselves
of an albatross.<P>
Since the late 1980's timeshare resale
schemes have come and gone.
They advertise in local and national
newspapers, buy mailing lists from
timeshare brokers, cold call timeshare
owners, and host seminars with offers
to sell unwanted units.
The catch is superficial:  "Pay us $500
up front, and consider it a done deal."
Only, timeshare owners soon learn that
up front money is gone for good once
these hucksters have it in their sweaty
little hands.<P>
Now, a new generation of timeshare
scheme has surfaced.
It's still an advance fee setup, but
it has a twist.
If your timeshare doesn't sell within a
prescribed time frame, the selling
agent will pay you for the timeshare
anyway.
And they'll throw in a fat profit on
your investment.
Guaranteed, they say, through an
insurance company.<P>
The first of these to cross our desk
was World Wide Vacations, based in St.
Clairesville, Ohio.
World Wide Vacations claims to
represent buyers in Great Britain,
where there is pent up demand for U.S.
timeshares, they say.
Your sale guaranteed by the British
Guarantee Company.
Only there is no British Guarantee
Company, and the offer is a scam.
Police in St. Clairesville, Ohio
recently arrested the alleged brains
behind this scheme, Brian Masinelli.
But another scheme just like it has
now popped up to take its place.
Danish Leisure, based in Copenhagen,
Denmark, is billed as a country teeming
with people eager to plop down money
for timeshares in the United States, particularly in Southern California.
The Scandinavian United Society, in
Copenhagen, is the insurance company
that guarantees the sale.
With experience "over many years," they
say.
Curious.
When we call we get only an answering
machine, and the Scandinavian United
Society has no listed telephone number.
The Danish consulate in Los Angeles
tells us the European timeshare market
is saturated, and Danes especially, are
not big on timeshares.
So, beware the "deal of the decade."  
Don't pay anyone money up front to sell
your timeshare, no matter what they
promise.<P>
Until next time,<BR>

<FONT size=2>
<STRONG><EM>7/22/96</EM></STRONG><P>
Credit.  Credit.  Credit.  We all love credit, to the tune of $400
billion dollars.  That's how much American consumers now
owe on their credit cards, credit cards too enticing not to use.
We're inundated with offers of pre-approved credit cards, cards with low teaser interest rates and cards that give us airline miles and other perks just for buying with plastic.
Two billion credit card offers arrived
in our mailboxes last year alone.  So many offers consumers can't help but
bite.  Only problem, those cards bite back,
with interest rates that leave us
steeped in debt.  If you pay your balance each month,
interest isn't such a big deal.  But, most of us carry a balance.  And interest rates can range all the
way up to 28% on some accounts.<P>

There are ways to cut the interest you
pay on your credit cards.  The first, don't carry a balance.
Pay off the card every month.  Another way to cut the interest you pay
is to pay your bills on time, and keep your credit report clean.
Many credit card issuers now set
interest rates according to the
applicants credit history.  The better the risk, the lower the
rate.  And here's another way you can cut the
amount of interest you pay.  Pull out your major credit card.  Now turn it over.
On the back of the card you'll find a
toll free telephone number.  If you have an available balance on
your card, your payments are current,
and the card doesn't offer bonuses, you
may be able to negotiate your interest
rate.  Credit providers are locked in a
dog-eat-dog competition for your
interest dollar.  Take advantage of it.
Tell your credit card issuer the
competition is offering you a lower
rate.  Can they meet it or beat it?
In many cases they can and will.<P>

Our Troubleshooter crew recently
conducted a survey at a San Diego
shopping center.  We provided cellphones.  Consumers negotiated.
Half of them got a break on their interest rates.
It pays to ask.  At the worst, you get a "no".
At best, you wind up with an interest
rate that makes all that credit just a
little more lovable.<P>

<FONT size=2>
<STRONG><EM>7/26/96</EM></STRONG><P>I hate to be the bearer of bad tidings
but that mailer telling you, "You've
won a fabulous prize," is a lie.
The good news:  The people doing the
lying are in deep pudding with the
feds.<P>


The Federal Trade Commission is pulling
out the stops to put these slick
promoters out of business.
Their crackdown is called Project
Jackpot, a major enforcement effort
targeting firms that fraudulently offer
"valuable prizes" to induce us to buy
their products.  Often these so-called
free prizes wind up costing hundreds,
even thousands of dollars by the time
we buy the obligatory vitamins, water
filters, magazines, or vacations these
promoters are peddling.<P>

The F.T.C. says prize promotions are
the number one source of complaints
reported to the National Fraud
Information Center, a federal-state
telemarketing fraud database.  For the
fiscal year ending in June 1996, fully
half of all complaints reported were
prize promotion scams.  So, with the backing of the Attorneys
General in 17 states, the U.S. Postal
Service, and Canadian law enforcement,
the F.T.C. has filed charges against 79
prize promoters.<P>
Among those charged are the American
Exchange Group, Las Vegas, selling
magazines and pens.
Oasis Southwest, also in Las Vegas,
sells "Say No To Drugs" paraphernalia.
Family Publishers Clearing Center,
Woodland Hills, California, and
Publishers Award Bureau in Orange,
California.  Both offer cars, T.V.
sets, cash, and building lots in Baja,
Mexico as inducements to buy 
magazines.  
Best Marketing out of Florida.
Multinet Marketing, LLC, in Texas.
And Incentive International (aka
Pegasus Industries) head quartered in
Montreal, Canada.<P>
And here's a twist on telemarketing
scams.  The F.T.C. also targets a so-called
"recovery room:"  telemarketers who
claim they will recover money you lost
to other scammers.  Investigators say the
Telecommunications Protection Agency 
in Oklahoma would collect $500 up front
from consumers, and has never recovered
a cent for those who believed their
pitch.
The F.T.C. has frozen assets and has
shut down these telemarketers for the
time being, while they duke it out in
court.
But you can bet your lucky dollar,
there are plenty of prize promoters to
take their place. <P>
If you've been ripped off, or suspect a
scam, report it.

Center Hotline at 1-800-876-7060.

<FONT size=2>
<STRONG><EM>8/2/96</EM></STRONG><P>Now hear this.  If you bought the "fabulous" Whisper XL
hearing device, advertised nationally,
you are entitled to a refund.
The Attorney Generals of 17 states are
sending the message loud and clear.
They've settled a lawsuit with the
company that sells the XL, the
Telebrands Corporation of Roanoke,
Virginia.<P>
Telebrands pitched the Whisper XL in
Parade Magazine, TV Guide, and other
national publications.
Their pitchman, the well-known and
respected performer Steve Allen.
Telebrands claimed the Whisper XL has
"state of the art electronic
engineering" that helps you hear a pin
drop from fifty feet away, hear a
whisper from one hundred feet away and hear birds sing like never before-- 
claims that just aren't true, according
to state prosecutors who joined in the
consumer protection lawsuit.
California Attorney General Dan Lungren
says Telebrands, "Made
misrepresentations about the product's
ability to function as a hearing aid,"
for people suffer hearing impairment.
Further, the Whisper XL is not approved
as a hearing aid by the U.S. Food and
Drug Administration, or state health
agencies.
That means it's not only
misrepresented, but it could be dangerous
to your hearing.<P>
Rather than duke it out in court, the
President of Telebrands, Ajit Khubani,
has agreed to pay $515,000 in civil
penalties, attorney fees, and costs.
Khubani will reimburse consumers who
bought the Whisper XL.
And without admitting any guilt,
Telebrands will stop selling the
Whisper XL until it's approved by the
FDA and state health agencies.
When or if it's ever approved.
If you bought the Whisper XL and you
want a refund, here's the address to
write:<P>

Telebrands, Inc.<BR>
2428 Patterson Ave, SW<BR>
Roanoke, Va.  24016<P>

Send them the Whisper XL or provide
proof of purchase along with a written
statement saying you no longer have the
device.
And before you buy any hearing aid or
other product that promises to help you
overcome a medical problem or
disability, check with your doctor or
local health agencies to see if the
product is safe and approved for sale.<P>

<FONT color="#000080"><STRONG>TroubleShooter Column:  Reformulated Fuel</STRONG><BR></FONT>
<FONT size=2>
<STRONG><EM>8/26/96</EM></STRONG><P>California is one of a growing number
of states under court order to clean up
its air.
And one promising new tool in the war
on smog is a new gasoline.
Reformulated fuels hit the California
market June first--Hit the market with fanfare, higher
prices, and controversy.<P>
A year ago, critics complained the new
fuels could damage carborators on older
cars.
Others said fuel economy would be
sacraficed.
Now, it is state inspectors who
criticize, alleging the Air Resources
Board is hiding potentially lifesaving
information from the public.
Three inspectors for the ARB's
Performance and Compatibility Test
Program say the reformulated fuels seem
to cause fuel leaks.
In more than half the fleet vehicles
tested, the inspectors say they found
seeps.  That's where moisture collects
around the car's fuel system.  Seeps
that could indicate a more serious
leak.
Worse yet, the seeps can create a
buildup of gas fumes in the engine
compartment and contribute to car
fires.
But management at the ARB excluded this
data from their final Performance
Report on reformulated fuels, saying
seepage, "should be characterized as a
normal occurrence and not be attributed
to test fuels."<P>
In an ARB memorandum, Dean Simeroth,
chief of the agency's Criteria
Pollutant  Branch says the three
whistle blowing inspectors,
"consistently reported more seeps than
anyone else, including the mechanics of
fleets who participated in the
performance test program and technical
representatives from the automobile
manfacturers who looked into the issue
of seeps."
So the ARB doesn't consider the
inspectors' findings important or
accurate.
But, apparently the data has at least
one oil company concerned enough to
post consumer warnings.
Chevron has warnings posted on its gas
station pumps saying the new fuels may
cause gas leaks in older and high
mileage cars.<P>
There's another concern about
these new fuels, leaks from underground storage tanks.
The new fuels have components that
don't decompose easily, and are
travelling far and wide.
In Santa Monica, the city was forced to
cut off five water wells affecting
200,000 customers.
In the Napa Valley of California, the
chemicals wound up in a well a block
away from gas stations, forcing water
officials to shut off spickets to
nearby residents.<P>
The stubborn component in the new fuel
is MTBE:  Methyl Tertiary Butyl Ether.
The additive that makes the gas burn
cleaner.
The Environmental Protection Agency now
acknowledges MTBE may possibly cause
cancer, and local water agencies are on
notice to look for MTBE while checking 
leaking tanks.
Again the Air Resources Board has an
answer.  MTBE, they say, has been used
as an octane enhancer since the 1970's,
with no harmful affects.  Besides,
underground tanks aren't supposed to
leak, period.  And older ones are
supposed to be replaced with
double-walled tanks by 1998.<P>
But, that doesn't address lingering
concerns about reformulated fuels.
After all, California didn't test the
fuels until last year, four years after
they were approved for use in the
state.
By then, the oil industry had already
spent sizeable sums of money developing
the new fuel and bringing it to market.
Auto makers are also changing vehicle
designs for the new gas.
Talk about closing the barn door after
the cows are out.
We can only hope the critics are wrong,
and reformulated fuels are as safe as
their supporters claim.<P>

<STRONG><EM>9/27/96</EM></STRONG><P>
Remember that old childhood game where
you sit in a big circle and whisper
something into the ear of the person
next to you.  They pass it to the
person next to them and so on.
When the message finally makes it back
around to you it often bares little or
no resemblance to your original
statement.<P>
That is what has happened on the World
Wide Web these past few weeks.
A rumor got started and spread like
wildfire, somehow leaving the truth in
the ashes.
At least that's according to the people
at Lexis-Nexis, a data service that
that provides information to lawyers,
mainly.
Lexis-Nexis introduced a big new
database in June that offers
subscribers a tremendous resource for
tracking people down.  Especially folks
who don't want to be found.
P-Trak has 310-million names,
addresses, phone numbers. 
It's fair to say most of us are in the
Lexis-Nexis file.
When the company first unveiled it's
new product, P-Trak included social
security numbers.
That only lasted ten days, according to
Lexis-Nexis spokesman Steve Edwards.
The company received complaints, and
realizing their mistake, dropped the
S.S. numbers from the file.<P>
But, that didn't stop the rumors along
the Internet.
Users have been passing one version
after another along the superhighway.
Some of the messages I'm receiving
include complaints about Lexis-Nexis
selling not only social security
numbers, but mother's maiden names.
Imagine what an identity thief could do
with that?
Others hear P-Trak is available to
anybody with a credit card.
And most of these letters express fear
about a loss of privacy.<P>
Lexis-Nexis has been flooded with calls
and is now trying to set the record
straight.
Steve Edwards says they no longer
include social security numbers.
And, he says, "Lexis-Nexis never
included mother's maiden names to
subscribers."
Further, he says, "The information we
provide is available only to our
subscribers", says Edwards.  "And even
with 310-million names, P-Trak comes
nowhere close to matching some of the
enormous databases out there."
Edwards says because of all the flap,
Lexis-Nexis is willing to drop
information about anyone who doesn't
want to be in the database.
But, you must place your request in
writing.  <P>Here's the address:<BR>

<FONT size=2>
<STRONG><EM>10/4/96</EM></STRONG><P>

Summer's over.  Vacations are done.
Everybody's back to work, and catching up.
It's a hectic time.
The people behind a clever scheme know this and are trying to take advantage.
You or your business may already be a victim.
It's the "Invoice Caper."<P>

Statements in the mail or on the fax that look just like invoices for all sorts of products:  toner, light bulbs, batteries--all at inflated prices.
It's not until you read the very fine print at the bottom the page, you see it's not a bill at all.
It's a sales pitch.
Here are some of the latest.<P>
Northeastern Environmental based in Phoenixville, Pennsylvania is selling what it's mailer calls "High Density Liners."  
That's trash can liners for the rest of us.
A "bulk lot" goes for $981.10.   
That kind of money could buy a whole lot of trash can liners.
The Northeastern invoice looks so official with it's branch and I.D. numbers, even a stock number for the "high density liners."
It's not until you refocus your eyes on some very small print at the bottom of the page that you learn the truth.
"This is not a bill.  This is a solicitation.  You are under no obligation to pay the above amount or accept this offer."
The Postal Inspection Service says these disclaimers are supposed to be printed in 30 point type.
The Northeastern disclaimer measures in at six point, five times smaller than it's supposed to be.
The same goes for a couple of other "trash liner" invoices, also out of Pennsylvania.
U.S. Safety, Inc. sells its liners for $995.   Coincidentally enough, they're also in Phoenixville.
A bulk pack of 100 liners from Precision Plastic Products in Ardmore, Pennsylvania sells for $988.60.
All official looking "invoices," likely to slip through to cracks at your busy office.
We now have a pile of these mailers from small and large businesses, school districts, and other government offices.<P>
Postal inspectors tell us they're receiving complaints about the "invoices" from all over the country.
So, treat this as a heads up.
And if you do receive one of these mailers, send it to postal inspectors.
The Chicago office investigates phony invoice violations.<P>

<FONT color="#000080"><STRONG>TroubleShooter Column:  809 Area Code</STRONG><BR></FONT>
<FONT size=2>
<STRONG><EM>10/18/96</EM></STRONG><P>

This week we dip into the Troubleshooter mail bag for a peek at some of the schemes stinging consumers right now.
And a look at some of the relief consumers can expect to see.
No consumer issue strikes closer to home, than buying and selling a home.
And when there are problems, it can feel  like the sky is falling.
The state of California is now considering a new policy that could help keep the sky in it's place.
By regulating the people who inspect homes up for sale. 
Currently, nobody regulates them.
That's right, anybody can hang a shingle and call themselves an inspector.
What that means to consumers is the distinct probability of a faulty inspection when they buy or sell a home.
The state contractor's board regulates the various building trades, and is considering taking inspectors under it's wing as well.
But, it won't be without approval from the legislature and considerable public comment.
If you want to be heard on this issue the contractor's board invites you to write.
The address: <BR><STRONG> Contractor's State License Board<BR>  
                                  P.O. Box 26000<BR>
                                  Sacramento, CA 95826</STRONG><P>
	


With your home in mind, you may have seen a mailer offering to fill out paperwork for a declaration of homestead.
That's a document that could protect part of your home equity if you are sued.
The mailer looks official.  
It's from the state homestead protection office.
It defines a homestead declaration.
Specifies how much equity is protected, potentially.
And urges you to file right away.
The mailer even offers to fill out the application for you.
For a $25 fee.
What the mailer doesn't say is you must still pay  notary and filing fees.
And it's not until you read the very small print, the mailer reveals it's a private company soliciting your business.
The county assessor in San Diego says this is deceptive.
Gregory Smith  writes, "The state homestead protection office portrays itself as a governmental agency...and that could be misleading".
And he's now asking the postal inspection service to investigate.
So, be aware.
And don't send away your money until you  have all the facts.
<P>
Getting  down to facts on the latest telephone scam can be an expensive proposition.
It's a scam spreading as fast as you can say:  beep me.
In short:  beware the 809 area code.
Ads are popping in newspapers and on the Internet offering jobs.  Just call an "809" number.
Letters arrive in our mailboxes, threatening collection  on debts or promising a prize.  
Again, the number to call has an "809" area code.
Or your beeper goes off:  the number begins with "809."
809 is a legitimate area code, in the Caribbean.
Only  victims of this scam don't know that when they dial, and wind up with whopping phone bills.
So far at least two long distance phone companies have been singled in this scam.
And there may be more.
Best bets:  don't return any long distance call unless you know who it is.
Or dial collect.<P>
Until next time,<P>

<FONT color="#000080"><STRONG>TroubleShooter Column:  Top 10 Consumer Complaints</STRONG><BR></FONT>
<FONT size=2>
<STRONG><EM>10/28/96</EM></STRONG><P>




With election day just a week away, everybody with an axe to grind is trying to make their point and make it stick.  Whether it's affirmative action, managed care, or who to elect to office.
And heavens, we've certainly had an earful about Whitewater and family values as the presidential campaigns shift into full gear.  But one group is conspicuously silent, their interests hardly even a murmur.  This group is the consumer.
All of us can only hope we get a fair shake in the marketplace.
And we usually do.  
But try as we may, consumer fraud still takes a big chunk out of us.
Forty billion dollars each year.
Everything from credit card fraud to sleazy telemarketers and their empty promises.
Yet, during this clamorous election season, you can hear a pin drop on the subject of consumer protection.
And there's so much to be said.
Heck, we've got our own top ten list of  consumer complaints.
Again worth  $40,000,000,000.  That's billion dollars.
Starting with number ten:<P>


<STRONG>10.</STRONG>  Health clubs.  Consumers pay upfront for memberships , and get ripped off.<P>

<STRONG>9.</STRONG>  Funeral and cemetary services.  Consumers buried in a flurry of unexpected costs.<P>

<STRONG>8.</STRONG>  Auto repairs.  The single most common complaint in sheer numbers to state consumer protection agencies.<P>

<STRONG>7.</STRONG>  Auto purchase, lease, and rent.  It's so hard to say no to what could be your second biggest purchase.<P>

<STRONG>6.</STRONG>  Construction and repair contractors.  And as winter arrives so do the travelling construction scams.<P>

<STRONG>5. </STRONG> Travel failures and scams.  Usually we pay upfront for our vacation plans, leaving us wide open for all sorts of disappointments.  From business failures, to cons who run off with our money leaving us high and dry.<P>


<STRONG>4.</STRONG>  Deceptive advertising.  From bait and switch to the endless "going out of business" sale, consumers must sift daily through advertising claims, many which fall short of the truth.<P>

<STRONG>3.</STRONG>  Phony prizes and misleading offers.  From free prizes to charity fraud many of these scams tempt us over the phone and through the mail.<P>

<STRONG>2.</STRONG>  Investment scams.   Many of these victims are  retirees,  bilked out of their savings, with investments they don't need, and don't pay off.<P>

<STRONG>1.</STRONG>  And the number one consumer complaint is:
Identity theft.  Thieves get their hands on our personal information and life becomes a nightmare.<P>

The top ten list of consumer complaints.  Forty billion dollars dollars.
That's  about $160 out of pocket for every man, woman, and child in this country.
Every year.
Yet not a word on the campaign trail about consumer protection.
With a week left to election day, don't you think it's time we consumers break the silence?

Your  opinions invited.<P>
Until next time,<P>

<FONT color="#000080"><STRONG>TroubleShooter Column:  Reformulated Fuel 2</STRONG><BR></FONT>
<FONT size=2>
<STRONG><EM>11/8/96</EM></STRONG><P>

It's billed as a "friendlier" fuel.
A lifesaver.
It will clean up our air and save lives.
New cleaner burning, reformulated gasoline.
But, is it the friendly breakthrough it's backers claim?
We wonder.
And so do a growing number of consumers.
From drivers to landscapers.
Reformulated gas is beginning to chalk up a lot of complaints.
<P>
We first reported on the new fuel this past summer, when  three inspectors from the California Air Resources Board said half the vehicles they tested with the new fuel developed fuel system leaks.
Seepage, they call it.
The inspectors warned this seepage could contribute to engine fires.
But,  the air resources board left these findings out of the state's final report  on reformulated fuel.
Calling the inspectors' claims an abberation.  That none of the other state inspectors found any seepage.
<P>
While the state of California denies any fuel leak problem, Chevron is the first oil company to post warnings on it's pumps, saying the fuel can create problems in older, high mileage cars.
Now several other oil companies including Exxon and Texaco warn customers to check their fuel systems on a regular basis.
<P>
 While no fire agency or insurance carrier is able to confirm that engine fires are caused by the new fuels,  there's general agreement the gas is hard on rubber parts in the fuel system.
Auto makers have issued recalls to upgrade rubber parts.  Nissan and BMW have recalled hundreds of thousands of cars built between 1989 and 1995.
Last month, Harley Davidson  issued a safety recall of 177,000 motorcycles because fuel valves are seizing up.
<P>
Consumers also complain about lower gas mileage.
While many examples are anectodal,  the new issue of Motorland magazine says mileage with reformulated gas is off 3.8%.
In defense of the new fuel, AAA just announced a survey of 1500 brand new fleet vehicles.  Brand new cars.  Mileage was off one percent.
But some experts say  with new vehicles  mileage should have gone up, by about four percent.
<P>
And the problems don't stop with cars.  Lawnmowers, weedeaters, and  chain saws, all are having problems.
The portable power equipment manufacturers association is complaining.
<P>
As if this isn't enough, many states are now concerned about the new fuel and it's potential affects on health.   New Jersey, Maine, and Connecticut are now taking a closer look at the fuels key ingredient, MTBE: methal tertiary butyl ether, an octane booster.
Breathing these ether vapors could be harmful.
The environmental protection agency says MTBE is a possible carcinogen and deserves more testing.
Alaska and Wyoming aren't waiting for results of federal testing.
They have banned MTBE in their states.
<P>
Many other states are also checking leaking underground gas tanks.
Their concern?  MTBE  doesn't break down easily, and is being found in ground water.
While the California Air Resources Board still denies any problems with this new "friendlier" fuel, California's legislative leaders now promise hearings to investigate the growing list of complaints.
A class action suit has also been filed in California.  To add your name to the list call:  1-800-510-FUEL.<P>

Until next time,<P>

<FONT color="#000080"><STRONG>TroubleShooter Column:  Get Rich at Home</STRONG><BR></FONT>
<FONT size=2>
<STRONG><EM>11/15/96</EM></STRONG><P>

Get rich quick without leaving the comfort of your own home.
That's the come-on.
Make thousands of extra dollars each month.
Stuff envelopes, make crafts, operate vending machines.
The list goes on.
And these tempting pitches come at us from all sides:  the internet, the fax, phone, and mail, on TV infommercials.
Most of them are big money makers, alright.
Money makers for their promoters.
The poor working stiff in Anytown, America winds up losing money, upfront fees ranging anywhere from $30 to $30,OOO, or more.
<P>
These get rich quick, work at home "opportunities" are the hottest scams going.
So hot, the Federal Trade Commission has just cracked down.
With support from state authorities, the FTC is suing promoters in 25 states.
"Operation Missed Fortune" was launched this past summer targeting cons who capitalize on downsizing, the growth of home computers, and other trends .
Frauds who promise "proven" and "lucrative" opportunities to gain financial independence and "be your own boss".
What investigators call false promises.
<P>
Here are a few of the companies targeted in "Operation Missed Fortune."
<UL>
<LI>P.M.C. S., Inc of Great Neck, New York.  "Earn up to $23,000 a year working only 28 minutes a day".  That's the promise.  Just process insurance claims for doctors.  Investigators say they inflated the opportunity and are sued by the FTC, and the states of Florida and Tennessee.
<BR>
<LI>Interlock Service Centers of Victorville, California.  Invest $30,000 on breathalyzers in cars driven by convicted drunk drivers.  Earn a return of $288,000 a year in court referrals.  Not.  The California Department of Corrections drives this case.
<BR> 
<LI>Advantage Marketing of Pocatello, Idaho.  For a one time fee of $38.95 you can earn up to $1000
a week assembling products at home.  Again, that's a big nyet.  What you get are brochures with the names of companies purported to offer work at home jobs, many of which charge $30-$40 for start up kits.
  </UL>
<P>
The Federal Trade Commission says consumers lose tens of millions of dollars to get rich quick business scams every year.
Officials filed 75 actions as part of "Operation Missed Fortune", with more expected in the coming weeks.

Bottom line, don't pay money upfront for a chance to work.
And never give money to people you know based on promises they can't prove beyond doubt.<P>

Until next time,<P>

<FONT color="#000080"><STRONG>TroubleShooter Column:  Sex Claims on the Net</STRONG><BR></FONT>
<FONT size=2>
<STRONG><EM>11/22/96</EM></STRONG><P>

"Have sex with beautiful women and get paid for it."
To find out how, just send $19.95.<P>
Curiosity alone has men across the country reaching into their pockets for money to send away.
This sexy pitch is one of the newest "opportunities" on the internet.
The pitch goes on to say, "There are over 100 companies in most major cities of the united states that have these programs available to you.  These programs are safe and legal," the pitch says.  And they say, "Companies will pay for short term or long term commitment to have sex."
<P>
The viewer who tips us to this cyber come-on wonders if it's inspired by the old  longing, "find a niche and fill it."
Certainly it's inspired by at least one old longing, and  what red-blooded male isn't ready to write a check?
But, before you do, and don't you hate that  word, "but", let's fill in some blanks.
<P>
First we save you twenty bucks, and send away for the offer ourselves.
While we wait for our list of companies that "pay you to have sex with beautiful women", we do a little  snooping.
The company behind this tantalizing offer is new images enterprises out of Orangeburg, South Carolina.
They're promoters in the business of "junkie mail."
That's internet lingo for the  same  solicitations and junk  that come in the mail or by fax.
Only it's a lot cheaper to send.
About 1/1000 the cost of regular bulk mail.
Law enforcement agencies have no records on the company.
No investigations.
The better business bureau  in nearby Columbia, South Carolina, says new images has one outstanding consumer complaint, alleging false advertising.
<P>
As to this advertising claim, promising "a list of companies, requirements, exact pay rate.  Order now.  It's fun, easy, and the pay is great."
So, what do we get for our $19.95?
A cheap photocopied booklet.
New 1996 release, "Confidential Report.  Directory of Official U.S.A. Paid Programs."
Ages 18-66 years, it says.  Nationwide search, all races , privacy assured.
The headlines all jumbled up on the first page of this packet.
"Earn up to $1000/mo.," it goes on to say.
<P>
It's not until we turn the book over that we finally get the punch line.
What we've  paid $19.95 to learn.
Want to get paid to have sex with beautiful women?
This little booklet gives the names of more than one hundred sperm banks and donor-paid sperm bank programs in the united states.
Including fees paid donors, payment schedule, age limits, educational requirements, length of commitment, and program guidelines.
Admit it, in your heart you knew this  pitch was too good to be true.
And watch, there are copycats.
<P>
With that, have a wonderful Thanksgiving holiday.

<P>

Until next time,<P>

<FONT size=2>
<STRONG><EM>11/22/96</EM></STRONG><P>
<STRONG>Happy Holidays.</STRONG>
'Tis the season to be jolly.
'Tis also the season to wary of holiday scams.
Charity scams mainly,  banking on our generous holiday spirits.<P>
Emotional pleas tend to tug harder on the heartstrings this time of year.
And scammers know it.
They usually contact us by phone, claiming to raise money for aids, burned children, the homeless, or police and fire agencies.
The list goes on.
Their pitch may vary, but the closer is usually the same:  
Write us a check today, and  we'll  send someone by to pick it up.
Just leave it under the mat, they say.
It's convenient.  Too convenient.
This approach is a  definite tip-off to a rip-off.
Legitimate charities don't use couriers.
Most even steer clear of telemarketing.
It's gotten such a bad name in recent years.
So, be suspicious of anyone who calls claiming to raise money for charity.<P>

<B>The better business bureau gives us some other tips:</B><P>
<UL>
<LI>
Some questionable charities operate under names that are very similar to legitimate charities.  So be leery of charities that use the words veterans, children, aids, widows, orphans, and animals in their names.

<LI>
Always ask for printed material so you can evaluate the charity.
Brochures and other solicitation material should include a clear description of how funds are spent.  And solicitors should reveal their relationship to the charity.
<LI>
Carefully investigate an organization before you give.
<LI>
Beware of hard-sell tactics.
<LI>
Don't give your credit card number  to a solicitor over the phone.
<LI>
Check with your local better business bureau before you write a check.
</UL>
<P>
<STRONG>Our best and simplest advice:</STRONG>  give only to charities you know.
Charities doing visible work in your community.
Donations don't always have to be cash, either.  
They can  be food or clothing, furniture or supplies.
And the greatest donation of all is your time as a volunteer.
Especially during the holiday season. 
Nothing feels quite as good as giving of yourself to those in need.
<P>
<STRONG><EM><CENTER>'Tis the season.</EM></STRONG><BR>
<EM><STRONG><CENTER>And from all of us on the Troubleshooter crew, may this holiday season be a joyous one for you and yours.</CENTER></STRONG></EM>

Privacy.
It's one of the last frontiers.
But, it's being whittled away daily.
Apply for a credit card we wind up on a mailing list.
Subscribe to a magazine we land in a data base.
Information about us is bought and sold like a commodity.
And we have no control over who has access to our personal information.<P>

This problem is becoming common knowledge.
Most of us know we must guard our personal information.
To insulate ourselves from unwanted sales pitches.
To protect ourselves from unsavory telemarketers or other cons.
And worse yet, we must guard our personal information so thieves don't use it to steal our identities.<P>
Identity theft and related fraud cost business billions of dollars each year and create a nightmare for the consumer whose identity is stolen.
The problem is so vexing and so costly, state legislatures across the country have enacted privacy laws,  reigning in business and the way it wheels and deals with personal information.
Returning more control to consumers.
So, you'd think government would be especially sensitive in the way "it" handles our personal information.
But, think again.<P>
Tax booklets are now arriving in mailboxes across the country.
Helping taxpayers get an early start filing their returns.
But California taxpayers are waking up to a surprise.
Printed above their name and address on the mailing label is one of the most sensitive pieces of private information.
Our social security number.
A peel off label, right there on the booklet  cover, for all to see and steal.
Consumers are properly outraged, and calling the California Franchise Tax Board for answers.
The state says these labels are a matter of convenience and economy.
Privacy advocates say they are a matter of negligence.
And at least one California State Senator, Steve Peace of San Diego, says he will personally take on the tax agency to stop the practice of displaying taxpayer I.D. numbers on mailing labels.
<P>
Is California alone?
Is your state exposing your social security number?
We're all ears, and right here on the net.
We'd like to hear from you.<P>

Until next time,<P>

<FONT color="#000080"><STRONG>TroubleShooter Column:  Medical Fraud</STRONG><BR></FONT>
<FONT size=2>
<STRONG><EM>1/10/97</EM></STRONG><P>


Quack....quack...quack.
<P>
Medical quackery has been around since the beginning of recorded history.  It's a fair bet that anything we grow or make will eventually land in somebody's medical stew.
<P>
Whether it's herbs and potions for impotency.  Or machines that cure our damaged souls.  We are a Ponce de Leon society in search of the fountain of youth.  A quick fix culture looking for instant relief to the aches and pains  often caused by over-indulgent lives.  It is just such a mentality that breathes life into the "snake oil" industry, and keeps it going.
<P>
For every quack needs quackees to make business thrive.  And according to the National Council Against Medical Fraud, quackery is thriving.  It's bigger, better funded, with more "quackees" than ever before.
<P>
Dr. William Jarvis runs the non-profit council against medical fraud based in Loma Linda, California.  He's been chasing quacks for the last 30 years.  Dr. Jarvis says the biggest influence on the quackery of the 1990's is the boom in multi-level marketing.
<P>
These marketing networks sell mineral tonics, overpriced vitamins, magnets, and other products of dubious value to customers who want to believe and want to make money.
<P>
Jarvis says seven million Americans are now selling alternative health products on the multi-level market.  And he says their products are sheer quackery.  But, he says these are the toughest people to convince.
<P>
First, they are often blinded by greed.  Secondly, many are simply uninformed.
"We can't even teach kids to read and write, so it's no wonder most adults are uneducated about health care," says Jarvis.
<P>
But, these quackees often go beyond ignorance.  They buy into conspiracy theories that the fda and ama are somehow  in cahoots, trying to quash so-called "natural medicine."
<P>
Not true says Jarvis.   "Nobody's that smart.  Not even the FDA and the AMA."
Consequently, you have legions of disciples across the country selling and spreading false health information.
<P>
This is the message Dr. Jarvis wants to spread through his non-profit council.
Based on the campus of the Loma Linda University Medical School, Dr. Jarvis teaches public health and ethics, and invites questions from the public and challenges from critics.
<P>
Jarvis says quackery isn't limited to the disciples of multi-level potions.  It can be found in health food stores and among the remedies that line drug store shelves.
And Jarvis says there's no eliminating quackery.  But, he'll be satisfied if he can make a dent.
<P>
That means help the public make health care choices based on proven, scientific fact rather than empty promises.
<P>


Until next time,<P>

<STRONG>TroubleShooter Column:  A Quick Buck</STRONG><BR>

<STRONG><EM>1/17/97</EM></STRONG><P>

Want to pick up a few extra bucks?  We've got some suggestions.  Make money without breaking a sweat.  As easy as chewing gum or playing a video game.Literally.
<P>
Research firms are always on the lookout for consumers eager to test products.  Usually firms scout shopping malls for candidates .
Take for example, the chewing gum.
A tester is asked to sit for 15 minutes sampling various chewing gums.  Just sit and chew, and the rate the gums. To keep the test honest, between gums the tester rinses his mouth with crackers and water.  Then, chewed out, the volunteer answers a few questions about taste and texture.  
<P>
That's it.  Collects five dollars for 15 minutes work, and he's on his way.  That easy.  And in an increasingly competitive marketplace, this research is becoming more valuable.
Results are passed on  to manufacturers to use in product development and marketing.
If you have the itch to test products you don't necessarily have to wait for a survey team to find you at the mall.
<P>
Call them.  In San Diego, Roseanne Luth of Luth Research says she is happy to sign up volunteers.
But, be prepared to answer some personal questions.  Your age, occupation, income, and so forth.  Research firms use these profiles to find the right testers for each product.  To contact Luth Research call 619-516-7829.
<P>
And another way to pick up easy pocket change is to watch ads on the Internet.  Yes, advertisers are actually willing to pay consumers to watch their commercials.  
A new interactive ad campaign will be on-line this spring, offering consumers a chance to make extra cash and advertisers a chance to reach their target market.
<P>
Cybergold is the company behind this novel idea.  They're just now fine-tuning their service.  When it's up and rolling, consumers will be invited to sign on.  Cybergold will compile consumer profiles that help advertisers decide what ads you'll see.  Then you just watch, and collect.
Oh yes, there is a catch.  You have to pay attention to get paid.  There's a quiz at the end of each ad.
Answer right and you'll hit goldCybergold.
This new program goes on-line this spring but you can sign up now.
<P>
The Web address:   <a href="http://www.cybergold.com">www.cybergold.com</a>.

Until next time,<P>

<STRONG>TroubleShooter Column:  Snooze You Lose</STRONG><BR>
<STRONG><EM>1/24/97</EM></STRONG><P>
It's one of the best tools we have to keep tabs on the health of our credit profile.  To head off credit reporting problems or inaccuracies on reports.  And it's our best defense against fraud;  identification and credit fraud that are sweeping the nation.
<P>
This tool is your credit report.  You know, that long listing of your credit accounts, your payment history.  All the good and all the bad.  For the past five years your credit report has been free, compliments of TRW.
<P>
But, that is about to end.  As of March 1, 1997, consumers will once again be required to pay for their TRW report.  By the way, it's no longer TRW.  It's Experian, a group of information businesses that used to be owned by TRW, inc.  Since April 1992,  Experian has been the only credit reporting company to offer free credit reports to consumers nationwide.
Experian has mailed five million complimentary reports.
But, it's just getting too expensive.  Experian CEO E. Van Skilling says, "when introduced, the complimentary credit report was a genuine demonstration of our public commitment.  Today, needs have changed and, increasingly, the cost of continuing the offer has become a significant competitive disadvantage".
<P>
Why a disadvantage?
First, the free reports are often used by credit repair companies.  Their tactics include challenging every piece of negative information on a credit report.  And Experian has been getting the lion's share of this credit clinic "business", because of the consumer's free access to their credit report.
<P>
Experian also cites a lack of public insistence that other companies offer free credit reports.  A spokeswoman says Experian was shooting itself in the foot.  That the complimentary report has become a casualty of abuse and competition.
Not to say consumers are not entitled to free reports in some circumstances.  The fair credit reporting act says if consumers are denied credit they are entitled to see their credit report.
<P>
An annual report is free if a consumer certifies they are out of work and looking for a job, receiving public assistance, or believe their credit file contains inaccuracies as a result of fraud.
Otherwise, you've got to pay to play, as they say.  Experian reports will cost anywhere from $2.00 in Maine, to $8.00 in California, and $8.50 in Texas.
But, Experian.....slash TRW....reports are free now.  Until March 1.
<P>
To find out how to get a copy of your credit report call Experian at 1-800-682-7654.  Or dial them up on the Internet:  www.experian.com.
The company is geared up for extra business, anticipating smart consumers will want to beat that March 1 deadline.
Remember, you snooze you lose.
<P>


Until next time,<P>

<STRONG>TroubleShooter Column:  Welcome to the Net</STRONG><BR>
<STRONG><EM>2/4/97</EM></STRONG><P>
Welcome to the Net.  Ready to make money?  A lot of money?
We'll show you how you can rake in big bucks on the Internet with any product, service, or package of information. 
You can work from your office, your home, or the beach, for that matter.
We'll show you how.  We'll even sell you a piece of our action. 
All it will cost you is two days in a classroom and, oh yes,  $3000.  Upfront.<P>

Sound familiar?   It should.  Afterall, the Internet is an entrepeneur's dream.  
We can't even begin to count the number of promoters hawking their Internet seminars in cities from coast to coast or pitching their classes on Internet billboards and chat lines.  The rush to riches on the Internet is the gold rush to end all gold rushes.
<P>
But before you hand over your money,  remember all that glitters is not gold.
And some promoters will attempt to blind you with their glittering promises just to cash in on your gold.
Here's some advice from the Federal Trade Commission.
Never invest without doing your homework.
The F.T.C. requires promoters of a franchise or business opportunity to provide prospective buyers detailed disclosure documents at the time of the offering.  And the promoter must give you at least ten days before you pay any money or legally commit yourself to a purchase.   That gives you time to study the offering or use the documents to shop around.
<P>
The documents include:
<UL>
<li>
The names, addresses, and telephone numbers of other purchasers.<li>
A fully-audited financial statement of the seller.<li>
The background an experience of the business's key executives.<li>
The cost of starting and maintaining a business.<li>
The responsibilities you and seller will have to each other once you've bought.
</UL><P>
The F.T.C. says if the seller doesn't give you a disclosure document, ask why.
Some sellers are not required to provide a disclosure document.  If a franchise or business
opportunity seller says it's not covered by the these rules, verify it with the F.T.C., an attorney, or a business advisor.  Even if the business is not legally required to provide a disclosure document, you still may want one for your own information.
Once you receive documents be sure you study them thoroughly.  Talk to owners and  other investors.  Investigate claims about potential earnings.  Get all promises in writing.  Get professional advice.  And shop around.  
<P>
Every year the U.S. Department of Commerce publishes a list of more than 1,400 companies that offer franchises.
It's called the Franchise Opportunity Handbook.   It could be a terrific idea book and good for comparison shopping.
No doubt there is big money to be made on the Internet.
There is also big money to be lost.  Stay out of the loser's column.  Do your homework.  And remember business opportunities that seem too good to be true usually are.
<P>


Until next time,<P>

<STRONG>TroubleShooter Column:  Finding a Good Mechanic</STRONG><BR>
<STRONG><EM>2.7.97</EM></STRONG><P>

How do you find a good mechanic?  Talk about your $64,000 question.  We've been asking this question since the first Model T rolled off the assemblyline.  And now Alfred, one our Internet surfers asks the Troubleshooter for tips.
<P>
Let's see, where do we start?  Do you take your car to the dealer, an independent shop, or the corner service station?
<P>
Wherever you go to, make sure they're properly licensed with local and state authorities.
Beyond that, opinions vary depending on who you ask.
<P>
To answer Alfred's question, I'll refer to the Consumer's Bible.  A terrific consumer guide written by Mark Green, a longtime consumer advocate.
<P>
The Bible says the shop you choose should hit your purpose.
<P>
<STRONG>Dealers:</STRONG>  Your best choice for warranty work.  While non-warranty work may cost more, the dealer's mechanics have been trained to understand thoroughly your car's quirks.  And, writes Green, dealers are often the only convenient supplier of the diagnostic equipment necessary to understand bugs in your car's complex computer system.
<P>
<STRONG>Specialty/Franchise/Department Stores:</STRONG>  Often the best for routine maintenance.  Service is usually fast and convenient and prices reasonable.  But, these chains may specialize in a particular service and have little knowledge about other systems in your car.
<P>
<STRONG>Independents: </STRONG> Can be a  good  and convenient choice for personal service and routine maintenance.  Service and price vary. Choose a shop based on the kind of repair you need.
<P>
With that, shop around.  Find a garage with credentials.  The AAA has rigorous standards and guarantees their work for AAA members.  Look for certification by the National Institute for Automotive Excellence.  It's not a guarantee, but it tells you the mechanics have more experience than the average, with expertise in various areas of repairs.
<P>
Look the shop over.  Is it clean?  Is it organized?  Does it have the latest in diagnostic equipment?
<P>
When all else fails, don't discount the importance of good old word of mouth.  Ask friends and co-workers where they get their repairs done.  Are they happy?
<P>
And when you finally pick the mechanic who's right for you, stick with them.  As long as they do right by you.

<P>


Until next time,<P>

<FONT SIZE=2><STRONG>AMANDA'S HEALTHY TIPS FOR THE WEEK OF 8/12/96.</FONT></STRONG><P>
<STRONG>KEEP IT SIMPLE AND SWEET WITH SOFT FRUIT.</STRONG><P>

<STRONG><EM>How to ripen peaches, nectarines and plums at home with just a paper bag...</EM></STRONG><P>

Soft fruits are generally picked mature, but not ripe.  This is done so that the fruit can withstand shipping.  Unlike melons, soft fruits like these will continue to ripen after they have been picked.  You can speed up this process at home by placing the fruit in a paper bag. <P> 

The paper bag works by trapping a natural ripening gas called ethylene.  This is a natural gas that is found in soft fruit as well as mangoes, bananas and kiwifruit.  Be sure to check the bag daily-you don't want the fruit to become overripe.  The fruit is ready to eat when is has a sweet aroma and yields to gentle pressure along the seam.
<P>
Color on a peach or nectarine does not dictate flavor or sweetness.  Different varieties have different amounts of what is called "blush", the red coloring against a yellow background.  The color variations come only from different varieties and growing areas.
<P>
<STRONG>PEACHES</STRONG><BR> are a sweet and healthy treat with only 70 calories per serving, (about 2 medium sized peaches), no fat, no sodium and no cholesterol.  They are a good sources of vitamins A and C and contain dietary fiber.<p>
<STRONG>NECTARINES</STRONG><BR> are also healthy with 1 gram of fat per serving, (about 1 medium sized nectarine), no sodium and no cholesterol.  They too are a good source for vitamins A and C, and contain 3 grams of dietary fiber.<p>
<STRONG>PLUMS</STRONG><BR> too have 1 gram of fat per serving, (about 2 medium sized plums), no sodium, and no cholesterol.  They are high in vitamin C.<p>
<STRONG>GRAPES</STRONG> <BR>A sweet summer treat that is easy and healthy is frozen grapes.  Simply wash and stem your favorite variety of grape, lay them on a cookie sheet covered with wax paper and freeze!  Place them in the freezer for about an hour, (till they are hard), and serve immediately.  You can also store them in a zip-lock freezer bag for later.  Grapes have about 85 calories per 1 1/2 cup serving, no fat, no cholesterol, and no sodium.<P>

<STRONG>HOW TO PICK A GOOD MELON</STRONG><BR>
With the vast variety of melons available it is hard enough to choose what kind to buy, let alone which one is best for eating right away.
<P>
The easiest way to select any melon for eating right away is to buy cut melons from the produce department.  Your produce manager selects ready to eat melons daily and cuts them for selling.  You'll pay a few more cents a pound, but it eliminates the risk of buying an unripe melon.
<P>
You can follow some rules for almost any melon.  When selecting a cantaloupe, for example, be sure it has good "netting" or "webbing" on the rind.  A ripe melon will also yield to gentle pressure at the ends.  A sweet aroma is also a good sign of a ripe melon.  When selecting a melon that will sit for a few days, make sure the stem end has a smooth dimple or depression where the vine broke clean from the melon.  If a melon is picked too early in the field, the vine will not separate easily.  When this happens part of the vine is still attached to the stem end of the melon.  
<P>
Always avoid melons with soft spots, or bruising on the rind or melons with large gashes.
<P>
When selecting a watermelon, see if the produce manager has any cut melons on display.  If so, look for melons with full color and dark seeds.  The melon does not need to be bright red to be sweet, meat color will vary depending on the variety.  To do the "thump test" on a watermelon, simply cup your palm and "thump" the watermelon.  If you hear a hollow sound, the melon is good.  
<P>
If you are still unsure about selecting the perfect melons for you and your family, don't hesitate to ask someone in the produce department for help.
<P>
<STRONG>NUTRITION</STRONG><BR>
A 3.5oz. serving of Crenshaw or Persian melon has about 31 calories and contains about 100% of the U.S.R.D.A. of vitamin A and 80% of the R.D.A. of vitamin C.  The same size serving of Casaba has 26 calories and 30% of the R.D.A. of vitamin C.  Cantaloupe has about 50calories per serving, (1/4 of a melon), and 80% of both vitamins A and C.  These melons have no fat, sodium or cholesterol.
<P>
Because of growing popularity, mangoes are available almost all year round, but because of growing cycles, supplies and varieties do change.
<P>
The most recognized mangoes are those with bright red, yellow, and orange colors-like the Haden and Tommy Akins varieties.  However, color doesn't dictate flavor or ripeness in all varieties.
<P>
The Kent variety, which is what was featured on the segment, is what most stores are currently offering.  This variety  can be completely ripe, but still green.  The fruit is ready to eat when it emits a fruity aroma and yields to gentle pressure.
<P>
When a mango is eaten fresh, it has approximately 70 calories, 1/2 a gram of fat, 17 grams of carbohydrates, and is high in vitamins A and C.  It is also a good source of dietary fiber.
<P>
Pinhead sized black spots on a mango are not defects.  Theses spots are actually a common characteristic on many varieties of mangoes.
<P>

<P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<STRONG>HULA PASTA</STRONG><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<EM><STRONG>For something fresh and healthy, try this recipe. <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It takes about a 1/2 hour to prepare...</STRONG></EM><P>

<UL>
<LI>A family sized portion of pasta-preferably fusili or rotelle<BR>
<LI>1 cup of fresh or canned cubed pineapple<BR>
<LI>1 pint of fresh sliced strawberries<BR>
<LI>1 small Red Lady Mexican papaya, (peeled, seeded and cubed)<BR>
<LI>1 kiwifruit (peeled and sliced)<BR>
<LI>1 mango (peeled and cubed)<BR>
<LI>a bed of your favorite lettuce<P>
</UL>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<STRONG>ALMOND DRESSING</STRONG><BR>
<UL>
<LI TYPE=CIRCLE>1/2 of a sweet onion<BR>
<LI TYPE=circle>1 tablespoon papaya seeds<BR>
<LI TYPE=circle>1/4 cup sugar<BR>
<LI TYPE=circle>1/2 teaspoon dry mustard<BR>
<LI TYPE=circle>A dash of salt<BR>
<LI TYPE=circle>1/4 cup tarragon vinegar<BR>
<LI TYPE=circle>1/4 cup almond oil</UL>
<P>
	
Blend all the above dressing ingredients in a blender or food processor except the almond oil.  
Use the pulsing speed to blend.  Add the almond oil slowly and gradually blend.
<P>


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<STRONG>GLORIOUS GARLIC</STRONG><P>

Garlic is by far one of the most popular flavors in food.  Across the world you will find garlic being used in every way, shape and form.  <P>

Aside from it's wonderful flavor and aroma, garlic has many health benefits.  Alliin, an amino acid found in garlic, is known to kill viruses, fungi, and various bacteria.  It has been said by doctors that alliin also aids in respiratory ailments, cardiovascular problems and arthritis.  Many also believe that garlic can take the credit for lowering the "bad" LDL-cholesterol while raising the level of HDL or "good" cholesterol.  Garlic also thins the blood and lowers triglyceride levels.  Garlic contains no fat or sodium and only 5 calories per clove.  For those of you who are looking for and effective way to take your daily dose of garlic without smelling like it, look in Boney's vitamin department for some wonderful supplements.  As added protection, munch on some fresh parsley after eating garlic or taking tablets.<P>

Heat and handling affect the potency of garlic.  Raw garlic is stronger in flavor than cooked garlic.  The longer garlic cooks, the more delicate it's flavor becomes.  Whole cloves and large pieces give off a more gentle flavor than cut, minced, or chopped garlic.  When cooking garlic, be sure to watch it carefully.  It can burn and when it does it's flavor becomes bitter.<P>

Peeled garlic can be bought, but it can be expensive.  You can peel your own garlic at home by simply "mashing" the clove with the flat end of a butter knife.  Once mashed, you take the tip off with your nail, and the skin peels right off.<P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<STRONG>GARLIC MASHED POTATOES</STRONG>.<BR>
To add a new twist to the dinner table, try garlic mashed potatoes.  Make your favorite mashed potato recipe.  Roast 4 large cloves of garlic in tin foil at 425 degrees for 20-25 minutes, (until soft).  Cut off one of the ends of each clove and squeeze the pulp into the potatoes.  Mix well with 2 tablespoons fresh minced parsley.  Salt and pepper to taste.  Serve warm or cold.  <P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<STRONG>ADDED TIPS</STRONG><BR>
Top the left over mashed potatoes with cheddar cheese and bake till the cheese it just starting to brown.  Serve hot for tasty baked cheese potatoes.<P>
<P>
To keep your mashed potatoes as healthy as possible, try adding 1/2 cup light sour cream or light cottage cheese and 1/2 cup 1% or skim milk instead of butter.<P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<STRONG>DID YOU KNOW</STRONG><BR>
Horse racers used to cover the bridal of their horse with garlic.  They felt the smell would prevent other horses from passing.<P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<STRONG>HEALTHY PIZZA</STRONG><BR>
Every kid loves pizza, so next time they want pizza you can say no problem.  Best of all the pizza will be healthy and 
done in less time than it takes to order delivery.<P>

Buy a ready made pizza crust.  Boney's has several available.  Keep one in the house, these crusts can be kept in your freezer until you're ready to use them.  
Top with your favorite pizza or marinara sauce, (again, keep a jar in the pantry for convenience), 
fresh slices of tomato and your families favorite cheese.  Keep it tasty and nutritious by adding more vegetables
 like squash, mushrooms, peppers and onions. <P>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<STRONG>ADDED TIP</STRONG><BR>
 Stir fry the squash, mushrooms, onions, and peppers, (or whatever veggies you prefer),
  in olive oil, balsamic vinegar, and fresh chopped garlic.  To keep your homemade pizza as healthy as possible, 
I recommend using reduced fat cheeses and fresh grated Parmesan cheese. Too cook simply follow the directions on the 
ready made pizza crust.

<FONT SIZE=2><STRONG>AMANDA'S HEALTHY TIPS FOR THE WEEK OF 8/26/96.</FONT></STRONG><P>
<STRONG>VEGGIE KABOBS FOR YOUR LABOR DAY BBQ.</STRONG>
<P>
Tired of the same old BBQ food.  The traditional meals can really make it tough on those of us that are health conscience.  For something easy, tasty and healthy for your Labor Day BBQ, try barbqueing your vegetables!

Marinate your favorite vegetables like asparagus, potatoes, onion, peppers, egg plant, mushrooms, and squash, in your favorite low fat or fat free Italian style dressing and lay on the BBQ!  It makes for a great tasting and healthy new way to eat your vegetables!

Be sure to lay veggies against the direction of the BBQ grates so the vegetables don't fall in.  If you have skewers, simply stack your vegetables on them, baste with your dressing and BBQ that way.  Marinated skinless chicken breast chunks make a great addition to your veggie kabob.

Don't forget that Boney's has locally grown white corn for your BBQ.  The corn is grown in our own San Pasquel Valley, (by the Wild Animal Park), and delivered to the stores daily.  <P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<STRONG>TOMATOES</STRONG><BR>
Probably the most important thing I can say about tomatoes is <I>DON'T REFRIGERATE THEM</I>.  Refrigerating tomatoes stops the ripening process and doesn't' let the full flavor come through.  If you have to refrigerate them because you don't plan on using them for some time, take them out of the refrigerator at least 1 hour before serving.  This will help.  If you buy tomatoes that are on the green side, you can ripen them at home by leaving them on the counter in a brown paper bag for a few days, (yep-just like soft fruit-the ethylene ripens the fruit!).  Tomatoes are delicate, so keep them stored stem side up to prevent bruising.  A ripe tomato will be slightly soft and have a full red color.  (I guess I should mention again that ethylene is a ripening gas produced by a wide variety of fruits.  Some other fruits that produce their own ethylene include bananas, mangoes, kiwifruit, nectarines, and peaches).<P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<STRONG>ADDITIONAL TIP</STRONG><BR>
To peel tomatoes, boil them for about 30 seconds, cool and peel skins off with a sharp knife.  You can also douse the hot tomatoes under cold water for easy skin removal.

Tomatoes are a tasty and healthy addition to any meal.  They are low in fat, sodium free, (less than 5mg sodium per 85g tomato), cholesterol free, only about 35 calories per medium tomato, and a good source of vitamins A and C.

Some quick tomato creations include salsa, guacamole, stir fry, sauces, salads, soups...baked, broiled, or microwave with crushed basil and grated Parmesan cheese.<P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<STRONG>DID YOU KNOW?</STRONG><BR>
 Despite the fact that half the world was eating tomatoes, for many years tomatoes were considered poisonous on the Americas side of the Atlantic because they belong to the deadly nightshade family, which includes belladonna and mandrake, both of which are quite toxic.  The earliest record of tomatoes being grown in the Americas wasn't' until after the Declaration of Independence.  History records show that the poison theory was finally disproved when a brave man named Robert Gibbon Johnson stood on the courthouse steps in Salem, N.J., in 1820 and ate a tomato-and lived to tell about it.<P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<STRONG>STUFFED TOMATOES</STRONG><BR>
You can actually stuff a tomato with almost anything you would like, however the following is one of my favorite ways.  Enjoy!<P>

<UL>
<LI>4 medium to large tomatoes<BR>
<LI>1 cup boiled creamer size red potatoes, cubed<BR>
<LI>1/2 cup cooked petite green peas, (preferably frozen)<BR>
<LI>1 cup tuna, drained-(if you prefer, use 1 cup skinless cooked chicken breast).<BR>
<LI>1 tbsp. chopped fresh tarragon<BR>
<LI>2 tbsp. capers<BR>
<LI>1/2 cup extra virgin olive oil<BR>
<LI>1 cup balsamic vinegar<BR>
<LI>1 head radicchio<P>
</UL>
Core the tomatoes so they make a shell for the stuffing.  Keep the pulp from the tomatoes.  You'll need to crop the pulp up and add it later.  Lightly salt the inside of each tomato and allow them to drain for at least 15 min.  Add the peas, tuna (or chicken), tarragon, capers, and tomato pulp.  Add pepper enough to taste.  Add half of the oil and vinegar and toss well.  (If the mixture seems to dry, and more oil and vinegar in equal parts).  Stuff the tomatoes with the mixture, and serve on a bed of fresh radicchio leaves and top with any left over dressing.<P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<STRONG>POTATOES</STRONG><BR>
When selecting the perfect potato, avoid ones with wrinkled or wilted skins, cut surfaces, sprouts, soft dark areas or those with a green appearance. 

Potatoes are naturally fat free, sodium free, (contains less than 5mg sodium per 85g potato), cholesterol free and they are high in vitamin C and potassium.  They also contain 2g of dietary fiber, nician, B6, only 120 calories, and 27g of carbohydrates.  It is because of all the healthful goodness in potatoes that they have become increasingly popular.

Potatoes have often been thought of as fattening because of the toppings.  Just one tablespoon of butter will double the number of calories in a baked potato.  Here are some healthy, low calorie topping ideas...<P>
	<UL>
<LI TYPE=CIRCLE>Stewed tomatoes and a bit of grated cheese<BR>
	<LI TYPE=CIRCLE>Cottage cheese<BR>
	<LI TYPE=CIRCLE>Chive-spiked yogurt<BR>
	<LI TYPE=CIRCLE>Salsa<BR>
	<LI TYPE=CIRCLE>Sweet baby peas and light sour cream
</UL><P>

Potatoes can be cooked quickly in a microwave.  It takes about 8-10min for 1 medium russet to cook.  Simply stab the potato with a fork on each flat side.  Microwave for 4-5 min., turn over and cook for an additional 4-5 min.  The potato is done when you can easily pierce it with a fork.<P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<STRONG>DID YOU KNOW?</STRONG><BR>
Inca Indians from Peru were the first know people to cultivate potatoes, in about 200 B.C.  
They used potatoes for many things other than eating.  Raw slices were placed on broken bones,
 they were carried to prevent rheumatism and they were also believed to prevent indigestion.  
The Incas also used potatoes to measure time-correlation units of time by how long it took a potato to cook. 
 Another interesting fact is that French chemist Louis Lumiere used microscopic grains of potato starch fixed on glass 
plates to create the first autochromes, which were widely used until the development of color film in the 1940's.
<P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<STRONG>SPLASH SALAD</STRONG><BR>

<UL>
<LI>1 lb creamer potatoes, (try to combine reds, whites, and golds for best color).<BR>
<LI>1 red bell pepper, sliced and roasted<BR>
<LI>1 yellow bell pepper, sliced and roasted<BR>
<LI>1 1/2 tspn. extra virgin olive oil<BR>
<LI>2 tspn. white wine vinegar<BR>
<LI>1 tbsp. finely chopped fresh chives<BR>
<LI>approx 4 cups, (or one package),  of fresh spring mix
</UL>
<P>

Boil the creamer potatoes until tender, (you should be able to easily pierce them with a fork).  
Once the potatoes have cooled enough to handle, quarter them and toss them in with all the other
 ingredients except the spring mix.  Mix the combination until everything is evenly distributed. 
 Serve warm on top of a bed of spring mix.

<STRONG>THOSE MYSTERY ITEMS....</STRONG><BR>
While shopping in Boney's recently I had several people approach me asking me about various items in the produce department.  Here is a quick summary of these items. I hope you find the information to be helpful!<P>

<STRONG>CHAYOTE SQUASH.</STRONG>  It is also called the vegetable pear because of its shape and size.  Chayote has a crisp, pale flesh and tastes like a combination between a cucumber and Italian Squash.  Preparation tips include peeling the skin like an apple and using it as a vegetable by steaming, baking, stuffing or frying.  Personally, I leave the skin on, quarter the squash, steam it and top it with lemon pepper and fresh grated Parmesan cheese!  Give it a try, I think you'll like it.<P>

<STRONG>RHUBARB.</STRONG> I grew up in Upstate New York where rhubarb grew wild so I am no stranger to this vegetable, (yes, it is a vegetable).  Aside from baking rhubarb in pies, try dicing it up fresh and topping with cream and sugar.  Cherry rhubarb is the wild variety I grew up with, strawberry rhubarb is grown during the off season in greenhouses.  When raw, it has a very tart taste.  Don't eat the leaves of a rhubarb stalk-they are poisonous in large quantities.  <P>

<STRONG>AUSTRALIAN NAVEL ORANGES.</STRONG> Several people expressed concern that these navel oranges would be dry because they are shipped from Australia.  NOT TRUE.  These are a special treat and they are wonderful.  At a time of the year when all the oranges have seeds, and new crop citrus from the United States hasn't started yet, these navels are a welcome sight!  They should be around for another 6 weeks or so.  Take a chance and try them.  Trust me-they are sweet and juicy.<P>

<STRONG>NEW CROP CALIFORNIA APPLES ARE IN !</STRONG>  And boy are they wonderful!  This is the time of year when, instead of coming out of storage cooler, the apples are fresh, sweet crisp and oh so yummy!
California is the 3rd largest apple growing state in our country.  We began planting apples during the late 1800's.  Apples have been recorded in biblical history as far back as Adam and Eve.  Other countries have apple legends and folklore that date back to the Trojan War.  As a matter of fact, some people may not realize that the great American folk hero, John Chapman or "Johnny Appleseed, " was a real live person.  He was known for his mystical love of nature and his love and respect for all of mankind.  He traveled the western frontier lands in the 1800's.  Johnny Appleseed planted apple orchards and taught farmers apple culture, wanting to provide the "best of fruit for the coming generation.".  It was these farmers than dubbed him "Johnny Appleseed".
There are over 7,500 known varieties of apples in the world.  About 2,500 varieties are grown here in the United States.  Nearly 100 varieties are grown commercially in the Untied States, but a total of 15 popular varieties accounts for over 90% of production!
Apples contain only .5g of fat, are saturated fat-free, and have been reported by some doctors to help reduce some cancers.  Apples are also sodium free, high in fiber, cholesterol free and are high in complex carbohydrates.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<STRONG>SUMMER COOLER SALAD</STRONG>
<P><UL>
<LI>2  medium size Granny Smith apples<BR>
<LI>2  cups watermelon cubes<BR>
<LI>1  cup seedless grapes or pared and cubed pear<BR>
<LI>1 orange, peeled and sliced<BR>
<LI>1 cup berries<BR>
<LI>2 cups chilled ginger ale<BR>
<LI>2 tablespoons lime juice<BR>
</UL>	Core apples and cut into bite-size pieces, toss with remaining fruit.  combine ginger ales and lime juice.  Pour over fruits.  Serve immediately.  Makes 6-8 servings.  Each serving contains approx. 100 calories<P>

<STRONG>CALIFORNIA APPLE SNACKS</STRONG>
<P>

Just cut your favorite apple variety crosswise to make rings, (cut out the small area that may have some core or seeds). Top a toasted English muffin half with a slice of your favorite cheese and microwave on high long enough for the cheese to melt.  Top with the apple slices, and fill the center of the apple slice with low fat cottage cheese, cherry tomatoes, or just sprinkle with cinnamon!<P>

Also try cut apples in wedges. 
 Eat wedges sprinkled with cinnamon and sugar. 
 Also try dipping them in honey, peanut butter or caramel for a special treat. 
 Also try tolling the wedges in coconut or cornflake crumbs, or wrapped in cheese or ham slices. 
 There are lots of wonderful caramel and peanut butter apple dips available, (some are even fat free!). <I>Enjoy !

<FONT SIZE=2><STRONG>AMANDA'S HEALTHY TIPS FOR THE WEEK OF 9/9/96.</FONT></STRONG><P>


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<STRONG>BAKED APPLES</STRONG>
<UL>
<LI>6 large tart apples (preferably Granny Smiths or Pippins)<BR> 
<LI>1/2 cup raisins or currents<BR>
<LI>1/3 cup mild honey<BR>
<LI>ground cinnamon,  ground nutmeg, ground all spice to taste<BR>
<LI>apple juice or cider <BR>
<LI>1 3" cinnamon stick<BR>
<LI>1/2 cup plain non-fat yogurt (optional)
</UL>
<P>

	Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Core the apples from the top, not cutting all the way throughout the bottom, but cutting it in a cone shape so you have a large hole in the top that narrows at the bottom.  Fill each cavity with raisins and currents and drizzle in some honey, (not quite a tablespoon per apple).  Sprinkle with cinnamon, nutmeg and allspice.  
	Butter a baking dish and put the apples in it with the open end of the cone up.  Pour apple juice or cider into the pan so the pan is half full.  Place a stick of cinnamon in the cider.  Bake in the preheated oven for about 45 minutes.  basting the apples every 15 minutes. with the apple juice.  Serve warm or at room temperature.  If you wish, garnish with a dollop of the yogurt.
<P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<STRONG>COOKING WITH CHILIES</STRONG><BR>
	Living so close to the Mexican border we are constantly exposed to Latin foods.  It has caused many of us to have an increased tolerance for spice, however, Mexican food is not meant to be just spicy, it is to be a rich blend of flavors and spices.  There are certain rules to follow when cooking with chilies:
<P>
<STRONG>1. </STRONG> Never touch your eyes or face after handling chilies.  You may even want to wear rubber gloves.  There is a substance in chilies that burns called Capsaicin. <P>
<STRONG>2.</STRONG>  To lessen the heat from a chili, remove the seeds and ribs from the inside of the chili.  It is in these areas that there is the most Capsaicin. <P>
<STRONG>3.</STRONG>  If you get a bite that is too spicy <B>DON'T DRINK WATER!</B>  Drinking water only spreads the heat.  Instead, take a bite of rice, bread, tortilla, banana, avocado or potato.  These items will help neutralize the Capsaicin.
<P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<STRONG>CHILLED CHILI SOUP</STRONG> <P>
<UL>
<LI>2 cups frozen corn<BR>
<LI>4 cups tomato juice<BR>
<LI>1 large cucumber, peeled and cubed<BR>
<LI>2 ripe avocados peeled, pitted and cubed<BR> (try to use Hass Avocados, they have the highest oil content, thus they have the best flavor)<BR>
<LI>4 tbs.. fresh squeezed lime juice<BR>
<LI>2 cloves fresh garlic, minced or pressed<BR>
<LI>1 1/2 tsp. ground cumin seeds<BR>
<LI>1/2 tsp. ground red pepper<BR>
<LI>1 Jalepeno roasted and sliced<BR>
<LI>1 yellow chili roasted and sliced
</UL>
<P>

Cook the corn just long enough to become tender and then drain.  Mix the corn into a large bowl that already has the rest of the ingredients in it.  Blend well and allow to chill for at least 2 hours before serving.  To roast chilies-half and seed the chilies.  Slice them into slivers and lay on a "Pam" sprayed cookie sheet.  Brush the chilies lightly with olive oil.  Bake at 425 for about 20min.  The chilies are done when they are tender and just starting to blacken.
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<STRONG>AMANDA'S SNEAKY ENCHILADAS</STRONG><BR>

I call these my "sneaky" enchiladas because I snuck them to my boyfriend without telling him I had converted his favorite meal to low fat.  The first time he had them he asked if I did something different because they were better than before-GOT HIM!  I later told him that they were low fat, and he still liked them.  I hope you enjoy them as much as we do.<P>

<UL>
<LI>24 corn tortillas<BR>
<LI>1 lb. skinless chicken breast<BR>
<LI>1 can vegetarian refried beans<BR>
<LI>1 can black beans<BR>
<LI>1 can peeled and diced tomatoes, drained<BR>
<LI>1 medium onion chopped<BR>
<LI>1 bottle of your favorite tomatillo or enchilada sauce<BR>
<LI>2 cloves fresh garlic, minced<BR>
<LI>1/4 tsp. paprika<BR>
<LI>2 tbs. freshly chopped cilantro<BR>
<LI>2 cups fresh grated reduced fat Jack cheese<BR>
<LI>1 Jalepeno finely chopped</UL><P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>FILLING:</B>  Cook the chicken and cut it into chunks slightly smaller than "bite size".  Add the onion and garlic, saut until onion pieces are clear.  Add the tomatoes, both beans, cilantro, Jalepeno, and paprika.  Reduce heat to medium low mixing frequently.  Once the combination is nice and hot, lower heat to low.  
	In a small pan, heat the sauce you want to use on medium low.  Also, heat a tortilla pan on high.  You are going to warm the tortillas, one at a time, then quickly submerge them the sauce.  Lay the tortilla in a 9X11 baking pan that you have lightly coasted with the filling mix.  Fill the tortilla and roll up.  Continue this process till you pan is full or you run out of filling.  Top with left over sauce and the jack cheese.  Bake at 325 for 25-30min.  
	These are easier to eat if they have been allowed to sit and cool.  I usually make them on a Friday and serve them for dinner on Saturday.  They are a great "left over"  meal.  Serve them with a fresh dinner salad and low fat or non fat sour cream.

<P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<STRONG>VEGETABLE LASAGNA</STRONG><BR>

<UL>
<LI>6 Italian Squash-washed and trimmed<BR>	<LI>8 ounces skim milk mozzarella cheese, sliced thinly
   and cut into strips<BR>				<LI>2 cups ricotta cheese<BR>
<LI>14 large lasagna noodles	<BR>		<LI>3 large fresh tomatoes, sliced<BR>
<LI>3 large cloves garlic	<BR>			<LI>1 28oz can peeled tomatoes<BR>
<LI>1 large red bell pepper cored, seeded	<LI> fresh basil leaves, chopped
   and cut into strips	<BR>			<LI>3 large portabello mushrooms, cut in bite size chunks<BR>
<LI>1tbsp olive oil	<BR>				<LI>1 large onion, diced</UL><P>
<STRONG>1.</STRONG>  Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water until they are just slightly underdone. 
 Drain and brush with olive oil to keep them from sticking.  Set them aside.  

<p><STRONG>2.</STRONG>  Heat olive oil in a saut pan and saut garlic, basil and portabello mushrooms just long 
enough to make the mushrooms soft.<p>  
<STRONG>3.</STRONG>  Next, in the same pan, saut onions until clear and add to the mushroom mix.  <P>
<STRONG>4.</STRONG>  Add the mushroom mix and onions to the ready cut peeled tomatoes and let simmer.<p>  
<STRONG>5.</STRONG>  Spread some of the peeled tomatoes and olive oil on the bottom and inside edges of a 9x11, (or there abouts) baking dish. <P>
Layer the ingredients in the following order.  Repeat the layering to the top of the baking dish...
noodles						Top the dish with some fresh grated parmesan and 
peeled tomato/mushroom combo			bake at 375 degrees fro 30 minutes.  Let lasagna stand
Italian squash slices					for 10-15 minutes before trying to cut.
red bell peppers					
mozzarella cheese					You may want to garnish the top with fresh grated
ricotta cheese						parmesan cheese and fresh basil leaves.  <P>
This is a great recipe to serve as left overs.  Just cover with tin foil and re-hear in the oven or microwave!  One thing that is fun about this recipe is the portabello mushrooms.  They are a very thick mushroom and have the texture of meat!  If you have a family member that hates the thought of a meatless meal, try this recipe and don't say anything about the mushrooms!  Good luck!<P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<STRONG>VEGETARIAN CHILI</STRONG><BR>
<UL>
<LI>2 cans kidney beans, drained<BR>	<LI>	1 can garbonzo beans	<BR>	<LI>	2 cups frozen kernel corn<BR>
<LI>1 can black beans-drained	<BR>	<LI>	 tbs. chili powder	<BR>		<LI>	1 1/2 tsp. salt<BR>
<LI>2  large red bell pepper, chopped	<BR><LI>	2 large red rose potatoes-diced		<BR><LI>2 carrot, diced<BR>
<LI>1 butternut squash-diced			<BR><LI>1 tbs. olive oil<BR>			<LI>	1 tsp. black pepper<BR>
<LI>6 large cloves garlic, minced	<BR>	<LI>	1 14.5 oz can peeled tomatoes	<BR>	<LI>2 onions-diced		<BR>
<LI>4 portabello mushrooms, diced	<BR><LI>	1 cup grated reduced fat jack cheese<BR>	<LI>2 Italian squash-chopped</UL>
<P>
Heat olive oil and saut onion, 1/4 garlic, carrot, bell pepper, mushrooms and seasonings. Add the corn and the remaining garlic.  Add enough of your favorite hot sauce to taste, (you'll probably want at least a couple tablespoons).  Serve hot on top of brown rice.  Top with cheese. <I>Enjoy!  
</I>Also-if you want to thicken your chili, ad some un-cooked bulger wheat.
<P>


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<STRONG>FIVE-CHILI SALSA</STRONG> <P>

<UL>
<LI>1/2 cup toasted pine nuts	<BR>	<LI>1 Yellow Bell Pepper, seeded and chopped<BR>
<LI>1 Anaheim chili pepper, chopped<BR>	<LI>1 Red Bell Pepper, seeded and chopped<BR>
<LI>1 Jalepeno pepper, chopped<BR>		<LI>1 Serrano pepper, chopped<BR>
<LI>1 onion, diced		<BR>	<LI>2 Large garlic cloves, minced or chopped<BR>
<LI>1 tablespoon fresh cilantro	<BR><LI>	1/2 cup red wine vinegar<BR>
<LI>1/4 cup water		<BR>	<LI>3/4 cup brown sugar<BR>
<LI>1/2 teaspoon salt		<BR><LI>	1/2 teaspoon mustard seed</UL><P>
	Toast the pine nuts by putting them in a small, dry saut pan and shake over high heat until the nuts turn a golden color.  Add to the remaining ingredients, chill and serve.
	To make this a chutney, put all of the ingredients, except pine nuts, into a heavy saucepan and cook until the vegetables are soft.  Stir in the nuts and allow to cool.  It is always best to refrigerate before serving.  Chutneys are best served with grilled meats and vegetables.<P>

<FONT SIZE=2><STRONG>AMANDA'S HEALTHY TIPS FOR THE WEEK OF 10/7/96.</FONT></STRONG><P>

This week we kick off our tribute to Italy.  You'll find wonderful Italian food stuffs on ad like fresh pasta, 
semolina flour, (for those of you who make you own pasta like myself), sun-dried tomatoes, balsamic vinegar, 
diced tomatoes and much, much more!  Italian food is not only tasty, but many recipes are very quick and easy to make. 
 I varied the recipes used this week-we have a soup, a salad and a sauce.  One thing you want to keep in mind with Italian 
food is the oil that is called for in many recipes.  There is approximately 12 grams of fat per tablespoon of olive oil.  
Whenever using a recipe that calls for high fat ingredients, remember the list of substitutes from last week, 
(i.e.. apple sauce for oil when baking, water or vegetable broth for sauting).  In the Roasted Beans & Garlic recipe 
I found I cut the oil in half.  Eliminating it completely when roasting vegetables is tough, you can however use a fat
 free vinaigrette based dressing or marinade for similar results. <I>Enjoy </I>!<P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<STRONG>GARLIC POTATO SOUP</STRONG><BR>
<UL>
<LI>2 quarts water						<BR>	
<LI>1/2 cup finely chopped celery<BR>
<LI>2 1/2 lb.. red rose potatoes-1/2 inch cubes<BR>
<LI>3 1/2 tablespoons minced garlic<BR>
<LI>1 large brown onion-chopped<BR>
<LI>1/4 cup minced fresh parsley<BR>
<LI>salt and pepper to taste
</UL>
<P>
Saut in 1/2 quart water garlic, onion, celery and potatoes until the veggies just start to turn brown.  Dump into a large pot and add the remaining water.  When it starts to boil, turn heat down to simmer until potatoes are soft, (about 40 min.).  Puree 1/4 of the soup and add back to the rest.  Serve with fresh garlic bread and salad for a great healthy meal!
<P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<STRONG>ROASTED BEANS & GARLIC SALAD</STRONG><p> 

<UL>
<LI>1 Tbs. olive oil<BR>
<LI>1 lb. fresh green beans<BR>
<LI>1 cup thinly sliced onion<BR>
<LI>10-12 cloves garlic-peeled<BR>
<LI>salt and pepper to taste<BR>		
<LI>2 Tbs. balsamic vinegar<BR>
<LI>1 cup lightly toasted pine nuts<BR>
<LI>1/2 cup fresh grated Parmesan cheese
</UL>
<P>

Preheat oven to 400 degrees
Brush a cookie sheet with olive oil.  Spread the green beans, garlic, and onions on the cookie sheet and sprinkle lightly with salt and pepper.  Bake for 20 minutes, occasionally shaking the tray.  Remove from the oven and place veggies and garlic in a bowl.  Drizzle the mix with the balsamic vinegar and some more black pepper to taste.  Top the salad with pine nuts and Parmesan cheese. 
This is actually an antipasto salad.  The term "antipasto" is a broad term referring to the first of several courses served in a traditional Italian meal.  The course can mean a simple dish or tow of sliced, marinated vegetables or a platter of veggies, meats and cheeses.  "Antipasto servings" translates into "modest-sized side dish type servings".  <P>
Of course when you think of Italian food-you think of sauces.  Well, Italian sauces can be yummy, healthy and quick too.  The following recipe is my favorite because of these reasons.  I make large batches of it and put it in the freezer.  The way it is listed below will serve 2 people very well.  I hope you enjoy it.<P>


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<STRONG>TOMATO AND VEGGIE SAUCE</STRONG><BR>
<UL>
<LI>2 28 oz can peeled cut tomatoes<BR>
<LI>1 medium onion-thinly sliced<BR>
<LI>2 large mushrooms (cut into 1/2 inch cubes)<BR>
<LI>5 cloves garlic-minced<BR>
<LI>1 Italian squash<BR>
<LI>1 yellow squash<BR>
<LI>1 red bell pepper (optional)<BR>
<LI>3 tbs. dried basil<BR>
<LI>2 tbs. vegetable broth (or 1 tbs. olive oil)<BR>
<LI>2 tbs. balsamic vinegar
</UL>
<P>
Saut veggies in the vegetable broth and vinegar.  When the veggies just start to turn brown, add the garlic and continue to saut until the veggies are getting soft.  Dump the veggies into a pot along with the peeled tomatoes and basil.  Allow to simmer while you cook your pasta.  (Hint-if you are using homemade pasta allow the sauce to simmer for 10 min. before you start your pasta.  This is because homemade pasta cooks much faster than dried pasta).
Like many sauces, this one is better the next day, so don't hesitate to put it in the freezer to use later.  Also, if you prefer to cut and peel your own tomatoes-go for it!  Just make sure the tomatoes are completely ripe for the best flavor. If you are sensitive to the acid in tomatoes, use Roma or Plum tomatoes or yellow variety tomatoes.
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>DID YOU KNOW <I>?</I></B><BR>
You can freeze homemade fresh pasta for up to 3 months!

<STRONG>COOKING WITH CRANBERRIES</STRONG><BR>
 Fresh cranberries are a treat because they are only available about 2 months out of the year.  The market is usually done by Christmas, so now through the Thanksgiving holiday is the time to think about your favorite fresh cranberry recipes.  Don't be afraid to buy extra while they are fresh, you can freeze them at home for later use.  Simply keep the berries in a zip-lock bag to prevent freezer dehydration and don't thaw them until you are ready to use them.  This will help avoid any breakdown or loss of crispness.<P>
Some cranberry facts...Most cranberries are grown in bogs, or swamps.  These bogs are drained of all water before they are cleared, leveled, spread with a layer of sand, and seeded with vine cuttings.  Cranberries require an acid peat soil, sand and a fresh water supply to grow successfully.  It takes 3-5 years for a new cranberry plantation to bear a crop, but with care against frost damage, the vines will bear fruit indefinitely.  As a matter of fact, some cranberry bogs are more than 100 years old and yield about 100 barrels an acre.
Fresh cranberries have about 30 calories per 1/2 cup serving and are a good source of vitamin C.
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<STRONG>CRANBERRY BREAD<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Delicious and low fat too! </I></STRONG><BR>

<UL>
<LI>3/4 cup fresh cranberries, coarsely chopped<BR>
<LI>	1 tbs. grated orange peel<BR>
<LI>1/2 cup raisins	<BR>			<LI>	1 1/4 cup fresh orange juice<BR>
<LI>1/4 cup honey	<BR>			<LI>	1/4 cup applesauce<BR>
<LI>1 1/2 cup whole wheat pastry flour<BR>	 <LI>	1/2 cup whole wheat bread flour<BR>
<LI>2 1/2 tsp. baking powder<BR>		  <LI>1/2 tsp. baking soda<BR>
<LI>1/2 tsp. salt		<BR>			   <LI>1/2 cup wheat germ<BR>
<LI>1/2 cup Grape Nuts cereal
</UL>
Preheat oven to 375 degrees.
Spray a 8"X4" loaf pan with Pam.  In a sauce pan combine cranberries, raisins, orange peel, juice and honey.  Bring the mixture to a boil, stir in apple sauce and remove from the heat.  Allow it to cool to room temperature.  Add the flours, slat, and leavenings,(I recommend you sift them together),  and stir in the wheat germ.  Fold in 3/4 of the cereal, save the rest for the topping.  Spread your batter into a loaf pan and sprinkle the cereal on top.  Press the cereal down lightly with your hand or the back of a spoon.
Bake for 50-60 minutes-test with a toothpick.  If you pierce a cranberry the test will come out wet, so you'll have to try it again.  When done, let the loaf cool on a wire rack for about 10 minutes.  Turn the loaf out on the rack to set for at least  45 minutes before cutting.  
<P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<STRONG>APPLE-CRANBERRY RELISH</STRONG><BR>
<UL>

<LI>1 cup sugar<BR>				<LI>1 lemon<BR>
<LI>1 cup White vinegar<BR>		<LI>2 medium Granny Smith apples-corded and diced<BR>
<LI>1 medium onion-diced<BR>		<LI>1/8 tsp. ground cinnamon<BR>
<LI>1/4 tsp. whole mustard seed<BR>	<LI>a scant 1/8 tsp. ground cloves<BR>
<LI>1/2 tsp. salt	<BR>			<LI>1 cup whole cranberries
</UL>

<P>
	In a medium sauce pan combine sugar, vinegar, apples, and onions.  Trim the ends off the lemon, seed and dice it, (with the peel).  Add lemon, spices and salt to apple mixture.  Allow this mixture to simmer for 10 minutes, stirring every few minutes.  Next, add the cranberries and allow to simmer for 5 more minutes.  Remove from heat and allow to cool, then refrigerate.
	This recipe, per 1/4 cup serving has 87 calories, 1/10 of a gram of fat (okay-no fat), 21 grams of carbohydrates, 89mg of sodium, and 1 gram of fiber.  There is also no cholesterol!

<FONT SIZE=2><STRONG>AMANDA'S HEALTHY TIPS FOR THE WEEK OF 10/21/96:</FONT></STRONG>
<P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<STRONG>HALLOWEEN TREATS</STRONG><BR>
Are you ready for Halloween?  Do you have party preparations, "bobbing" size apples, Candy and Caramel apples, cider and popcorn...how about garlic to scare away vampiers?  We can't forget all the candy you will need!  
Here's an idea!  Keep children entertained with "spooky foods" hidden under the coffee table!  Tell a scary story, and ask the kids to feel various "body parts", hidden under the table...
Use wet cooked spaghetti as intestines, dried apricots as ears, and peeled grapes as eyes! <P> You can also decorate your party with ghosts.  Take some lolli-pops, cover them each with a sheet of facial tissue.  Tie the tissue around the base of the lolli-pop with a short pipecleaner.  You can even draw faces on the ghosts if you would like.
Those Halloween parties can be such fun!  Whether the party is at your house or at your child's school, you can offer healthy snacks and still be popular with the kids.  The recipe that follows is my favorite muffin recipe, but you can use any carrot, pumpkin or bran muffin recipe.<P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<STRONG>HALLOWEEN HOT SPOTS</STRONG><BR>
<UL>
<LI>3 cups bran cereal<BR>
<LI>3 cups bran flakes<BR>
<LI>3/4 cup un-sweetened apple sauce<BR>
<LI>1/4 cup canola oil<BR>
<LI>2 cups hot water<BR>
<LI>4 egg whites, lightly beaten<BR>
<LI>1 egg<BR>
<LI>5 cups all purpose un-bleached flour<BR>
<LI>2 cups sugar<BR>	
<LI>1 quart non-fat butter milk<BR>
<LI>1 tsp. salt<BR>
<LI>1 tsp. baking soda<BR>
<LI>1 tbs. ground ginger<BR>
<LI>4 tbs. ground cinnamon<BR>
<LI>2 tbs. ground nutmeg<BR>
<LI>2 1/2 cups raisins<P>
</UL>

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Line muffin pans with muffin cups and set aside.  Place all of the above ingredients in a large mixing bowl.  Stir until well blended (don't over mix).  Fill the tins half full and bake for 25 minutes, or until a toothpick comes out clean.  Allow the muffins to cool.  Add orange food coloring to your favorite white frosting.  Frost the muffins lightly with the now orange frosting and decorate.  You can also use mini-muffin pans!
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<STRONG>CRUNCHY "KOOKIE" COOKIES</STRONG><P>
This is a quick and easy recipe that your kids can even help on.  Unfortunately, it is not exactly healthy, but afterall, it's Halloween!  Enjoy!<P>
<UL>
<LI>16oz of butterscotch chips<BR>
<LI>1 can of Chinese noodles

</UL>
<P>

Melt the butterscotch chips in a pan over medium-low heat.  When the chips are melted, slowly add the Chinese noodles.  The noodles should be covered in butterscotch completely.  While still hot, place spoonfuls of the mixture on wax paper and allow to cool.  That's it!  You can also use chocolate chips instead of butterscotch and you can add peanuts if you would like.

<B> MORE COOKING WITH APPLES</B><P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<STRONG>APPLE YOGURT</STRONG><BR>
<UL>

</UL>
<P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<STRONG>APPLE BAKED BEANS</STRONG><BR>
<UL><LI>3 cups Pinto beans<BR>		<LI>4 cups chopped onion<BR>
<LI>2 tbs. vegetable broth<BR>		<LI>1 1/2 tsp. salt<BR>
<LI>1 tbs. chili powder<BR>		<LI>2 tsp. cumin<BR>

<LI>3 medium Granny Smith Apples<BR>		<LI>4 medium tomatoes, diced<BR>
<LI>	lots of black pepper
</UL>
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
Saut onions in the vegetable broth in a skillet.  Add chili powder, salt, cumin and mustard and continue to saut until onions are clear.  Add garlic and saut for another 5 minutes over medium heat.  Add this combination to the beans and all other remaining ingredients.  Mix well and put into a deep casserole dish or baking pan.  Cover tightly with foil and bake for 1 hour.<P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<STRONG>CRISP APPLE DESERT</STRONG><BR>
<UL>
<LI>7 medium sized Granny Smith Apples, peeled, cored, and quartered<BR>
<LI>6 ounces of frozen apple juice concentrate, defrosted<BR>
<LI>1/3 cup light brown sugar<BR>	<LI>1 teaspoon cinnamon<BR>
<LI>dash of all spice<BR>	<LI>1 1/2 cup of your favorite granola<BR>
<LI>1 tablespoon un-salted butter  
</UL>
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
Spray a saucepan lightly with Pam.  All the juice, fresh apples, cinnamon and sugar.  Cook over high heat until the apples are tender and the juice is caramelized and reduced-this should take about 15 min.  Spray a 6"X8" baking dish with Pam.  Place the apples from the pan in the bottom of the dish and save the juice for later.  Cover the apples with your granola and pour over the juice from the pan.  Melt the butter and lightly sprinkle the butter over the ingredients.  Bake until golden, about 20-30 minutes.   Serve warm with fat free vanilla frozen yogurt.

<FONT SIZE=2><STRONG>AMANDA'S HEALTHY TIPS FOR WEEK OF 11/6-11/11</STRONG></FONT><P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<STRONG>PEARS, SQUASH & POTATOES</FONT></STRONG><BR>
Starting this week I am going to focus on healthy foods to serve at your
holiday meal.  The average person gains 5 lbs. between Thanksgiving and New Years. 
        This week our feature produce item is fresh new crop--PEARS!  How do you know
if they are ripe?  Apply gentle thumb pressure near the base of the stem.  If it
yields slightly, it's ripe. Don't rely on color to determine ripeness.  Different varieties of any given
type of pear will vary in color.  To ripen your fresh pears at home, place them in a paper bag and let
them stand at room temperature.  It is okay to refrigerate ripe pears if you want to save them
for later.<P>
        A medium size pear contains approx. 98 calories, 25g carbohydrates, 4.8g
dietary fiber and
208mg of Potassium, Vitamin A and C, and iron!  Fresh pears have all of this,
but have no sodium or
cholesterol.  Most of the fiber found in pears is found in the edible skin.
  Did you know pears
are picked and shipped green because pears develop a finer flavor and smoother
texture when ripened
off the tree!  The starch converts to sugar after picking.
The following recipe was found in a book called Great Good Food by Julee
Rosso.    It is filled with lots of healthy, yet
tasty foods.  <P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<STRONG>ROASTED GINGER SQUASH</STRONG><BR>
<UL>
<LI>1 Butternut Squash, (about 2 lb.)  <BR>
<LI>3 tbs. frozen orange juice concentrate, defrosted<BR>
<LI>1 1/2 tsp. peeled and minced fresh ginger<BR>
<LI>1/4 tsp. ground ginger
</UL>
<P>
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
Cut the squash in half, lengthwise.  Scoop out all of the seeds and discard
them.  Place the squash halves, hollow
side down, in a shallow baking pan.  Pour in 1/4 inch of water and bake until
tender.  This should take 60-75 min. 
When done, remove the squash from the pan and allow to cool enough to handle.
 Scoop out the flesh of the squash
and place it in a serving dish.  Mash the flesh with the juice and both
ginger's.  If you find it is too gingery, add
more juice.  Serve right away or keep warm in a low oven.  Makes four
servings. One serving contains:  108 calories, 28g carb., 2g protein, no cholesterol
and .2g of fat.<P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<STRONG>STUFFED ACORN SQUASH</STRONG><BR>
<UL>
<LI>1 large green Acorn Squash<BR>
<LI>2 cups wild rice-cooked<BR>
<LI>1 red bell pepper-roasted<BR>
<LI>1 small brown onion-roasted(or 1/2 a med. sized)<BR>
<LI>1 tsp. lemon pepper
</UL>
<P>

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
Cut the squash in half, lengthwise.  Scoop out all of the seeds and discard
them.  Place the squash halves, hollow
side down, in a shallow baking pan.  Pour in 1/4 inch of water and bake until
tender.  This should take 50-60 min. 
When done, remove the squash from the pan and allow to cool enough to handle.
 Cook the wild rice.  When done,
reduce heat to low and add remaining ingredients.  Scoop equal portions of
the rice into each squash half and serve
hot.  (Reminder-to roast onions and peppers-1.  slice them into strips 2.
 spray lightly with an olive oil cooking spray
3.  dust lightly with salt and pepper  4.  bake at 450 degrees for about 20
min.). Makes 2 servings.<P>


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<STRONG>POTATO GRATIN</STRONG><BR>
<UL>
<LI>2 cups plus 2 tbs. skim milk<BR>
<LI>2 lb. Red Rose Potatoes-sliced thin<BR>
<LI>2 cloves garlic, minced<BR>
<LI>1/4 tsp. salt<BR>
<LI>1 tbs. cornstarch or arrowroot powder<BR>
<LI>1/2 cup shredded reduced fat Jack
<LI>cheese, (or Cheddar or 1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese)
</UL>

<P>
Preheat oven to 375 degrees.
In a medium saucepan, combine 2 cups of the milk, garlic, potatoes, and salt.
 Simmer this over medium heat and
cook until the potatoes are tender enough to pierce easily with a fork.
 Remove from heat.  Using a slotted spoon,
transfer the potatoes to a shallow baking dish.  In a small bowl, mix
together the cornstarch and the remaining 2
tbs. skim milk to make a thick paste.  Whisk the paste into the hot milk over
medium heat until thick, about 10 min. 
Stir in the jack cheese and pour over the potatoes.  Sprinkle on the Parmesan
cheese and bake for about 15 min,
(until golden brown and bubbly).  Let stand for 10 min. before serving.

<FONT SIZE=2><STRONG>AMANDA'S HEALTHY TIPS FOR WEEK OF 11/13-11/18  </FONT></STRONG>
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>THANKSGIVING FEAST</B><BR>
Now is the time to start planning that Thanksgiving Holiday feast.  Don't
wait until the last minute!  You may find yourself serving the same delicious, yet high fat meals as last
year.  By planning your appetizers, side dishes and desserts now, you can save yourself a lot of time
and calories!  Try these wonderful holiday foods.  I think you and your whole family will be
pleasantly surprised!  Let's start with a great appetizer...<P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<STRONG>SPICY BLACK BEAN DIP</STRONG><BR>
<UL>
<LI>1 15oz can black beans-drained and rinsed     <BR>        <LI>  3 tsp. fresh chopped cilantro<BR>
<LI>1 tsp. chili powder                 <BR>                         <LI>   1 small avocado, (pref. Hass)-peeled<BR>
<LI>2 tsp. lemon juice         <BR>                                   <LI>  2 tbs. fresh chopped jalepenos<BR>
<LI>1medium tomato, seeded & finely chopped     <BR>            
<LI>1/2 cup shredded reduced fat Jack cheese  <BR>            <LI>  1/4 cup thinly sliced green onions<P>
</UL>
<P>
Place the beans, cilantro and chili powder in a bowl and mix very
well-getting most of the beans mashed.  Spread the mixture in a deep pie dish or a shallow serving dish.
 Finely chop the avocado and toss with the lemon juice.  Set aside.  Spread the jalepeno peppers over the
bean mix and spread the avocado over all of it.  Create layers of the remaining ingredients in the
order listed.  Bake uncovered at 400 degrees for about 20 min.  Serve at room temperature or hot with warm
corn tortilla wedges.  (You can add an additional layer using nonfat sour cream).  <I>Enjoy </I>!
<P>

If there is one dish that is traditional, it's stuffing.  The problem is 
if your family's recipe has apples, onions, or gizzards-it is surely loaded with fat.  Try this
recipe as a healthy alternative. 
<P>


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<STRONG>WILD CRANBERRY STUFFING</STRONG><BR>
<UL>
<LI>1 cup uncooked brown rice      <BR>                <LI>1 cup uncooked wild rice<BR>
<LI>1 medium brown onion    <BR>                        <LI>1 cup celery-finely chopped<BR>
<LI>1 bay leaf      <BR>                                       <LI> 1 tsp. dried rosemary, or 1 tbs. fresh<BR>
<LI>1 tsp. chicken bouillon granules <BR>           <LI>    1/4 tsp. ground white pepper<BR>
<LI>1 cup whole berry cranberry sauce<BR>     <LI>  3 cups unsalted, fat free chicken broth or water
</UL>
<P>
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
Combine all ingredients except cranberry sauce in a 2 1/2 quart pot.  Bring
the mixture to a boil, reduce the heat to low, cover and simmer without stirring for 45 to 50
minutes.  Coat a 2 quart casserole dish with cooking spray.  Stir the cranberry sauce into the
stuffing mix, and loosely spoon the stuffing into the dish.  Cover with aluminum foil and bake for 30-45
minutes.  <P> 
Last, but certainly not least, we cannot forget dessert!  Dieting does not
mean deprivation.  These wonderful treats have 1.5 grams of fat per cookie and boy are they
yummy!  I found this recipe in a book called Fat Free Holiday Recipes by Sandra Woodruff.
<P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<STRONG>PUMPKIN PECAN BITES</STRONG><BR>
<UL>
<LI>1 cup whole wheat flour    <BR>                    <LI> 1 cup oat bran<BR>
<LI>3/4 cup brown sugar      <BR>                            <LI>   3/4 tsp. baking soda<BR>
<LI>2-3 tsp. pumpkin pie spice<BR>                          <LI>    1/2 cup mashed cooked or canned pumpkin<BR>
<LI>1/4 cup honey or molasses   <BR>                       <LI>     40 small pecan halves<P>
</UL>
<P>
Preheat oven to 300 degrees.

In a large bowl, combine the flour, oat bran, brown sugar, baking soda, and
pumpkin pie spice, and stir
to mix well.  Add the pumpkin and the honey or molasses, and stir well.  Coat
a baking sheet lightly
with cooking spray.  Roll the dough into 1 inch balls, and place 1 1/2 inches
apart on the sheet.  Press a
pecan half in the center of each cookie to flatten the dough.  Bake for 15
min.  Cool the cookies on the
sheet for 1 minute, then transfer baked cookies to a rack to cool completely.
 Serve immediately or
transfer to an airtight container, and arrange in single layers separated by
waxed paper.  If you want
to make these really low in fat, just make them pumpkin bites by leaving out
the pecans!

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>MORE THANKSGIVING TREATS</B><BR>
As the holiday season marches on, we continue our efforts to not gain those traditional five pounds. 
The following recipe is traditionally full of flavor, is a great breakfast item that is sure to please everyone in the family, and it's still low in fat,about 2 grams of fat per muffin.<P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<STRONG>PUMPKIN-GINGER MUFFINS</STRONG><BR>
<UL>
<LI>1 1/2 cup fresh or canned pumpkin puree<BR>         <LI>2 cups light brown sugar<BR>
<LI>2 tbs. canola oil       <BR>                                       <LI> 2 tbs. applesauce<BR>
<LI>1 egg and 1 egg white <BR>                                  <LI>1 cup canned mincemeat<BR>
<LI>1/2 cup apple juice concentrate   <BR>                      <LI>1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour<BR>
<LI>2 tsp. baking soda       <BR>                                      <LI> 2 tsp. baking powder<BR>
<LI>1 tsp. salt      <BR>                                              <LI> 4 1/2 tsp. ground ginger<BR>
<LI>1 tsp. ground nutmeg     <BR>                               <LI>1/3 cup finely chopped crystallized ginger
</UL>
<P>
Preheat to 350 degrees.  Lightly spray muffin pans with cooking spray.  In a large bowl, combine the
pumpkin, sugar, oil and
applesauce.  Add the egg and egg white, beat until smooth.  Stir in the
juice.  Add the dry ingredients
in another bowl.  Gradually stir in the dry mixture with the wet and mix
well, but don't over beat. 
Fold in the ginger and mincemeat.  Generously fill the muffin tins with the
batter, (about 2/3 full). 
Bake for 25 min. or until they pass the toothpick test.
<P>


With the weather getting cooler and the days getting shorter, what better
meal to end the day than homemade soup.  We can still enjoy fresh, hot soup that is full of
flavor, yet low in fat.  Your family will appreciate this hot meal after a long day of holiday shopping!
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<STRONG>VEGGIE PASTA SOUP</STRONG><BR>
<UL><LI>2 cups Navy Beans-cooked        <BR>                                
<LI>6 tbs. vegetable broth          <BR>                                <LI>1 large brown onion-chopped<BR>
<LI>3 cups peeled and cut tomatoes     <BR>                             <LI>3 1/2 quarts water<BR>
<LI>1 tbs. salt                <BR>                                            <LI> 2 carrots, peeled and cut into 1/4" slices<BR>
<LI> cups red potatoes-cubed                <BR>                       <LI>1 cup coarsely chopped leek<BR>
<LI>2 stalks fresh celery w/ leaves-chopped                 <LI>2 cups green beans cut into 2" lengths<BR>
<LI>2 cups Italian Squash, unpeeled, cut into 1/8" slices  <BR>          <LI> 1 cup fresh grated Parmesan cheese<BR>
<LI>1 cup small shells or other small pasta              <BR>           <LI>1/8 tsp. powdered saffron<BR>
<LI>3 large garlic cloves-crushed      <BR>                             <LI>1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley<BR>
<LI>1/4 cup chopped fresh basil, (or 2 tbs. dried) <BR>        <LI>1/2 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese
</UL><P>
Heat vegetable broth and saut onions over medium heat for 2 min., do not let the onions turn
brown.  Add the tomatoes and bring to a boil.  Lower the heat and cook for about 5 min.  Add 3 1/2
quarts of water and the salt, return the soup to a boil.  Add the carrots, potatoes, leeks, and celery. 
Lower the heat again and cook for 15 min.  Add the green beans, squash, navy beans, and pasta and
cook for an additional 10-15 minutes.  The vegetables shouldn't be too soft.
 Add the saffron and cook 1-2 minutes longer.  Remove from the heat and add the garlic, parsley, basil
and 1/2 cup of Parmesan cheese.  Serve with the remaining Parmesan to be passed around separately.
<P>

        All too often we try to be good about eating right be eating salads-drenched
in dressing!  I too am a fan of salad dressing-my favorite is Balsamic vinegar and oil.  Not
exactly the most healthy.  I have learned that I much prefer the bite of the vinegar than the heaviness of
the oil.  If you are an oil and vinegar fan like myself-try this lower in fat alternative I found in
Great Good Food by Julee Rosso.  The real key to this recipe is to use it as a spray or spitzer.
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<STRONG>BALSAMIC VINAIGRETTE</STRONG><BR>
<UL>
<LI>6 tbs. minced shallots  <BR>                        <LI>1/2 cup balsamic vinegar<BR>
<LI>2 tbs. sugar        <BR>                                  <LI>  1/2 tsp. salt<BR>
<LI>1/4 tsp. fresh ground pepper  <BR>              <LI>    1/2 cup fat free low sodium chicken broth<BR>
<LI>2 tsp. minced garlic        <BR>                 <LI>   1/2 cup chopped fresh Italian Parsley<BR>
<LI>2 tsp. Dijon mustard     <BR>                   <LI>    2 tbs. fresh orange juice

<FONT SIZE=2><STRONG>AMANDA'S HEALTHY TIPS FOR WEEK OF 11/27-12/2. </FONT></STRONG>
<P>
<B>HOLIDAY TIPS</B><BR>

 It was tough to decide what to do for these 3 segments because they fall
right before and right after Thanksgiving.  Not only is everyone living on leftovers, but 'tis
the season to start shopping!  My guess is that between shopping, family and tryptophan, (that
stuff in turkey that makes us sleepy), we will all need a little boost.
     <P>
The first thing we are going to cover are the essentials for keeping your
energy up.  We all get very busy this time of the year, so regular healthy meals may be hard to come by.  For snacking, try
some of these "grab and go" snack items...(and don't forget your water bottle!). <P>

<STRONG>Energy Bars</STRONG><BR>
There are all types of energy bars on the market these days.
 Some of these bars are Balance Bars and Energy Bars.  Some have more protein, while others have more carbohydrates. 
Select those that best suit your dietary needs.<P>
<STRONG>Dried Fruit</STRONG><BR>
Apples, prunes, apricots, pineapple, papaya, even raisins make
great snacks to go.  You can buy them in bulk so you have one or several in your pantry for immediate
consumption.  <P>
<STRONG>Trail Mixes</STRONG><BR>
Awide variety of trail mixes are available, however, be sure to
select the "raw" varieties
when watching fat and salt intake.<P>
<STRONG>Cereals</STRONG><BR>
Fill a baggy with your favorite healthy cereal!  Cereals like Puffins
or Puffed Kamut make great snacks.<P>
<STRONG>Fruits and Veggies</STRONG><BR>
Of course fresh cut apples, baby peeled carrots,  celery
stalks, and bananas all make great snacks!
                
<P>

With the weather getting cooler it is a great time to make homemade soups.
 Over the last few weeks we have had a few recipes involving baked squash.  Now we are going to
try something new with Acorn Squash.  Acorn is a dark green, deeply ribbed, acorn shaped
squash.  They will usually have some orange blush. This is a great soup to serve immediately or make it ahead of time and
freeze it.  One thing to note, when the recipe lists a "chopped" item, you can chop as thick or as
fine as you prefer. 
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<STRONG>FALL HARVEST SOUP</STRONG><BR>
<UL>
<LI>1 tablespoon vegetable broth   <BR>         <LI>1/2 cup chopped onion<BR>
<LI>1/2 cup chopped carrot      <BR>    <LI>1/2 cup chopped celery<BR>
<LI>5 cups fat free chicken broth   <BR>        <LI>2 cup lentil beans<BR>
<LI>4 medium Acorn Squash, halved, seeded, peeled and cut into 1 inch chunks <BR>
<LI>1 tsp. dried thyme<BR>
<LI>1/2 tsp. nutmeg<BR>
<LI>Salt and pepper to taste   <BR>   
 <LI>2 tsp. summer savory
</UL>
<P>

In a large stockpot, heat the vegetable broth over medium heat.  Add the
onion, carrot, and celery, and saut till veggies are soft, but not brown.  Add them to the pot
with 4 cups of chicken broth and the lentils.  Bring the mixture to a boil, cover, and let simmer
for 1 hour.  Add the squash and herbs and continue to simmer until the squash and lentils are
cooked, (about 30- 45min.).  Add the remaining cup of broth if the soup seems too thick.  Add
additional seasoning as you please.  Garnish with a sprig of fresh parsley.
<P>
We spend so much time during the holidays cooking and shopping for gifts-so
why not make our lives easier by doing them at once?!  Wondering what I am talking
about?...check out the following recipe,to see what I mean!
<P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<STRONG>FAVORITE PAPAYA CHUTNEYS </STRONG><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Salsas, Chutneys & Relishes by Linda Ferrari</I><BR>


<UL>
<LI>1 1/2 cups finely chopped papaya   <BR>           <LI>  1/2 yellow bell pepper, finely chopped<BR>
<LI>1/2 medium onion, finely chopped  <BR>             <LI> 1 Serrano Chili, seeded and minced<BR>
<LI>1/3 cup dried cranberries  <BR>           <LI>  1/4 cup slivered almonds<BR>
<LI>1/2 cup light brown sugar  <BR>             <LI>3/4 cup sherry vinegar<BR>
<LI>1 tbs. crystallized ginger, minced     <BR>         <LI>1/2 tsp. coriander seed<BR>
<LI>1/2 tsp. salt<P>
</UL>        Put all of the ingredients into a heavy saucepan and bring to a boil,
stirring to dissolve the
sugar.  Lower the heat and cook until the mixture is slightly thickened and
syrupy.  Remove from
the heat and cool.  Keep refrigerated in a jar with a tight-fitting lid.
        Now, the key with this recipe is actually the jar!  To use this simple and
beautiful chutney as a
gift, pack it in a traditional canning jar.  Once it is cooled and sealed,
decorate the jar with twine,
autumn leaves and other country decorations. 
This recipe makes about 2 1/3 cups<P>

<FONT SIZE=2><STRONG>AMANDA'S HEALTHY TIPS FOR WEEK OF 12/4-12/9.</FONT></STRONG>
<P>
<B>  HOLIDAY PARTY IDEAS</B><BR>


'Tis the season for holiday parties, friends, family and fun.  Because you
want to keep the fun fun for you too-I suggest you follow the K.I.S.S. method to your appetizer and snack
planning.  K.I.S.S. stands for Keep It Simple Stupid!  No matter what your party theme is there are certain sure fire things to
serve...
<P>

<STRONG>FRUIT AND VEGGIE TRAYS</STRONG><BR>
<STRONG>1.  Get a lot of your favorite fruits.</STRONG>  Try and stick to fruit that is firm and neat.  For example, try to use
apples, bananas, grapes, pears, assorted melons.  Use bamboo skewers to keep the table clear, clean and fun.  You can also make melon and cheese skewers.
<P>
<STRONG>2.  Get a lot of your favorite vegetables</STRONG>.  Use more bamboo skewers.  Make red and green skewers with cherry tomatoes and bell peppers and keep it colorful by using colored bell peppers.<P>
        We are very fortunate to live in an area that provides us with a wide
variety of fresh fruits and vegetables year round.  Take advantage of this and get creative!  HINT-cut
out the top of a bell pepper, scoop out the seeds and use the pepper as a serving dish for your
favorite dips!<P>

I often speak about using vegetable broth for sauting vegetables.  I call
little things like that "tools"
because they make healthy cooking so much easier.  Because I use it
frequently, I keep a container of it in
the refrigerator for immediate use.  Well, here is another "tool" to keep in
the refrigerator.  Use it as a
substitute in recipes that call for sour cream, mayonnaise, or heavy cream.<P>

<UL>
<LI>1 cup low-fat or non-fat cottage cheese<BR>
<LI>1 cup nonfat plain yogurt</UL><P>
        Mix these two items by hand in a bowl until smooth, cover and refrigerate.
 This cooking tool is great
when making dips for your holiday parties.  The following dip recipe was
found in Great Good Foods by Julee Rosso.
<P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>TAHINI DIP</B><BR>
<UL>
<LI>1 cup of the "tool" mentioned above<BR>             
<LI>3 tbs. fresh squeezed orange juice, (juice from 1 large orange)<BR>
<LI>1 tbs. orange juice concentrate<BR>
<LI>3 tbs. tahini<BR>
<LI>1 tbs. honey<BR>
<LI>the zest of 1 orange, grated<BR>
<LI>a pinch of Cayenne pepper
</UL>
<P>
        Place all of the ingredients in a blender and process until just combined.
 Transfer to a bowl and cover.  Refrigerate until needed.  Remember-get creative in your serving
methods.  Serve in bell pepper shells or make a dish with orange peels!<BR>

<LI TYPE=SQUARE>Carb. 1g
<LI TYPE=SQUARE> Protein .7g.
<LI TYPE=SQUARE> Chol. 0mg, Fat .7g  (per teaspoon)
</UL>
<P>

Another dip that is great for the holiday season is pesto.  Now, pesto is
traditionally made with basil
and olive oil.  The pesto we are going to make has less than 1 gram of fat
per tablespoon!  <P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<STRONG>VEGETABLE PESTO</STRONG><BR>
<UL>
<LI>1 1\4 cup of the above "tool" <BR>  <LI>4 cups broccoli florets, chopped<BR>
<LI>1 can f.free chicken broth<BR>      <LI>4 garlic cloves, peeled<BR>
<LI>1 cup basil leaves-packed     <BR> <LI> 2 tbs. toasted almond slivers<BR>
<LI>1/4 cup grated parmesan cheese<BR>  <LI>1/4 cup low fat sour cream<BR>
<LI>a dash of salt <BR> <LI>Tabasco or other pepper sauce to taste
</UL>
<P>

In a large pot, steam the broccoli over 1 cup of chicken broth until tender,
about 5 minutes.  Remove the broccoli and set aside.  Add enough more broth to the liquid to equal 6
tablespoons after steaming.  Drop the garlic in a food processor while it is on and process
until minced.  Scrape down the sides, add the basil and almonds and process until chopped.  Add 2
tablespoons of the cooking liquid and process until smooth.  Add the broccoli, Parmesan, salt and remaining
liquid.  Continue to process until smooth.  Add the "tool" and sour cream.  Whisk until well blended.

<FONT SIZE=2><STRONG>AMANDA'S HEALTHY TIPS FOR WEEK OF 12/11-12/16. </FONT></STRONG>
<P>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>SQUASH AND KIWI RECIPES</B><BR>
The following recipe is one that I found around this time last year.  I served it at my housewarming
party and it was an instant success.  I don't recall where I found it. 
 As with most squash recipes the thing that takes the longest is the baking of the squash itself, the rest is easy. 
 This recipe is great right out of the oven, however it is an awesome leftover dish.  <P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<STRONG>STREUSEL TOPPED BUTTERNUT SQUASH</STRONG><BR>
<UL>
<LI>1 med. Butternut squash-seeded<BR>  <LI>1 1/2 cups unsweetened applesauce<BR>
<LI>1/3 cup maple syrup <BR>                   <LI> 1/3 cup nonfat plain yogurt<BR>
<LI>2 tbs. brown sugar     <BR>                   <LI>  1/4 tsp. cinnamon
</UL>
<P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<STRONG>Topping:</STRONG><BR>
<UL>
<LI TYPE=CIRCLE>1/2 cup sweet bran flakes-crushed  <BR>     <LI TYPE=CIRCLE>3 tbs. brown sugar<BR>
<LI TYPE=CIRCLE>1/4 tsp. cinnamon    <BR>                           <LI TYPE=CIRCLE>2 tsp. butter-melted
</UL>
<P>

Bake the butternut squash at 400 degrees for 50 minutes or until tender, (you should be able
to easily pierce it with a fork).  Combine all base ingredients and mix thoroughly.  Once the
squash is cool enough to handle, scoop out the pulp and add to the mixture, mix until smooth. 
Pour the mixture into a baking dish lined with cooking spray.  Combine topping ingredients
and sprinkle over the dish.  Bake at 400 degrees, uncovered, until hot throughout.
<P>
We have spent the last several weeks talking about foods for the holidays-healthy
snacks, side dishes, desserts, even quick and healthy breakfast ideas.  Well,
this week will be no different.  Although we are going to focus on one of my favorite
fruits-kiwi.  California kiwifruit are in full swing and they are delicious!  Kiwifruit are a great snack item, simply cut the kiwi in half from side to side and scoop out the pulp with a spoon.  They can also be put on cereal and desserts.
 They are low in fat, high in fiber and high in vitamin C and potassium.  As a matter of fact, 1
kiwifruit has more vitamin C than an orange!  Here is a great breakfast idea using kiwi.<P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<STRONG>KIWIFRUIT MUFFINS</STRONG><BR>
<UL>
<LI>1 cup bran flakes           <BR>                    <LI>1 egg, slightly beaten<BR>
<LI>1/2 cup brown sugar, loosely packed    <BR> <LI>1 tablespoon apple sauce, unsweetened<BR>
<LI>1 cup unbleached flour            <BR>     <LI>1 teaspoon baking soda<BR>
<LI>1/2 cup 1% milk or skim milk        <BR>    <LI>1 teaspoon baking powder<BR>
<LI>2 Kiwifruit, peeled and chopped<BR> <LI>1/2 teaspoon each salt and ground cinnamon<BR>
</UL>
<P> 
       
Preheat oven 425 degrees.  Place the bran flakes and sugar in a bowl and
stir well.  Sift in the flour, baking powder and cinnamon.  Combine egg, applesauce, baking soda
and milk.  Slowly mix the batter into the dry ingredients and add the kiwifruit.  Fill
sprayed muffin pans 3/4 full and bake for about 15 min. or until golden brown.  (Try serving
halves topped with a slice of fresh kiwi).
<P>
It's time for dessert!  Thankfully we live in Southern California where we can enjoy cool
deserts anytime.  Here is a great one to serve after a hot holiday meal that is healthy, tasty
and uniquely wonderful!
<P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<STRONG>TROPICAL KIWI ICE</STRONG><BR>
<UL>
<LI>4 kiwifruit       <BR>      <LI>1/2 cup sugar<BR>
<LI>1 cup cubed melon (honeydew or cantaloupe work best) <BR> 
<LI>  1 tsp. grated lemon rind<P>
</UL>   
<P>
   Wash and trim the ends of the kiwi.  Cut the kiwi into cubes and put into a
food processor with the metal blade in place.  Add the remaining ingredients.
 Process until smooth.  Pour the mixture into a 8" metal pan.  Cover with foil and freeze
until firm.  Remove from the freezer and let stand for about 10 min.  Break into small pieces and
put into food processor with the metal blade in place.  Process until smooth.  Pack into a
Tupperware container and cover.  Return to the freezer.  Serve by scooping out slices
into an ice-cream dish.  Garnish with a slice of fresh kiwi or a sprig of mint.  (If you have
the time to make an icebowl-serve it in that for a great holiday touch.)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>EGGNOGG AND LAMB RECIPES</B><BR>

The following recipe is a holiday tradition-Eggnog.  The twist is that this
eggnog doesn't use any eggs!  This is a real treat for vegetarians, people 
who are cutting back on their cholesterol intake, and those of you who hesitate
 to eat raw eggs, (especially after they have been sitting in a punch bowl) !
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>EGGLESS EGGNOG</B><BR>
<UL> 
<LI>2 10 1/2 oz packages of soft silken tofu     <BR>   <LI>16oz vanilla soy or rice milk<BR>
<LI>1 tbs. + 1 tsp. vanilla extract<BR>                <LI> 1/4 cup sugar<BR>
<LI>1/4 tsp. turmeric <BR>       <LI> 1/2 cup rum or brandy (optional)</UL><P>
Combine all of the above ingredients in a blender or food processor and dust
with nutmeg! 
<P>

The upcoming holidays has brought me quite a few requests for healthy lamb
recipes. The following recipes comes from Great Good Food by Julee Rosso.  It is a great excuse to try the new FARL hormone free lamb!<P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>LAMB AND GREEN PEPPERCORN PASTA </B><BR>     

<UL>
<LI>1 tsp. olive oil       <BR>   <LI>1 1/2 lbs lamb, well trimmed and cut into 1 1/2 inch cubes<BR>  
<LI>8 garlic cloves-peeled <BR>   <LI>2 medium onions, coarsely chopped<BR>  
<LI>1 1/2 cup red wine<BR>        <LI>3 cups low fat beef broth<BR>  
<LI>3 medium sized red potatoes<BR>       <LI>1 tsp. fresh thyme<BR>  
<LI>2 bay leaves<BR>      <LI>1 can, (2 ounces), green peppercorns in brine, drained<BR>  
<LI>Salt and fresh ground pepper <BR>     <LI>3/4 pound dry fettuccine</UL><P>
In a nonstick skillet over high heat, heat 1/2 teaspoon of the oil.  Add the lamb and saut  until brown on all sides.  Do not overcrowd the pan; do this in batches if
necessary.  Transfer the lamb to a stockpot.  Heat the remaining oil in the skillet.  Add the garlic and onion, and saut until soft, about 3- 4 minutes.  Add to the stockpot.  Pour the wine into the skillet, scraping up any brown bits from the bottom;  add the lamb.  Add the beef broth, potatoes, thyme, and bay leaves to the stockpot.  Bring
to a boil, reduce the heat to a simmer and cover.  Simmer for 1 1/2 hours,
until the lamb is tender. <P>

Bring a pot of water to boil for the fettuccine.  Remove the lamb band the potatoes to a bowl, using a slotted spoon.  Increase the heat to medium-high.  Add the peppercorns and cook for 8 to 10 minutes, until the sauce is reduced slightly.  You should have about 1 2/2 cups.  Strain the sauce and add the peppercorns and onion to the lamb.  Discard the bay leaves.  Place the broth and potatoes inn a
blender and puree.  Season with salt and pepper to taste, and pour over the
lamb.  Cook the fettuccine
while you are finishing the sauce.  Serve the lamb over the pasta. Serves 6.<BR>

<LI>2 cups very good red wine <BR>       <LI> 8 sprigs of fresh rosemary</UL><P>  
Pre-heat oven to 375 degrees.
Trim the lamb of extra fat and place it in a shallow roasting pan.  With a
sharp knife, make small slits
all around the lamb and insert the slivered garlic.  Season wit slat and
pepper, and place the remaining
garlic around the lamb.  Pour 1 cup of the broth and 1 cup of the wine into
the pan, and place the
rosemary sprigs on top of the leg.  Place the lamb in the oven and bake for
18 minutes per pound-about
2 1/2 to 3 hours for medium; baste occasionally.  After 1 hour add the
remaining broth and wine, and
continue to baste until done.  Remove the lamb from the roaster and let it
rest for 10 minutes before
carving.  Discard the rosemary.  Meanwhile, place the roaster over
medium-high heat, and reduce the
liquid by half.  Mash the garlic into the liquid with a fork while it is
reducing.  Serve the juice on the
side.<BR>

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>NEW YEAR'S RECIPES</B><BR>

Now that we have made our New Year's Resolutions to eat a more healthy diet, and we may already be forgetting them, here are some tips to get you back on a healthy track.  The following list is what I'm calling the top 12 foods to fill your kitchen
with.  These are items that you should keep in your house at all times.
Keeping tasty and healthy items in your home or office
makes it easier to build a healthier you!<P>

<B>1. Non-fat yogurt.</B><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ways of making yogurt more exciting without adding a lot of fat!
<P>
<B>2.  Pasta sauce.</B><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has little or no fat and can be heated up quickly for a great meal.  
<P>
<B>3.  Pasta.</B><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Keep a variety of  shapes and flavors around. <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also keep some cooked cold pasta in the refrigerator for salads.
<P>

<B>4.  Beans.</B><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kidney, garbanzo, black, soy, and vegetarian refried beans are a great source of protein<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and they are very low in fat.
<P>

<B>5.  Rice.</B><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another good source of protein with little fat.
<P>

<B>6.  Bagels.</B><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Always keep some of your favorite breads around. 
<P>

<B>7.  Fish.</B><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;High protein, low fat, and studies show that an ounce a day may cut the risk of a heart attack by 50% <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;among many other benefits. 
<P>

<B>8.  Olive Oil.</B><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you need to use oil this is the one-an artery-protector high in heart-healthy oleic acid, which reduces <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LDL cholesterol without lowering the good type-HDL cholesterol.  Remember, any oil is high in fat and <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;calories so use sparingly. 
<P>


<B>9.  Vegetable broth.</B><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Better for sauting that oils.  Healthier and tastier!.
<P>


<B>10. Canned Tomatoes.</B><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cans of peeled and cut tomatoes are great to have around.  Heat them up with some of your favorite
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;spices and herbs, throw in some roasted or saut d veggies and serve on pasta for a quick and healthy <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;meal.
<P>

<B>11.  Lean Meats.</B><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chicken breasts, fresh fish, tuna, turkey etc.
<P>

<B>12.  Snacks.</B><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A key to any diet plan is to not deprive yourself!  Keep low fat sweets around like Kashi Chocolate <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pillows cereal, licorice, dried fruit, popcorn dry, low fat granola bars etc.
<P>

Now that we have talked about some essentials to keep in the house,  here are some recipes that use some of these ingredients!  These recipes are sure to please and they are easy,  low in fat and
calories.  <P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>THROW TOGETHER SALAD</B><BR>
 This recipe can easily be tailored to fit your tastebuds.  The point of this is the fact that you literally "throw together" your favorite foods to make a healthy salad.
 The way it is listed is simply my favorite way.  The measurements are only approximate measures.  Serves 2 people as a meal.<P>
<B>Fill a large salad bowl with fresh spinach and top with...</B><BR>
<UL>
<LI>1 large fresh tomato         <BR>     <LI>1/2 cup kidney beans<BR>
<LI>1/2 cup garbanzo beans    <BR>        <LI>1/2 cup cold cooked pasta <BR>
<LI>1/3 cup grated fresh parmesan cheese  <BR>         <LI>1/4 cup grated fat free jack cheese<BR>
<LI>top with imitation bacon bits
</UL>
<P>   

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dressing:</B><BR>
  <UL>
<LI TYPE=CIRCLE>1 tablespoon olive oil 
<LI TYPE=CIRCLE>3 tablespoons of balsamic vinegar
<LI TYPE=CIRCLE>1 tablespoon of lemon pepper
<LI TYPE=CIRCLE>1 clove minced garlic. 
</UL>
Serve the salad with fresh warm bread.
<P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>SLOW-BRAISED CHICKEN AND MUSHROOM RAGU' </B>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>1 tsp. olive oil<BR>
<LI>8 skinless chicken breasts, trimmed of any excess fat<BR>
<LI>2 cups sliced onion     <BR>         <LI>1 tbs. minced garlic<BR>
<LI>1/2 lb. portobello mushrooms, sliced thin   <BR>  <LI>1 cup dry white wine<BR>
<LI>1 14 oz can fat free chicken broth    <BR>
<LI>1 tbs. chopped fresh thyme or 1tsp. dried<BR>
<LI>1 lb. spinach, sliced into 3/4 inch ribbons   <BR>  <LI>2 tbs. fresh grated Parmesan cheese <BR>
<LI>2 tbs. chopped fresh Italian Parsley<BR>             <LI>Salt and Pepper to taste
</UL>
<P>

 In a large skillet, heat oil over high heat and add the chicken breasts.
Cook till they are well browned on each side, about 4 min. per side. 
 Remove the chicken and reduce the heat to medium and add the
onions to the pan.  saut  until they are lightly colored and tender about 7
min..  Add the garlic and cook for about 1 minute longer-continue to saut .  Add the mushrooms and cook, stirring, until the mushrooms
are soft and any juices have evaporated about 5 min..  Increase the heat
to medium-high.  Add the wine and let simmer for 5 minutes.  Add the chicken broth, return to a simmer and let cook until the liquid is
reduced by half, about 12 min..  Stir in the thyme and season with salt and pepper.  Reduce the heat to low, return the chicken to the skillet.  Cover and simmer gently until the breasts are quite tender, about 30
minutes.  Remove the chicken to a clean plate.  Gradually stir the spinach
leaves into the mushroom sauce, adding more as the first batch wilts, until all is wilted.  Mound just-cooked fettuccine on a platter, spoon on
the sauce and set the chicken on top.  Sprinkle with parmesan cheese and parsley and serve.Serves 4.

<P>

I mentioned that I would give you some creative ideas for livening up plain non-fat yogurt...<BR>
<B>1.</B>  take a fresh apple and chop it.  Mix it in with your  yogurt with just a dash of cinnamon.<BR>
<B>2. </B> mix in some of your favorite granola<BR>
<B>3. </B>add chopped dried fruit and/or raisins .  <BR>    
Yogurt is low in fat and calories, non-fat yogurt has no fat and about 120 calories per cup. <P>

<B>SUPPLEMENT OF THE WEEK</B>: <BR>
<B>Carnitine</B><BR>
 Although carnitine is not a vitamin or amino acid, carnitine functions as a co-enzyme to help the cells utilize long-chain fatty acids for energy.  There is some evidence
that carnitine also assists the body in balancing blood sugar levels and
improves the liver's ability to burn fat.  Of course, for optimum benefit to any weight reduction program, a well balanced diet, regular physical
activity and consistent behavior modification must be present.  Dietary
sources include:  Beef, chicken, lamb and dairy products like non-fat yogurt.

<FONT SIZE=2><STRONG>AMANDA'S HEALTHY TIPS FOR THE WEEK OF 1/15 & 1/17.</FONT></STRONG>
<P>
<B>DEPRESSED ?</B><BR>

  The holidays are over, the family has gone back home...how are your new years resolutions going?  Do the
thought of these things make you depressed? Well, Fight Back!  There are some very simple and natural ways to fight depression right in your own kitchen.  There is no longer scientific dispute that what you eat can affect you mood-which ever way it swings.  There is
even evidence that people often make unconscious food choices that change brain chemistry and put them in a better
mood.  Even chronic depression has been linked to a long-term, subclinical deficiency of certain nutrients.   Except for caffeine and sugar, few food substances are commonly known to have an influence on moods.  Well, guess what-some of our favorite foods can help us break through the post-holiday depression...Popeye was right!<P>

Folic acid deficiency-ever here of it?  Probably not although it is quite
common in the United States, especially among women.  Folic acid is a B vitamin found in green leafy vegetables like spinach.  Studies
have shown that people who were deliberately deprived of folic acid have lapsed into sleeplessness, forgetfulness and irritability after 5 months.  Once the vitamin was restored in their bodies most of
the symptoms disappeared in 2 days!  Popeye not only ate spinach to keep strong and up beat-he was a sailor-and sailors eat seafood!  
<P>
Seafood is very high in selenium, and several recent studies suggest that people who are deficient in selenium
are more apt to suffer the blues!  A 7oz swordfish steak has the same amount of selenium as the 100-
microgram pill that was used in a popular British study on the effects of
selenium and mood swings.
<P>
Other popular pick-me-up foods are garlic and chili peppers.  "Eating hot
chili peppers may give you a thrill that
is more than purely sensory.  The capsaicin, the hot stuff, in chili peppers
can actually induce in the brain a rush of
endorphins that give you a temporary high."  said Jean Carper, author of Food-Your Miracle Medicine.   If your stomach cannot
handle the spicy foods, there are supplements available that give you all of the benefits of spice, but have heat shields to
protect your stomach.  Check them out in our Nutrition Department.
<P>
So, spicy foods can give you a thrill that is more than hot-what are we going to do about it?  We're gonna
make salsa!  The following recipe is sure to spicy up your mood.  Pile this
salsa on top of baked potato, pasta, or use
for dipping with baked chips or warm tortillas and enjoy!  I found it in a
wonderful little book called Salsas, Chutneys and
Relishes by Linda Ferrair.  (Hint:  if you want to make the salsa spicier,
leave the seeds in.  The capsaicin, or hot stuff, in
chilies is found in the seeds).<P>
<b>Cactus Salsa: (Makes about 2 1/2 cups)</b><UL>
<li>
1 large Anaheim pepper, diced   2 jalapeno peppers, seeds removed, minced 
<li>1/2 pound cactus leaves (nopales), needles and fine quills removed, (or buyalready chopped
leaves).<li>
2 tomatillos, husks removed, diced<li>      2 green onions, diced<li>
2 cloves of garlic, minced <li>     1/4 cup cilantro, chopped<li>
1/4 cup limeade concentrate or orange juice concentrate<li>
1/4 tsp. each of salt and pepper</UL><P>
        Prepare the peppers and transfer them to a bowl.  Put the cactus into
boiling water for 1 minute and plunge into cold water.  Drain and dice.  Add to the peppers.  Add the tomatillos, onions, garlic, and cilantro and toss together.  Mix in as much of the limeade as you like and season with salt
and pepper to taste.  
<P>
This next recipe was one my mom gave to me.  She found it in a book called
Mr. Pasta's Healthy Pasta Cookbook by Rick Rogers.  She admitted that she hadn't tried it yet but it sounded so wonderful that I decided to give it a shot.  Hint: 
be sure that the pie is fully set.  Otherwise when you release the spring
sides it will fall apart. 
<P>
<b>Spinach Pasta Pie</b><UL>
<li>12 oz dry spinach fettucine<li>      1 tsp. olive oil
1 med. onion-chopped    <li> 1 med. red bell pepper, chopped and seeded
<li>2 cloves garlic-minced   <li>10oz pkg. frozen chopped spinach, thawed and squeezed
dry <li>1 1/2 cup reduced fat or fat free ricotta  <li> 1 egg white, (or 1/4 cup liquid
egg substitute)
<li>1 tsp. dry basil        <li> 1 tsp. dry oregano    
<li>1/2 tsp. salt <li>   1/4 tsp. black pepper   
<li>2 cups of your favorite marinara sauce, (herbed)</UL><P>
        Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Pam a 9" spring form pan.  Cook your pasta,
but careful not to over cook.  In a medium non-stick skillet saut the onions, pepper, garlic.   Remove from heat.  In a large bowl combine spinach, cooked veggies, ricotta, egg white, basil, oregano, salt and pepper.  Add
the drained pasta and mix well.  Spoon all of it into spring pan pressing
lightly with the back of a
spoon.  Cover with foil and bake for 20 min.  Uncover and continue to bake 40
min. till set in center,
(when it no longer jiggles).  Run a knife around the pie to release the pie
and allow to cool for 5 min.
before removing the spring form sides.  Serve with sauce warm or at room
temperature without
sauce.<P>

<b>Supplement of the week:  Selenium</b><p> 
Selenium is an essential trace mineral and has been found to be a potent
protector against cardiovascular disease and cancer.  Selenium is a component of glutathione peroxidase, a key  
enzyme that helps protect cell membranes from free radical damage.  Selenium
works well with Vitamin E as an antioxidant and appears important in cancer prevention.
 Recent study reported in The Journal of American Medical Association, (Dec. 1996), revealed a 60% reduction in cancer risk
for those who have adequate selenium intakes, (50-200mcg is recommend a safe
level by the
National Research Council).  <P>

The best food sources of selenium include broccoli, mushrooms,
cabbage, celery, cucumbers, onions, garlic, radishes, brewer's yeast, grains,
and fish.

<B>PASTA RECIPES</B><BR>
<P>
What would we do without pasta?  In these modern times of health
conscious Americans, we have turned to pasta for tasty meals loaded with
carbohydrates, low in fat and topped with fresh vegetables and hearty
sauces.  Pasta is inexpensive, easy to make and prepare.  Pasta also
stores well.  Even homemade pasta can be kept in the freezer for up to 2
months, (sealed in a freezer bag is probably best).  When cooking any
pasta recipe be sure to trim the "unwanteds" whenever possible.  For
example, use salt in moderation.  Spices and fresh herbs are great
substitutes.  
<P>
<IMG ALIGN="LEFT" SRC="mac.jpg" WIDTH=178  HEIGHT=133    HSPACE=8 VSPACE=8 BORDER=0  ALT="Macaroni">


For Christmas my mom got me a wonderful new cookbook called Mr. Pasta's
Healthy Pasta Cookbook by Rick Rodgers.  I have found this book to be a
great source for tasty and healthy recipes.  Each recipe even lists the
nutritional content.  All the recipes this week are from this book and I
encourage you all to try them.  This book proves that pasta no longer
means macaroni and cheese or spaghetti with meatballs!
<P>
This first recipe is what Rick Rodgers calls "<B>upscale macaroni and
cheese</B>".  Personally, I think that description does not do this recipe
justice.  You don't have to use the specific vegetables listed in the
recipe.  Don't be afraid to experiment with different ones or just use
what you've got in the refrigerator.
        <P>
Vegetable and Pasta Bake (serves 8)
<UL>


<LI>1 pound tubular pasta, such as penne
<LI>1 med. onion-chopped
<LI>1 med. red bell pepper, seeded and chopped
<LI>8 oz. fresh mushrooms-sliced    
<LI>1 med. Italian squash-cut into bite sized pieces
<LI>2 garlic cloves, minced
<LI>2 cups non-fat cottage or ricotta cheese
<LI>3/4 cup evaporated skim milk
<LI>4 large egg whites
<LI>4 roma tomatoes-chopped
<LI>1 10oz pkg. frozen spinach, defrosted and squeezed dry
<LI> 1/2 cup chopped fresh basil
<LI>1/2 teaspoon salt
<LI>1/4 teaspoon black pepper
<LI>1 cup shredded nonfat mozzarella cheese, (about 4 oz.)
</UL>
<P>

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Lightly spray a 13X9 inch baking dish
with non-stick cooking spray.  In a large pot of boiling water, cook the
pasta until just tender, about 7 minutes. (Don't overcook;  the pasta
will cook further in the oven.)  Drain, rinse under cold water, drain
well, and return to the pot.  In a large non-stick skillet, (lined with
cooking spray), saute the onion, red pepper, zucchini, mushrooms, and
garlic and cook, covered, until the onions have softened and the
mushrooms have released their liquid, about 5 minutes.  Uncover and cook
until all the liquid has evaporated, about 3 minutes.  Stir the
vegetable mixture into the pasta.  In a food processor or blender,
process the cottage or ricotta cheese, milk, and egg until smooth.  
Pour over the pasta.  Add the tomatoes, spinach, and basil and mix
well.  Transfer the pasta to the prepared baking dish, and sprinkle with
the mozzarella cheese.  Bake until golden brown on top, 25-35 minutes. 
Let stand for 5 minutes before serving.

This next recipe appealed to me because I love beans with pasta.  <BR>
<B>The escarole </B>is a nice addition with some folic acid, fiber and vitamin A. 

Of course the beans are also a good source fiber and low-fat protein.

<UL>

<LI>Escarole and White Beans with Penne(serves 8)
<LI>1 head of garlic
<LI>1 med. onion-chopped
<LI>2 tsp. olive oil
<LI>2 cups chicken broth
<LI>2 med. heads of escarole-cut into 1 inch pieces
<LI>1/4 tsp. salt
<LI>1/4 tsp. crushed hot red pepper
<LI>1 16oz can of white kidney beans
<LI>1 pound dried penne or other tubular pasta
</UL>

<P>
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.  Loosely wrap the head of garlic in
aluminum foil. Bake until the garlic is soft when squeezed, (protect you
hands from getting burned), about 20 minutes depending on the size of
the head.  Unwrap the garlic and allow to cool slightly.  Cut the garlic
in half horizontally, and squeeze the softened pulp onto a small plate. 
Mash the garlic pulp with a fork into a puree.  
<P>
<IMG ALIGN="LEFT" SRC="escarole2.jpg" WIDTH=178   HEIGHT=133    HSPACE=8 VSPACE=8 BORDER=0  ALT="Pasta">
In a large saucepan,
heat the oil over medium-low heat.  Add the onion and cook, covered,
until softened, about 3 minutes.  Add the broth, increase the heat to
medium-high, and bring to a boil. Add the escarole in batches, covering
and waiting for one batch to wilt before adding the next.  Add the
garlic puree, salt, and crushed red pepper to the escarole.  Reduce the
heat to low, cover, and simmer until the escarole is tender, about 15
minutes.  Add the beans and cook until heated through, about 5 minutes. 
<P>
<IMG ALIGN="RIGHT" SRC="escarole.jpg" WIDTH=178   HEIGHT=133    HSPACE=8 VSPACE=8 BORDER=0  ALT="Pasta">

Meanwhile, in a large pot of boiling water, cook the pasta until just
tender, about 8 minutes.  Drain and return to the pot.  Add the escarole
and beans to the pasta and toss well. Transfer to a warmed serving bowl
and serve immediately.<BR>

<STRONG>Vitamin E Recipes</STRONG><br>
<P>
February is Heart Health Month, so all month I will do my best to focus
on recipes that are high in fiber, use "good fats," and have natural
vitamin E sources.  This week we are going to focus on natural vitamin E
sources.  
<P>
What are antioxidants?  Research has shown antioxidants seem to protect
the body from the everyday cell damage caused by free radicals, produced
in normal metabolism, by rendering them inactive.  Scientists seem to
think that free radical damage, if left unchecked, may increase the risk
of heart disease and cancer.  A diet high in antioxidants, namely
Vitamin E, Beta Carotene, and Vitamin C, have shown to be protective for
most degenerative disease. On-going research in this area will provide
more definitive answers to keep us all healthy in the years to come.  
<P>
Vitamin E can be found naturally in many foods including broccoli,
cooked leafy dark greens like kale and spinach, corn, sweet potatoes,
oatmeal, wheat germ, legumes, grains and some fish.  Be sure to
use whole grain flours and grains.  Processing can remove 60-90% of
vitamins B6 and E, folate, and other nutrients.  For this reason,
unbleached flour is a better choice than bleached, but whole wheat
flour is the better choice.  (Everyday Cooking with Dr. Dean Ornish).  
<P>
Some further reading about Vitamin E and antioxidants can be found at
Boney's.  Look for Dr.Stephen Sinatra's book, <I>Heartbreak Heart Disease</I>,
(1996) and Dr. Dean Ornish's <I>Everyday Cooking with Dr. Dean Ornish</I>,
(1996).
<P>



<B>Bean and Barley Soup</B><BR> (serves about 8, 1 cup per person)
<P>

<H4><FONT color="#000080">Absorbable Screw</H4></FONT>

<STRONG>The Absorbable Screw:</STRONG>
Absorbable screws have been used in Europe for the past eight years.  Approximately 100 surgeons in the US are using the screws since they have received FDA approval.  The screws are made of lactic acid, a naturally occurring substance in the body.  The screws decompose in three months, breaking down into water and carbon dioxide.  This alleviates the need for a second surgery to remove the screw and helps reduce the cost of surgery.<P>

<STRONG>Widespread Usage:</STRONG>
The screw is being used in facial plastic surgery, knee reconstruction, and large and small joints in the hand and foot.  I think these screws will replace metal screws in almost all surgical indications, says Washington, D.C. Podiatrist and Surgeon, Stephen Kominsky, D.P.M.  <P>

I cant imagine that theres a surgeon out there that once they become aware of the product and try it one or two times, that they wont switch over,  he says.
<P>
Dr. Kominsky uses the new screws for fracture repair, ankle fractures, fusion of joints, and cutting and repositioning bones.  Over 50 percent of his use is for bunion correction.
<P>		
<STRONG>The Absorbable vs. The Metal Screw:</STRONG>
<br>
- 50% of metal screws are removed because the head or tip of the screw cause tissue 
irritation.  
<br>
- Metal screws may cause a visible lump in the skin.
<br>
- The head of the absorbable screw is burned off during surgery so that there is no 
protrusion.
<P>
<STRONG>Side Effects:</STRONG>
After multiple studies both here and abroad so far there are no known side effects to 
the absorbable screw.
<P>
<STRONG>Cost:</STRONG>
The absorbable screw initially costs $20.00 more than metallic screws.  However, the absorbable screws will save the patient the $2-3,000 they would have spent for a second surgery had the metal screw been used.

When most folks think of acupuncture, tiny, sharp needles come to 
mind.  But for several years now, therapists have been using low-energy 
lasers instead.  One doctor in Boston is using laser acupuncture to 
alleviate the pain associated with carpal tunnel syndrome.
<P>
Michael Montuori hopes the painless red light from this laser will help 
him avoid a more radical and costly treatment for carpal tunnel 
syndrome.

<EM>"I'd rather try this before I try surgery.  Surgery is the last resort."</EM><P>

Doctor Margaret Naeser stimulates acupuncture points with a low-
energy laser beam.  She also uses a device called Microamps (micro-
amps) TENS, which sends a small electrical current to the wrist.  The  
alternative treatment is considered experimental.

<EM>"Acupuncture with low frequency electrical stimulation tends to promote 
a very high level of beta endorphin plus cortisol.  So you get a pain-
killing effect, plus, because of the cortisol, an anti-inflammatory effect."</EM><P>

Gregory McBride volunteered for the study because his hand and wrist pain was so bad, bicycle racing became impossible.
<P>

<STRONG>Gregory McBride</STRONG><BR>
<STRONG>Carpal Tunnel Syndrome Sufferer</STRONG><BR>
<EM>"I had the treatment about a year and a half ago.  No recurrent pain 
whatsoever."</EM><P>

Carpal tunnel syndrome is often brought on by the stress of repetitive 
motions like typing. The result is an inflammation of the area 
surrounding one of the nerves in the wrist.
<P>

<STRONG>Margaret Naeser, Ph.D.</STRONG><BR>
<STRONG>Licensed Acupuncturist</STRONG><BR>
<STRONG>Boston VA Medical Center</STRONG><BR>

<EM>"Our best results are obtained when the patient's hand is treated every 
48 hours for the first three or four weeks.  And so far, I have eight cases 
and all eight cases have gone to pain zero."</EM><P>

A growing number of acupuncturists in the U.S. are trained in laser 
acupuncture.  Doctor Naeser says patients can also treat themselves at 
home with a few lessons, a laser pen and a Microamps TENS device.
<P>
Doctor Naeser says using low-energy laser acupuncture is not a 
substitute for traditional medical care.  If patents use the laser pen, they 
should be under the supervision of a licensed acupuncturist. Low-
energy lasers should not be used by pregnant women.

Two million children in the United States are known to have attention 
deficit disorder.  It's a syndrome that makes them restless and 
hyperactive.  Scientists are not sure what causes A-D-D,  but 
researchers in California and Canada  have discovered the first  
abnormal gene  associated  with it.  It' s a closer step in developing 
more effective medications of the disorder. <P>

This is show and tell at  a special class of  six, seven and eight-year-
olds on the University of California campus in Irvine.  All of these 
students have Attention Deficit Disorder.   While the kids talk, social workers watch their attention span and listening skills. <P>


Watching  the behavior of a child with Attention Deficit Disorder is one 
way to understand  it.  But it doesn't help parents who wonder  why 
their child has the disorder in the first place. So scientists are looking to 
a child's biological background for the answers. <P>


<STRONG>James Swanson, M.D.<BR>
Director, Child Development Center<BR>
University of California Irvine, CA</STRONG><BR>
<EM>"The diagnosis currently is based completely on subjective 
information."</EM> <P>

The scientists studied 39 children between the ages of seven and 12  
diagnosed with A-D-D and compared them to a similar number  of 
healthy children.  They found about half of the children with A-D-D 
had a gene containing a unique segment that repeats itself seven 
times. <P>


<STRONG>James Swanson, M.D.</STRONG><BR>
<EM>"We've been studying a gene that encodes a protein that's involved in 
the transmission of signals between brain cells."</EM><P>



The gene  is one of the dopamine receptors in the brain. <P>


<STRONG>James Swanson, M.D.</STRONG><BR>
<EM>"Dopamine is a chemical that is involved in the transmission of signals 
between brain cells."</EM> <P>

Scientists say understanding how the brain cells of a child  with A-D-D 
work is the key to getting a closer look at what causes the disorder.
Researchers at the University of California say their study will also 
help refine the medications like Ritalin which A-D-D patients now 
take.

<P>


When 10-month old Kelsey Dantu gets a check-up it's a family affair, a
pretty typical doctor's visit, but one the Dantu's might not have been
able to afford without the help of California's AIM program.
<P>
Angela was a stay-at-home mom with one child when she learned she was
pregnant last year.  Husband Michael works full time, but his company
insurance didn't offer maternity benefits.  He also made too much to
qualify for Medi-cal or Medicare.
<P>
But the AIM program is designed to assist people who are under insured
or uninsured.
<P>
That's the Dantu's.  They're comfortably middle income but Angela says a
six thousand dollar out-of-pocket delivery would have meant bankruptcy.
<P>
But because of the AIM program, the Dantu's paid only 600 dollars and
baby Kelsi's covered until she's two-years-old.
<P>
Surprisingly, the program that so helped Angela is not well-known.   
Project Director Carin Holliday says people in the middle income range
aren't in the mind set  to think they'd be eligible for such a program.
 <P>
The AIM program is not an entitlement.  It's paid for by tobacco and
cigarette tax revenues.  Participants pay a portion of their care capped
at two percent of their family income.
<P>
     
<B>Who's eligible?</B><BR>

A single women earning between $20,700 and $31,000 annually or a family
earning between $31,200 and $46,700 annually with no or inadequate
insurance.
<P>

<H4><FONT color="#000080">Alzheimer's Eye Test</H4></FONT><FONT size=2>

A drop commonly used by ophthalmologists to examine a person's eyes 
may also prove to be the most accurate test for diagnosing Alzheimer's 
Disease. The Alzheimer's Eye Test could eventually replace the difficult, 
costly and often inconclusive tests currently available.  Doctors in Boston are using a drug called tropicamide to identify early 
signs of Alzheimer's Disease.  <P>


Leonard Scinto, Ph.D.<BR>
Brigham & Women's Hospital  <BR>
Boston, MA<BR>
<EM>"What we look for are any significant changes in pupil size over the 
original baseline readings. If it exceeds a certain threshold, then we call 
that, based on our original study, a positive pupil response."</EM><P>



According to Doctor Scinto's earlier studies, 
the pupil of an Alzheimer's patient dilates 13% in response to the 
eyedrops compared to just four percent in healthy individuals.  The pupil test can diagnose a person before the symptoms of Alzheimer's Disease ever appear.<P>


Leonard Scinto, Ph.D.<BR>
<EM>"The reason we would want to diagnose individuals who are really pre-
symptomatic is that the strategy on which many new therapies that are 
being developed is predicated is to administer very early in the course of 
the disease in order to have the best chance of being efficacious at 
slowing the progress of the disease." </EM><P>



Richard Pyle joined the study to find out whether Alzheimer's Disease 
was to blame for his recent forgetfulness.<P>


Richard Pyle     <BR>       
Study Subject  <BR>

<EM>"I'm worried that I might have Alzheimer's because my memory isn't 
what it used to be."</EM><P>



His test results are confidential since the clinical study is still underway.  
Researchers intend to expand the study.  If the test continues to be 
effective, it should be on the market in the next couple years.  Alzheimer's Disease affects between 2-4 million Americans at a cost of $80 
billion dollars a year.  The eye test is certainly not a cure for Alzheimer's 
Disease but early diagnosis will one day make treatment more effective.  <P>

Forty million people suffer from some form of arthritis. Millions more have to 
deal with chronic pain. Often good nutrition is the first thing these patients give 
up,  because preparing a healthy meal is too difficult.<P>

Janet Austin developed rheumatoid arthritis at the age of sixteen. Like many 
people with chronic pain, cooking was so painful and exhausting janet let good 
nutrition slide.<P>


Janet Austin, Ph.D.<BR>
Has Arthritis<BR>
<EM>"To try and prepare a full course meal was just too much for me." </EM><P>

Sarah Morgan, M.D.<BR>
University of Alabama<BR>
Birmingham<BR>
<EM>"They were telling me that it was easier to go to the fast food restaurant then to 
cook. That it's hard to chew when you have arthritis. When your fingers are 
inflamed it's hard to cut things up."</EM><P>


Janet, along with Dr. Sarah Morgan, developed the Essential Arthritis 
Cookbook to help those with chronic pain. <P>

Sarah Morgan, Ph.D.	<BR>	<EM>"It's not just a collection of recipes. I really think of it as an arthritis source book 
and so it provides a lot of information."</EM><P>



There is no cure-all arthritis diet. But the book includes vitamin and mineral 
requirements plus food sources for arthritis sufferers.  A chapter on kitchen 
basics covers kitchen layout and energy saving cooking positions.  It also 
offers tips on the most comfortable utensils to use and how to modify them. <P>


Sarah Morgan, Ph.D.	<BR>
<EM>"Many of these you can make in your own home. You don't have to rush out 
and spend a great deal of money."</EM><P>



These days Janet's eating healthier and feeling better about being able to 
provide nutritional meals for herself and her family.<P>





The Essential Arthritis Cookbook  is available in bookstores and through 
Appletree Press for about twenty-five dollars. <P>

<H4><FONT color="#000080">Aspirin Advantage</H4></FONT><FONT size=2>

If you take aspirin to reduce your risk of heart disease, you may be getting 
more than you bargained for.  In the first part of our two part series on cancer 
control, a recent study shows that aspirin may also help prevent colon cancer. <P>

After looking through 47 thousand questionnaires, researchers at Harvard 
Medical School discovered a link between aspirin use and colon cancer. <P>

Edward Giovannucci, M.D., Ph.D.<BR>
Epidemiologist<BR>
Brigham & Women's Hospital<BR>
Boston, MA<BR>
<EM>"We found that women who had been taking aspirin for at least 10 years, 
possibly up to 20 years, had a lower risk of colon cancer.  And in essence, 
they had a 44% reduction in risk of colon cancer."</EM><P>  

As part of the ongoing nurse's health study, doctors found that women taking 
four to six aspirin a week benefited the most.  Since aspirin can cause 
stomach ulcers and bleeding, Doctor Giovannucci doesn't recommend routine 
aspirin use for everyone.  <P>

Edward Giovannucci, M.D., Ph.D.  <BR>
<EM>"Well, the people that are most likely to benefit are the people who have a 
family history of colon cancer."</EM><P> 

Doctors think aspirin prevents the growth of tumors by slowing down the 
normal division of cancer cells.  <P>



Judy Beard was diagnosed with colon cancer two years ago.  Today, she is 
cancer-free and hopes to stay that way with low-fat cooking and regular 
exercise.  She's not sure if she'll add aspirin to her diet.  <P>


Judy Beard <BR>
Colon Cancer Patient  <BR>
<EM>"Aspirin is not without risk, and I actually, know it upsets my stomach.  I'd 
certainly have to take coated aspirin at least.  But anything like that, I think is 
worth looking into."</EM><P> 

Since the benefit of aspirin was observed only after years of use , doctors don't 
know if aspirin also plays a role in preventing tumors from growing back. <P>
 

Doctor Giovannucci says earlier studies showed aspirin use reduces colon 
cancer risk among men.  He also says other lifestyle factors that protect 
against colon cancer include eating fruit and vegetables and exercising 
regularly.  On the other hand, obesity and diets high in animal fats found in red 
meat increase the risk.  In the second part of our two part series on cancer 
control, we'll examine a new tool for reading mammograms that will reduce the 
number of screening mistakes. <P>

A one mile walk or run can put 60 to 100 tons of pressure on a foot. 
That's a heavy load especially when you're wearing the wrong athletic 
shoes.
<P>
Marathon runner Mary Beth Romig runs about 50 miles a week . She 
buys new running shoes every two months.

Mary Beth Romig<BR>                  
Marathon runner<BR>
<EM>"I can tell when my shoes are breaking down right away, my knees start 
to bother me during a run. After a run my heel starts hurting."</EM>
<P>
Worn out shoes are a problem for all athletes- from weekend warriors to 
the serious. Shin splints, plantar fasciitis, stress fractures and achilles 
tendonitis are commonly caused by poor footwear.
<P>

Tulane University Medical Center<BR>                                    
 New Orleans, LA<BR>
<EM>"Those all relate to repetitive stress over a period of time, where the foot 
doesn't handle it well and starts to break down in some form or fashion."</EM>
<P>

The most expensive, greatest looking shoe isn't necessarily the best.<P>
Kyle Julian       <BR>                
Shoe manager<BR>
<EM>"A lot of people just walk in and say 'Oh, that looks good, give me that.'"</EM><P>

Comfort is more important than looks. Go with what feels good on your 
foot. Try on  a lot of different styles before buying.<P>


Kyle Julian<BR>
<EM>"You basically want to get a shoe, a fit where it's going to give you at 
least a thumbnail between the tip of your toe and the front of your shoe. 
Which allows for expanding of your feet as you do exercise." </EM><P>


It's also good to know before you start shopping whether you're flat 
footed or high arched.<P>


Michael Brunet M.D.<BR>
<EM>"She's got shin splints and she's got a high arch. Athletes who have high 
arches don't have good shock absorbers for feet."</EM><P>

High arches need a shoe that will bend. Flat feet need a more rigid 
shoe. And if you've wondered what these  little heel windows are, 
They're pockets of air that help absorb shock every time your foot hits 
the ground...
<P>

Mary Beth Romig<BR>
<EM>"I've learned shoes are a runner's best friend-good shoes are a runner's 
best friend."</EM><P>

Having a knowledgeable sales clerk can go along way when buying 
athletic shoes. If you're not getting the answers you need, then ask for 
someone who can further help you. It can mean the difference between 
good health or an injury.

<H4><FONT color="#000080">Attention Defecit Disorder</H4></FONT><FONT size=2>


An alternative to drugs for treating kids with too much energy and not 
enough concentration.  Experts say more than two million children in the U.S. suffer from 
Attention Deficit Disorder. Most are treated with stimulant drugs, the 
most popular being Ritalin.<P>



More than six million children receive psychiatric drug prescriptions 
every year.  Experts say while there's no question drug treatment can 
vastly improve the lives of children suffering from depression, panic 
disorder and A.D.D., many wonder if too many kids are on drugs for the 
wrong reasons. <P>


Marvin Silverman<BR>
Child Psychologist<BR>
<EM>"Unfortunately, a lot of children get diagnosed after visiting a doctor for a 
couple of minutes and are given a prescription and they may have 
something other than attention deficit that needs to be addressed."</EM> <P> 


Parents are often told medication is the only answer, but some 
determined parents like Ginny Dutton aren't satisfied until they find an 
alternative that works.<P>


Ginny Dutton<BR>
Mother<BR>
<EM>"What a blessing.  This is miracle stuff here."</EM><P>


Ginny and her 11-year-old daughter Phoebe, travel 10 hours every 
week so Phoebe can undergo biofeedback to help her with Attention 
Deficit Disorder.  Phoebe was on Ritalin for years.  Then, her mother 
said, enough is enough.<P>


Ginny Dutton<BR>
<EM>"I didn't want her to be dependent on that and I knew it wasn't doing 
everything it could do.  It was kind of putting a Band-Aid over it, and we 
could get through school, but we still weren't addressing the issue, we 
were covering it up."</EM><P>





New research shows the brains of kids with A.D.D. are different .  
There's is less activity in the areas of the brain that control attention and 
concentration.  During biofeedback, Phoebe is taught how to force her 
brain to behave differently.<P>


Gerald Gluck<BR>
Neurotherapist<BR>
<EM>"That's the key to biofeedback.  She directly intervenes the change and 
self regulates her own brain physiology."</EM><P>


Gary Magid<BR>
Psychiatrist<BR>
<EM>"It's the one alternative that we know which has very long-lasting effects, 
and really allows the child to get very very close to normalizing."</EM><P>

Phoebe Dutton<BR>
Has A.D.D.<BR>
<EM>"I just want to be normal.  That's all I've wanted to be for eight years since I 
discovered I was hyperactive and everything.  I only wanted to be 
normal."</EM><P>



Before putting kids on medication or biofeedback for A.D.D., parents 
must make sure their child has been properly diagnosed.  That requires 
extensive psychological testing.  With all the publicity about A.D.D., critics fear many kids are being labeled hyperactive when they're not. In part three of our series we'll look at a nutritional supplement that is replacing prescription drugs to 
treat A.D.D.  <P>

The number one reason people
go to the doctor--back pain.  Traditional treatments such as
surgery, medication and rest don't
always work.
    That's why hundreds of San Diegans
are turning to treatment options that
often do work.
    The key element is personal
responsibility. 
    All this week, we'll be talking
with former back pain sufferers who
took control of their pain through
several local programs.
    We begin with the Egoscue Method. <P>


Adam Klarer is a very physical guy with
a very physical job.  Adam is a Channel 10News photographer.  But five years
ago, in a matter of seconds, Adam's
life changed.<P>
 
Adam Klarer<BR>
News Photographer<BR>
<EM>"In December of '91, I just reached over to pick up my son, turned
sideways to pick him up.  What followed was blinding pain.  it must be what it feels like to
get shot in the back or stabbed in the back.  It was severe."</EM><P>
 
The diagnosis?  A herniated disc.  Adam
was out of work 2 months.<P>
Adam Klarer<BR>
<EM>"I basically had to restructure my
life, how I move, how I think before
I move.  It involved a lifestyle
change."</EM><P>
All of which helped until the pain came
back. It happenned recently while Adam
was lifting some gear from his car. 
This time, his pain was compounded by
fear, fear that he wouldn't be able to
provide for his family.<P>
Adam Klarer<BR>
<EM> "To face the prospect of being
out of work for any length of
time, even permanently, is frightening."</EM><P>
 
But Adam's new HMO health plan left him
discouraged.<P>
Adam Klarer<BR>
<EM>"They basically don't want to see
you.  So I decided it was time to do
something a little bit different."</EM><P>
 
 
Adam went to the Egoscue Method
clinic in Del Mar.  He was assigned a
therapist who listened and then made a computerized postural
evaluation.<P>
 
 Michael Bellofatto<BR>
Therapist<BR>
<EM> "I'm manipulating the stick
figures so that the computer is gonna
look just like Adam.  I saw his right hip was
elevating and both femurs point out when he walks."
</EM><P>
Adam has become what's called
dysfunctional.  The Egoscue Method is
geared to restore that function.<P>

 Pete Egoscue<BR>
The Egoscue Method<BR>
<EM>"In Adam's case, what has
happenned is he's responded to all of
the stimulus of his environment.  What
happenned to him is his body's
implementation of that stimulus.  He's going to go through a series
of exercises specifically designed to change his body, posture,
how he stands, walks and moves.  If
we're correct, when we're finished, he'll feel much better."</EM><P>
 

And so, for the next 8 weeks, Adam will
do his routine each day at home. Every
week or two,  he'll check back in with
the clinic to update his routine based
on the progress he's made, progress
that's largely up to him.<P>
 Pete Egoscue<BR>
<EM> "We allow them to understand the
true cause of the problem, then we
give them a vehicle for them to correct those problems."</EM><P>
 

 These days, Adam is back doing what he
loves, pain-free and with renewed
confidence, he'll be around as long as
there's news to shoot.<P>

Adam Klarer<BR>
<EM>"I don't think an injury's gonna
be so quick to happen now that I'm
actually treating the problem, not just
getting a massage or icing for the
symptoms.  I'm doing something to
correct the whole fundamental problem."</EM><P>


    Adam will continue a maintenance
program indefinitely to help him remain
functional.

   The Egoscue Method can be applied to
most any musculal-skeletal problem, from neck and shoulder pain to hip,
knee and foot pain.<P>

<H4><FONT color="#000080">Back Pain:  Jim Davis Connection</H4></FONT><FONT size=2>
   Jim Davis, a Carlsbad gym owner
knows all about back pain. 
   Along his journey to find relief,
Davis stumbled upon something that
worked.
    And he's using it to change
people's lives.<P>
Since a back injury nearly 25 years
ago, exercise has been out of the
question for 69-year-old Felix Meza.<P>

Felix Mezda<BR>
Back Patient<BR>
<EM>"I couldn't.  I couldn't even
walk, couldn't water my grass.  When
I turned, I had spasms that were just
terrible."</EM><P>
 
Fed up with pain killers and
muscle relaxants, Felix got off
medication 3 years ago.  But he still
had to put up with the pain.  Until a
year ago, when everything changed. 
Felix went to thw Jim Davis
Connection Gym and signed up for 11
sessions.<P>
<EM>"After the third session I could
move.  After the 11th, I had no more
pain.  I haven't had any pain
since."</EM><P>
Felix's miracle was not the
result of anything fancy or high tech.
He did it himself with this special
pulley system for weight training
designed by Jim Davis. The handles are
the key.<P>

Jim Davis<BR>
Jim Davis Connection<BR>
<EM>"I have a handle, a set of
handles.  The vectors and length are
put together in such a way that you can
go through a full range of motion very comfortably."</EM><P>
 
Davis came up with the pulley
concept while looking for relief from
years of pain from severe arthritis in
his spine.  The equipment at his gym
just didn't cut it.<P>

 
 Jim Davis<BR>
Jim Davis Connection<BR>
<EM>"But it wasn't really getting
success because my joints, especially
my spine really hurt."</EM><P>
 
But when he tried a little
stretching on a cable machine, an idea
started to take shape.  Experimenting
in his own garage, Davis invented a
unique set of handles and
bindings which, when attached to a
weight cable system, allows the user to
develop a full range of motion.  It
worked.<P>
 
Jim Davis<BR>
Jim Davis Connection<BR>
<EM>"Then I discovered that
everyone, given the right
teaching, could get the same movement.
 It's kind of like tai chi with resistance."</EM><P>
 
And virtually anyone can do
it.<P>

 
 
<EM> "One gentleman is 88.  When he
started with us four weeks ago, he
couldn't walk up stairs.  Now he's
doing it unassisted.  So we can
start where you're at."</EM><P>
 
But the real news is how people
with all kinds of physical
problems, ranging from chronic back
pain to MS can benefit.<P>

Jim Davis<BR>
<EM>"We've noticed that people, even
with pain, get stronger, start to
feel better and better, and can deal with the pain."</EM><P>
 

 
When it comes to pain, Davis
says sometimes you have to take
control.  Doctors don't have all the
answers.<P>

Jim Davis<BR>
<EM>"Doctors in my life have done some
really great things and helped me in my
journey, but they didn't get me there.
 It was my determination to deal with
my pain and manage it."</EM><P>

People of all
abilities use the Davis
Connection, professional athletes to
severely disabled.
   The same principles apply.  <P>

Davis Connection at 619-931-1582. </STRONG><BR><A HREF="Stayhealthymain.html">-back-</A></FONT>

The solution to a bad back may
be back school.
   In our continuing series on
solutions to back pain, the Paul Chek
Center is helping many San Diego back
pain sufferers learn how to avoid and
overcome back pain.<P>

   Bard Bruce calls himself a fanatic
bike rider.  But that's putting it
lightly.<P>

Bard Bruce<BR>
Back Patient<BR>
<EM>"I ride about 250 miles a week."</EM><P>

It's hard to believe bard had major
back surgery a few years ago.<P>


 Bard Bruce<BR>
<EM> "I have three bad discs in my lower
back.  I was having pain in my legs and my back would lock up."</EM><P>

Surgery provided relief.  But it
was short-lived.<P>

Bard Bruce<BR>
<EM>"A month after I had the
surgery, my back really went south."</EM><P>
 
Riding a bike was the last
thing on his mind.  Driving a car was
challenge enough.<P>

Bard Bruce<BR>
<EM> "I used to get in a car and get
out and couldn't stand up straight."</EM><P>
 
A firefighter, Bard also
couldn't work.  Fed up, he tried Paul
Chek's center in La Jolla and
started doing exercises specific to his
problem.<P>


Paul Chek<BR>
Back Therapist<BR>
<EM> "Exercise is the only proven
modality to help back pain.  They've
tried drugs, heat, stretching, but the
only thing that consistently works is
exercise.  Exercise is like a drug.  If you
give someone the wrong exercise, you
get the wrong response, just like if
you give the wrong drug.  For me it's a very simple
procedure.  You have quads, hamstrings,
butt, abdominal, back and lat muscles. 
Those muscle groups all have to be
conditioned, all have to work together
to support your back and the
surrounding structures."</EM><P>


An analysis of the length and
strength of various muscle groups
determines where to begin. <P>


 Rhonda Fuller<BR>
Therapist<BR>
<EM> "Squat position down, chest
up and rotate from the hip spine area."</EM><P>
 
With a little help from
Therapist Rhonda Fuller, Larry Addleson
is pain-free and has worked up to a
weight-training program that keeps him
that way.<P>

Paul compares a bad back to a bicycle
wheel that's out of alignment.<P>

Paul Chek<BR>
<EM>"You look at the wheel, say my
wheel's bent and I'm going to throw it
away, or I can't ride my bicycle
anymore.  Well, that's what doctors are
telling you to do.  You've got a bent
wheel.  Put your bike in the garage.  
You bring the bike to me, I look at
your wheel, that spoke's loose and that
one's tight.  We tighten the loose
ones, loosen the tight ones and you
say, hey my whole wheel rolls straight
again!"</EM><P>


Bard Bruce's spoke's are
perfectly balanced these days and
his bike runs pretty good too!<P>
The Paul Chek
program takes clients from simple
stretches and floor exercises to weight
training and more vigorous
workouts, and continues on a
maintenance basis.  <P>

Back pain can ruin you life.  However, you
can now take charge and get that pain
under control.
   Back care has come home, to
home video that is.<P>
    To look at her, you'd never know
fitness instructor, Diane Wall suffers
from chronic back problems.<P>

Diane Wall<BR>
<EM>"I've had back problems for 10
years and I manage my back and the only
way to take care of it in the long run
is to do exercises and strengthening
movements and it's not fun and it does
take commitment but pain is a huge
motivator."</EM><P>

   And if you're motivated, Diane has
created an exercise routine you'll be
interested in.
   It's a two tape series called
Stretch 101 and Back 101 that will help
you deal with the real life challenges
your back faces.<P>

Diane Wall<BR>
<EM>"Taking care of your back is a
daily thing. And you need to adjust
your posture about a hundred times to
offset what you do everyday in terms of
sitting, reading eating driving
carrying thing.  Five years of therapy taught me
a lot. And what I try do is warm up
the muscles around your back, then
strengthen your back and then follow
with more stretching. And
so it's a well planned well thought our
routine."</EM><P>
 
   Now this routine won't make you
buff but when you live with chronic
pain who cares.<P>


<STRONG>   The tapes cost $19.95 each.

<H4><FONT color="#000080">Back Pain:  Epidural Spinal Cord Stimulator</H4><FONT size=2>
There's new help for back pain
sufferers.
   Many times back pain is caused by a
buldging disc that presses on a nerves
in the spine.
   Surgery on the disc works for 70% of
patients.
   However, for the rest, it's a life of
frustration and pain.<P>

  Joe Varhegyi has back
problems from an injury he received
while changing a flat tire.

For now, Joe
isn't ready for surgery.  However, to get him off debilitating
levels of pain medication, he has
received what called an epidural spinal
cord stimulator.<P>
  It's an implanted device that blocks
pain signals.  Doctors surgically implant an
electrode in the spine at the source of
the pain.  It's attached to a pacemaker like
device that emits signals.  Patients operate the stimulator with
a hand held controller which sends
radio signals through the skin.<P>
  The controller is completely external.  It's simply taped in place, so it can
be easily removed for bathing or
swimming.  Patients can even test out the
device before undergoing implant
surgery.<BR><A HREF="Stayhealthymain.html">-back-</A></FONT>

<B>Diagnosing Breast Cancer:</B>
Breast cancer is the second most common life-threatening disorder in women, and the number two killer of women age 35 to 54.  Early detection can mean the difference between developing cancer or not.  In fact, when breast cancer is caught while still within the mammary ducts, it approaches a 100 percent cure rate.  Biopsy is an important means of diagnosing breast cancer.  It involves removing a portion of the suspicious lesion (tissue damaged by disease or injury) and running tests on the 
specimen to determine if it is cancerous or not.  Eighty percent of breast biopsies turn out to be non-cancerous.<P>

<B>Biopsy Methods:</B>
Physicians have several biopsy methods to choose from.  These include fine needle 
aspiration (FNA), in which a needle is inserted into the mass, and a specimen is withdrawn with a syringe.  However, this method provides a limited quantity of the specimen.  Furthermore, the needle has a tendency to bend, resulting in imprecise targeting.  Another method is a tru-cut core biopsy.  This ultrasound-guided method 
uses a core biopsy gun with a larger needle to acquire tissue.  This method requires multiple insertions in order to obtain enough tissue for diagnosis.  Finally, doctors can opt for a surgical biopsy, during which a specimen is removed through an open incision.  This is the most expensive and time consuming method of biopsy.
<P>
<B>Mammotomy:</B>
Now, physicians have a new and more accurate biopsy method.  The method, called 
mammotomy, involves inserting a slender probe (called a mammatome) into the breast with the aid of ultrasound.  A vacuum then draws in tissue through an opening on the side of the probe.  The tissue is removed from the probe by a high-speed rotating cutter, thus eliminating the need to remove then reinsert the probe to obtain more tissue.  The probe is rotated around the clock to obtain a sufficient sampling of the tissue.  In addition, breast implants are protected from the biopsy process because the opening can be turned away from the implant.  The entire process takes about five to 10 minutes.  It is approved by the Food and Drug Administration and is perfomed by radiologists and breast surgeons in hospitals and breast centers, including Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York, the Mayo Clinic in Minneapolis, Baylor-Komen Alliance Breast Center in Dallas, and Cedars Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles.
<P>
<B>Eliminating Misdiagnosis:</B>
Errors can arise from under-sampling breast tissue in needle biopsies that may 
be eliminated with mammotomy.  These include:
<BR>
- Better removal of calcification (tiny flecks of calcium in the breast that need to be sampled to accurately diagnose the presence of associated cancer).  Calcifications not retrieved dropped from 17 percent with needle biopsies to only four percent with mammotomy.
<BR>
- Less chance of misdiagnosing cancer as atypical ductal hyperplasia (ADH) -- a recancerous condition.  Fifty percent of lesions identified as ADH by needle biopsy turned out to be cancer at surgery, compared to only 19 percent with mammotomy.
<BR>
- Less chance of misdiagnosing invasive cancer (or cancer that can spread) as duct carcinoma in situ (DCIS) -- an early cancer confined to the ducts of the breast.  Sixteen percent of cancers diagnosed as DCIS by needle biopsy were actually invasive, while only eight percent were misdiagnosed with mammotomy (results based on research my Roger J. Jackman, M.D. at Palo Alto Medical Clinic in California).

<H4><FONT color="#000080">The Birth Place</H4></FONT>

Giving birth has come along way from the time when fathers paced in waiting rooms smoking cigars, waiting for a nurse to come out an inform them they had a boy or a girl. One of the most dramatic changes has been the use of midwives.
<P>
And now, Sharp Hospital has put together a whole midwife center.  It's called "The Birth Place" and  according to Obstetrician Dr. William Swartz, it's like a home away from home for giving birth.
<P>
The birth place is very comfortable, from the pastel bedding to the antiques armouires. It feels more like a bed and breakfast than a medical facility.
Yet it is very much a medical facility.   Here all births are administered by nurse midwives with Sharp obstetricians readily available if trouble arises.
<P>
Katrina Molenda gave birth to her daughter Madeline at The Birth Place.  She continues to come here for follow up pediatric care.
Her first child was born in a traditional hospital birthing center, which she says is quite a contrast to the birth place. 
In a hospital she had to follow the physician's protocol.   At the birthplace, patients set the protocol.  Katrina says she wanted to be in charge of her birth and have the medical staff follow her lead rather than visa versa.
<P>
Dr. Swartz says the data shows this kind of approach is very successful.
He created the center along with nurse midwife Debra Jackson.
Now they're sharing their vision with Russian doctors who are trying to modernize birthing methods.
Dr. Swartz says in Russia birth is treated like an operation where fathers stay out of the loop.
<P>
Quite a contrast to a center which allows family and friends in on the event and even provides a kitchen and other amenities for their stay.

In bloodless surgery, major blood loss
is eliminated and so is the need for
transfusion. <P>

Sharon Vernon is a Nurse and the Director of the Bloodless Center at St.
Vincent Charity Hospital in Cleveland, Ohio.  She says,
<EM>"The reason a lot of people are unaware
of this stems from the medical
community itself. Blood has always been
a standard of care. We need to change
that." </EM><P>
Bloodless surgery grew out of efforts
to honor the religious beliefs of
Jehovah's Witnesses, who refuse blood
transfusions. Now 50 hospitals across
the country use the procedure. Every
step of the way, the goal is to save
blood.<P>

Dr. Soseph Sopko, a Surgeon and Director of the Department of Medicine at St.
Vincent Charity Hospital, tells us, 
<EM>"Once you're admitted to the hospital,
as we say, you literally bleed into the
laboratory. Every day someone comes and
takes blood out of you. The average
blood loss in an intensive care unit
like this is between a half liter to
one liter for your stay."</EM><P>
Doctors say special equipment minimizes
blood loss. During surgery, unecessary
blood transfusions are avoided by
conserving the blood.<P>

Bloodless bypass surgery allowed patient
Richard Miller to honor his religious
beliefs and, in his opinion, protect
his health. He claims, 



<EM> "With AIDS and hepatitis, and all the
other diseases, again it goes on. All
of these are factors that are
detrimental to one's health." </EM><P>
In bloodless surgery, the key is to
make every drop count. <BR><A HREF="Stayhealthymain.html">-back-</A></FONT>

<B>Arterial Venus Malformation (AVM):  </B>AVM is a congenital abnormality (existing since birth) of the brain commonly called an aneurysm.  It is a tangle of arteries and blood vessels that have a tendency to bleed and cause stroke-like problems of the brain. Symptoms include intense headaches, nausea, vomiting, distortions to vision or loss of sight.  The most severe symptom is coma.  Incidence of this condition is slightly higher in women than in men, especially those in their late 40's or early to mid-50's, but it can occur at any age.<P>

<B>Treatment:</B>  Standard treatment for AVM is to surgically open the skull, expose the brain, and apply a clip to the mass of arteries and blood vessels to stop the flow of blood.  However, if the lesion is too large, or connected to too many parts of the brain, less invasive techniques may be necessary.
<P>
<B>Emobolization:  </B>This is a non-surgical option for high-risk AVM patients.  The three to five hour microcatheter procedure begins with an angiogram (X-ray examination blood vessels) to locate the exact site of the blood vessel bundle.  Guided by fluoroscopy (a procedure that allows doctors to view X-ray images directly), neuroradiologists then insert a one millimeter catheter threaded with a platinum coil through affected blood vessels to the site.  The coil is injected into the aneurysm which causes a clot to form.  This prevents bleeding and allows the vessel to heal.
<P>
<B>Gamma Knife: </B> Gamma Knife treatment is another treatment for AVM usually following embolization.  It is a form of focused radiation therapy that aims a number of beams of x-radiation at the malformation to correct it.
<P>
The procedure generally takes three to five hours.  A local anesthesia is administered to the patient, then he or she is fitted with a frame around the head which acts as a navigational guide for the Gamma Knife to target the tangle of arteries.  An MRI locates the abnormality, and the coordinates are fed into the Gamma Knife's three-dimensional computer planning program.  X-radiation is then targeted at the blood vessel malformation. The treatment shrinks the cells in the lining of the arteries and veins that form the AVM, stopping the bleeding and allowing healing.
<P>
Patients usually experience a severe headache for a short period after the removal of the frame.  The hospital stay after Gamma Knife treatment is usually only overnight, compared to several weeks of recovery for open-skull surgery.
<P>
Success:  Over 6,000 patients with AVM's have been treated with the gamma knife.  Eighty-five percent experienced total eradication of the lesion within two years.  Eleven percent have had a significant reduction in the size of the lesion.

A important link between breast cancer and enzymes may be a major 
step forward in early detection.  Despite advances in recent years, more and more women are dying 
from breast cancer.  This year alone, it will claim 44,000 lives in the U.S. 
many times because it's caught too late.<P>

Scientists in Texas have now linked an enzyme called Telomerase  to breast tumors.  If you are tested and doctors find the 
enzyme, they may be able to tell if you have the beginnings of a 
malignant tumor.<P>

Jerry Shay, Ph.D.<BR>
Professor of Cell Biology and Neuroscience<BR>
<EM>"Every single cancer that subsequently was shown to be an advanced 
malignancy had telomerase activity at the earliest stage."</EM><P>


Finding the enzyme isn't difficult.  Doctors take microscopic samples 
from a suspicious lump with a small needle.<P>


Soshanna Conway, Ph.D.<BR>
<EM>"It's a major step forward, and everything that can be done in finding this 
earlier and earlier or being able to predict that it's going to happen is 
much better for all of us."</EM><P>



If the test shows there is Telomerase, doctors do more extensive surgery 
around the tumor.<P>


Jerry Shay, Ph.D.<BR>

<EM>"On the other hand, if the biopsy turns out to be negative for this 
Telomerase, I can imagine in the future that one might take a more 
conservative surgical procedure."</EM><P>



If results in Texas can be confirmed by other researchers, doctors could 
start using the test in a couple years.  The scientists are also researching whether a lack of the Telomerase 
enzyme means breast cancer patient will live longer.<P>

<b>Background:</b>
  The study was designed to examine the effects on breast tissue from a low fat diet 
combined with fish oil and soy supplements.  The study determines whether these foods can change the fatty acid composition of breast fat and therefore affect the growth of breast cancer.
 <P>

<b>Dietary Fat & Breast Cancer:</b>
  Studies have shown that a high fat diet increases breast 
cancer recurrence and the spread of cancer.  Some of the possible reasons that dietary fat may affect breast cancer are that it:
<br>
  turns on genes that allow cancer cells to grow and spread<br>
  reduces the ability of the immune system to kill cancer cells<br>
  raises the estrogen levels, which in turn increase tumor growth<br>
  enable cancer cells to easily invade the surrounding tissue<P>

By eating a low fat diet you starve these mechanisms and protect yourself.
<P>
<b>Soybean Supplements: </b>Over the years a number of studies have shown that soybeans 
may be protective against cancers of the breast, prostate, and colon.  People in Japan, who have low incidents of these cancers, have diets that are not only low in fat, but are also high in soy. One of the compounds within soy that is of particular interest is called genistein.  It is thought to inhibit cancer by:<br>

  blocking chemicals required for cancer growth<br>
  blocking the binding of estrogen to cancer cell receptor sites<br>
  inhibiting the development of blood vessels, required for cancer growth, around the 
cancer cell<P>

 
<b>Fish Oil Supplements:</b> Polyunsaturated fats contain two groups of fatty acids, one of which is 
called N-3.  N-3 fatty acids may inhibit chemically-induced breast tumors by slowing the growth rate of tumor cells.
<P>
<b>Diet Requirements Per Day:</b><br>
No more than 15% of calories from fat.
<br>
60 grams of soy protein.<br>
10 grams of fish oil taken with 800 IU of Vitamin E.<P>

There's a kind of laser, called the CO2 laser, that doctors typically use to remove wrinkles, acne scars and pock marks.  Now for the first time, plastic surgeons in Worcester, Massachusetts, are using the laser to treat serious burns.  <P>



When doctor Richard Silverman treats the second degree burns on this patient's face, he uses the light from a CO2 laser to remove the dead skin.  The treatment is slow but eventually, living tissue begins to appear.  Until now, chemicals or knives were the only treatment options available to surgeons.  <P>


Richard Silverman, M.D. <BR>
Surgeon<BR>
University of  Massachusetts<BR>
Medical Center <BR>
Worcester, MA<BR>
<EM>"The chemical agents are slow and the knife is inprecise so that with the chemical agents you have to wait around till something happens and with the knife, you're probably going to go too deep and have to put a skin graft on.  So using this laser where you can go a little bit at a time layer by layer, gives you the advantage of being able to stop as soon as you see living tissue and then give it a chance to heal."  
</EM><P>


The laser has several other benefits:  patients bleed less, there's potential for less scarring and doctors can use it right in the patient's hospital room.  <P>


Richard Silverman, M.D.<BR>

<EM>"There's no blood loss.  And in the treatment of burns that's a significant thing because they're losing so much blood elsewhere."  </EM><P>



These photos show a patient who received a chemical treatment on his left hand but had laser surgery on the right.  Eight months later, he has better range of motion in the right hand and fewer scars. Third degree burns do not respond to laser therapy.  So for this patient, the area below her chin will require skin grafting.<P>



Dr. Silverman says patients also appear to heal faster with the CO2 laser.  He hopes more plastic surgeons will familiarize themselves with the CO2 laser, also called the silk touch laser, and start using it to treat deep second degree burns. <P>

A third of the women who live with breast cancer will see their disease 
return this year.  Now,  a simple test can detect the reoccurrence of 
cancer early while there's still time to fight back.<P>



For 26 years, Ellen Limitone has cared for hospital patients.  She's 
watched many battle to stay alive after cancer took hold of their bodies . 
Now she finds herself fighting the same disease.<P>


Ellen Limitone, Breast Cancer Patient<BR>

<EM>"We always know there's no guarantees in life, we can get hit by a bus 
going home from work, but there's always an assumption that dying or 
facing a deadly disease is way off in the future."</EM><P>



Ellen's been lucky. Doctors were able to remove the cancer in her breast.  
But it could come back.<P>


Now, a simple blood test will warn Ellen and other women if cancer 
returns. Doctors say the test can find  cancer five to 12 months earlier 
than other tools.  If the test is positive, a doctor can begin treatment 
early.<P>


Herbert Fritsche, Ph.D.<BR>
Clinical Chemist<BR>
MD Anderson Cancer Center<BR>
<EM>"We think right now that this blood test can have significant improvement 
in the number of patients that do survive from breast cancer."</EM><P>


The test works by detecting cancer cells in the blood.<P>


Ellen Limitone<BR>
<EM>"It gives me a lot of hope, a lot of confidence, that if it does come back, 
they'll know it soon and something can be done about it, not just for me 
but for lots of women."</EM><P>


	
For cancer patients in remission the fear of the cancer returning never 
goes away. For Ellen, and others like her, a negative blood test brings 
tremendous relief.
<P>

The blood test, which as been approved by the F-D-A,  costs about 80-
dollars. The test is not recommended for women who have not been 
diagnosed with breast cancer.

Childhood cancers like leukemia and brain tumors are rare.  Surviving 
them is even more rare, but the odds are improving with the help of a new 
combination of cancer killing drugs.  These are the faces of childhood cancer survivors.  Generally , 50% of 
children who have been diagnosed with cancer can beat it.  Children's 
cancer specialist Faith Kung says children whose cancer returns 
aren't so lucky.  Ninety percent die.<P>




Ten-year-old Elizabeth Vannote developed cancer in her abdomen two 
years ago.  When regular chemotherapy didn't work, 
Dr. Kung tried ice, a drug combination of Ifosfamide, 
Carboplatin and Etopiside.  Although the 
drugs aren't new, using them together is. Dr. Kung says the ice mixture has 
boosted survival rates from 10-53% in children with recurring cancer.<P>


Faith Kung, M.D.<BR>
Univ. of  California at San Diego Medical Center<BR>
San Diego, CA<BR>
<EM>"And we now have children who are now disease free for five years."</EM><P>



The ice treatment does cause side effects like hair loss, nausea and 
anemia.  Dr. Kung says transfusions and anti-nausea drugs provide some 
relief.<P>


Faith Kung, M.D.<BR>
<EM>"They surprisingly respond to it better than adults."</EM><P>


Diana Vannote<BR>
Daughter has cancer<BR>
<EM>"She's doing much better. I mean her spirits are good."</EM><P>


Elizabeth's mother, Diana ,knows it's too early to add her daughter to the 
list of survivors, but the signs are encouraging.  The ice treatment  shrunk 
the  tumors, and Dr. Kung believes more doses of her cancer killing 
combination could freeze Elizabeth's cancer permanently.<P>



Dr. Kung has used ice to successfully treat leukemia and  tumors in the 
kidneys, adrenal  glands and  brain.  She plans to try it next on cancer of 
the lymph nodes.  <P>

<B> V Chemotherapy Treatment: </B>

The standard therapy for metastatic colon cancer and most other cancers of the gastrointestinal tract is intravenous chemotherapy using 2 drugs:  a drug called 5FU, which has been around for many years, and another drug called leucovorin, which assists the activity of 5FU.  A new experimental oral medication known as UFT is a variant of 5FU.  But instead of taking the medication through an I-V, patients are given pills to swallow three times a day.     
<P>
<B>The Experimental Oral Medication:</B>
UFT is a combination of uracil and a drug called tegafur.  Once inside the body, doctors say it mimics the intravenous form of 5FU. Phase III clinical trials are underway at more than 100 sites around the country, including M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, Memorial Sloan Kettering in New York, the University of Chicago, and Scripps Memorial Hospital in La Jolla, California.  The drug is being tested on approximately 1,000 patients.  In addition to colon cancer treatment, its effectiveness is being studied on cancers of the pancreas and stomach.  UFT is being produced by Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, who is expected to seek FDA approval in early 1997.  Doctors are hopeful it will be approved for treatment against a wide range of cancers.  The oral medication is being used in Japan to treat a variety of cancers including breast and neck cancers. 
 <P>
<B>Benefits: </B>
The number one benefit is convenience to the patient.  With the new treatment, patients avoid weekly hospital visits.  The oral medication allows them to continue working, or enjoying life,  while getting their treatment. Doctors say patients also experience fewer side effects than patients treated with conventional chemotherapy.  One of the major problems with intravenous chemotherapy is its negative effects on bone marrow.  Many patients end up getting infections because of low white cell counts.  With the oral chemo, white cells aren't affected because the dosage is extremely low and is 
administered for long periods of time.  In addition to having fewer effects on bone marrow, the oral medication has little impact on a patient's mucus membranes.  I-V chemo causes patients to develop sores in their mouths.  This does not happen with the oral medication.  Mouth sores are completely eliminated because the medicine is administered in such low doses.<P>
<B> Other advantages include:</B> <BR>

<UL>

<LI TYPE=CIRCLE>No hand, foot syndrome usually associated with I-V chemo
<BR>
(sores, thickening and pain on the hands and feet) 
<LI TYPE=CIRCLE>Minimal or no hair loss

<LI TYPE=CIRCLE>Less nausea & vomiting

<LI TYPE=CIRCLE>Less expensive: the drug is prescribed on an outpatient basis, reducing the cost of care.
</UL>


<P> 
<B>Side Effects:</B>
About 30 percent of the patients using the oral medication will develop some form of diarrhea.  Doctors say such side effects are minimal and can be offset with medication during their oral treatment. Physicians say early results suggest the oral medication is as effective as the standard I-V chemo treatment.

If you weigh too much or have high cholesterol, chances are your doctor will tell you to eat 
less fat and exercise more.  But one cardiologist in Worcester, Massachusetts is taking a 
new approach to patient care.  He provides his patients with a personal coach and it fits 
into the palm of their hand.<P>



Meet "Newt," Roger Leland's conscience.  This small, hand-held computer knows 
everything about what Roger eats, how much he exercises, and even his level of stress.<P>


Roger Leland <BR>
Cardiac Patient <BR>
<EM>"Every single bite I eat, I have to tell that machine.  I have to tell it and it immediately tells 
me whether it was good or bad."</EM><P>



For cardiac patients like Roger Leland, lifestyle changes don't always come easy.   But 
with this special computer program, called the cardiac coach, Leland has lost twenty 
pounds and now knows which foods are good for his heart.<P>


Roger Leland <BR>
<EM>
"I'm not computer literate.  I'm the dinosaur in the office, but this machine was easy for 
me to do."</EM><P>



By scrolling through a list of food items, he's able to enter his lunch menu into the Newton 
computer.  Seconds later, everything from calories to cholesterol appears on the screen.<P>


Roger Leland <BR>

<EM>"It is so easy to work with and it's a way to relax and I'm anxious to see whether I've been 
a good do-bee or not."</EM><P>




A telephone and modem make it possible to download the information to the medical 
team.  A doctor, nurse and dietitian, then read the material and make recommendations.<P>


Ira Ockene, M.D. <BR>
Cardiologist
<BR>
Univ. of Massachusetts Medical Center  <BR>
Worcester, MA<BR>
<EM>"It sends the information to us as E-mail, if you will.  That information comes into our 
computers and we can look at it.  We can read the messages, we can analyze the data 
and then we can respond to it...we can send messages back."</EM><P>



Fourteen patients have used the cardiac coach so far.  They all come in for regular 
checkups  but in between, "Newt" keeps them on track.<P>



Doctor Ockene encourages his patients to pick up the phone and call him 
directly, especially in cases of medical emergencies.  
E-mail is fine for communicating important messages back and forth but it's certainly not 
appropriate when patients need immediate medical care.  <P>

Six million Americans are allergic to cats.  Now, doctors are testing a 
new vaccine. Cat lovers are hopeful it will stop the sneezing.  They are playful and cuddly.  But Mary Farace says even though she loves cats.  She can't have one because they make her sick.<P>


Mary Farace<BR>
Allergic to cats<BR>
<EM>"I feel like I can't breathe, I get to the point where I get a runny nose, 
itchy eyes."</EM><P>



Mary is one of 150 people across the country testing a new cat allergy 
vaccine.  Traditional allergy shots contain proteins that can also trigger 
allergic reactions.  The cat vaccine is designed without those proteins.  <P>


Harold Nelson, M.D.<BR>
Allergist<BR>
<EM>"You get the results much sooner with many fewer visits to the doctors 
office, but also without the risk of incurring a serious allergic reaction 
along the way."</EM><P>


This is the day, Mary tests the vaccine.  She sits in a room full of cat dander.  A machine measures the level of dander she breathes.  Two cats sit in a cage, as Mary writes down her symptoms.  Breathing tests also monitor Mary's progress.<P>


Mary Farace<BR>
<EM>"I really did better this time, I'm amazed."</EM><P>


Mary says as soon as the vaccine is available, she hopes to own a cat 
again.  The cat vaccine could be on the market as early as 1998.  Because 
doctors are still testing the vaccine, there is no estimate on how much it 
will cost.<P>

The students at Highlands
Elementary School in Spring Valley are
participating in an important study
called CATCH - Child and Adolescent
Trial for Cardiovascular Health.<P>


  Highlands Elementary is one of a
hundred schools nationwide testing a
program to get kids heart healthy.
   Three years ago school lunches at
Highlands Elementary went low fat and
low sodium.<P>


  Diet is one step toward a healthy
cardiac lifestyle and the next is increasing physical
activity from moderate to vigorous.

   Kids are also taught about healthy
living in class and families get
involved in the lessons.<P>
  Also, the whole campus is tobacco
free with no-smoke filled teachers
lounges.<P>

   Teachers are given simple lesson
plans on index cards so the program is
easy to implement.<P>

   Parents, teachers and researchers
agree the CATCH program is a success.<BR><A HREF="Stayhealthymain.html">-back-</A></FONT>

   A year ago riding in the car would
have been terrifying for 9-year-old
C.J. Sepulveda.
   She and her mother were in a
serious automobile accident.

  
 Because of this trauma C.J developed
a fear of riding in the car.<P>
 
 C.J. Sepulveda tells us, 
  <EM>"You always see red cars. I
Hate when you seem them because that's
the car that crashed right into us."</EM><P>
  
 
   The experience also lead to 
nightmares and it became obvious that C.J. needed
help.  
   She turned to "Change," a 16
session therapy program that includes a
take- home workbook which patients use
to help them sort out their feelings.
 
 
 
 
   Audio cassettes are also used to
train children to overcome their fears.<P>
 

 
   In C.J.'s case the accident brought on
her anxiety.
   But for children predisposed to this
problem, stress can be the culprit.<P>






   Psychologist Dr. John Pullen says
these children are prone to
re-developing anxiety problems later in
life if they don't continue to practice
what they've learned in the Change
program.<P>
   As for C.J., riding in the car is no
longer traumatic and life is good.<BR><A HREF="Stayhealthymain.html">-back-</A></FONT>

Up to 80% of  women suffer heartburn during pregnancy. Taking care of the 
problem can be as safe and simple as chewing gum.<P>

Colleen Lenz is five months pregnant and like most expectant mothers, she 
often gets heartburn.  Her pain occurs when acid from the stomach washes 
back into the esophagus between the throat and stomach.<P>

Colleen Lenz    <BR>                  
Has Heartburn During Pregnancy<BR>
<EM>"It's just a burning uncomfortable feeling.  And it feels like it's reflux, it feels like 
it's going up into my esophagus."</EM><P>


Colleen took part in a study at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. 
Expectant mothers chewed regular gum after meals for thirty minutes, and any 
time the heartburn returned.<P>


Robert Marks, M.D.<BR>                
Gastroenterologist   <BR>               
UAB      <BR>                               
Birmingham, Alabama<BR>
<EM>"What we found was just absolutely amazing. The women who chewed gum 
had less frequent heartburn, less severe heartburn and they consumed 
significantly less antacid tablets."</EM><P>


The study found acid does not remain in the esophagus nearly as long when 
patients chew gum. An increase in saliva seems to be the key.<P>


Robert Marks,  M.D.<BR>
<EM>"We found that chewing gum is a simple, safe, effective way of increasing the 
amount of saliva that we produce which contains a lot of bicarbonate and 
neutralizes the acid." </EM><P>


Men and women tested in a previous study showed 7 out of 10 decreased their 
heartburn while chewing gum. Researchers thought the method would be a 
safe alternative for pregnant women who don't want to expose their babies to 
medication.<P>


Doctors say any type of gum can be tried, although pregnant women might 
want to avoid the sugarless because of additives. Doctors do not consider this 
a cure-all for heartburn. Lifestyle modification can also help reduce the 
problem in the general population. If you suffer frequent or severe heartburn, 
see your doctor.<P>

One in 30 children will suffer a severe head injury before the age of 16. 
Startling statistics for any parent. Now new evidence suggests the 
effects from severe head injuries don't always show up immediately 
after the accident.
<P>


Valorie Gideo doesn't remember the accident. She was 5 years old 
when she was hit by a car, thrown 30 feet, and landed on her head. 
Everyone thought she had made a full recovery.<P>



Audrey Gideo<BR>
Valorie's mom<BR>
<EM>"She developed like a normal child and we really didn't see, we thought 
gosh, we're really lucky.  She sustained this injury and nothing 
happened, and about a year ago she started having problems in 
school."</EM><P>


Researchers at the University of Texas at Dallas,  say Valorie's 
problems today are the result of her head injury 6 years ago.<P>


Sandra Bond Chapman, Ph.D<BR>
Research Scientist<BR>
University of Texas<BR>
<EM>"In terms of cognition, language and brain, we're seeing that the picture 
may not be apparent early on, we may not see these deficits until some  
time later after the injury."</EM><P>

In fact, doctors now know it can take 3 to 5 years for head injury 
problems to surface.<P>

Children may have difficulty solving problems, planning, and relating to 
others.<P>

For Valorie's family, knowing the cause of her  problems makes it easier 
to cope and focus on treatment.<P>


Audrey Gideo <BR>

<EM>"Whatever the problems are, I'm so grateful that she's here.  And I know 
that there are probably a lot of parents out there that have gone through 
this maybe with not as much help as I have, and it's not hopeless, there 
are people out there that can help."</EM><P>


Researchers are now focusing on what can be done to help head 
injured kids do better in school and social situations. If you have any 
concerns about your child, you may want to contact the national brain 
injury foundation.  That number is 1-800-444-6443. <P>

Are your children safe in your own home?  Nearly 3 million children are 
injured in their homes each year.  As your about to see, spending a little 
time and money childproofing now, can prevent an accident later.  <P>



It's playtime for 3-year-old twins Jake and Tyler.  Since mom can't watch 
them every minute of the day, she's tried to childproof her home, but 
admits, it's a big job.<P>


Debbie Chambers <BR>
Mother of four <BR>
<EM>"It's been a challenge.  Some things are real basic, like the outlets,  but other things I didn't think of."</EM><P>



Debbie invited a specialist to come into her home and point out the 
hidden dangers.  He started in the kitchen.<P>

John Ross  <BR>
Safety Inspector<BR>
<EM>"Remember to always keep a child safety lock on your microwave.  This 
will prevent the child from getting into it while you're cooking.  You want to keep pots and pans out from underneath the stove to 
prevent children from coming to the stove to play with."</EM><P>



He stresses the importance of unplugging counter-top appliances when 
you're not using them. They're easy for a child to turn on, and that can 
mean  danger.  He also says not all childproof latches are the same.  All 
of Debbie's latches have broken off.  He recommends that latches be 
spring-loaded with a large base.<P>


John Ross<BR>
Safety Inspector<BR>
<EM>"The number one thing that saves children's lives is correct parental 
supervision.  A product will slow a child down, so you have that moment 
to react."</EM><P>



Companies specializing in childproofing can point out potential dangers 
in every room of your home and recommend solutions.<P>


Debbie Chambers<BR>
<EM>"I feel like I should be a pro, but obviously, I'm not.  There's a lot to learn 
even if you feel like you know what you're doing."  </EM><P>



Education is the key to childproofing your home.  There are numerous 
books on the subject.  Safety experts say that being safe also means 
being practical.  Safety devices should protect your kids, and be 
convenient so that adults will use them properly.   <P>

Cataracts are rare in children, affecting one in five hundred.  In adults cataracts are treated by replacing the clouded lenses.  But they often cause blindness in the very young.  Until now.   New technology from Norfolk, Virginia makes surgical replacement available to children as well.<P>



Eleven-year-old twins Brett and Cameron Hudson love sports.  They're fine teammates, equally matched in strength... That is, they were until this past summer when Brett suddenly lost his hand-to-eye coordination.  <P>


Maria Hudson<BR>
Brett and Cameron's Mother<BR>
Norfolk, VA<BR>

<EM>"He's a very avid sports fan and can play every sport really well.  But this particular season he struck out every time he was up to bat." </EM><P>



Brett had developed cataracts, a rare condition in children caused by eye trauma, heredity or medication.  In Brett's case it was medication. Eight years ago, he had leukemia. He was given bone marrow from his twin. Doctors prevented rejection by giving Brett steroids. And that caused the problem.  <P>


Earl Crouch, M.D.<BR>
Professor/Chairman of Ophthalmology Deptartment<BR>
Eastern Virginia Medical School<BR>
Norfolk, VA<BR>

<EM>"When Brett came in one eye was seeing 20/200, and the other was 20/100.  With that kind of vision he couldn't really function at school, he couldn't read the blackboard." 
</EM><P>




Dr. Crouch removed Brett's cloudy lenses and replaced them with permanent lenses just like those used in adults.  <P>


Earl Crouch, M.D.<BR>


<EM>"Lenses have been put into children before but they weren't the technological advances in lenses nor did we have the right instruments to do the procedure." 
</EM><P>


Brett is now seeing 20/20.  Over 90-percent of children who undergo the surgery have 20/40 vision or better.<P>


Brett Hudson<BR>
Cataract Patient<BR>
Norfolk, VA<BR>

<EM>"After I got my new lens in I hit a home run the other day."
</EM><P>
Cameron Hudson<BR>
Twin Brother<BR>
Norfolk, VA<BR>
<EM>"Now he can play like a real player." </EM><P>



Dr. Crouch says he has no reported infections or rejects of the implants.   He performs the surgery on children as young as 16 months. He continues to document his cases and publish the results in hope of receiving the FDA's approval of the procedure.<P>

   It's surprisingly common for kids to
suffer from migraine headaches.
   The good news is researchers say
there is a non-drug way to treat them.
   A study released today shows self-hypnosis and relaxation techniques can
help children reduce the frequency and
pain of migraines.
   In the study, children were taught

Six to 10 million Americans, most of them women, spend every waking 
moment in pain.  Their condition, known as fibromyalgia has been difficult to 
treat because it's exact cause is unknown.  But two 
common antidepressant drugs are being used to rid people of their constant 
pain. <P>
 


Every muscle in Paula Leclerc's body used to ache. <P>


Paula LeClerc      <BR>
Chronic Pain Sufferer  <BR>

<EM>"It would hurt to comb my hair.  It would hurt to brush my teeth.  To type or 
perform my job duties was practically next to impossible."</EM><P>




Paula suffers from fibromyalgia.<P>

Don Goldenberg, M.D.  <BR> 
Rheumatologist   <BR>
Newton-Wellesley Hospital  <BR>
Nutting Lake, MA<P>

<EM>"The definition of fibromyalgia is a chronic muscular rheumatism. Instead of 
having rheumatism in the joints, people have chronic pain and discomfort and 
stiffness throughout most of their muscles throughout the body." </EM><P>


To help patients with chronic pain, Dr. Don Goldenberg tested low doses of 
two anti-depressant medications: 25 milligrams of amitriptyline  and 20 
milligrams of fluoxetine, better known as prozac.  Nineteen patients took each 
drug alone for six weeks and then in combination. <P>


Don Goldenberg, M.D.<BR>

<EM>"The two of them in combination, without any side effects I should add, were 
more effective than either alone."  </EM><P>




The drugs make a natural chemical called serotonin more available to the 
brain.  That's important because serotonin improves the body's ability to 
control pain.  
<P>

Don Goldenberg, M.D.<BR>

<EM>"Because we are using antidepressants does not mean that we're saying this 
is all in your head or you're depressed.  That may be the case with chronic 
pain and changing one's lifestyle, but it's important that patients and doctors 
understand that that's not why these medications are often effective." </EM><P>




Now Paula Leclerc is typing ninety words a minute without any problem.  She's 
also sleeping better ... another bonus for patients with fibromyalgia.<P>




Dr. Goldenberg says patients taking antidepressant drugs should also exercise 
regularly and stretch their muscles to help control the pain.  Other treatment 
options include physical therapy, acupuncture, biofeedback and stress 
management.<P>

A traumatic injury to the eye can result in blindness if proper care isn't taken immediately after the injury occurs.  But there has never been a safe medication to treat the injury while the eye heals.<P>



Twelve-year-old Brandon Weldon has set his sights on either being an architect or a professional baseball player.   His hopes were almost dashed this past summer after a sports accident. <P>


Brandon Weldon<BR>
Had Eye Accident<BR>
Norfolk, VA<BR>
<EM>"My brother's friend was pitching the ball to me and my brother foul tipped it, and it hit me right in the eye." </EM><P>



This is what Brandon's eye looked like last July...15-percent of the inner eye was filled with blood.<P>


Earl Crouch, M.D.<BR>
Ophthalmologist <BR>
Eastern Virginia Medical School<BR>
Norfolk, VA<BR>
<EM>"It caused an injury to the iris and blood vessels and caused a hemorrhage or hyphema in the eye itself."</EM><P>


Brandon was immediately treated with an experimental new eye gel called ACA or amino caproic acid. It prevents small  blood vessel clots from breaking down while the eye is healing. <P>


Earl Crouch, M.D.<BR>
<EM>"Usually when there's a secondary hemorrhage or secondary hyphema it fills the eye, not always, but it usually will be much larger than the first one."</EM><P>  



Secondary hemorrhages occur in one out of four eye-injury cases. As much as 50-percent of the eye can fill with blood. This can lead to elevated pressure in the eye, nerve damage and loss of vision.  Doctors at Eastern Virginia Medical School developed the gel because orally the drug has serious side effects. <P>


Earl Crouch, M.D.<BR>
<EM>"Taking it by mouth you can get nausea and vomiting from the medication or even lowered blood pressure or hypertension." </EM><P>


Patricia Williams, M.D.<BR>
Professor of Pharmacology<BR>
Eastern Virginia Medical School<BR>
Norfolk, VA<BR>
<EM>"The thing about the gel that makes it special is we're able to apply it where we want the drug to act." </EM><P>


Brandon made it successfully through the first five days after his accident  when rebleeding is most likely to occur.  <P>


Brandon Weldon<BR>

<EM>"It feel good, cause I'm back to normal."</EM><P>


The ACA gel will shortly go into it's last trial phase before it's submitted to the FDA. In the second part of our two-part series, Clear Eyes, you'll see how a new eye drop makes treatment of eye infections easier and safer.<P>

25-million Americans wear contact lenses.  They are now disposable, color coordinated and many can be worn for extended periods of time.  Along with the new technology has come a marked increase in eye infections.  But a new eye drop is making the treatment of bacterial infections safer and easier.   <P>



Eighteen months ago Hope Krick woke up with blurred vision, her eye was blood shot and it hurt. <P>


Hope Krick<BR>
Eye Infection Patient<BR>
Baltimore, MD<BR>

<EM>"It was just like someone was taking a knife and stabbing you in your eye ball over and over again."  </EM><P>



Hope's contact lenses had scratched the protective surface of her eye, causing an infection of the cornea. Her optometrist sent her to eye specialist Terrence O'brien at Johns Hopkins. <P> 


Terrence O'Brien, M.D.<BR>
Director of Ocular and Infectious Diseases<BR>
Wilmer Eye Institute<BR>
Johns Hopkins Hospital<BR>
Baltimore, MD<BR>

<EM>"Infection of the clear cornea is a true eye emergency because of the ability of these bacteria to divide very rapidly over a matter of hours and to multiply within the tissue." </EM><P>



Dr. O'Brien enrolled Hope in a study comparing the current therapy with a new antibiotic called ofloxacin.  


Terrence O'Brien, M.D.<BR>

<EM>"The single drug is easier to use for patients, it's less irritating, causes a reduction of burning and stinging and also is equally as effective because of it's broad coverage for bacteria." </EM><P>



Current therapy is a combination of two antibiotics mixed by a pharmacist.  The mixtures can be too strong, too weak or even accidentally contaminated during the mixing process.  After the study, Hope found she had been treated with ofloxacin.  The FDA has just approved the drug which can treat up to 95-percent of all bacterial infections of the cornea. Ofloxacin is available by prescription for about 20-dollars and is covered by insurance.  The combination drug costs 55-dollars.<P>

A California company is creating a new generation of spare body parts.  
Not by building them but by growing them in a laboratory.<P>


Jesus Segovia was burned in a gas fire last November.  His wounds 
have healed well thanks, in part, to man made skin.<P>


John Hansbrough, M.D. <BR>
UCSD Medical Center<BR>
San Diego<BR>
<EM>"We used this to place on the wounds in the operating room and it 
functioned as a temporary skin replacement for several weeks while the 
patient could be brought back and stabilized."</EM><P>


The manmade skin starts as a soupy mixture containing skin cells from 
the donated foreskins of newborns.  The mixture is pumped onto a 
plastic mesh scaffold.  In seven days, the cells multiply and fill in the 
scaffold to produce a layer of skin. The skin can be grown in the lab to 
any size.<P>


Gail Naughton Ph.D.<BR>
Dermagraft <BR>
<EM>"From one donor material, we can get 250,000 square feet of final 
product."</EM><P>


The product, known as Dermagraft is sterile, so patients face fewer 
problems with infection and rejection that often occur with cadaver skin 
grafts.<P>


John Hansbrough, M.D.<BR>
<EM>"They may reject that skin in a couple of weeks and have to go back to 
surgery just to have that skin replaced."</EM><P>


In a study of 85 burn patients treated with Dermagraft, the need for 
surgery was cut in half, and  hospital stays were shortened by months.  
But what does manmade skin feel like?<P>


Jesus Segovia<BR>
Burn Victim<BR>
<EM>"I feel the same like I did before. I feel that I never use another skin."</EM><P>


As Jesus healed, the dermagraft was replaced with 
Healthy skin from his back and legs.  Dermagraft's creators hope to 
engineer a  permanent skin the may someday eliminate the need for 
human skin grafts.<P>


Also in the works,  a permanent tissue plug for diabetic foot ulcers, man 
made cartilage and heart valves. All are currently in clinical studies.<P>

The invention of Nautilus exercise equipment revolutionized the way we 
exercise.  Its creator has designed a new system that uses computers 
instead of scalpels to repair injured backs and knees.<P>



Mikaela Kinnear's weekly exercises on this Med X equipment keeps a 
curvature in her spine from getting worse.  The computer component of 
the system tracks every move she makes and keeps a record of her 
progress.<P>


Vert Mooney, M.D.<BR>
Orthopedic Surgeon<BR>
UCSD Medical Center<BR>
La Jolla, CA<BR>
<EM>"What it does is to measure the range and strength of specific muscles. 
The equipment is so big and bulky because it has to isolate those 
specific muscles."</EM><P>


The equipment can isolate and strengthen muscles in any part of the 
body.  It's especially effective for treating chronic back pain. In many 
cases it can replace the need for surgery.<P>


Vert Mooney, M.D.<BR>
<EM>"I'm not saying we can keep everybody from surgery but for those earlier
in the problem it's fixable by straightening out what the muscles do and 
then they can take care of themselves."</EM><P>


Mikaela Kinnear<BR>
Med X User    <BR>       
<EM>"It's helped me because my back's gotten stronger and I can do things 
easier."</EM><P>


Dr. Mooney says Med X gives people in pain or on the mend a faster, 
cheaper and non- invasive way to build up their strength and prevent 
future injury.
<P>


The equipment can also benefit people with arthritis, osteoporosis and 
back pain. Therapy on Med X is covered by most insurance carriers.

Many of us may drink coffee to stay  awake, but a study done at the University of California shows that a strong cup of caffeine  can serve another purpose for allergy patients.<P>


A bubble  might be the only way Tammy Colacion would be free from allergies. <P>


Tammy Colacion<BR>
Allergy Sufferer  <BR>
Huntington Beach, CA<BR>
<EM>"I'm allergic to trees, grasses, weeds, molds, environmentals, the dogs and the cats and the feather mixes."</EM><P>




Like most allergy sufferers, Tammy takes lots of  antihistamines and decongestants. But, an unusual study at the University of California helped her breathe easier. <P>


Vincent Tubiolo, M.D.<BR>
Dept. of Allergy and Immunology<BR>
Harbor-UCLA Medical Center <BR>
Torrance, CA<BR>
<EM>"When I was in my residency training program, I was a bit tired a few times, and I have horrible allergies myself. I decided to drink some caffeine, mostly because I wanted to kind of pick me up, not that I had any idea it would do anything for my allergies. "</EM><P>



But it did. So, Dr. Tubiolo decided to conduct a blind study. With 10 allergy patients.  For one week, six of them got  a pill containing 400 milligrams  of caffeine every day. That's equal to about three cups of coffee. The rest got a placebo.  Those who had caffeine reported a 51% improvement in their symptoms.<P>


Vincent Tubiolo, M.D.<BR>

<EM>"What we measured were symptoms like running nose, congestion, sneezing, itchy nose and post-nasal drip. "</EM><P>


Tammy Colacion<BR>
<EM>"That week I was fine. Cheerful all day and no problems or anything."</EM><P>



The caffeine worked because it has anti-inflammatory ingredients which help relax muscles in the lungs.<P>



Dr. Tubiolo does not suggest allergy sufferers drink lots of coffee. Some of the patients in the study had side effects like severe insomnia. <P>



Dr. Tubiolo also warns that drinking too much coffee could affect a person's heart rate and blood pressure. He plans a large study to confirm his results. Now he just wants people to know that the caffeine they're drinking may be relieving their hay fever.<P>

Thirty years ago a new therapy surfaced for patients with psychiatric problems.  Dance/movement therapy and is now 
accepted across the board. The National Institutes of Health is even conducting one study with the University of Pittsburgh to 
determine the success of it.<P>

Susan Kleinman<BR>
Dance/Movement Therapist<BR>
<EM>"It's often used to reach people who have great difficulty verbalizing their feelings."  </EM><P>


For Jennifer Torrese, it was different than other therapies she tried. 
<P>

Jennifer Torrese<BR>
Recovering Anorexic/Bulimic<BR>
<EM>"When I first went into it, I really
wasn t sure.  And people here kept
telling me just go with her and experience it. 
And it's a very awkward but relaxing 
feeling."</EM><P>  


It is a step in her recovery. <P>


Jennifer Torrese<BR>
<EM>"I was 13 when I started my anorexia
and everybody told me to eat so then I 
did start eating and it turned to
bulimia and it s been seven years and I
just want to say good-bye to it, I don't
need it anymore."</EM><P>


Music and movement  help Jennifer
connect to herself. <P>


Susan Kleinman<BR>
<EM>"It works because we can t make change
without being connected in our 
bodies."</EM> <P>
 


Jennifer Torrese<BR>
<EM>"My thing was the wall and how that
symbolizes my wall that I put up around people."  </EM><P>



This form of therapy has also been used with Alzheimers patients. <P>


Ira Cutler, M.D.<BR>
Medical Director<BR>
<EM>"For the patients I have in the
program, I feel that in general when I see them 
they have a somewhat lower level of
anxiety and seem better adjusted to 
being in the nursing home environment." </EM><P>




For Jennifer, it was the healing she
needed. <P>



The American Dance/Movement Therapy Association licenses more than 450  
therapists.  It is a recognized form of therapy in more than 300 psychiatric 
centers.<P>

<H4><FONT color="#000080">Dead Bones Come to Life</H4></FONT><FONT size=2>
Until about 10 or 15 years ago, amputation was often the only option for 
people with bone cancer.  But today, thanks to new procedures and 
technology, the future looks much brighter.<P>




Seeing Susie Royer walk with hardly a trace of a limp is the result of a huge 
stride in medicine.  Three years ago she almost lost her leg to bone 
cancer.<P>


Susie Royer<BR>
Cancer Patient<BR>

<EM>"When it got close to the time I was diagnosed I was crying and rolling on 
the floor.  It was so excruciating, I couldn't even walk."</EM><P>



Susie came to Dr. Kurt Merkel of Barnes Jewish Hospital in St. Louis, 
Missouri for a life saving operation.  The doctor removed nine inches of her 
thigh bone and replaced it with nine inches of bone from a cadaver.<P>


Kurt Merkel, M.D.<BR>
Orthopedic Surgeon<BR>
<EM>"When we put a bone in that bone is dead but it serves as a scaffolding or 
a model by which her body can invade that and blood vessels will grow into 
it and it will actually replace the dead bone with her own bone."</EM><P>



Doctors fasten the bones together by reconstructing ligaments and using 
metal plates.  In two or three years the bone allows the patient to function 
again.<P>

just a little bit longer than everybody else."</EM><P>


Kurt Merkel, M.D.<BR>
<EM>"Fifteen, 20 years ago, the 10 year survival rate was about 20 percent.  
Since that time, with the advent of chemotherapy as well as limb salvage 
procedures for surgery, the survival rate's now about 70 percent at 10 
years."</EM><P>



Dr. Merkel hopes in the next 10 or 20 years that cadaver bones will be 
replaced with synthetic bones.  The patients own tissues will invade 
synthetic bone and completely replace it with their own bone.<P>

Important news for pregnant women. Pain relief during labor and 
delivery may cause complications.  A new study shows that a popular pain blocker used during labor can lead to more cases of babies delivered by operations.<P>



Before Mimi Fleming gave birth to her first daughter, Victoria, she was 
determined to deliver without pain-blocking medication such as an 
epidural. After the delivery, she changed her mind. She delivered her 
second daughter, Melissa, with some pain relief.<P>


Mimi Fleming<BR>
Had an Epidural<BR>
<EM>"My doctor had told me there was no reason to be as painful as it was, 
that the epidural would help considerably."</EM><P>


However, a new study shows there are some risks with epidurals.<P>


Susan Ramin, M.D.<BR>
Southwestern Medical School<BR>
Dallas, TX<BR>
<EM>"Probably the most significant finding is an increase in operative 
delivery, which could include low forcep deliveries and Caesarean 
sections."</EM><P>


Doctors studied 900 women with normal pregnancies and found 
epidurals produced up to four times as many C-sections. They say 
epidurals can slow down labor... the woman may need a C-section to 
deliver.  Fortunately for Mimi, the opposite happened.<P>


Mimi Fleming<BR>
<EM>"I think once they gave me the epidural, I relaxed, and that caused me 
to dilate much faster than had I not had the epidural and been in pain 
and tense."</EM><P>



With these latest findings, doctors are looking into other medications 
that could replace epidurals and whether epidurals should be given later 
in labor. <P>



There"s another incentive to look for other pain relief beside epidurals: 
they can cost up to $2,500, while pain drugs given through an IV may 
only cost $200.<P>

    Out of control blood sugar levels
can lead to long term complications
which can be deadly.
    That's why it's vital diabetics eat
carefully and avoid sugar.
   But sugar isn't just white powder.
There are at least 22 different
sweetners used in foods and medicines
which can reek havok on a diabetic's
blood sugar level.<P>
   To help San Diegans know which
products are diabetes friendly the

<H4><FONT color="#000080">Diets To Die For</H4></FONT>
<I>Air Date -- 2.11.97</I>
<P>
Americans spend millions of dollars every year in pursuit of the elusive goal of loosing weight. It's an odessy that can take them from frozen dinners to drugs to diet programs too good to be true. Many diet gimmicks have come and gone over the years. The pursuit of quick weight loss even includes some dangerous choices.
<P>
One example is liquid diets. Dr. Carolyn Coker Ross of Harbor View Medical Center says, in some people,  liquid diets can cause protein to be lost in muscle. It can also cause an electrolyte imbalance which can lead to heart damage. That's what typically causes death in people who suffer from anorexia.
<P>
Another diet danger is one which emphasizes eating just one type of food restricting you from the basic food groups.
<P>
The latest diet craze is Phen Fen and Redux, drugs which suppress appetite.  However, they have side effects which you won't see mentioned in the ads. They include drowsiness, stomach upset and diarrhea.
<P>
While these only last a couple of weeks, there's evidence that long term use of these drugs can cause a potentially fatal illness called Primary Pulmonary Hypertension. So this risk needs to be carefully weighed against the health hazards of being overweight.
<P>
Dr. Ross says the drugs are meant only for people who need to loose more than 20 pounds. It shouldn't be used with other Seritonin drugs. They also do not mix with some antidepressants.
The risk of Primary Pulmonary Hypertension is 36 cases in one million. Statistically low but a hazard none the less.
<P>
What makes the drugs truly dangerous is obtaining them and taking them outside the care of a doctor.
Dr. Ross emphasizes that patients need to be screened for warning signs of the illness such as shortness of breath. Problems which could be overlooked if a physician is closely monitoring the situation.
<P>
Overall, when it comes to weight loss keeping the pounds off will require making lasting lifestyle changes.
<P>

<H4><FONT color="#000080">Diets To Die For - Part 1</H4></FONT>
<I>Air Date -- 2.10.97</I>
<P>
Everybody is getting in on the Phen Fen act.  Even established diet plans like Jenny Craig.
<P>
Phen Fen is the nickname for two drugs.  The first Phen is Phentermine which stimulates metabolism.  It's combined with the second Fen - Fenfluramine the brand name is Pondimine. It raises the level of the hormone seritonin in the brain and suppresses appetite.
<P>
A second popular diet drug is Redux which is taken by itself.  It's a cousin to Fenfluramine and likewise works on seritonin levels.
<P>
Janet Rathfon is a Phen Fen success story.  After a lifetime of dieting she lost 60 pounds with Phen Fen.  But if you're ready to lose weight the Phen Fen way, consider this...
<P>
Dr. Carolyn Coker Ross of Harbor View Medical Center warns the drugs don't live up to the hype. She says you can't just take the drugs and continue to eat anything you want. The drugs give you an edge by taking away cravings so you can begin to exercise and make the dietary changes necessary to loose weight.
<P>
However, this edge carries with it a very serious risk--primary pulmonary hypertension, a potentially fatal illness.
<P>
Although the risk of this disorder is 36 out of a million cases that risk is still too high for Lauren Shepherd.  She says reading about primary pulmonary hypertension scared her. She talked with her family and they decided it just wasn't worth it.  So Lauren is going about weight lose the tried and true way, she's eating healthy and exercising.  And she's fully aware that with Phen Fen the weight could come off fast, instead of taking years. But she says nothing worthwhile is ever easy.

Downsizing, layoffs, it doesn't matter what it's called, the impact is the 
same...increased employee upheaval and stress.  What is the psychological 
impact of downsizing, and what we can do to help ourselves or our co-
worker who's lost his job?<P>



Empty work stations where workers once sat.  It's the trend...downsizing.  
It's enough to make you stressed-out.  Jill, a social worker asked to conceal 
her identity for fear of retribution.  She's watched her co-workers being laid-
off, and fears she may be next.<P>


Jill Walker<BR>
Social Worker<BR>
<EM>"There's a sadness, we're feeling...a grief aspect to it...that we're worried 
about what's going to happen next, but also what's happening to the 
individual people who are not going to be with us.  So there's a lot of.... 
there's anger.  There's all kinds of feelings that people have."
</EM><P>


Working in an environment filled with layoffs is keeping psychologists and 
psychiatrists busy.<P>


Michael Kowitt, Ph.D.<BR>
Director of Psychology<BR>
Institute of Pennsylvania Hospital<BR>
Philadelphia, PA<BR>
<EM>"Cutbacks, downsizings, have swept through industry and it really doesn't 
matter how good or how loyal you were...and the sense of security now is 
gone."</EM><P>





The stages stress caused by downsizing include..anger or 
betrayal...depression or blame, especially with traumatic overnight firings 
with no time to plan for the future or to say good-bye...and finally realizing 
you need expert help to begin to rebuild your personal and professional life.<P>


Martin Rosenzweig. M.D.<BR>
Director of Mood Disorders Program<BR>
Institute of Pennsylvania Hospital<BR>
Philadelphia, PA<BR>
<EM>"As traumatic as the downsizing is, people need to keep in mind that the 
unemployment rate is not soaring.  There is some hope that they will be 
employed again....albeit..maybe not at the same kind of salary range but 
they will find work."</EM><P>


Experts also say many of the patients they're seeing are using this as an 
opportunity to start the business they had only dreamed of in the past.<P>

<H4><FONT color="#000080">Drill-Less Dentistry:  Part 1</H4></FONT>
<STRONG>What Is It?</STRONG>
Imagine sandblasting your cavities away, imagine no more needles, no more droopy 
lips and drool after visiting your dentist.  It is a new technique dentists call air abrasion.  According to Len Ledet, DDS the air abrasion approach works like a sandblaster.  It will just abrade away the tooth structure just as a drill would cut it away.
<P>
Air abrasion has been around a long time. The hand held device was invented in 1943 by dentist, Robert Black.  Unfortunately its high prices prevented dentists from implementing the virtually pain-less procedure into their offices. 
<P>
The device applies micro air abrasion to remove decay from teeth. The most common use of these machines is to aid in the preparation and restoration of various cavities and tooth decay.  However, none of the air abrasion units available are designed for complicated procedures.
<P>
<STRONG>How It Works:</STRONG>
The cavity is cut with the advanced particle beam and then etched and cleaned out.  Next, the area is filled in with a bonding agent and a laser is used to make the agent stick and dry. Finally, the area is polished and smoothed to match the contours of the natural tooth.  
<P>
According to manufacturers, the filling is practically invisible to a trained eye.  The laser also lowers the risks of contamination from saliva, saving the patient an unnecessary trip back to the dentist.  When contamination occurs the bonding has to be removed, cleaned, and applied again.
<P>
<STRONG>Benefits:</STRONG>
According to manufacturers, the treatment is quick and causes almost no discomfort.  
Dental patients say they prefer air abrasion.  David Weber, dental patient, says, It went really quick, that was the main thing I noticed.  I didnt have to wait for the Novocain and Im not leaving having my tongue feeling like a football.   Because of the ease and comfort of this new procedure, dentists believe air abrasion will become essential in the treatment of children.
<P>
<STRONG>Dentists:</STRONG>
Cost for the air abrasion machine ranges from $8,000 to $18,000. However, some 
dentists agree that you more than make-up for the cost by having the time to schedule more patients.  Aside from being more expensive than conventional dentistry tools, the air abrasion unit has the potential to be very messy.  According to Reality Now, an information source for dentists, the use of an external suction device helps keep the debris created from the air abrasion contained.

   Perhaps the increase in eating disorders is due to mixed
messages we get when wafer thin
supermodels are glorified in the media.  The media messages are confusing. 
While fitness experts promote healthy
lifestyles, it's wafer-thin model
Kate Moss and company who promote fun
and fashion.  The Baywatch babes set
an impossible standard for many women. 
   The result can be a dangerous slide
into the world of anorexia and bulimia.
   A local psychotherapist wants to
help change all that in a time when
resources are dwindling.<P>


Susan Byrd<BR>
Battles Eating Disorders<BR>

<EM>"I was having heart problems, skipping beats.  I missed
work.  I had problems with my kidneys
because I wasn't getting enough
water keeping enough liquids
inside."</EM><P>

After years of destructive
eating patterns, that was a turning
point for Susan Byrd.<P>


 Susan Byrd<BR>
<EM> "At that point it was either die or drink some water and I decided to drink some
water."</EM><P>
 
And she's been getting better
ever since.  But Susan admits, she's
lucky.  She got help.  With a changing
health care system and cutbacks in
coverage for psychological disorders, 
the resources just aren't there.<P>

Cindy Ryan<BR>
Psychotherapist<BR>
<EM>"A lot of the programs around town
have closed down.  I get calls from
parents saying I don't know what to do.
 I don't know what to tell her.  I
don't know where to go.  There's no
resources for parents and no place for someone with
limited funds."</EM><P>

 So Cindy put together a video. 
"Deadly Reflections" is a 30-minute
look at anorexia and bulimia to help
women "see" the problem.<P>

Cindy Ryan<BR>
<EM>"That they could identify with the
person on the screen, look at the
person and say I do the same things.  She looks like me.  I've had the same
thoughts."</EM><P>


The video shows interviews with experts and women who have confronted
their eating disorder, encouraging
information on effective treatments and
a docudrama, a day in the life of a
woman struggling with anorexia and
bulimia.  Cindy emphasizes  "Deadly
Reflections" is not a cure for eating
disorders.
    It's basic education and should be
used as a stepping stone to treatment.<P>

<STRONG>   If you'd like to order "Deadly
Reflections," call
1-800-246-2502.  The cost is $24.95
plus shipping and handling.</STRONG><BR><A HREF="Stayhealthymain.html">-back-</A></FONT>

For many people, life in a nursing home can cause serious depression.  They 
are no longer independent, and it can be very boring.  A new program could 
make nursing homes a much nicer place to be.<P> 



When Anna Griffin first came to national health care center she was angry and 
depressed, but that all changed when she got Peter and Susie.<P> 


Anna Griffin<BR>
Nursing Home Resident<BR>
<EM>"I got something to do now.  I got my birds.  I'm not lonely." </EM><P>


The center has a program called "Eden Alternative."  The idea is to put the 
"home" back in nursing homes by letting residents care for gardens and 
animals.<P>  


John Morley, M.D.<BR>
Gerontologist<BR>
St. Louis University Medical Center<BR>
St. Louis, MO<BR>
<EM>"As soon as the animals arrived people who spent their time in their rooms 
started coming out.  People who were very depressed began to smile.  There 
was a lot more interaction and perhaps most excitingly, young children started 
to come in to visit their grandparents." </EM><P>

Eden Alternative is designed to spark activity and alleviate feelings of 
helplessness that many residents find in nursing homes.  It works.  Depression 
is down, participation is up and patients are more satisfied.<P> 


Mary Markmueller<BR>
Nursing Home Resident<BR>
<EM>"When we were little we had a lot of chickens, and I always used to
favor one of the Rhode Island Reds." </EM><P>


Eden Alternative triggers fond memories, and administrators hope it creates 
an environment that feels less like a nursing home. <P>


Jennifer Gettman<BR>
Administrator<BR>
National Health Care Center<BR>
St. Louis, MO<BR>
<EM>"We were touring a potential resident's family, and the resident turned to the 
social worker and asked, 'Do you have to be ill to live here?'"  </EM><P>


Another Eden Alternative home is in New York.<P>
 


By the way, not all the animals worked out so well.  The pot bellied pigs were a 
mess and had to go and some goats jumped the fence and ate the lawn 
furniture.<P>

   Hot enough for you?
   While the majority of us spent the
day keeping cool to be comfortable, for the elderly keeping cool in hot
weather is actually a mater of
survival.<P>
   The folks at the North Park Senior
Center kept cool today by staying
indoors and taking it easy.
 That's a good idea because as according to UCSD's Dr.
Mark Bracker, the elderly are
at greater risk of heat stroke.<P>  Normally a body cools off

shows sweat glands release sweat and
blood vessels swell to cool the
bloodstream, but with heat
stroke, vessels shrink as blood
pressure drops and sweat glands stop
working so the body can't cool down.<P>
   Thirst is the body's signal to avoid
heat stroke and in hot weather it's
best to respond immediately.
  Dr. Bracker says drinking lots of
water along with beverages with
elctrolites is a good idea.
  He also advises you stay in the
shade, use a wet cloth to promote
evaporation and think cool thoughts.
And a reminder to parents--very young
children also don't regulate body
temperature as well.
   So they need to be dressed lightly
and given lots of fluids.<BR><A HREF="Stayhealthymain.html">-back-</A></FONT>

<H4><font color="#000080">Emergency Contraception Hotline</H4></font><font size=2>

     
<b>America's Best Kept Contraception Secret:</b><br>
Few women in America realize there is a birth control regimen that can be used after unplanned intercourse to prevent pregnancy.  Over 3.5 million pregnancies are unplanned each year, 50 percent due to the failure of a contraception device.  
<P>
Over 1.7 million of these pregnancies and 800,000 abortions each year could be prevented if women knew about the "morning-after" pill.  This is actually a misnomer because the Emergency Contraception Pill (ECP) can work up to 72 hours after unprotected sex.
<P>
<b>The Hotline:</b><br>
In February 1996, the Reproductive Health Technologies Project out of Washington, DC launched an Emergency Contraceptive Hotline that explains contraceptive options.  It also refers women to health care providers in their area who will set up immediate appointments for a consultation and then prescribe the birth control pills.  Over 2,000 health care providers in all 50 states are taking part in this project.<P>
<b>Emergency Contraceptive Pills:</b><br>
These are common birth control pills containing estrogen and progestin, which disrupt the normal hormone pattern of the menstrual cycle by either blocking the ovaries from releasing an egg, preventing the egg's fertilization by the sperm, or preventing the egg from implanting in the uterus lining.  Brand names include Ovral, Lo/Ovral, Nordette, Levlen, Tri-Levlin and Triphasil.  
<P>
The treatment involves taking a specific dose, two or four, of the birth control pills within 72 hours after having unprotected sex, and a second dose 12 hours after the first dose.  Eating a snack or drinking a glass of milk with the medication is recommended to prevent nausea.
<P>
<b>Side Effects:</b><br>
Approximately one-third of women will have temporary nausea for a day or two, which is generally mild and can be treated with Dramamine.  If vomiting occurs immediately after taking the medication, it may be necessary to repeat the dose.  <P>

Also watch for these danger signs in the weeks following the dose of ECPs:  severe pain in leg (calf or thigh), severe abdominal pain, chest pain or cough, shortness of breath, severe headaches, dizziness, weakness or numbness, blurred or loss of vision, trouble speaking or jaundice (yellowing of the skin or whites of the eyes).  If any of these symptoms occur, consult with your doctor.
<P>
<b>Candidates:</b><br>
Many women can safely take ECPs, even women who can't normally take birth control pills. However, it is important to discuss the possibility of an existing pregnancy with your physician or possible side effects to the ECPs if youve ever had a stroke, breast cancer, blood clots in your legs or lungs, or any serious medical disorder such as diabetes, liver disease or high blood pressure.

New research may prove that breast cancer can be successfully treated 
without removing a woman's breast.  For years, breast removal has been the standard treatment for breast cancer.  Now doctors say breasts can be saved by reversing the order of treatment.<P>
 


Five years ago, Patti Goodall found a very large tumor in her breast. She was 
told the only option to save her life was a mastectomy.<P>


Patti Goodall<BR>
Mastectomy Patient<BR>
Cancer Survivor<BR>
<EM>
"If I had had the opportunity when I was diagnosed, and if they had shown me 
information that said it was just as effective. I would have chosen a 
lumpectomy over a mastectomy."
</EM><P>


But most women don't know that studies have proven that removing only the 
tumor and radiation is as effective as a mastectomy.
<P>

Harry Bear, M.D., Ph.D.<BR>

Virginia Commonwealth Universities<BR>
Medical College of Virginia<BR>
Richmond, VA<BR>
<EM>"In previous trials we've shown that lumpectomy and mastectomy have 
absolutely identical survivals over follow-up periods of more than ten years."</EM><P>




Yet this year, 60% of the 185,000 women diagnosed with breast cancer will 
undergo a mastectomy, only 30% a lumpectomy.  <P>


Harry Bear, M.D., Ph.D.<BR>
<EM>"It's been estimated, and looking at our pervious studies at least two-thirds of 
women who have breast cancer could have a breast conservation approach."</EM><P>




Dr. Bear says that even some patients with large tumors could avoid breast 
removal if they underwent chemotherapy before surgery.<P>


Harry Bear, M.D., Ph.D.<BR>
<EM>"We know from that study that 80% of the patients treated with chemotherapy 
before surgery had a very marked shrinkage of their breast tumors. I think this 
very well could be the beginning of the end of mastectomies."</EM><P>

mentioned in the story call  1-800-798-7425.<P>

<H4><FONT color="#000080">Photodynamic Therapy</H4></FONT>
<I>Air Date -- 2.5.97</I>
<P>


<B>Esophageal Cancer:</B><BR>
Each year 12,000 new cases of esophageal cancer are detected, and 11,000
Americans die from the disease.  This form of cancer is on the rise in
America for white men over the age of 50.  Some experts say the sharp
rise is associated with the overuse of chronic heartburn medication and
the high rate of a pre-cancerous esophageal cancer condition called
Barretts Syndrome.
<P>
<B>Photodynamic Therapy:</B>
Photodynamic therapy is the process by which the drug photofrin is
intravenously fed into the body for 24 to 48 hours.  The drug collects
mainly in the tumor area.  A fiber optic probe is inserted into the
patients esophagus where it directs low-energy, non-thermal laser light
at the cancerous tissue for 12 minutes.  The light activates the drug
causing it to destroy tumor cells.
<P>
<B>Side Effects:</B>
Because the laser is a cool laser with a gentle light, the skin may
receive a sunburn, but not a serious burn.  However, the patient will be
photosensitive (a condition where the skin has an abnormal and severe
reaction to sunlight) and must avoid contact with the sun and bright
light sources for 30 days.  Following surgery, there may be slight
tenderness when swallowing due to the sunburn, discomfort in the chest,
fever or slight nausea.
<P>
<B>Other Options:</B>
While this is the only option for patients who have inoperable cancer,
it is also an important option for older patients who cannot tolerate
massive surgery.  If surgery is performed, but the cancer is not
completely removed, chemotherapy and radiation are other options.
<P>
<B>Cost:</B>
Photodynamic therapy is much less expensive than surgery because it is
performed on an out-patient basis.  The approximate cost is $12,000.  It
is being covered by some insurance carriers, including Medicare.
<P>
<B>Future Plans:</B>
Researchers think that this laser therapy may one day be the cure for
esophageal cancer.  In October 1996, photodynamic therapy received
approval from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as treatment for
inoperable esophageal cancer.  Trials have shown that 94 percent of
patients had positive tumor response.  Since the results have been so
positive on inoperable cases, researchers are now using the drug on
early cancer cases before the disease has spread throughout the body. 
It is our hope that this will be a cure for esophageal cancer when the
cancer is picked up at such an early stage that it has not invaded and
gone else where, says Gastroenterologist Alvin Zfass, M.D., lead
researcher at Virginia Commonwealth University-Medical College of
Virginia in Richmond.  
<P>
Dr. Zfass says doctors across the country are
closely monitoring patients with Barretts Syndrome.  If early cancer,
or dysplasia (abnormal development of tissue) develops, it is the
perfect time to use photodynamic therapy.  Its important to gather data
on early testing to have positive proof to submit to the FDA that this
therapy works in early cancer cases.

In a society that places a lot of emphasis on good looks, life can be difficult for children born with misshapen heads and faces.<P>



Surgeons call Claire Phillips a "work in progress."  She's a bright, happy  eleven year old, who was born with Apert's syndrome. <P>


Vickie Phillips<BR>
Claire's Mother<BR>
Birmingham, AL<BR>
<EM>"She had to have head surgery when she was six weeks old, to basically unfuse the skull bones up here." </EM><P>


Like many children with facial deformities, as Claire's forehead and chin grew, the middle section of her face did not. Her eyes bulged, and she had difficulty  breathing.  <P>


Paul Howard, M.D.<BR>
Chief of Plastic Surgery<BR>
The Children's Hospital of Alabama<BR>
Birmingham, AL<BR>
<EM>"Some of the sutures that connect this face to this skull just wouldn't let the face grow forward. And therefore, to fix it what you have to do is go inside the head and separate this whole area and this whole area down to these teeth and separate it from the skull and move it forward." 
</EM><P>

The surgery can be risky, but the results are often remarkable. In Claire's case, she no longer gasps for air when she has a cold and her eyelids better protect her eyes. She'll eventually have braces for her teeth and  a procedure to straighten her eye muscles, but already Claire likes her new looks.<P>


Vickie Phillips<BR>

<EM>"I catch Claire in the bathroom with a little hand mirror that we have in the bathroom and she's just looking at herself in the mirror. She's quite happy with herself, we're all happy." </EM><P>



Some other centers that do craniofacial surgeries are: Miami, at the University of Miami, Tampa , New York, at NYU, Chicago, Atlanta and Los Angeles.<P>

Radio, magazines and television constantly talk about the importance of 
exercising.  It's not only good for adults, it also sets an example for our 
children.  Parents should pick exercises that are good for themselves and fun for 
the kids. <P>  


Charlene Monetti<BR>
Exercise Instructor<BR>

<EM>"It's just like any other developmental skill.  Your children will imitate 
you.  They see Dad out running, they wanna go running.  They see 
Mom on a bike, they wanna be on a bike.  If they see you come home 
every night, sit in the chair and eat chips and watch TV, chances are 
that's what junior's gonna be doing or wanting to be doing."  </EM><P>



Sometimes we do think of exercise as a chore, but these parents have 
found a little enthusiasm goes a long way in getting kids to exercise.  <P>


Marion Nass <BR>
Mom<BR>
<EM>"All they have to do is see my shoes and when they see my shoes, they 
say, 'oh, we're gonna go exercise, Mom, we're going to exercise.'"  </EM><P>


Anne Sellers<BR>
Mom<BR>


<EM>"There's no pulling it cause he loves to come, and actually, the days we 
don't come, he's like 'what are we gonna do, Mom?'"</EM><P>  


Experts say overweight children tend to become overweight adults.  The 
patterns are set early.  That's why the examples set now are so 
important.  Parents don't need to attend a class to get kids exercising.  They can 
help children get into the habit by simply spending time playing at home.<P>

Trying to find that happy medium between munching on fast food and 
molding yourself into a low-fat diet?  It can be done, it just takes the right food 
choices.  Think high-fat foods like pizza, burgers and french fries don't fit in a calorie-
conscious low-fat diet?  The latest news nutritionists are dishing out may be 
easy to swallow. <P>


Jamie Pope<BR>
Dietitian<BR>
<EM>"Fast food is a reality and telling people not to eat it is not only unnecessary, 
but unrealistic. So what people have to do is learn how to eat out and still eat 
out reasonably low-fat and reasonably healthfully."</EM><P>



Researchers say most Americans want to eat better and watch their weight.  
But people living in constant high gear tend to grab fast food because of the 
convenience. <P>


Jamie Pope<BR>
<EM>"When you read surveys about fast food eating, it indicates that about 60 
percent of the Americans are interested in eating healthfully when they eat 
out.  However, when they get in the line to actually order, only 30, at most 
40 percent, actually choose lower fat selections."</EM><P>



And which meal do Americans eat out the most?  You guessed it.... Lunch.  <P>


Irene Guest<BR>
Fast Food Fanatic<BR>
<EM>"Because time you get up and do things you have to do before you leave 
home, you don't want to pack a lunch, it's too much trouble to pack a lunch 
once you've straightened up, gotten yourself ready to go to work and working 
full-time you have to take advantage of every minute." </EM><P>


Kathy Myers<BR>
Fast  Food Fanatic<BR>
<EM>"I think they do better now than they used to.  Used to be there was no 
choice, now it's good that they offer salads."</EM><P> 




Dietitians say it's not necessary to completely cut fast foods from your diet but the best trick is to pick lower calorie foods without all the excess fat.  At the rate Americans eat out right now, by the year 2000, most of us will 
get a majority of our  meals from restaurants.<P>

The McShane family is into healthy
eating at home these days but it hasn't
always been this way.

Charlie remembers how daughter Madison
helped him realize the family needed a
change.<P>

Charlie McShane<BR>
<EM>"It wasn't until one day she asked us after we had
already eaten at home, why we haven't
gone to the restaurant.
 And we realized we eat out too often."</EM><P>

Tonight's menu is healthy stir fry cooked
in chicken broth instead of oil.<P>

 Mother<BR>
<EM>"By starting early, they
get used to eating healthy foods."</EM><P>

A key to good health is cutting down on
fat.
Adults should limit their fat intake to
20 percent of calories from fat each
day, kids can eat closer to 30
percent of calories from fat.
The number one source of fat in our
diet is ground beef.<P>
 
Jane Hurley<BR>
Nutrition Specialist<BR>
<EM>"Other problem foods are fatty
whole milk, fatty cheeses, ice cream,
and, of course, fried foods.  If
everyone could cut back on those
foods, they could cut back
significantly on the amount of fat they
eat."</EM><P>

There's a world of lower fat healthy
foods to choose from by following
the food pyramid, the USDA guideline
for a healthy diet.
Focus on eating from the bottom of the
pyramid up.
Load up on whole grains and fresh
fruits and vegetables.
Those are the foods that offer 
vitamins and minerals known as disease
fighters.
Most Americans eat too much protein.
Go for the leanest choices like poultry
or seafood and eat smaller servings.<P>
 Nadine Pasder<BR>
Registered Dietitian<BR>
<EM>"We're still saying two to three servings of protein in a day, but now,
for our day's total we're talking about
it being four to six ounces, as opposed
to four to six per serving and I think that's the real
change."</EM><P>

Often the key to eating right comes
down to taste. To keep the family
interested, learn new ways to fry using
chicken broth, defatted stock or even
fruit juice instead of oil.
Experiment with herbs and spices to
replace salt and butter.
Be inventive with sauces; Cream
sauces can be created with yogurt,
nonfat ricotta or pureed fruit.
And keep portions under control.
A diet with variety, balance and
moderation is sure to keep the family
fat free and healthy.<BR><A HREF="Stayhealthymain.html">-back-</A></FONT>

It's lunch time at this high school 
and these days that's means healthier
eating.<P>


This is no experiment.
Schools across America are learning to
comply with new USDA guidelines that
must be met by the 96-97 school year.
And nutritionists say its about time.
In 1993 the USDA studied lunches for
more than 500 schools.
Meals exceeded dietary guidelines for
fat by more than 25 percent, saturated fat by more than 50 percent, and sodium by nearly 100 percent.<P>

So schools are making changes.
They're using whole wheat flower and
lowfat cheese.
They use fat free butter substitutes on
their breads.
And they offer more fresh fruits and
vegetables then ever before.<P>

How are the students adapting?
Some of the low fat fare can be a hard
sell. Today's lean turkey dogs and low
fat french fries get mixed reviews.<P>
 


But here's the bigger challenge for
schools- fatty fast food.
As names like Dominoes and McDonalds
take up more cafeteria space, 
nutritionists say its tough for the
healthy stuff to survive.<P>

David Schardt<BR>
Nutrition Specialist<BR>
<EM>"Kids are so influenced by
advertising, by peer pressure that
they'll gravitate toward the fast food
and away from the fruits and vegetables."</EM><P>

Its hard for schools to say no to fast
food because selling it helps support
the food service.
Food service directors say their
mission is clear. They must not only be
cooks and bakers of healthy foods,
they must be savvy marketers too.<P>
 
Delores Ford<BR>
Food Services Director<BR>
<EM>"McDonald's has taught me, Taco
Bell has taught me, they've all taught
me.  Now I'm going to use all that because it works."</EM><P>
An occasional fast food lunch is not a
big deal if its balanced with healthier
meals through out the week.
Teaching students to choose that
balance for themselves will be the big
challenge for schools in the coming
years.<BR><A HREF="Stayhealthymain.html">-back-</A></FONT>

    Today's lunch at Hickman Elementary
School is chicken patties, baked (not
fried) french fries, fruit and salad
bar.
   Sounds pretty healthy.
   And it is.  Children in the San Diego
School District get one third of their
daily government recommended allowance
of nutrients from the school lunch
program.
   A lot of parents probably can't match
that record.
   And this healthy eating is nothing
new to San Diego.
   The district has been cooking this
way since 1978.<P>

 Sue Gilroy<BR>
Food Services<BR>
<EM>  "Choosing foods wisely to get
the right nutrients into your diet is
what we're all about and teaching
children to do that."</EM><P>
  
       San Diego schools
serve up 100,000 meals a day.
   To accommodate this staggering
demand there are 23 large kitchens in
schools which service the school they
are at and 4 to 17 other additional
schools.
   It's accomplished through a meal
transport system that's as
sophisticated as any airline.
   Now all of this is important, but
face it, it's meaningless if children
don't eat what they're served.
   And that means it all comes down to
the menu. <P>
 Brenda Reynosa<BR>
Registered Dietitian<BR>
<EM>  "When we start writing a menu
I focus on the entre and pick the types
of things kids like to eat and then we
add fruits and vegetables and one
percent milk to provide a menu that's
balanced and low in fat."</EM><P>
  
   Since schools make most of their
dishes from scratch, they can control
the ingredients to make them lower in
fat.
   However, do kids really like all
these fruits and veggies?<P>
 
 Sue Gilroy<BR>
Food Services<BR>
<EM>  "The students of San Diego
are very accepting of fruits and
vegetables, they obviously like raw
vegetables better than cooked 
vegetables so that's mostly what we
serve and fruit, they love any kind of
fruit."</EM><P>
  
    Another challenge District
Dietitian Brenda Reynosa deals
with is government
commodities.
   The government will help out
farmers and ranchers by buying large
quantities of their products.
   They give these food commodities to
American schools.
   That doesn't mean it's canned
chipped beef on toast.  Today the
government is much more health
conscious, so schools are receiving low
fat foods to incorporate into their
menus.
   All of this careful planning is
extremely important because, for some
kids, the school lunch or breakfast is
the best meal they're going to get.<BR><A HREF="Stayhealthymain.html">-back-</A></FONT>

<FONT size=2>
Imagine being able to clean blood by putting it through a filter.  That's what blood banks around the country are doing to make blood transfusions safe for patients with weak immune systems.


Donated blood is screened and tested for a common infection called cyto-megalo-virus, or CMV.  Newborns who need transfusions, some AIDS patients, and most people undergoing bone marrow or solid organ transplants need CMV free blood. <P>


Merlyn Sayers. M.D.<BR>
Director Transfusion Surveillance<BR>
Puget Sound Blood Center<BR>
Seattle, WA<BR>
<EM>"CMV is a very, very common virus. Fifty percent of otherwise healthy adults have been infected with CMV."  </EM><P>


With CMV free blood in short supply around the country, attention is now focused on a new study that shows CMV can be filtered out of blood. <P>


Raleigh Bowden, M.D.<BR>
<EM>
"We're filtering out white blood cells so that the blood coming out of the filter no longer has those white blood cells that contain the virus and it can be safely given to patients without  transmitting the infection."</EM><P>



Dr. Raleigh Bowden says the filter is pretty simple. <P>


Raleigh Bowden, M.D. <BR>
Infectious Disease Program <BR>
Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center<BR>
Seattle, WA<P>
<EM>"It's actually just a simple gel that's inside the filter that the white blood cells stick to." </EM><P>


Robert Hull<BR>
Patient<BR>
Seattle, WA<BR>

<EM>"I sure hope it doesn't get any worse."  </EM><P>




Robert Hull had a bone marrow transplant for Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma.  He could need up to 100 units of CMV free blood in the next couple of months. <P>


Raleigh Bowden, M. D.<BR>

<EM>"They don't have the right kind of cells to fight virus infections, therefore, if they come in contact with this virus, usually through blood products after their transplant, it can cause very serious infection and sometimes death."</EM><P>



CMV poses little risk to most healthy people.  People who carry the virus have it their entire lives, even though they may never get sick.  Insurance covers filtered blood and many blood banks around the country are using filtration. Doctors say there is still no way to filter out HIV or the hepatitis virus from blood. <P>

<b>The Fitness Dilemma:</b>
There is no doubt that exercise is good for us.  It can control weight, blood pressure, complications of diabetes and even help ward off heart disease and some types of cancer. Americans spend billions on gym memberships, exercise equipment and weight control products that often end up collecting dust because the individual loses motivation, interest, or doesn't get the results they hoped for.  National statistics show that 50% of health club members quit in the first six months and 90% of new PFS members quit in the first year.<P>

<b>Personal Fitness System: </b>PFS, is a computer generated personality survey that helps tailor a fitness regimen to a person's individual personality traits. The 24 question survey takes only a few minutes to complete.  The questions address personality traits rather than exercise practices.  It measures the levels of four different types of behavior found in everyone.
<P>
- Dominance:  How you respond to problems or challenges
<br>
- Influence:  How you interact with people and influence them
<br>
- Steadiness:  How you respond to change
<br>
- Compliance:  How you respond to rules set by others
 <P>
The completed survey is analyzed by a special computer program developed by personal trainer Deby Harper and the Arizona State University Exercise Science Department.  It produces a ten-page personal profile with insights into what will keep you interested and motivated, and how fitness trainers need to communicate with you in order to get the best workout from you.  The report takes the guesswork out of designing a challenging, productive and personalized fitness program for anyone.  It gives any personal trainer or health club fitness instructor a quick and accurate reference guide to the client they are working with; how they respond to direction, how to focus on the exercise instead of outside thoughts, what kind of exercise environment they prefer, what their goals are and how to guide them to that end.
<P>
<b>The Compatability Factor:</b>
Deby Harper of the Fitness Company says the survey has a 90% accuracy rate in its ability to profile an individual's personality.  Harper says as a result of the survey, clients are more motivated, more productive and less stressful and injury prone.  She's also seeing clients who used to be quitters now sticking with their exercise regimen and enjoying themselves more.  The survey and ten-page analysis costs $40.00.

<H4><FONT color="#000080">Food Allergies:  Part 1</H4></FONT>
<STRONG>The Study:</STRONG>
Researchers at Johns Hopkins Medical Center believe that food allergies that are 
undetected by standard allergy tests may be the root of many children's gastrointestinal problems, rather than acid reflux.  A new system for testing food allergies in children suffering from severe nausea, pain, vomiting and poor weight gain shows promising results.  The study group consisted of 10 children being treated for Gastric Esophageal Reflux but their medication or surgery was failing to improve their symptoms.  They required constant medication to remain symptom free.
<P>
<STRONG>Diet:</STRONG>
The children, ages 8 months to 12 years, were put on a highly-restrictive, amino-based formula for two weeks. The formula contained all the nutrients and vitamins to ensure proper health.  The formula is free of the proteins that trigger allergic responses.  In addition, they were allowed clear liquids, apples and corn products since children are rarely allergic to them. "We found that they improved in 7-10 days.  The mothers called back in disbelief that their children had improved so dramatically," says Kevin Kelly, M.D. the director of the study. "We didn't expect such a remarkable outcome, but it was so gratifying that they had gotten so much better."
<P>
<STRONG>Results:</STRONG>
Once the children became symptom-free their mothers slowly reintroduced them to food 
products one-by-one.  Four products were found to be the leading cause of irritation in the study group:
<P>
- Milk Protein<br>
- Eggs<br>
- Soy Protein<br>
- Wheat Protein<br>
<P>
Nine of the ten patients reacted to more than one food group.  Eight eventually stopped chronic anti-reflux medication.
 <P>
<STRONG>Hereditary?</STRONG>
Amazingly enough, the study also found that the parents often complained of the 
same symptoms as their children.  Once they saw the positive results in their children, they too changed their diets and became symptom-free.<P>
<STRONG>
Further Study:</STRONG>
Dr. Kelly says that although these amino-based formulas are a reasonable tool to 
detect food allergies, we need a better understanding of the relationship between the intake of food and the development of gastrointestinal symptoms.  "I think that we should further investigate the possibility that there might be another reason why they have their pain other than acid secretion."

We all forget things once in a while but what's considered normal 
forgetfulness? Undergoing intense neurological testing can be a real 
turnoff but if results were quick and easy, more people might get tested.<P>



Every once in a while, Zelda Covey  loses track of her car keys. <P>

     
Zelda Covey<BR>
<EM>"I say did I put my car keys in my pocket or did I put them on the table, 
or what?"</EM><P>


After retiring from the workforce, Zelda wanted to know just how sharp 
her memory is.  At the University of Alabama at Birmingham, a healthy memory screen 
gave her immediate results. <P>


Daniel Marson, JD, Ph.D <BR>
Department of Neurology    <BR>  
University of Alabama at Birmingham School of  Medicine<BR>
<EM>"What makes the healthy memory screen different is that it's responding 
to, I think, a need in the older adult community to find out whether the 
memory loss they are experiencing is simply age related or not." </EM><P>




Participants take standardized tests on visual and verbal memory, 
attention and naming.  Of sixty patients screened, thirty five percent had 
normal age-related memory loss.  Twenty five percent had memory loss 
due to depression and forty percent showed abnormal memory loss and 
needed a full work-up. <P>


Daniel Marson, JD, Ph.D.<BR>
<EM>"The litmus test remains whether or not memory loss is beginning to 
interfere with your social and occupational functioning." </EM><P>


Some of the warning signs of serious memory loss can include:
Forgetting appointments, asking people to repeat things to you and forgetting navigational routes in the car.   For Zelda, her screening results were positive and reassuring.<P>

Zelda Covey<BR>
<EM>"Made me feel better, more confident.  When she told me I was average, 
that made me feel good too." </EM><P>


The test costs eighty five dollars and lasts two hours. Results are 
instantaneous.<P>

Jon Turner knows what a genetic defect
can mean.  His wife Sharon died of a
heart attack caused by a genetic defect
of the heart called long q-t syndrome. 
Their child Jacob, also carries the
deadly gene. <P>
 
But Jon tells us, <EM>"He has
never had a problem at all.  He is
total a-symptomatic."</EM><P> 
Despite this, when Jon left his job to
be a full-time dad and was taken off
his employer's group insurance policy,
he was met with a surprise.  When he
applied for an individual policy, Jon
was denied coverage for his son at
normal rates.<P>
 
Stanford University Geneticist Dr. Paul
Billings says, <EM>"We have hundreds of examples of
insurance companies who have used
family history information, the results
of genetic based tests to limit
people's access to insurance."</EM><P>

90% of those who have insurance, have
it on a group basis, such as through
work. <P>
 
Harvie Raymond,

 Assistant Vice President at Health
Insurance Association of America Reports,
<EM>"It's a ninety percent solution where
pre-existing conditions and problems of
past health history really are not a
problem." </EM><P>
Because of cases like Jon Turner's,
California Senator, Patrick Johnston
has pioneered legislation that prevents
insurers from denying coverage or
charging higher rates because of a
genetic trait. <P>
 Senator Johnston says,
 <EM>"They can't have a
crummy policy at a high cost for
someone that they think someday may
have a disease." </EM><P>
After Senator Johnston's legislation
passed, Jon's premiums were lowered.  <P>

Wendy McGoodwin of the Council for
Responsible Genetics says strong
anti-discrimination legislation at the
federal level is also needed.<P>

 Wendy Mcgoodwin believes, <EM>"It needs to
guarantee privacy by restricting the
ability of third parties to collect
genetic information and it needs to
prevent discrimination by restricting
their ability to use that information
however they may obtain it." </EM><P>
Dr. Billings would like to go further
than that.
 
 He says, <EM>"We need to establish our genetic
information as a civil right."</EM><P>
On the other side, Insurance Spokesman
Harvie Raymond says insurers must have
access to genetic information to
protect themselves from people who buy
insurance only after they learn they
have a defective gene.  This could
cause a disproportionate number of
claims. <P>
 
 
 Harvie Raymond explains, <EM>"There has to be
an adequacy of premiums to pay claims."</EM><P>

McGoodwin points out that insurance
companies have always offered insurance
to people destined to become ill.<P>

 
 
<EM>"It's
just that before now they weren't able
to identify who those individuals
were."       </EM><BR><A HREF="Stayhealthymain.html">-back-</A></FONT>

Patsy Benner believes she owes her life
to genetic testing.  But, Patsy had to
visit four doctors before one suggested
a genetic test.  She learned she has
the gene for hemochromatosis.  This rare
defect can cause diabetes, liver
failure or heart failure.<P>

Genetic tests are available for a
number of diseases. There's testing for
some forms of colon cancer, breast
cancer, melanoma and Alzheimer's. 
Tests for diabetes, ovarian cancer and
lung cancer are on the way.<P>

Dr. Judy Garber, Cancer Specialist at Dana Farber Cancer Institute in Boston says, <EM>"In the future, we'll be able to
test for genes that are less powerful
and still hopefully give us ways to
reduce our risk of cancer and other
diseases." </EM><P>

Scientists say learning how our genes
work will allow us to wipe out disease.
Genetic tests are just the first step.
<P>
Dr. Mark Guyer, Genetic Researcher Assistant Director for Program Coordination at National Center for Human
Genome Research tells us, <EM>"In the future we'll
be able to say we know how to intervene
to actually prevent the disease from
developing." </EM><P>

In Patsy's case, intervention is
already possible.  Once she learned she
had the gene, Patsy began a simple
treatment to prevent hemochromotosis
from developing.  She also contacted
her brother.  <P>

Patsy says, <EM>"They caught him
in the early stages and he's being
treated and he's just fine too.  So
this has all come from the genetic
testing." </EM><P>

But knowing your genetic information is
a double-edged sword. <P>
 
 Dr. Robert E. Murray, Jr., Genetic Researcher Chief of Medical Genetics at Howard
University in Washington D.C. explains, "<EM>On the one
hand it will allow them to take action.
 On the other hand it will give
information to employers or insurance
companies about the possibility that
people will get illnesses somewhere
down the line and that can be used
against them." </EM><P>
Doctors and scientists say
discrimination based on genetic traits
is unfair because genetic information
is inconclusive. <P>

Dr. Garber says, <EM>"These tests
are hardly black and white.  Having a
gene does not mean you will get
cancer."</EM><P>

Bill Allen, Assistant Professor of Medical Humanities
at the
 University of Florida disagrees.  He says, <EM>"Some people
who have had particular genetic
conditions have had a hard time getting
automobile insurance, some have been
discriminated against in adoption
settings." </EM><P>

 Geneticist Dr. Paul
Billings at 

 Stanford University says, <EM>"There are
probably at least a million people who
are being discriminated against on the
basis of their family history or
genetic testing." </EM><P>


Dr. Billings is one of many who say we
won't be able to enjoy the full benefit
of genetics until we have laws to keep
genetic information private.<BR><A HREF="Stayhealthymain.html">-back-</A></FONT>

Cancer is the second leading cause of death in the U.S.  One and a quarter 
million people are diagnosed with it each year.  It's not a disease that's easy to 
talk about, but a California radio station devotes a weekly group therapy show  to 
do just that.  It's the first talk show of its kind on the nation's airwaves.  Sundays at a suburban Los Angeles radio station, cancer survivors and health care professionals meet.  They are part of a syndicated therapy session that 
reaches millions of patients, their families and friends across the country.<P>

<EM>"I saw this as being an opportunity to bring issues and subjects to radio that had 
never been brought before.  I just think it's time to talk about it."</EM><P>



The two hour call-in program is the creation of its host, Selma Schimmel.  She's 
the head of a non-profit organization called Vital Options that's dedicated to 
helping young people with cancer.  She started the program when she was 
diagnosed with breast cancer at age 28.<P>


Selma Schimmel<BR>
Vital Options president<BR>
Encino, CA<BR>
<EM>"In order to survive spiritually, psychologically, emotionally, I wanted to find a way 
to one, outsmart the cancer, make the cancer work for me and pull from it 
something that would help a lot of people."</EM><P>


Listeners can call in and speak to cancer survivors and health care professionals 
in the studio Group Room, as well as others linked by telephone.  The show gives those who are too sick to attend a therapy session a chance to participate.<P>


Laura Tousseau<BR>
Show Participant/Cancer Survivor<BR>
Sherman Oaks, CA<BR>
<EM>"Like, when I felt really puny going through chemo laying on the couch, it would 
have been nice for me to tune into something where I could have listened to other 
people."</EM><P>


And now cancer patients do have that something to tune in to which links them 
with others throughout the country.  The group room airs on WOR network radio stations across the country on Sundays from 2-4 p.m. Pacific time.  If you would like to contact the show during a live broadcast , you can call 1-800-G-R-P- R-O-O-M. <P>

<H4><FONT color="#000080">Growing-Up With Glaucoma</H4></FONT><FONT size=2>

<B>What Is It?</B><BR>
Glaucoma is the leading cause of blindness today.  Glaucoma occurs when the fluid which nourishes the eye doesn't drain properly.  The tiny canal becomes blocked and pressure builds up in the eye.  If left untreated, it destroys the optic nerve.  However, the condition is not painful.  According to a Richmond, Virginia Ophthalmologist, Geoffrey Cooper, "The most common form of glaucoma that 95 percent of people have is not painful at all, there are no symptoms.  It just causes a slow loss of peripheral vision."
<P>

<B>Who Is At Risk?</B><BR>
Glaucoma is more common in older adults than in teenagers.  Those at high risk for glaucoma include anyone over the age of fifty, diabetics, anyone with a family history of the disease, and African Americans.  African Americans are four times more likely to be affected by the condition.  However, children under are not risk free.  A diagnosis of glaucoma occurs in one out of 2,000 children under the age of 18.  According to The National Center for Statistics, during 1994 there were 22,000 reported cases of glaucoma found in children.  Most often a family history of glaucoma is responsible for its development at such a young age.
<P>

<B>What Treatment Is Available?</B><BR>
Glaucoma is commonly treated with eye drops.  However, laser treatment is available to some patients.  The treatment involves a special contact lens which focuses a laser beam on the tiny drainage canals,opening them up and allowing the build-up fluid to drain.  Unfortunately, the body's own healing process can prevent laser treatment from working.  When the body begins the healing process it forms scar tissue over the opening the laser created, preventing drainage.  Researchers are conducting experiments on an implant that would eventually replace surgery.  However, the implant is still considered experimental.
<P>

<B>What Can I Do Now?</B><BR>
Because there are little or no symptoms, glaucoma is not easily detected.  However, a routine eye exam could mean the difference between light and darkness.  Know your family history and the risk factors.  Knowledge and early detection are the key.

Have you ever had a headache that's so severe, you can't think straight?  Now 
there's a class to find the stress and some food choices that could be causing 
your headaches.  This is a class of chronic headache sufferers. They are learning how to prevent 
migraines.<P>


Sherry Gaunt<BR>
Migraine sufferer<BR>
<EM>"They are so bad that you hurt and you say make it stop."</EM><P>



Sherry hopes to make it stop with what she learns at this headache management 
class in Fontana, California.<P>


Sally Schultzman, Ph.D.<BR>
Preventive Medicine Dept.<BR>
Kaiser Permanente<BR>
Fontana, CA<BR>
<EM>"People who suffer with chronic headaches often feel like they are the only people 
who suffer with that."</EM><P>




Participants learn how to reduce stress and watch what they eat. For example, if 
they are sensitive to Nitrates or Nitrites they might want to stay away from leafy 
vegetables.<P>


Sally Schultzman<BR>
<EM>"Salads have a lot of naturally occurring nitrates in them , and nitrates are 
something a plant will get according to the growing season."</EM><P>


Reading labels on  food packages can also be the best medicine to prevent a 
headache.  Students keep a diary of when their headaches occur and what 
triggers them.<P>



Karen Stark<BR>
Headache sufferer<BR>
<EM>"When I found out on weekends, when I didn't get up early enough to have my 
coffee at the same time I usually had during the week, the caffeine absence 
would kick in and immediately give me a headache."</EM><P>




Whether their headaches are caused by food or stress, those who come here 
leave this two hour class knowing that the source of their pain is not just in their 
head.<P>


Sally Schultzman<BR>
<EM>"They are not nuts. They are not crazy. They are not being written off. There are 
things that they can do."</EM><P>


Researchers find that many times the frequency, severity and duration of 
headaches, can be controlled without drugs, by making simple lifestyle changes. <P>

Smart consumers seek out the best deals on groceries, clothing and 
appliances.  So why not shop around  for cheaper healthcare?  There's  a new 
store in Phoenix may offer just what healthcare bargain hunters are looking for.<P>



It's touted as the super store of healthcare.  One-stop shopping for almost any 
health aid you can think of. Need a van  with a wheelchair lift?  Utensils for 
arthritic hands?  Or maybe an herbal remedy?  Cost-conscious shoppers can 
find it here in one of eight departments.<P>

General Manager<BR>
Health & Home Store<BR>
Phoenix, AZ<BR>
<EM>"People want to be treated at home now.  People don't want to go to 
institutions, and institutions are frankly very expensive."  </EM><P>

How much can you save at Health & Home?  A dynamo scooter that costs 18 
hundred dollars elsewhere, costs 16 hundred 99 dollars at Health & Home.  
Diabetes test strips that sell for 31 dollars are twenty eight ninety-nine at 
Health & Home.  You also won't find any sales people here.  Almost every 
employee is a medical professional. <P>


Al Homiski<BR>
<EM>"They're nurses, they're physical therapists, they're board certified orthotists, 
they're mobility specialists, they're reimbursement specialists, they're 
pharmacists and fusion pharmacists."</EM><P>



Customers can discuss their diet with a nutritionist.  Nurses in the women's 
center can fit breast cancer patients with special bras, bathing suits and 
prosthetics.  <P>




You can get a wound dressed or learn how to use an oxygen tank from a 
respiratory therapist.<P>


Nancy McManus<BR>
Registered Dietitian<BR>
<EM>"If you provide the education and the support for them it makes self care much 
easier." </EM><P>

<EM>"They have just about everything here that you can think of, that you might

In addition to the pilot store, there are two satellite stores in Phoenix.  Health & Home is considering expanding.  Their goods and services are covered by 3 
hundred and 50 health insurance carriers and providers, including Medicare.  
All educational services are free.<P>

Experts say fewer than one fourth of the people who could use some type of 
hearing aid actually do. That means a lot of people are missing out on 
what's going on around them. New technology may be the answer.<P>


Peggy Meador has succeeded in business despite a hidden handicap. For 
years she couldn't hear well. <P>


Peggy Meador<BR>
Uses Hearing Aids<BR>
<EM>"I wanted to deny that I had a problem." </EM><P>


When her hearing loss impacted her career, Peggy knew she needed help. <P>


Peggy Meador<BR>
<EM>"It was affecting my performance on the job, and that affects the 
pocketbook, so you have to do something." </EM><P>



The reason why many people don't want to use hearing aids is that 
conventional devices merely amplify all the noise that surrounds them. <P>


Deborah Price<BR>
Audiologist<BR>
<EM>"So unless you had a flat hearing loss across all frequencies or pitches, they 
could be very harsh, they can bring in too much background noise. They 
could cause some distortion in what you were hearing." </EM><P>

New computerized, programmable hearing aids have two channels of audio 
that separate high and low frequencies. <P>


Deborah Price<BR>
<EM>"With the newer technology you can put a program in that will enable you to 
hear that person, but not be bombarded by somebody next to you that puts 
down a cup or closes a book." </EM><P>


Peggy says hearing clearly has changed everything. <P>


Peggy Meador<BR>
<EM>"Now I'm coming out a little more, and I must say, people are surprised. 
They're wondering what's going on...She's talking.  She can talk, and she 
can respond." </EM><P>


The new hearing aids also have eight hearing settings that can be changed 
according to where the person is, such as talking to one person or at a 
football game.  Thirty percent of people between ages 65 and 74 suffer from hearing loss. 
Once those people reach ages 75 to 79, 50 percent of them have hearing 
problems.<P>

New evidence says that cancer of the esophagus is on the rise in America.  
Researchers believe that chronic heartburn treated with 
over-the-counter antacids is part of the cause.  Doctors say there is no reason  
people should put up with chronic heartburn pain.<P>



Three months ago, Art Wingo wouldn't have dreamed of ordering manicotti with a 
rich and spicy tomato sauce. Chronic heartburn limited his diet to bland foods.<P>


Art Wingo<BR>
Suffered from Chronic Heartburn<BR>
<EM>"I had to sleep sitting up, I would have problems choking in the middle of the 
night."</EM><P>



Forty-percent of Americans suffer from heartburn, making antacid medications a 
billion dollar business. What most people don't know is that heartburn can be 
cured and they may be causing more serious problems by staying on medication 
for years.<P>


Eric DeMaria,  M. D.<BR>
Laparoscopic Surgeon <BR>
Virginia Commonwealth University, Medical College of Virginia<BR>
Richmond, VA<BR>
<EM>"We recognize that long-term heartburn can lead to precancerous changes in the 
esophagus and even cancer of the esophagus."</EM><P>


In Art's case, 15 years of chronic heartburn had led to regurgitation of food and 
liquids after eating, and his only alternative was surgery.<P>


Art Wingo<BR>
<EM>"I'm at the stage where if there's something that can be done to eliminate it...I'm 
willing to do it."</EM><P>




Art opted for a new laparoscopic stomach-wrap procedure that would correct the 
condition.  With the aid of a camera inserted through very small incisions,  doctors 
at the Medical College of Virginia loosely wrapped his stomach around his 
esophagus to prevent the backward flow of stomach contents.  Art was out of the 
hospital in a day and back to work in two weeks.<P>


Art Wingo<BR>
<EM>"I sleep laying down.  I can eat anything.  And I have not had indigestion since the 
day of my surgery."</EM><P>

It's estimated that more than two million Americans could be helped with this 
procedure.  Dr. DeMaria says patients don't take chronic heartburn seriously 
enough.  They blame their food choices for their pain, when they actually may 
have a more serious problem that can be cured.<P>

   Imagine you feel your heart
pounding.
   Is it a heart attack or just
indigestion?
   If you're a heart patient, you know
the frustration of trying to describe
your symptoms to your doctor after the
fact.
  Now there's a way to document
symptoms as they happen.<P>

Auto Broker David Reynolds knows how
scary it can be when his heart starts to pound.

He says, <EM>"I went to the hospital a couple of
times because I panicked a little more
than what I should have." </EM><P>
Not anymore. Now when David feels his
heart racing, he reaches for his
heartcard - a battery-operated monitor
that records and stores his heartbeat.<P>
Then all David has to do is call his
doctor.<P>

He puts the card to the receiver and hits
the send button. A built-in modem
transmits his heartbeat, or
EKG, directly to his doctor's
receiving machine. <P>


 Cardiologist Dr. Suzanne Hall tells us, <EM>"This
is unique in the sense that is seems to
be such a nice recording, not as much
interference, what we call artifact,
muscle artifact and movement, so we're
able to make a diagnosis in an easier
fashion."
</EM><P>

 David explains, <EM>"It's kind of like a
baby and a pacifier. You get so used to
it, if you don't have it you kind of
panic a little bit." </EM><P>

The heartcard costs about 795 dollars.
Dr. Hall says it is cost effective.<P>

<EM>"If we can evaluate
with an easy instrument like the
heartcard whether the rhythm is serious
or not, we may avoid a very expensive,
several thousand dollar work-up in the
hospital."</EM><P>

The heartcard was recently approved by the FDA.<BR><A HREF="Stayhealthymain.html">-back-</A></FONT>

When a couple decides to have a baby there are so many things to 
consider. One thing they might take for granted is having the baby in the 
hospital.  Now there's a more homey option.<P>


For centuries, midwives, not doctors, helped women have babies.  Now, more couples are using nurse-midwives. <P>


Jennifer Foley<BR>

<EM>"We wanted to have our baby as naturally as possible, avoiding some of 
the things that happen in the hospital." </EM><P>

not only taking part but really taking as much control over the birth as

Ellen Foley was born on Christmas Eve in 1994, right on this couch. <P>

Jennifer Foley<BR>
<EM>"They came, Sara and Gina came, after we called her when my water 
broke, and then the labor got heavier and  more intense.  I was always 
aware of David's presence next to me, he was right there."</EM><P>


David Foley<BR>
<EM>"It happens really fast, and the baby is crowning, and then Ellen came 
out in a big rush." </EM><P>


Sara Liebling, C.N.M.<BR>
<EM>"They disovered they had a little girl, and she was in excellent condition 
when she was born."</EM> <P>




Even though Ellen arrived perfectly, there's always the chance of 
complications. Sara Liebling says she goes prepared with emergency 
equipment, oxygen and medicine.  <P>


Some doctors say home births aren't safe because midwives don't have 
instant access to hospital technology. But a recent survey found women 
who use midwives are 50 percent less likely to have a Cesarean section 
than women who have regular hospital care.<P>

Every year, more than half a million women have their uterus 
removed, a procedure known as hysterectomy.  A promising new 
therapy could eliminate the need for surgery in some of these 
patients.
<P>
For two long years, Leslie Magier was in too much pain to play with 
her children.
<P>

<STRONG>Leslie Magier</STRONG><BR>
<STRONG>Uterine Balloon Therapy Patient</STRONG><BR>

<EM>"I was tired, I was sick, I didn't feel good, I didn't feel well, I was 
stressed and I just couldn't cope with anything that was going on 
around me."</EM><P>



Leslie suffered from excessive menstrual bleeding.
<P>

<STRONG>Brian Walsh, M.D.</STRONG><BR>
<STRONG>Gynecologist</STRONG><BR>
<STRONG>Brigham & Women's Hospital</STRONG><BR>
<STRONG>Boston, MA</STRONG><BR>
<EM>
"About 10 percent of women will suffer from excessive vaginal 
bleeding to the point where it really restricts their life.  They can 
miss time from work, they can't plan vacations or any other events, 
and their whole life revolves around how quickly they can get to a 
bathroom."</EM><P>

Like many women with this condition, Leslie considered having her 
uterus removed.   But Doctor Walsh offered her an experimental 
alternative .... Uterine Balloon Therapy.
<P>

<STRONG>Brian Walsh</STRONG><BR>
<EM>"A small balloon is placed into the uterus.  There's a connecting tube 
through which you can fill the balloon with water and there is a 
heating element within the balloon which will make the water warm. 
The heat from the water will be transmitted to the lining of the 
uterus and will destroy the lining of the uterus."</EM>
<P>



The entire treatment takes less than 10 minutes and is virtually 
painless.<P>


<STRONG>Leslie Magier</STRONG><BR>
<EM>"I went in in the morning, came home at night .  I didn't feel it.  The 
next day I was out gardening, I was out playing with my kids and I 
was fine."</EM>
<P>

Thirteen U.S. centers have tested Uterine Balloon Therapy to make 
sure it's safe and effective.  Previous studies show 70 percent of all 
women who undergo the treatment experience no or light periods 
each month.  Although the lining of the uterus is destroyed with this new 
technique, women should continue using birth control.  Doctor 
Walsh says there is a possibility, although strictly theoretical, that a 
woman could still get pregnant.

<H4><FONT color="#000080">Impotence Drug</H4></FONT><FONT size=2>
30 million men may suffer from Impotence, a medical condition that causes problems with sexual relations. 
Doctors say too many men don't seek treatment for the problem.

The good news is the Food and Drug Administration has approved a new drug which could make the difference for many men.


 
The drug is Prostaglandin EL and it's the first drug approved by the FDA  for treating impotence.<P>
 
Urologist Richard Berger says the new drug relaxes blood vessels:  <EM>"By relaxing blood vessels this allows blood to flow into the penis and the blood pressure to get into the penis which is what makes an erection."</EM><P>
 
A patient injects the drug himself at the base of the penis.  The drug relaxes arteries -- 10 times more blood can flow through them. The drug also squeezes the veins that trap blood.<P>
 

According to Dr. Berger, <EM>"The advantage of the shots is that they are reversible.  Someone can try them and if they don't like them they can stop."</EM><P>

One patient says he likes the convenience of the shot and says it isn't painful.  He says,  <EM>"I can feel it going in there, but it's not painful at all, it's not nearly as painful as a flu shot in your arm." </EM><P>

The risk for impotence is increased by age, diabetes, neurological problems and hardening of the arteries.<BR><A HREF="Stayhealthymain.html">-back-</A></FONT>

There are about 8 million people in the United States with diabetes.  Most 
diabetics can manage their blood sugar levels through proper diet or insulin 
pills,  but others require insulin by injection.  As diabetics grow older, their 
chances of needing  insulin by injection increase. In Baltimore, studies are 
underway to take the needle and the pain out of insulin therapy.<P> 



Ada Lloyd is a nurse assistant.  She's also a diabetic.  She takes pills now, but 
she knows she may one day need  insulin injections to keep her diabetes 
under control. <P>


Ada Lloyd<BR>
Diabetic<BR>
<EM>"Well, I really don't like injections." </EM><P>


Ada's not alone. For many diabetics, the pain of injecting themselves with a 
needle keeps them from taking insulin often enough. 
<P>

Beth Laube,  Ph.D.<BR>
Pulmonary Physiologist<BR>
Hopkins School of Public Health <BR>
Baltimore, MD<BR>
<EM>"So we are trying to find a new way of giving insulin that's painless and that 
people can work into their life on a daily basis in a more convenient way than 
by injection."</EM><P>


Here it is-- insulin by aerosol.  The liquid is placed in a machine called a 
nebulizer, which turns it into a mist.  The mist is inhaled deeply into the lungs,  where the insulin enters the 
bloodstream.  This scan of the lungs shows the insulin was distributed evenly 
and uniformly throughout the lungs, a sign the therapy is doing what it's 
supposed to. <P>


Beth Laube, Ph.D.<BR>
<EM>"It eliminates the need for injecting insulin and it eliminates the pain that's 
involved, and it's more than likely to make patients more compliant, and more 
willing to take their insulin several times a day, which is now recommended."</EM>



The research is preliminary, but promising. <P>


Beth Laube, Ph.D.<BR>
<EM>"We are optimistic and enthusiastic that someday we'll be able to replace 
injected insulin by aerosol delivery."</EM><P>


Ada was taking insulin by aerosol because she's participating in the study.  
Other diabetics shouldn't go rushing out to the pharmacy just yet.  Dr. Laube 
stresses that this research is very early, and that inhaled insulin will not be 
available to the public for at least five years.<P>

Living with diabetes is a challenge for anybody. But if you're an active teenager, rigid schedules and exact eating times can really cramp your style. Now a new type of insulin is helping diabetic teenagers stay on the fast track of life. 



She's number 25, she's fast, she's good. And she's saying good-bye to a regimented lifestyle. <P>


Angela Mallory<BR>
Diabetic <BR>
Portland, OR<BR>
<EM>"I had to wait before meals depending on high my blood sugar was after I injected. I had to wait a certain amount of time before I could 
eat, anywhere from 15 minute to 45 minutes." </EM><P>



Not anymore. Thirteen-year-old Angela is testing a new fast-acting insulin for her diabetes. Regular insulin takes about 30 minutes to work. This new form of insulin takes about five. <P>


James R. Hansen, M.D. Pediatric Endocrinologist<BR>
Emanuel Children's Diabetes Center<BR>
Portland, OR<BR>

<EM>"That's a huge advantage because you don't have to factor all the coordinated lag times into a daily routine."</EM><P>

Angela Mallory<BR>

<EM>"You can do more things, and you don't have to wait so long, so it makes life faster and easier to plan." 
</EM><P>


That's made a dramatic difference in the whole family's schedule. <P>


Jan and Mark Mallory<BR>
Angela's Parents<BR>
Portland, OR<BR>
<EM>"I used to go in at breakfast time, for example, and go in and take her blood sugar while she was asleep, do a shot so it would have enough head start so she wouldn't have to get up 2 hours before she had to be in school." </EM><P>



Doctors are calling this new insulin one of the most significant treatment advances in 15 years, because it allows diabetics to fine-tune their doses to individual needs.<P> 


James R. Hansen, M.D.<BR>

<EM>"And all of these convenience factors and the flexibility will work together to improve diabetes control." 
</EM><P>


When it comes to diabetes, control is the name of the game. <P>



Dr. Hansen says because this insulin acts immediately, there is a risk for low blood sugar if diabetics don't eat right after they inject it. Overall, the results from this world-wide study have been extremely positive. The data are now being analyzed by the FDA, and approval is expected in the first half of this year.<P>

Imagine not being able to open your mouth to speak or feed yourself.  That is the 
reality for millions of patients with T-M-J. And as you're about to see, there is a 
new exercise device for the jaw that offers hope of a speedy rehabilitation. <P>



Heidi Tirjan couldn't do this six months ago. She suffered from temporomandibular 
 joint disorder or TMJ.<P>


Heidi Tirjan<BR>
TMJ patient<BR>
<EM>"I could not really get any utensils into my mouth so I could sip milkshakes, and 
that was about it, through a straw."</EM><P>



What enabled Heidi to open her mouth and avoid expensive and painful surgery 
was this device, E-Z Flex, a passive motion jaw exerciser invented by two 
dentists at Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center in New York City. <P>


Steven Syrop, D.D.S.<BR>
Dentist<BR>
Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center<BR>
New York City<BR>
<EM>"Mobilizing joints, getting joints to move that are painful or inflamed, or after 
surgery promotes healing.  We took that idea and applied it to the 
temporomandibular joint."</EM><P>



This is an enhanced MRI of Heidi's temporomandibular joint, the joint between 
the lower jaw and skull.  A protective cushion of cartilage that normally is seated 
within the joint had shifted.<P>


Steven Syrop, D.D.S.<BR>
<EM>"She couldn't physically open because there was a blockage.  By gradually 
stretching her joint, the joint was able to removed and heal on its own without 
surgery."</EM><P>




E-Z Flex works hydraulically, under the control of the patient.  A small hand pump 
forces fluid into a levered mouthpiece which gently forces the jaw to open.  For 
safety there are settings to limit the maximum opening.<P>


Heidi Tirjan<BR>
<EM>"All I had to do was operate this device maybe five times a day to exercise my 
jaw and get it in an operating order again."</EM><P>




The device was recently cleared by the FDA and is available by prescription 
from dentists. In addition to aiding patients with TMJ caused by stress, arthritis, 
trauma or muscular disorders, patients with dental infections or people 
undergoing radiation therapy which affects the jaw muscles may also benefit from 
this jaw exercise.<P>

In recent years, doctors have learned that not everyone with heart 
disease needs major invasive surgery.  For these patients, they've developed a new way to get a heart up and running.<P>
 


When 64-year-old Donald Hanna is
hitting his stride, wife Doris, has a 
hard time keeping up.  Five weeks ago, Donald had heart
surgery and hanks to a more simple 
bypass called a Keyhole, he's back
on his feet.<P>


Donald Hanna<BR>
Heart Patient<BR>

<EM>"I'm feeling 100% better than I did before, and I can get out and do 
things, walk around where I couldn't before."</EM><P>


In a standard bypass procedure,
surgeons divide the breastbone to 
expose the heart.  The patient is
placed on a cardiopulmonary bypass 
machine, and the heart is stopped
before grafts are sewn on.  In 
 Keyhole surgery, doctors make
incisions on the front of the chest to 
reach right onto the beating heart.<P>


Lawrence McBride, M.D.<BR>
Cardiothoracic Surgeon<BR>
St. Louis University Health Sciences Center<BR>
St. Louis, MO<BR>
<EM>"The biggest advantage is smaller
incisions.  The second is that 
cardiopulmonary bypass is not used and
both of those things lead to 
much quicker recovery for the patient
and less discomfort."</EM><P> 



With  Keyhole  surgery, patients are
out of the hospital in on to two days 
compared to three to five. They also
return to work much sooner.  
Doctors say the success rate of the 
Keyhole  procedure is comparable 
to that of the standard bypass.<P>


Doris Hanna<BR>
Donald's Wife<BR>
<EM>"He got to be a couch potato to tell the truth about it.  Now he's not 
using the couch as much."</EM><P>

The  Keyhole  bypass is only used in
cases where one artery is blocked.  
Someday doctors want to be able to
graft all the arteries using this less 
invasive approach. <P>

For years, doctors have been wondering if a low protein diet can stop the 
progression of kidney disease. Now, a University of California study proves 
such a diet can help patients with chronic kidney problems.
<P>
A dialysis machine is the only means of survival  for chronic kidney disease 
patients. It helps clean their  blood supply when the kidneys can no longer 
do it for them.
<P>

<STRONG>Dr. Ping Wang, Endocrinologist</STRONG><BR>
<STRONG>University of California</STRONG><BR>
<STRONG>Irvine, CA</STRONG><BR>
<EM>"It is estimated that it costs more than $7 billion dollars per year to take care of these patients."</EM>
<P>

Two hundred thousand people in the United States are dependent on 
dialysis.  But, a study by the University of California in Irvine found that 
diabetics and patients in the early stages of kidney disease can  avoid the 
machine if they stick to a low protein diet.
<P>

<STRONG>Dr. Ping Wang</STRONG><BR>
<EM>"We found that cutting down the protein in the patient's diet can effectively 
prevent or delay the progression of kidney disease."</EM>
<P>


Researchers evaluated 10 studies completed over 8 years.  Half  were 
done with diabetics, the other half focused on patients with kidney disease.  
When given a low protein diet, both groups slowed the progression of the 
disease or reduced the risk of it all together.  That's because such a diet 
decreases blood flow to the kidneys.
<P>

<STRONG>Dale Willumson, Diabetic</STRONG><BR>
<EM>"I don't want to end up in a dialysis unit so I'm willing to take steps 
necessary to avoid that."</EM>

<P>

Diabetic, Dale Willumson's first step was to change his eating habits.
<P>

<STRONG>Dale Willumson</STRONG><BR>
<EM>"I lived off of hamburgers and cheese and that  sort of thing. I cut that down 
a great deal."</EM>
<P>

Now he eats a lot of vegetables and pasta. The low protein diet keeps his kidneys healthy.
Doctors warn there is danger in a low protein diet for  diabetics  and those 
with kidney problems. They caution patients to watch out for poor nutrition 
which could cause more health problems. The best advice?  Always check 
with your doctor before starting a low protein or any diet.

When it comes to their kids, parents worry a lot about their teeth. Taking 
care of children's teeth should begin when the baby is born. Here's a look at 
what every parent should know about their kids' pearly whites.<P>


At the tender age of three, Stella has had cavities, root canals and bonding 
done on her teeth. Not from eating too many sweets, but from being put to 
sleep with a bottle when she was a baby. <P>


Celia Strzyzowska<BR>
Stella's Mother<BR>


<EM>"When her teeth first started coming in they weren't real white in certain 
areas, and then slowly they got worse, and I saw that there was decay." </EM><P>


Eric Lebowitz, D.D.S<BR>
Pediatric Dentist<BR>


<EM>"The back of the teeth get the most decay from the beverage sliding from 
the front all the way to the back and down to the bottom as you complete 
your swallow."</EM><P> 


Here's something else dentists see a lot -- gray teeth. Three-year-old Santiago's 
teeth turned gray after he bumped into some furniture. The color is a sign of 
infection. Treatment is usually antibiotics and a root canal. <P>


This little guy's tooth is not only gray, but he knocked one out right next to it. <P>


Leslie Stein<BR>
William's Mother<BR>
<EM>"He fell down and knocked out his front tooth and ripped open his gums, and 
the nerves and everything were exposed with the tooth." </EM><P>


Luckily, William's babysitter knew to put his tooth back in the socket, have 
him hold it in place and get to the dentist immediately. They were able to 
reattach the tooth. <P>


Eric Lebowitz, D.D.S.<BR>
Pediatric Dentist<BR>

<EM>"The quicker it's back in the mouth, the better the chance of it reattaching." </EM><P>


If you can't put the tooth back in the socket, put it in a cup of milk and head 
to the dentist's office ASAP.<P> 


Gladys Adan<BR>
Has a broken tooth<BR>

<EM>"My brother opened the door, and I was on the other side, and then it broke."</EM><P>


While it may seem like a tragedy at the time, kids with broken teeth can 
smile again. Nine-year-old Gladys got a bonded crown. In a few hours, she had 
a new front tooth.<P>


Dentists say the best thing parents can do is teach them how to brush their 
teeth and help them floss. They say regular dental checkups are also a 
must.<P>

For centuries.. Man has turned to mother nature to unveil her health 
magic.  One discovery may now be the key to a breakthrough in pain 
management.  Doctors are testing a new pain killer that stems from the 
secrets of a deadly snail.<P>


When you think predator, snails probably don't come to mind.  But take a 
look at this cone snail.  His venom is so strong it can paralyze a fish in 
seconds.  Now, researchers think a synthetic form of a toxin  in the venom 
may help them conquer pain.<P>


Edgar Ross, M.D.<BR>
Pain Specialist<BR>
Meridia Hospital<BR>
Cleveland, OH<BR>
<EM>"Nature provides so many answers to our problems and this is just 
another example of that."</EM><P>


Cancer patient, Sallie Williams is testing out the new drug. She says 
constant pain puts a damper on her lifestyle.<P>


Sallie Williams<BR>
Cancer Patient<BR>
<EM>"If I want to go outside and walk, I can't do that anymore."</EM><P>

Brenda Smith<BR>
Daughter<BR>
<EM>"You hate to see your loved ones suffer all the time, constantly in pain.  If 
this is something they can come up with that's going to give them some 
kind of relief where they can enjoy themselves, then I'm all for it."</EM><P>



A pump... surgically implanted in the abdomen, delivers the drug directly 
into the spinal cord. The drug paralyzes the nerves that transmit pain to 
the brain.<P>


Edgar Ross, M.D.<BR>
<EM>"This type of problem has never been able to be treated by any drug.  In 
fact, the only other alternative was to actually destroy nerves that were 
involved.  And obviously when you destroy nerves, you have a high 
potential of losing function."</EM><P>



Patients and their families hope the new drug can give a  one-two 
knockout punch to pain.  Patients with terminal cancer or AIDS are 
participating in the drug study at 30 medical centers across the country.  If 
the drug proves effective, it could be in  widespread use within two years.

<H4><FONT color="#000080">Knee Acupuncture</H4></FONT><FONT size=2>
Acupuncture has been an accepted form of pain therapy in the Orient for 
centuries.  Many Americans are still skeptical of a process the medical 
community can't explain.  That doesn't stop researchers from experimenting 
with the Chinese treatment.  They're finding amazing results when 
acupuncture is used to treat osteoarthritis of the knee.<P>



Joseph Smith is an avid gardener and sailor but the pain in his knees from 
osteoarthritis was keeping him from his favorite hobbies. <P>


Joseph Smith<BR>
Osteoarthritis Patient<BR>
<EM>"When I came in here I was in pain 24 hours a day.  The knees were stiff, your 
mobility was greatly diminished."</EM><P>


Joseph tried the standard treatment of anti-inflammatory medication and 
physical therapy but nothing would ease the pain.  <P>


Bryan Berman, M.D.<BR>
Director of Division of Complimentary Medicine<BR>
Kernan Hospital<BR>
Baltimore, MD<BR>
<EM>"Osteoarthritis of the knee is a very common condition that we have in the 
elderly in particular.  It's where the cartilage and the bone start to degenerate."</EM><P>



In a last ditch attempt to avoid knee replacement, Joseph signed up for a study 
examining the effects of acupuncture on arthritic knees.  He received 
acupuncture treatments for eight weeks along with 
anti-inflammatory medication.  <P>


Joseph Smith<BR>
<EM>"I was very skeptical approaching this and I started to say ah-ha, this is just 
another thing I'll try before they replace my knee, but by the third or fourth 
treatment it started to work."</EM><P>


Bryan Berman, M.D.<BR>
<EM>"We found that acupuncture was indeed helpful for osteoarthritis of  the knees.  
It improved patients walking time, it improved their subjective pain."</EM><P> 



Early results found patients enjoyed relief from pain for about 12 weeks.  The 
next phase will find out  how often follow-up sessions are needed.  Acupuncture sessions range in price from $50 to $75 per session.  There are no known side effects to this ancient Chinese therapy.<P>

<STRONG>Severe Obesity:</STRONG>Severe obesity is defined as a person weighing more than 100 pounds above 
their ideal weight. It often leads to severe medical problems like diabetes, hypertension, sleep apnea, breathing difficulties, joint and back problems, leg ulcers, irregular periods, and severe headaches.  With many of these patients dieting, drugs and behavior modification proves unsuccessful.  That's why many eventually turn to surgical procedures to help them lose weight.
<P>
<STRONG>Options:</STRONG><P>
Amazingly, 85% of patients who undergo surgical procedures to help them lose weight, take the pounds off and keep them off.
<P>

<STRONG>- Gastric By-Pass Surgery:</STRONG>
A large incision is made across the abdomen and the stomach is stapled completely shut.  The intestine is brought up to by-pass the stomach.  Recovery time is approximately six weeks.  The patient can lose up to two-thirds of their excess weight.  It is the preferred procedure for people who are addicted to sweets and junk food because they will throw up when they attempt to beat the surgery.  There is a 20% risk of incisional hernias with gastric by-pass surgery and it is also associated with Vitamin B-12, iron and calcium deficiencies.
<P>
<STRONG>- Gastroplasty:</STRONG>
When the stomach is made smaller by stapling.
<P>
<STRONG>- Laparoscopic Adjustable Gastric Banding:</STRONG>
A form of  gastroplasty.  A silicone band is placed around the stomach to make it smaller.  The band is adjustable so that if the patient is either eating too much or throwing up too much the band can be adjusted laparoscopically.  The procedure is being evaluated by the FDA at seven Medical Centers in the United States.  So far 60 patients have had the procedure.  It is necessary to study at least 300 patients for three years before receiving the approval of the FDA.  Patients need to live within three hours of a medical center to be eligible to take part in the study.

   Ltd. Harold Henderson has been a Navy
E.R. and I.C.U. nurse for 9 years.
   He had tours of duties at sea and in
the Gulf War.
   However, today his career has gone
from battle fatigues and surgical
gloves to a collection of pills.
   The reason--latex gloves.<P>

Harold Henderson<BR>
<EM>"All of the sudden I started
wheezing for the first time and they
set me on a bed, gave me a respiratory
treatment and it came back in about 30
seconds. They gave me a second one,
then in about 30 seconds I went into
respiratory arrest."</EM><P>

   In 1990 Harold discovered he was
allergic to latex gloves.<P>

Harold Henderson<BR>
Allergy Patient<BR>
<EM>"The allergy is real and we
can prove that by skin testing."</EM>
 <P>

   Harold has the severest form of the
allergy.  Latex can cause him to have
potentially deadly analfalactic
reactions.<P>

  Today Harold is on convalescent leave.  He spends his time with fellow 
health care workers who are in the same
predicament learning as much as they
can about their disorder and spreading
the word about latex allergies.

   Although there are alternative,
non-latex gloves available the problem
goes beyond skin contact.
<P>
Dr. Ronald Simon<BR>
Allergist<BR>
<EM> "A lot of people in the
operating room, like blood technicians
who draw blood on multiple patients,
will rip the gloves on and off multiple
times during the course of an operation
or their work.  If there's powder in
there, every time they rip off the glove
the powder gets into the air, carrying
the latex particles, and they inhale
that and get big time reactions."</EM>
<P>
   The other problem is latex is not
confined to gloves.
<P>
<EM>"It's everywhere, it's
a pervasive substance. Balloons,
rubbers stoppers anything that has a
rubberized surface probably has latex
in it."</EM>
<P>
   Today Harold struggles to exist in
latex filled world.
  He is currently battling the Navy to
recognize his illness as a legitimate
disability.<P>
   Dr. Simon is conducting a study on
latex allergy at Scripps Clinic.
   He is attempting to desensitize
patients to latex in a controlled
situation as is done with other
allergies.<P>
   Dr. Simon says the rise
in cases of latex allergy appears to be
related to the increased use of gloves
by health care workers in recent years
as a safety precaution taken against
AIDS.

Adults know it as accutane, a vitamin and a drug for acne and wrinkles.  It's medical name is 13 cis-retinoic acid.  When given to children with a rare form of juvenile leukemia, the drug is helping control their illness.   <P>



At age one, Taylor Gilliam was diagnosed with juvenile chronic myelogenous leukemia or JCML.  It's rare but deadly.  <P>


Mark Gilliam<BR>
Taylor's Father<BR>
Birmingham, AL<BR>
<EM>"I guess they indicated that his life expectancy was probably six months to a year, and that they really didn't have any hope because his type of leukemia didn't respond to chemotherapy." </EM><P>



Doctors said Taylor's only hope was a bone marrow transplant.  While waiting for a donor, Taylor went on 13 cis-retinoic acid. <P>


Robert Castleberry, M.D.<BR>
Pediatric Hematology/Oncology<BR>
Children's Hospital of Alabama<BR>
Birmingham, AL<BR>
<EM>"We know it gets into the cells.  We know there are receptors - little catch pieces of protein on the cell that catch this drug and bring it into the cell."</EM><P>  




As a result, leukemia cells stop growing.  In six of ten JCML  patients tested, researchers say leukemia was controlled for two to four-and-a-half years, buying time until a bone marrow transplant. <P>


Robert Castleberry, M.D.<BR>

<EM>"Within a couple weeks of administering the retinoids, even before we start seeing changes in live, spleen counts, lymph nodes, these kids perk up.  They start to feel better.  They eat better and they put on weight."  </EM><P>



In Taylor's case, doctors aren't predicting the future.  He's done so well his parents decided not to have a bone marrow transplant.  Right now they take things day by day. <P>


Mark Gilliam<BR>

<EM>"He's probably as active a five year old you'll ever see.  He's always on the go.  So far, so good." </EM><P>



13 cis-retinoic acid for this type of leukemia is being investigated.  It costs about seven dollars for the 40 milligram capsule taken every day.  Compare that to about five hundred dollars a day for chemotherapy which is sometimes a treatment but not a cure for JCML.
JCML is also recently known as JMML, juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia. <P>

It amounts to a high-tech crystal ball:
ultrasound, the same tool that can 
peek into a womb and show an unborn
baby s sex, can now predict if 
you re likely to have a stroke.  Strokes hit a half-million people every
year, killing 150,000 Americans and 
disabling hundreds of thousands.  Every
minute of every day, someone 
suffers a stroke.<P>

Richard C. Hinton, M.D.<br>
Neurologist<br>
Presbyterian Hospital<br>
<EM>"It can result in loss of speech, loss of vision and significant weakness on one side."</EM> 
<P>

Jerry Castongue never worried about
strokes until one day a while back.
<P>

Jerry Castongue<br>
Concerned about stroke<br>

 <EM>"At that time, I had bad problems. I
got dizzy, in fact I fell out of a
shower 
and was taken to an emergency room."</EM> 
<p>

Jerry's dizziness wasn t a stroke, but
a warning. Doctors are using 
ultrasound to help determine if a
stroke looms ahead. Using technology 
similar to weather radar, ultrasound
can show if jerry s arteries are 
blocked.
<P>

Richard Hinton, M.D.
<br>
 <EM>"When this artery narrows down, of
course, you can have a stroke from 
that... And the ultrasound is very
effective in detecting critical
narrowing of 
these vessels.  The more clogged the arteries, the more
accurate the test.  This area can easily be stripped out
surgically and relatively safely and 
that removes the ongoing problem there
and prevents a later and more 
devastating stroke."</EM><P> 




Veins become blocked over time and
there are no symptoms. Ultrasound 
can help find the problem...before it s
too late.  Early detection has made a 
difference.  In the past 10 years,
deaths from strokes have dropped 28 
percent.

A new surgery is saving the lives of some terminally ill patients who are waiting 
for lung transplants.  In fact, the new procedure repairs the damaged lungs 
and offers patients a new lease on life. <P>



Five months ago Kenneth Gadson couldn't walk a city block.  His lungs were 
blocked with blood clots. <P>


Lewis Rubin, M.D.<BR>
Pulmonologist <BR>
University of Maryland <BR>
Medical Center<BR>
Baltimore, MD<BR>
<EM>"He was wheelchair bound, he was on oxygen, he had extensive swelling in his 
feet from heart failure.  He was really pretty terminal."</EM><P>

Doctors don't know what causes clots to form in the lungs, but more than 60-
percent of Kenneth's blood circulation was blocked. Kenneth was told his only 
chance of surviving for more than a year was a lung transplant. <P>


Kenneth Gadson<BR>
Lung Surgery Patient<BR>
<EM>"I just didn't think I'd probably live much longer if I did get a lung transplant."</EM><P>



Instead of a transplant, Kenneth opted for a unique procedure called 
Pulmonary Thromboendarterectomy or PTE.  The patient's body is cooled to 
60 degrees and all the blood is drained into a heart-lung machine. The 
surgeons then remove the blood clots.  They have 20 minutes to clear each 
lung before  blood must start flowing again - longer than that, and there can be 
brain damage.<P>


Lewis Rubin, M.D.<BR>
<EM>"His prognosis is great.  He's gotten through the hard time.  He should be 
pretty much home free at this point."  </EM><P>


Kenneth Gadson<BR>
<EM>"For fun I do a lot of walking.  I can walk blocks and blocks now.   I think the 
surgery added years to my life."</EM><P>




Time is now on Kenneth's side.  He's recovering rapidly as his lungs return to 
normal.<P>



To protect  patients from further clotting after surgery, a filter is put in one of 
the main veins near the heart before surgery.  Patients also take blood thinning 
medications for the rest of their lives.  There are only two medical centers in 
the country performing PTE, the University of Maryland Medical Center in 
Baltimore and the University of California in San Diego.<P>

Five years ago an explosive
automobile accident in Rosarito Beach
turned  Shelly Owens-Dempster's world
upside down.<P>

Shelly Owens-Dempster<BR>
<EM>"I'm burned over 90% of my
body and I was on a trac for 5 months.
They took us to Rosarito Hospital.
There they punctured my lung to try and
ventilate me."</EM><P>

To survive, Shelly spent 3 months in
a medically induced coma--five months total in the intensive care
unit at UCSD, much to the horror of
family and friends.<P>

Shelly Owens-Dempster<BR>
<EM> "I wasn't really thinking
about me because I knew I could handle
it. I knew I was doing okay and I was
going to get through this. But
everybody would come in and you could
see it in their faces. They were so
scared and upset for me and I wanted to
bet better for them."</EM><P>
   
Amy Steinmetz<BR>
Makeup Artist<BR>
<EM>"Most of the burn victims and
other trauma survivors I've known have
gone through what they've gone through
and they come to an understanding of it
within themselves and have opted to get
on with it--not really focus on it.
Let's go! Let's get on with life!"</EM><P>

For Shelly, getting on with life
included replacing her burned off eye
brows with permanent makeup.  That's just one of the tricks Amy
uses to help women look their best.  In some cases she uses special makeup.<P>
 
 Amy Steinmetz<BR>
<EM>"It's really a question of
technique more than anything else, hiding the scars as much as you can,
bringing out the best features and
making those that are not quite so
great less obvious." </EM><P>
    Amy teaches clients so they can
replicate what she's done themselves at
home.<P>
<EM> "It means a great deal to me
to give them a few minutes of empathy,
but what they've done they've done
within themselves."</EM><P>
  Even though Amy won't take credit for
the changes clients make, she's masterful at making changes
on the outside.<P>
Shelly Owens-Dempster<BR>
<EM>"A lot of people look and
stare when I don't have make up on and
look at my scars. When I have makeup
on I feel there not as many people
looking and it's not as much of a shock
to other people."</EM><BR><A HREF="Stayhealthymain.html">-back-</A></FONT>

<STRONG>The Not So Friendly Skies:</STRONG>  A study by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) found there are an average of three medical emergencies a day.  A 1988 study in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) reported an average of 72 deaths each year that occur during flight.
<P>
Sixty-nine percent of the deaths accounted had no known health conditions.  According to the JAMA study, more than half the deaths aboard commercial airlines can be attributed to heart attacks.  Medical emergencies often require a flight diversion, which can cost the airlines tens of thousands of dollars.
  <P>
<STRONG>Taking 911 To New Heights:</STRONG>  A medical support service based in a Phoenix hospital is giving airlines and passengers a safer ride in the skies anywhere in the world.  Medlink was founded by a former flight nurse who recognized the need to provide 24-hour-a-day medical advice via radio or satellite to flight crews handling medical emergencies.
<P>
Flight crews have direct access to a round-the-clock team of  emergency physicians as well as physicians in 45 different specialties.  The service also provides a database of medical facilities around the world in case an emergency landing is required, and can coordinate ground transportation.  Medlink spans 30 countries and offers its services in 140 different languages.
<P>
<STRONG>Telemedicine At Its Best:</STRONG>  Commercial airlines using Medlink have been able to reduce medically related flight diversions by up to 90% because of medical advice available on Medlink.  Medlink answers calls from America West, TWA, Continental and numerous other commercial and private carriers around the world.
<P>
For the traveling executive who uses Medlink, the service can store that person's EKG reading in the database.  In the near future, carriers using Medlink will be equipped with a device that can send back vital signs in real time, including an EKG reading.  Then Medlink physicians will be able to compare it to the information stored in the database and determine if the individual is having a heart attack or just a bad case of indigestion.
<P>
The Medlink service fee is based on the number of paying customers per flight.  So, they are basically charged for the number of seats that are paying seats.  So if there are empty seats they are not paying.

    You could have melanoma and not
Even know it.
    The American Academy of Dermatology
just released a survey of one thousand
adults and found most can't identify
the early warning signs of melanoma.   
   Fortunately, a San Diego did
recognize the warning signs and it
wound up saving her life.<P>

 I first met Linda Burnham six
years ago after she saw our Staying
Healthy report on melanoma.<P>

Linda Burnham<BR>
<EM> "You put some pictures up on the
screen and I saw a mole that looked
suspiciously like one I had."</EM><P>

The pictures Linda
saw were examples of suspicious looking
moles that could indicate the often
fatal form of skin
cancer, melanoma.<P>




First thing the next day, Linda went to the melanoma skin cancer
screening we reported on and saw Dr.
Richard Fitzpatrick.<P>


Dr. Richard Fitzpatrick<BR>
Dermatologist<BR>
<EM>"She had a mole that was changing.
 She didn't realize the significance
until she saw your broadcast.  I could tell by looking at it
there was a high probability of it
being melanoma so we got it off right away."</EM><P>
 

The biopsy confirmed his
suspicions.<P>


 Linda Burnham<BR>
<EM>"We found it was just approaching
third stage.  I had more surgery, 126
stitches, a big scar, but my life was saved."</EM><P>

Linda's cancer was cured because
it hadn't spread.  But if they go down into the
skin, they can get into blood vessels and
lymph vessels and spread.<P>

The key is distinguishing
between the more common basal cell
carcinoma, a sore that won't heal or
an acne-like bump, and melanoma, a
nasty mole with uneven colors and
jagged edges.


Most moles are either round or
oval so if you get something that
looks like a map of South
America, then you know that's not normal.

For 25 years, heart-assist devices have been used by people waiting for a heart 
transplant.  The trouble was, they had to wait in the hospital because the device's 
control unit was too cumbersome for the outside world.  A new generation of 
devices gives heart patients greater freedom.<P>



He walks the city streets of Tucson with ease.  No one would ever guess that part 
of Michael West's heart was artificial, or that his backpack holds the batteries and 
computer brains that control the device implanted in his abdomen.  A heart-assist device like this one has kept Michael alive since last July when a heart attack destroyed the left side of his heart.  <P>


Richard Smith<BR>
Technical Director<BR>
Artificial Heart Dept. <BR>
Univ. of Arizona <BR>
Tucson, AZ<BR>
<EM>"It's taking the blood that is returned to the left side of the heart from the lung, 
already oxygenated, and it now pumps it to the body." </EM><P>


The device has been around for more than two decades.  The breakthrough is in 
the size of the device's controls.<P>  


Richard Smith<BR>
<EM>"This component used to be five feet tall and weigh 300 pounds.  So now this can 
be put in a pouch or in a backpack."  </EM><P>



The technology has also shrunk the medical bill. An average hospital stay for a 
patient awaiting a heart transplant is three thousand dollars a day.  Patients 
wearing the portable device get to wait at home with no hospital bill to worry about. 
Michael's wife Patsy always carries spare batteries and a recharger when they go 
out.  At home and during sleep, he plugs into a stationary control unit.  The 
constant clicking sound is a reassuring reminder that the device is working.<P>


Michael West<BR>
<EM>"I'm alive and I know it.  There's the proof." </EM><P>



Once the device goes in, it can't be removed until the patient receives a new heart.  
Biomedical engineer Richard Smith says researchers are already designing 
smaller, permanent devices that within a few years, could eliminate the need for a 
heart transplant. The portable heart-assist device is already being used in other 
parts of the world as a permanent alternative to transplant.  As of January 1995, 
95 patients throughout Europe are living on portable devices.  <P>

Treating clogged arteries to the heart costs Americans an estimated 
38 Billion dollars each year.  A coronary bypass requires extensive surgery and an 
extended recovery period.  That's why doctors are experimenting with new procedures 
that are safer, less traumatic ways to fix a broken heart.<P>



Fifty-eight-year-old contractor John Cramer recently underwent coronary bypass surgery but 
was back to his workshop designing cabinets in a week.<P>


John Cramer<BR>
MIDCAB Patient<BR>
<EM>"I was operated on at 11:00 a.m. on a Monday morning and by 9:00 p.m. Tuesday night I was home."</EM><P>


John is one of a handful of patients at Sinai Hospital in Baltimore who have undergone 
a revolutionary new minimally invasive direct coronary artery bypass procedure called 
MIDCAB.<P>


Neal Salomon, M.D.<BR>
Cardiac Surgeon<BR>
Sinai Hospital of Baltimore<BR>
Baltimore, M.D.<BR>
<EM>"The new approach does not require the use of cardiopulmonary bypass or the heart 
lung machine.  And does not entail an incision, a long incision through the breast 
bone."</EM><P>




A cardiac catheterization of John's heart shows one single artery making his heart 
weak.<P>


Neal Salomon, M.D.<BR>
<EM>"And what we need to do is bypass this artery beyond this critical blockage and that's 
what we do with an arterial graft."</EM><P>



Instead of a foot long cut through John's breastbone, a small three inch incision lets Dr. 
Salomon see the coronary arteries.  With John's heart still beating he bypasses the 
clogged artery.<P>


Neal Salomon, M.D.<BR>
<EM>"It minimizes the damage and hopefully gets exactly the same result.  And that's what 
we're hoping for."</EM><P>



Conventional bypass surgery requires a 5-7 day hospital stay, with 4-6 weeks for 
recovery.  The MIDCAB patient is home the next day and back to work in a week or 
two with a savings of $5,000 to $10,000 dollars. <P>



John says he plans to be around to watch his grandchildren grow up.  John and wife 
Kitty have switched to a lowfat diet with regular exercise.  The ideal patient for the 
MIDCAB procedure has a single clogged artery that is easy to reach, has a healthy 
heart and is free of lung disease.  That would be about 10 percent of the general 
bypass population.<P>

Most of us would agree.  When we go to the movies, we want to be entertained.  But according to a psychotherapist in Oregon, movies can also have strong healing messages.<P>



When Bill Johnson watches "When a Man Loves a Woman," it isn't just for fun--it's an important part of his therapy.<P>


Bill Johnson<BR>
Movie Therapy Patient<BR>
Portland, OR<BR>

<EM>"The light comes on. It came on during the whole movie, and it was very painful."</EM><P>



That's because Bill saw himself trying to deal with and fix an alcoholic friend. <P>


Bill Johnson<BR>

<EM>"I would tell the Meg Ryan character, 'I, Bill, am going to fix you. If you do what I say, I will make you better.'"</EM><P>


Gary Solomon, Ph.D.<BR>
Psychotherapist<BR>
Portland, OR<BR>
<EM>"What we experience is that we become part of that movie." </EM><P>


So much so that Dr. Gary Solomon, who calls himself "The Movie Doctor," prescribes movies to help his patients come out of denial. For example, "Kate's Secret" sends a powerful message about bulimia.<P>


Gary Solomon<BR>
<EM>
"And what I get over and over again in my practice is people come back with the shock of seeing themselves."</EM><P>


Bill Johnson<BR>

<EM>"With Gary I can put up shields. I don't want to feel that.  But in a movie, I take it in, and feel it. "</EM><P>




Dr. Solomon uses a variety of movies in his therapy, including classics like "The Secret Life of Walter Mitty" to help people take charge of their lives. <P>


Gary Solomon<BR>

<EM>"So we have a paradoxical healing by seeing the things in life that we don't want to do... The things we don't want to be."</EM><P>



And that lets us focus on real-life dreams. <P>


Gary Solomon<BR>

<EM>"Sometimes we hear these inner messages, (If you build it, he will come), and do.  When I hear the inner message I ask people to listen to their feelings, and that's what therapy is about." </EM><P>



Dr. Solomon says movies have been used in therapy for years, but they may have particular value now. With the focus on managed care and cost containment, Dr. Solomon has less time to spend with his patients, and movies help them cut through denial and move faster toward healing.<P>

We see actors and models losing weight and keeping it off. Sometimes they 
gain the weight back and then dramatically announce they're trying another 
weight-loss plan.<P>


We usually assume the celebrities have some incredible diet secrets that 
would work for us. Not according to psychologist Kelly Boswell. <P>


Kelly Boswell, Ph.D.<BR>
Clinical Psychologist<BR>
<EM>"The model-thin people that we see in magazines, on TV are a genetic almost 
aberration." </EM><P>


Dr. Boswell says most dieters are reaching for unrealistic goals. Mitzi Wheeler 
was in that group. She's been teaching for 20 years, and dieting almost twice 
as long. <P>


Mitzi Wheeler<BR>
Former Dieter<BR>
<EM>"When I saw them lose weight and stay thin. I would be very envious.  It was very depressing. It hurt my self-image a lot." </EM><P>



A year and a half ago, Mitzi went to Dr. Boswell who told her to stop dieting. <P>


Kelly Boswell, Ph.D.<BR>
<EM>"A diet is perceived by your body as a crisis. When you go on a diet and 
exercise program, your body perceives that as being put on the Bataan Death 
March."</EM><P> 



Instead, she helped Mitzi understand her body. <P>


Mitzi Wheeler<BR>
<EM>"You need to learn to listen to your body so that you'll know when to eat and 
how much you eat. Your body is the only one that can tell you how much you 
need and when you need it."</EM><P>


Dr. Boswell also recommends exercise, but not necessarily in the traditional 
way. <P>


Kelly Boswell, Ph.D.<BR>
<EM>"Exercise is everything. It's turning on the radio and dancing. It's going out 
and playing ball in the yard with your kids. It's taking the dog for a walk."</EM><P>



Mitzi has lost 15 pounds but says what she's gained is more important. <P>


Mitzi Wheeler<BR>
<EM>"It's not a fast progression, but it definitely works, and the positive attitude that 
comes out of it is just phenomenal."</EM><P>


Experts say some basic goals for weight loss include eating small amounts 
several times a day instead of skipping meals, exercising three to four times a 
week for about 30 minutes and eating a variety of food.<P>

The parents of a newborn are able to breathe easier these days, as is their 
baby daughter.  She was born without normal breathing passages in her 
nose.  How doctors successfully repaired her nose in a rare and delicate 
surgery.  Within minutes she was rushed to intensive care gasping for breath.  She 
was born with choanal atresia, a rare and sometimes fatal condition where 
the membrane in the back of the nose does not form natural breathing 
holes during fetal development.<P>


Glenn Isaacson, M.D.<BR>
Surgeon<BR>
St. Christopher's Hospital for Children<BR>
Philadelphia, PA<BR>
<EM>"This is a true obstetrical emergency when a baby is first born because little 
newborn babies only know how to breath through their noses so they're 
able to cry but as soon as they get quiet, the begin to suffocate."</EM><P>

John Young<BR>
Aileen's Father<BR>
<EM>"This is our first child and it was a very gut-wrenching experience to be 
honest with you, and when they took her from the emergency room to bring 
her down to St. Christopher's we had her baptized because they really 
didn't know how bad this was."</EM><P>



In the past, surgery wasn't viable for newborns because of their small size 
and the potential blood loss.  The recent development of micro-instruments 
to work on the back of the nose through the nostril, Aileen received a 
natural airway.  Without surgery, Aileen would have been hooked up to feeding tubes for the 
first year of her life.<P>


Kathleen Young<BR>
Aileen's Mother<BR>
<EM>"Within a hour of the surgery when we were finally allowed back in to see 
her, we walked in and Dr. Isaacson was feeding her a bottle which was a 
wonderful sight to see!"</EM><P>



Aileen was able to go home with her parents eleven days after birth.  Chonal atresia affects one in seven thousand babies born in the U.S.  
Doctors cannot detect the malformation before birth.<P>

Healthcare experts say Americans spend more than 13 billion dollars a year on 
unconventional medicine.  A study in the New England Journal Of Medicine found 
one-third of all Americans have tried some form of alternative medical treatment.  
Now public health officials in Seattle are about to open the nation's first-ever 
taxpayer funded natural medicine clinic.<P>



24-year old April Rich is hoping acupuncture will help ease her menstrual cramping.
More patients like April are turning to natural medicine clinics like this one at Bastyr 
University.  Doctors here have been helping  public health officials design a new 
model for the first-ever publicly-funded natural medicine clinic.<P>



Alonzo Plough, Ph.D.<BR>
Director <BR>
Seattle/King County <BR>
Public Health <BR>
<EM>"This is a demonstration pilot project. It is a study. We are evaluating it. We are not 
transforming our entire system into a natural medicine clinic overnight."</EM><P>



Dr. Alonzo Plough runs Seattle's $200 million dollar public health agency.  Funding 
for the new clinic is 750,000 dollars.
<P>

Alonzo Plough, Ph.D.<BR>
<EM>"The model is not just a natural medicine clinic. It is natural medicine practitioners 
working with public health practitioners and working with traditional primary care 
providers in a new team approach."</EM><P> 




For Dr. Mark Nolting, a naturopathic physician, treating patients with acupuncture is 
routine, and is likely to be a component of the new clinic.<P>


Mark Nolting, N.D.<BR>
Bastyr University<BR>
Seattle, WA<BR>

<EM> "We're trying to balance her energy and bring her body into more of a balanced 
state."</EM><P>




Acupuncture is a good alternative for April, who doesn't like taking medication.<P>


April Rich <BR>
Acupuncture Patient<BR>
<EM>"I'll probably come for another 3 or 4 treatments, at that point I'll stop for a while and 
see how things went."</EM><P>



Public health officials intend to have the 2-year pilot project in place by the end of  
the year. Washington became the first state in the nation to require healthcare 
insurers pay for alternative ways of treating illnesses. Researchers are hoping to 
determine if natural medicine is in fact more cost efficient.  <P>

For twenty years, Summer Leigh Autio's high energy dance and aerobics classes have been wildly popular at Del Mar workout. <P>

But even athletic skill and unbridled enthusiasm can't prevent the aches and pains that come from pounding the aerobics floor night after night.  A typical response to the pain would be aspirin and icing--normal recommendations for swelling.<P>

But recently, Summer's been using something new--The Natus Patch.<P>

Summer said, <EM>"One of my students brought this into me and I looked at it, and I said, yeah, right!"</EM><P>

Until she tried the medicated dermal patch that relieves pain naturally.<P>

Summer told us, <EM>"I like the idea that there's very few ingredients in it, not a huge line of chemicals that your gonna read in it.  It's very simple."</EM><P>

And while the Natus Patch is sweeping the health club scene, health experts say you don't have to be a jock to enjoy its benefits.<P>

Pharmacist Charles Carey reported,  <EM>"We use it for a variety of local pain. We've had elderly people come into the pharmacy that had arthritis pain in the knees, we applied the patch and it works wonders."</EM><P>

Carey also said the patch is a great alternative to pain-relieving medication.  <EM>"The advantage is that when you take these over the counter pain relievers, they cause a lot of intestinal problems. With this, it's a localized patch that you apply and you get immediate results."</EM><P>

But Summer also warned that the patch is not a cure-all.  <EM>"Just like an aspirin, you never want to mask something that can potentially be an injury or a serious medical problem."</EM>

<B>Flu Season:  </B><BR>
Flu season generally starts in mid-December, peaks in February and dwindles out in March, even though isolated cases appear after that.  The flu, or influenza, is one of the leading causes of respiratory illness, claiming more than 200,000 lives in the United States from 1972 to 1991, according to the Centers for Disease Control.  Flu shots are 50 to 80 percent effective in protecting against the infection.  
<P>
<B>What are the symtoms of the flu?</B><BR>
*Sore throat and fever <BR>
*Headaches, body aches and pains<BR> 
*Dry, hacking cough, fatigue and weakness<P> 

Sneezing, sniffling, vomiting and diarrhea are not typical symptoms of influenza, but they may occur occasionally in conjunction with the common symptoms.  Influenza also lingers longer than most other common respiratory infections, often lasting a week or more, and it can grow into other problems, including pneumonia.<P>

<B>Flu shot of the future:</B><BR>
Researchers are studying an experimental vaccine that contains live influenza viruses, which are administered not by a shot, but by a nasal spray.  This new nasal spray is being tested on more than 7,000 adults and children nationwide.  Researchers say so far it's being tolerated and is at least as effective as the traditional vaccine.  
<P>
However, doctors hope it will provide even better protection and last longer than the traditional shot in the arm. The nasal spray causes only minor irritation to the eyes, but it quickly goes away.    
<P>
<B>Advantages:</B><BR>
Doctors say, sprayed into the nose, the viruses stimulate production of flu-fighting antibodies in the nose and throat, where the flu virus settles first.  Another advantage, it's less painful for kids than a shot.  They leave the doctor's office with a smile on their face, not tears in their eyes.  If results confirm early tests, the nasal spray oculd be on the market within a couple of years.  Doctors say the nasal spray won't completely replace the injected flu vaccine.   
<P>
<B>Research:</B><BR>
The nasal spray is being tested at 10 sites nationwide:  Pediatric Associates in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; Pediatric Associates in Bardstown, Kentucky; University of Virginia in Charlottesville, Virginia; St. Louis University in St. Louis, Missouri; Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee; University of Maryland in Baltimore; University of Cincinnati in Ohio;  Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, Texas; University of Rochester in New York;  and the University of California in Los Angeles.  The study is a collaboration between a California-based drug company, Aviron, and the National Institutes of Health.

<H4><FONT color="#000080">New Antiviral Drug</H4></FONT><FONT size=2>

Although we're out of flu season and into allergy season there's some good news in the 
fight against the influenza virus.  Researchers think they are one step closer to 
finding a way to stop the spread of the flu once it makes it way into your house.
<P>


Each year 5-15% of adults in this country get the flu and 20,000 die.<P>


Frederick Hayden, M.D.<BR>
Professor of Internal Medicine and Pathology<BR>
University of Virginia<BR>
Charlottesville, VA<BR>
<EM>"Typically influenza starts suddenly with headache, muscle aches, fever and 
chills, often with cough, runny nose, sore throat."</EM><P>



Here in this viral laboratory at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville, 
researchers think they have found a new way to attack both Influenza A and B 
at the same time and keep them from spreading throughout your home.<P>


Frederick Hayden, M.D.<BR>
<EM>"The advantage is that the drug has a broader range of activity than our current 
antiviral drugs, which are only limited to Influenza A viruses."</EM><P>



The antiviral drug reduced the risk of infection by over 80% and the risk of 
developing fever by 95%. Even taken 24 hours after exposure it reduced the risk 
of fever in eight out of ten cases.<P>


Frederick Hayden, M.D.<BR>
<EM>"The drug works by blocking a particular part of the influenza virus a
protein called the neuraminidase.  And when this particular protein's action is 
blocked the virus can't spread to infect other cells in the body."</EM><P>




What makes the flu so dangerous is its ability to infect virtually every cell in the 
respiratory tract very quickly from the lining of the nose to the cells that make up 
the air spaces in the lungs.<P>


Frederick Hayden, M.D.<BR>
<EM>"I'm hopeful that with better vaccines and anti-viral drugs, that we'll be able to 
really markedly reduce it's impact in the population and reduce the risk of death 
and severe infection in our high risk patients."</EM><P>



The experimental drug is most effective when used as either nose drops or a 
spray.  Dr. Hayden says early results look promising but it will take another year or two of 
study to determine the drugs effectiveness.  An unfortunate part of viral research 
is waiting for another active bout of influenza to continue testing.<P>

One in 7,000 infants is born with microtia.  It's a  birth defect in 
which a small nub is formed instead of a full ear.  Microtia is  believed to be 
caused by a virus a mother may get during pregnancy or by  accutane, a drug 
used for facial pimples. Many children suffer emotional as well as hearing and 
speech problems.  One California surgeon has a new surgical technique that's 
music to their ears.   <P>

For most teenage girls, buying their first pair of earrings is exciting.  For 18-
year-old Barbara Granados it's a minor miracle.  Barbara was born with microtia, a birth defect in which one or both ears are not formed. In Barbara's case, only one ear was affected.  She could still hear well out of the other ear, but she still suffered emotional scars.<P>


Barbara Granados<BR>
Microtia patient<BR>
Glendora, CA<BR>
<EM>"The thing that bothered me the most was the people that would talk about me 
say, 'Yeah, that's the girl with one ear."</EM><P>



They don't say that anymore, thanks to a new surgical procedure which sculpts 
ears on people born without them.<P>


Robert Ruder, M.D.<BR>
Plastic Surgeon<BR>
Beverly Hills, CA<BR>

<EM>"It takes a lot of experience to develop a good surgical procedure and to develop 
the dexterity of your hands to perform this."</EM><P>


After experimenting with cows' ribs for several years, Dr. Ruder began working on children.
 First, he removes a piece of their rib and sculpts it to resemble an ear in a 
pocket of their skin.  He then takes the fatty remnant of their existing nub of an 
ear and makes it into a lobe.  Next, an ear, nose and throat specialist forms an 
ear canal as a link to the inner ear.  Then a groove is made behind the ear using 
skin grafts.<P>


Robert Ruder, M.D.<BR>

<EM>"I don't think there's anything better that a person can do then to help a young 
child."</EM><P>



No one knows that better than Barbara Granados.<P>


Barbara Granados<BR>

<EM>"There's some people, 'Oh yeah, she had plastic surgery.'  It really doesn't 
matter to me what they think anymore."</EM><P>



The surgery to build a new ear takes several months and costs about $15,000. <P>

Doctors meeting in San Diego this week are talking about a new type of
operation that is getting patients home sooner and with less pain.

Unlike traditional surgery where doctors open up the chest to operate
the new procedure uses instruments threaded through a few tiny incisions
to do the work.
<P>
The procedure is call Port Access.  Thoracic surgeons say it allows them
to perform multiple by passes as well as mitral valve surgery.  The less
invasive operation means patients are up and around a lot faster.

Double by pass patient Bill Seldizt says he was walking around two days
after the surgery, ready to go home in four days and only taking Tylenol
for the pain.
<P>
The Port Access procedure is available at Cedar Sinai Hospital in Los
Angeles, however several doctors in San Diego are performing other types
of minimally invasive surgery.

Before your next visit to the dentist's chair, you may want to check out 
some new over the counter dental tools.  The newest gadgets to blast 
away bacteria in Part One of our "Healthy Smiles" series.
<P>
For years, dental professionals have been using sound waves to help 
clean teeth.  Now this technology is available at home in the form of a sonic 
toothbrush.<P>


<STRONG>Greg Clark, Sonic Toothbrush User</STRONG><BR>
<EM>"It's not a toothbrush that you can just go across your teeth with, it's very 
serious work going on inside your mouth."</EM>
<P>
At first glance, it looks like a traditional electric toothbrush.
But these bristles pack a powerful punch.  The brush operates at a sonic 
frequency generating more than 30 thousand strokes a minute. That's 
about 100 times faster than you can brush by hand.
<P>

<STRONG>Lorin Berland, D.D.S.</STRONG><BR>
<STRONG>Fellow-American Academy of Cosmetic Dentistry</STRONG><BR>
<STRONG>Dallas, TX</STRONG><BR>
<EM>"You can feel the sound waves, you can feel the plaque and bacteria 
breaking off your teeth, without hurting it, it's a pleasant sensation."</EM>
<P>
The Sonicare and Sensonic brushes promise to do more than just 
brighten those pearly whites.  They claim to reduce plaque, reverse 
gingivitis, freshen breath and remove surface stains caused by coffee, 
tea, wine and tobacco.  They also clean under your gums where floss 
can't reach.  So does it work?  Ask Greg Clark.  He says he has plenty to smile about 
since discovering the sonic toothbrush eight months ago.
<P>

<STRONG>Greg Clark</STRONG> <BR>
<EM>"I want every one of my teeth in my head when I die...and every time 
I've had a checkup they've been amazed at how good the gums look 
and how good the teeth are doing themselves with the buildup."</EM>
<P>
These new wave toothbrushes may take a small bite out of your 
pocketbook.  The cost is about 120 dollars. They're available in many 
dental offices, catalogs, drug and department stores.  In Part Two of 
"Healthy Smiles,"  you'll find out how lasers are being used in oral 
surgery.

Each year millions of Americans try to kick the nicotine habit.  Most try 
several different approaches from nicotine gum, the nicotine patch to 
quitting cold turkey.  But for some, the urge to smoke can't be 
controlled.  Now smokers desperate to quit have a new option, a nasal 
spray.<P>



Real estate agent Darcy Kresslein-Whalen  has been a heavy smoker 
for 13 years.  She's so serious about quitting, she promised herself a 
new car if she can stay smoke-free.<P>


Darcy Kresslein-Whalen<BR>
Wants to Quit Smoking<BR>

<EM>"I didn't like having the smell in my house anymore.  And my daughter 
hates the smell of smoke so I was really ready to quit."</EM><P>



Darcy has tried everything to kick her addiction,  nothing worked until 
she took part in a study examining Nicotrol, the first nicotine nasal 
spray to receive FDA approval.<P>


Don Brideau, M.D.<BR>
Family Physician<BR>
Alexandria, VA<BR>
<EM>"What we're seeing when patients are using the spray is that their 
craving for a cigarette goes away and may not come back for anywhere 
from 30 - 60 minutes."</EM><P>


Smokers spray it onto their nasal membranes where it's absorbed and 
sent directly to the brain.   Within 15 seconds, they feel a cigarette-like 
rush. <P>


Darcy quit smoking during the six week study, but that wasn't long 
enough to break her habit.  She plans to try the nasal spray again, now that it's available by prescription.<P>

Darcy Kresslein-Whalen<BR>
<EM>"If I can keep it for maybe three or four months, six months tops, I'll be 
able to stop smoking and never go back even in the most difficult 
situations." </EM><P>



Darcy's keeping her new car smoke-free hoping she'll be the one out of 
four, who kicks the habit for good.<P>


The nasal spray is part of a behavioral change program.  It takes about 
3 months for a smoker to feel as comfortable as a non-smoker.  The 
FDA recommends that smokers use the spray no more than six 
months.<P>

Research shows smokers are less likely to gain weight than non-
smokers.  People who stop, usually do gain weight, women more than 
men.  Now there's a program that helps women get off smokes without 
putting on pounds.<P>


Bonnie Spring<BR>
Psychologist, Hines VA<BR>
Chicago Medical School<BR>

<EM>"There's no question that the health risks of smoking are far greater than 
the health risks associated with weight gain.  Most women would have 
to gain fifty to one hundred pounds to offset the health benefit they're 
going to get by quitting smoking."</EM><P>



Still, it doesn't balance for a woman who is concerned about her 
physical appearance.  In order to help these women, psychologist 
Bonnie Spring created a unique program that helps them quit smoking 
and maintain their normal weight.<P>


Bonnie Spring <BR>
<EM>"But remember, we are making two major behavioral changes:  one is 
smoking, the other is weight management."</EM><P>



The study provides free stop smoking treatment and support groups to 
female smokers.  Participants deal with their reasons for smoking and 
work hard to identify new rewards in order to stay smoke free.  
Researchers measure carbon monoxide levels to see if someone has 
sneaked a smoke.  Once a woman is smoke-free for about two months, 
exercise and diet programs start.<P>



Sharon Mallin<BR>
Study Participant<BR>


<EM>"I've been smoke free for two weeks now and I'm hoping not to gain the 
weight back."</EM><P>



80% of smokers gain weight when they quit.  Two thirds of women say 
that worry about weight gain is a major barrier to quitting.  Only about 
twenty-five percent of men have the same concern.<P>

Stephanie Kovac sounds like any other addict. <P>

<EM>"It's a major dependency, and you just know you cannot go through a day
without it."</EM> <P>

Her drug of choice wasn't heroin, speed or cocaine. It was nose spray.   <EM>"It was the last thing
I used before I went to bed at night. It was the first thing I used when I got up in the morning."</EM> <P>

Dr. Greg Rohn says he sees nose-spray addicts all the time. He says people get hooked because the sprays work right away.  <EM>"The nose sprays shrink the blood vessels and therefore decongest the nose."</EM><P>
 
Nose spray labels are clear--don't use them for more than three days in a row. If the cold lingers, so does the temptation to breathe free.<P>

Dr. Rohn warns,<EM> "If the medical use is continued beyond three days, an addiction becomes evident."</EM> <P>

Like any other addict, Stephanie hid her addiction and was always close to her next fix. She had also developed what's called rebound congestion. <P>

Dr. Rohn explains, <EM>"After the spray wears off, not only does the nose return to
its congested state, but it actually becomes overcongested." </EM><P>

There are saline-based sprays that aren't so addictive. Doctors also use oral medicines, including steroids, to help steady sniffers kick the habit. <P>

It worked for Stephanie, she's been spray-free for a year.<BR><A HREF="Stayhealthymain.html">-back-</A></FONT>

It's the number one reason parents are lining up in front of  doctor's 
offices around the country-- agonizing ear problems. Not theirs, but their 
kids.<P>



The spring season just started, and doctors may be finding themselves 
"up to their ears", you could say, in troublesome earache problems.  It's 
not difficult to hear just how bad the problems can be. <P>




At some point in life, almost everyone experiences an earache.  But the 
problem is especially tough on small children. Sara Humphrey's son 
knows the feeling all too well. <P>


Sara Humphrey<BR>
Mom<BR>
<EM>"He has tubes, so usually his ears drain and he gets a temperature and 
gets really crabby and wakes up at night."</EM><P>


Thomas Eyen, M.D.<BR>
Pediatric E.N.T.<BR>
<EM>"When you get a stuffy nose your ears feel kinda plugged up.  Kids are 
kinda having the same thing happening, but to a greater degree. 
Actually bacteria will get into the middle ear space where this fluid is 
already present and will cause an ear infection."</EM><P>



But while parents might assume the obvious reason for an earache is a  
cold or possible allergy, the culprit could be something as subtle as a 
pacifier. <P>


Thomas Eyen, M.D.<BR>


<EM>"It actually creates negative pressure in the ear which can go on to kind 
of develop fluid in the ear and ear infection."  </EM><P>




So if  your child is having frequent ear problems, cutting back on that 
pacifier just might do the trick. Most importantly, a  persistent earache 
can lead to high fever, temporary hearing loss and problems with your 
child's speech development.<P>



If your toddler seems to be battling an unusually high number of ear 
infections, they are not alone.  Family physicians say ear infections 
are the number one reason parents bring their children to the doctor's 
office.<P>

The days of pulling out that dusty first-aid book to figure out what ails you 
are vanishing. That's because the medical clinics in cyberspace offer 
information around the clock.  The amount of medical information online is 
exploding--more people are taking two aspirins and logging on.<P>

<EM>"Since I'm expecting my first child next month, I think it's imortant that I start 
looking into a pediatrician so I can find the best healthcare possible for my 
baby."</EM><P>



Forget Doctor Spock.  Americans are turning on their computers and tuning 
straight into a detailed world of medicine where leading research centers 
provide cutting-edge information in language anyone can understand.<P>


J.J. Sharma, M.D.<BR>
Oncologist <BR>
Presbyterian Hospital<BR>
<EM>"They are specifically tailoring a lot of those web pages for patients with 
information that's at the level the patients can understand very well."</EM><P>


All the available information forces doctors to be more alert. <P>


J.J. Sharma, M.D.<BR>
<EM>"Patients will freqently come to me, or their children will come to me with 
information from the Internet with a list of clinical trials saying, 'Will you 
know for this type of cancer, this is what's out there.'" </EM><P>




Even doctors who think patients should use their computers to improve their 
health warn against a simple self-diagnosis.<P>


J.J. Sharma, M.D.<BR>
<EM>"When someone has a chest pain, it could be the chest wall, it could be 
musculoskeletal, it could be because of  lung problems, it could be because 
of  the esophagus, the swallowing tube or it could be because of heart

There are also computer software programs that can help explain diseases 
and medical procedures.  But a red flag to watch out for are medical quacks or salesmen who are 
doing their own internet surfing for vulnerable customers.<P>

It hurts and it's ugly, so only four
percent of patients with braces wear
their headgear the required twelve
hours a day.<P>

Onplant patient Colleen Hirstius tells us,

 <EM>"Headgear is the most miserable thing
that goes along with the whole braces
and everything." </EM><P>

When high school student Colleen
Hirstius had braces, she
got around the headgear problem by 
agreeing to an onplant, a tiny titanium
disc that's anchored
to the roof of her mouth.
Colleen says, <EM>"You can't
even feel it after a while. It's just
like you have teeth in your mouth and
that's it. You don't feel anything
else."</EM><P>

Dr. Michael Block, Oral and Maxillo Facial Surgeon at

 LSU School of Dentistry New Orleans, says <EM>"The headgear is used to anchor
something in the jaws. It's either used
to anchor the upper jaw, the lower jaw,
the lower jaw to the upper jaw and
teeth. And we think the onplant can
eliminate the need for headgear." </EM><P>

The onplant is implanted in ten minutes
 while the patient sits in the chair. <P>

Orthodontist David Hoffman explains, <EM>"When this is slid
under the gum tissue, the bone
recognizes this as a cousin so to speak
and will attach itself to the onplant
much the same way as a barnacle will
attach itself to the bottom of a boat."</EM><P>

Twelve weeks later a piece that looks
like a tie tack  and bar is inserted to
do the job headgear would normally
do.<P>
The molars will stay in
place as the front teeth are moving
back.  The onplant is waiting for FDA
approval, and doctors think it will
eventually cut treatment time in half
since it works 24 hours a day. And that
has patients like Colleen smiling.<P>
   Four patients have tried the onplant
with what doctors say are excellent
results.
   Clinical trials will start in about
a year.<BR><A HREF="Stayhealthymain.html">-back-</A></FONT>

<EM>Air Date -- 2.3.97</EM><P>


<STRONG>What Is It?</STRONG> Its designed to ease the pain and anxiety of getting pricked with a needle -- whether its a shot, an intravenous procedure, biopsy or anything else.  Numby Stuff delivers numbing medication up to 10mm into the skin in seven to 10 minutes.  Numby Stuff, or iontophoresis, uses a mild electrical current from a small battery-powered supply unit to deliver Iontocaine (which is similar to lidocaine or Novocain used by dentists) into the target area of the skin. The electrical current pushes the medication into the skin using the same principle of like-poles of magnets repelling each other.  Only active drug ions are transported into the skin.
<P>
Patients say the procedure gives an itching or tingling sensation.  Some report having no sensation of it at all.  It is normal for the skin to appear red or pale with small blisters on the treated area.  These reactions usually disappear after several hours.  Itching and dryness may also occur.  When a needle is pushed into the site, it should be a relatively pain-free experience. While the device, developed by IOMED, Inc. of Salt Lake City, is directed to children, adults can use it also.
<P>
<STRONG>The Study:</STRONG>
Double-blind placebo-controlled study of lidocaine iontophoresis for intravenous line 
placement in children, conducted by William T. Zempsky, MD, et al, Department of Pediatrics, Egleston Childrens Hospital Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, Georgia.
<P>
In a study of 41 children aged seven to 18 years, all of the patients receiving the procedure over a placebo reported a great reduction in pain.  Fourteen patients reported redness beneath the ground electrode.  Doctors say this is normal and eventually disappears.  One of the main advantages of the procedure found in the study is children can themselves regulate the flow of the drug into their skin by using controls on the device.
<P>
<STRONG>Approval:</STRONG>
The FDA-approved Numby Stuff delivery system has been recognized as the sole 
iontophoretic drug delivery system to receive the Seal of Acceptance from the Alliance of Childrens Hospitals, Inc.  The seal is a nationally recognized sign of pediatric product excellence.
<P>
<STRONG>Cost:</STRONG>
According to an IOMED spokesperson, the battery-operated main appliance runs about 
$400.  Its a one-time purchase.  Disposable electrode kits are about six to seven dollars. Tubes of creams traditionally used to anesthetize skin can run in the $10 range. In addition, topical creams usually take one to three hours to work. The system is very new and is just being distributed. For hospitals and clinics using Numby Stuff, contact IOMED, Inc.

Every drugstore has a wall of pain relievers and we all have our own way of making a
decision.  There is some organization to the pain
relievers.  Every brand fits into one of
three categories: Aspirin, Acetominophen, like Tylenol, or
non-steroidals, like Advil, Orudis and
Aleve. They conquer some pain equally.<P>

 
 Pharmacist Jim Kewley says, <EM>"To be perfectly honest about it, all
three are probably equal in
effectiveness for a headache."</EM><P>
But there are some differences.<P>

<EM>"Tylenol as a group will not provide
the same pain relief in an inflammatory
type of disease that non-steroidals and
aspirin would.  If you
have any predisposition towards having
an ulcer, you certainly wouldn't take
aspirin with ulcer medications."</EM><P>

Jim also warns just because you don't need a
prescription, these pills aren't
harmless.
<EM>"For the most part, all of these
agents can become toxic if you take too
much of them."</EM><P>
But he says the amount you take can
depend on your size.
<EM> "Most of these
normal doses are based on what they
consider a 70 kilogram patient, which
is roughly 140 to 150 pounds. I'm
substantially larger than a 150 pound
person...will this dosage work for me?
Yeah. Can I take a little bit more than
somebody who is 120 pounds? Sure."</EM><P>

As for how long it takes to get relief,
Jim says all pills take about 30
minutes and powders take about 20 minutes.

<H4><FONT color="#000080">Parkinson's Patch</H4></FONT><FONT size=2>

<B>Parkinson's Disease:</B>  No one is sure exactly what causes the chronic disorder of the nervous system, although there are many hypotheses to it's origin.  In some patients the root of the problem is the degeneration of the brain cells that control voluntary body movement.  Other causes may be encephalitis (inflammation of the brain); a brain tumor; brain damage; or poisoning either from drugs such as tranquilizers, metallic chemicals, or poisonous gases such as carbon monoxide.
<P>
<B>Symptoms:</B>  Symptoms begin slowly with an occasional trembling of one hand which then leads to clumsiness.  Both sides of the body eventually become affected.  Movements become slow and stiff, the face becomes void of expression as muscles tighten, and the patient may drool.  Speech may be impaired, followed by deterioration of the thought process.  In later stages there may be continual hand tremors, the arms become bent and the body leans forward in a permanent stoop.  The patient may begin to shuffle, and walk fast to prevent falling forward.  Eventually the handwriting is small and illegible, and speech becomes garbled and intelligible.
<P>

<B>Treatment Options:</B>  There is no cure for the disease, but the symptoms can be controlled in many cases with drug therapy.  The problem with oral medication is it causes ups and downs in the patients wellness between doses.  It is hoped that the patch will offer patients a steady level of treatment to alleviate the highs and lows of oral medication.<P>

The patch administers a steady dose of the chemical N-0923 into the bloodstream, which in turn provides a steady dose to the brain (N-0923 replaces the Dopamine lost due to the disease).  The chemical in the patch can also be used intravenously...working in 10-15 minutes rather than the four to six hours the patch takes.
<P>
So far, in early testing,  the patch seems to work without the side effects of oral medication such as dyskinesia (jerky movements) and gastrointestinal distress.  The patch is the only practical alternative for patients who can't use oral medication.
<P>
<B>Study Results:</B> Positive test results on a small number of patients at Virginia Commonwealth University's Medical College of Virginia have led to a larger Phase II trial to begin later this year in several medical centers throughout the country.  It will take two to five years before the patch will be readily available.<P>

We feel the patch will be an important alternative or added therapy in the treatment of  the symptoms of Parkinson's Disease, says study coordinator and Medical College of Virginia neurologist Dr. Vincent Calabrese.  We feel its use may slow the development of side effects and allow better control of the Parkinsonian symptoms.

We all sneeze at one time or another. 
Some people do it every time they 
see a bright light.  It's a phenomenon called photic sneezing and it effects about one out of 
every three people.<P>




John Waterbor sneezes two or three
times when he first walks out into the 
bright sunlight.  It sounds like a
small problem until he gets behind the 
wheel. <P>


John Waterbor<BR>
Photic Sneezer<BR>
<EM>"My car has a sunroof and I could be
out on a day when it was sunny to 
begin with, and as the day progressed,
the sun came out very brightly and 
there have been a few situations where
I sneezed several times in a row 
and had to keep my wits about me."  </EM><P> 



Researchers at the University of
Alabama at Birmingham asked more than 
350 eye patients if they sneezed at
bright light.  Thirty-three percent
said yes.   Most were women and the
overwhelming majority were Caucasian.  
Most sneezed three times in a row for a
period of a minute. A deviated 
septum, which means the center line of
the nose pushes to one side, was a 
common factor.<P>


Leo Semes, O.D.<BR>
University of Alabama School of Optometry<BR>
Birhimgham, AL<BR>

<EM>"What that seems to do is create a
blockage in the nose which will enhance or trigger their response."</EM><P> 

John Amos, O.D.<BR>
University of Alabama School of Optometry<BR>
Birmingham, AL<BR>
<EM>"There really isn't any treatment or
management of the condition at least 
that we re aware of.  However, I think
it's very important to be aware that 
you have it."</EM><P> 


That's so you can be prepared to stop
whatever you re doing until the 
sneezing passes.  For instance, if you
re driving, pull over briefly.  Simple 
awareness can make living with the
condition easier.<P>



The condition has also been called the 
achoo  syndrome. The sneezing 
response to light was first recognized
by researchers in 1875.<P>

<H4><FONT color="#000080">Photodynamic Therapy</H4></FONT>
<I>Air Date -- 2.6.97</I>
<P>


<B>Esophageal Cancer:</B><BR>
Each year 12,000 new cases of esophageal cancer are detected, and 11,000
Americans die from the disease.  This form of cancer is on the rise in
America for white men over the age of 50.  Some experts say the sharp
rise is associated with the overuse of chronic heartburn medication and
the high rate of a pre-cancerous esophageal cancer condition called
Barretts Syndrome.
<P>
<B>Photodynamic Therapy:</B>
Photodynamic therapy is the process by which the drug photofrin is
intravenously fed into the body for 24 to 48 hours.  The drug collects
mainly in the tumor area.  A fiber optic probe is inserted into the
patients esophagus where it directs low-energy, non-thermal laser light
at the cancerous tissue for 12 minutes.  The light activates the drug
causing it to destroy tumor cells.
<P>
<B>Side Effects:</B>
Because the laser is a cool laser with a gentle light, the skin may
receive a sunburn, but not a serious burn.  However, the patient will be
photosensitive (a condition where the skin has an abnormal and severe
reaction to sunlight) and must avoid contact with the sun and bright
light sources for 30 days.  Following surgery, there may be slight
tenderness when swallowing due to the sunburn, discomfort in the chest,
fever or slight nausea.
<P>
<B>Other Options:</B>
While this is the only option for patients who have inoperable cancer,
it is also an important option for older patients who cannot tolerate
massive surgery.  If surgery is performed, but the cancer is not
completely removed, chemotherapy and radiation are other options.
<P>
<B>Cost:</B>
Photodynamic therapy is much less expensive than surgery because it is
performed on an out-patient basis.  The approximate cost is $12,000.  It
is being covered by some insurance carriers, including Medicare.
<P>
<B>Future Plans:</B>
Researchers think that this laser therapy may one day be the cure for
esophageal cancer.  In October 1996, photodynamic therapy received
approval from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as treatment for
inoperable esophageal cancer.  Trials have shown that 94 percent of
patients had positive tumor response.  Since the results have been so
positive on inoperable cases, researchers are now using the drug on
early cancer cases before the disease has spread throughout the body. 
It is our hope that this will be a cure for esophageal cancer when the
cancer is picked up at such an early stage that it has not invaded and
gone else where, says Gastroenterologist Alvin Zfass, M.D., lead
researcher at Virginia Commonwealth University-Medical College of
Virginia in Richmond.  
<P>
Dr. Zfass says doctors across the country are
closely monitoring patients with Barretts Syndrome.  If early cancer,
or dysplasia (abnormal development of tissue) develops, it is the
perfect time to use photodynamic therapy.  Its important to gather data
on early testing to have positive proof to submit to the FDA that this
therapy works in early cancer cases.

It's dinnertime at your home, and the kids are probably turning up their 
noses at what's on their plates. Sound familiar? It's no secret that 
getting kids to eat a healthy meal can be mission impossible.<P>



Two-year-old Kevin isn't interested in eating lunch today. Or any day, for 
that matter. Sheryl Gregory says her son is a picky eater. He won't sit 
down at meals, and his tastes are limited.<P>


Sheryl Gregory<BR>
Son is picky<BR>
<EM>"Anything with ketchup. He'll lick the ketchup off and put the food back. 
He likes sprinkles. If I get really desperate, I put little candy sprinkles on 
his food."</EM><P>


Sheah Rarback, R.D.<BR>
Dietician<BR>
<EM>"When you introduce a food, you just put it out there low key. It's not 
forced feeding. And if the child wants to put it on their plate, fine, and if 
they don't want to eat it, fine."</EM><P>



A few do's and don'ts. Experts say don't ever force-feed children. It's a 
guarantee they won't like the food. Don't give them a lot of juice -- they'll 
be full and won't eat. Don't use dessert as a reward -- it reinforces the 
idea that what's on their plate isn't good. 
Serve smaller portions -- they're not so intimidating. Have children help 
make the meal -- they may be more likely to try it. And make eating fun.<P>


Sheah Rarback, R.D.<BR>
<EM>"Cutting foods, either sandwiches or vegetables in cute shapes, or 
making a face with grated carrots and raisins can help a child eat that 
food."</EM><P>



Experts say it's O.K. to give kids their favorite food over and over, as 
long as it's healthy. If they're gaining weight and look healthy, they're 
probably getting all the nutrients they need.  Doctors say snacks are very important for children. They have small 
stomachs and tend to get hungry often. Just be sure they're eating 
something nutritious, like fruit and yogurt instead of chips and cookies.<P>

Teenagers and young adults are wearing earrings in just about every place you 
can imagine.  It's becoming more and more fashionable among mainstream 
America to have a body part pierced.  But as the trend grows, so too does the 
concern about infection, communicable diseases and scarring.<P>




Twenty-three-year-old Charlie Mackin is getting his tongue pierced -- again.  Charlie's been pierced a few times and has never had any health problems.  He says the pain doesn't bother him.<P>


Charlie Mackin<BR>
Has Body Pierced <BR>
<EM>"If it didn't hurt, then everybody would have it, you know."</EM><P>



Scars like this one from piercing,  are almost always permanent and can be risky.  
Germs from the surface of the skin can cause infections or worse.<P>


Jim Farrow, M.D.<BR>
University of WA<BR>
Adolescent Medicine<BR>
<EM>"You can also introduce what we call systemic infections like hepatitis and HIV, 
the virus that causes AIDS, into the blood system."</EM><P>



Dr. Jim Farrow says the best way to reduce the risk of infection is to:<BR>
* Make sure all piercing equipment is sterilized <BR>
* Pierce only fleshy areas of the body which have good blood flow <BR>
* Scrub the skin with an antiseptic for 60 seconds or more before piercing.<BR>
 Even with these precautions, there are other risks.   <P>


Jim Farrow, M.D. <BR>

<EM>"Bleeding, a side effect of tongue piercing that can be quite serious, and then loss 
of sensation because of damage to the nerves."</EM><P>

Charlie Mackin<BR>
Body Piercer<BR>
<EM>"If people knew how little it hurt, it wouldn't scare people so much though."</EM><P>


It will be a week or two before Charlie's tongue is healed and the swelling gone.<P>



If you're planning a trip to the piercing parlor, doctors recommend beginning with 
your earlobes first.  Stay away from the cartilage part of your ear. If  you want to 
get more daring, the navel has good blood flow and is easily concealed if you 
change your mind later.  The cost is about $60 dollars per piercing and should 
include the jewelry. <P>

<B>The Pilates Method:</B>  It's one of the hottest new exercise crazes sweeping through the country.  The Pilates Method offers total body conditioning without the pain and discomfort of existing workout methods.  Pilates has been around since World War I when athlete Joe Pilates added springs to veteran beds to aid their rehabilitation.  When he brought his technique to the United States where it was embraced by dancers wanting a well-conditioned body without bulk.  Seventy-five years later, it's finally hit the mainstream because aging baby boomers are looking for ways to exercise their bodies without punishing them.
<P>
<B>The "Core":</B>  Pilates focuses on the abdominal muscles as the core of the body.  "The philosophy being if you have a strong center or a strong core then your extremities are free to express themselves," says Pilates follower Cara Schneiders.  Posture is realigned and the spine is straightened.  The extremities are flexed and strengthened in a full range of motion.  The body and mind are free to move voluntarily.
<P>
<B>The Equipment:</B>  Pilates centers around a simple platform with detachable springs called the Universal Reformer.  The sliding platform allows the user to sit, kneel, stand or recline.  The individual controls the resistance by pushing against a padded bar or cords and straps.  There are hundreds of exercises available.  Although it was originally designed for rehabilitation, its total body conditioning makes it useful for overall exercise and injury prevention.  A work-out improves strength, flexibility, endurance and coordination.
<P>
<B>Availability:</B>  Ten years ago there were a hundred studios in the country.  There are now well over 400.  Classes are generally one-on-one or small groups.  Prices vary nationally from $20.00 an hour for a group session to $80.00.  Prices can be higher when Pilates is used for rehabilitation, but that is often covered by insurance.

   As we head into summer vacation from
school, many parents will rely on the
neighborhood playground to entertain
their children.
  However, many of these playgrounds
are fraught with danger.  The Consumer
Agency the California Public Interest
Research group, also known as Calpirg, investigated 562 playgrounds
nationwide including 12 here in San
Diego.  They found that far too many
playgrounds have hidden hazards.<P>
 
   The most common playground dangers
include swings that are too close together
or have hard wooden seats.
    They can cause dangerous
collisions and spaces that are less than
nine inches wide can easily entrap your
child's head.  Perhaps
   The most dangerous aspect of the
playground is the surface.  It should be
made of loose fill such as mulch or
wood chips to soften a child's
fall, not tightly packed sand or
pebbles.  Each year 150,000 children suffer
injuries from playgrounds. 
   Although 85% of playgrounds lack
adequate protection, the Calpirg survey
shows most have improved in the past
two years.<P>
<STRONG>You can get a
copy of the Calpirg report for $15.00.

I don't know about you, but going through an earthquake or other natural 
disaster would make my blood pressure soar.  In fact, doctors say that kind of 
mental stress results in more heart attacks.  The connection between mental 
stress and physical conditions is the focus of a new study.<P>



What Bill Craig is doing is tough.  He's tracing the outline of a star, while 
looking at the reversed image in a mirror.  Now it's a math test that requires a lot of mental pressure. Meanwhile, doctors monitor Bill's heart. <P>


Christopher O'Connor, M.D.<BR>
Cardiologist<BR>
Duke University Medical Center<BR>
<EM>"We're looking for small changes in the heart's movement that become 
abnormal under the mental stressor."</EM><P>


Doctors at Duke University believe a mental stress test can predict heart 
problems better than traditional tests.<P>


Christopher O'Connor, M.D.<BR>
<EM>"Using the current available tests, exercise, treadmill tests and some of the 
nuclear tests there is a considerable amount of error in their ability to predict 
cardiac events."</EM><P>



In a study of 130 patients, mental tests predicted the 40 patients with chest 
pain who would have heart problems later on.  Physical tests only predicted 20 
of those.<P>



For heart attack survivor Grace Matthews, the mental test is a challenge.<P>


Grace Matthews<BR>
Study Participant<BR>

<EM>"I think the mental test it gets your blood pressure up a little quicker than the 
physical test does."</EM><P>


Doctors say learning to handle stress is the first step, but caution studies still 
need to confirm whether it will actually ward off a heart attack.   For Grace, the 
test brought peace of mind.  Doctors say her chances of a repeat heart attack 
have dropped.<P>



Dr. O'Connor says this mental test will probably be available in two to three 
years.  He predicts it will be a better tool for individuals who deal with more 
mental stress than physical such as pilots, air traffic controllers and even 
doctors.  <P>

We used to think the only way to increase strength was to lift as much 
weight as possible. Now fitness experts know you don't have to pump a 
ton to tone your body. That's good news, because as we age, keeping 
strong is important to staying healthy.<P>



As Jane Le Vieux gets closer to pushing 40, she's pushing more weight. 
She joins a growing number of women who are weight-training for 
looks and health. <P>


Tom Anderson<BR>
Fitness Trainer<BR>
<EM>"Women see their bodies changing and sculpting.  Toning makes them 
feel strong."</EM> <P>

In general, women and men gain a pound a year between ages 25 and 
55. One big reason: we lose a half-pound of muscle annually.  It's 
replaced with a pound and a half of fat. Experts say the cycle can be 
broken by lifting weights. You don't even need a lot of them. <P>


Tom Anderson<BR>
<EM>"People think they need to pick up a lot of weights to get a lot of results, 
but form is probably the most important part of your workout." </EM><P>



Since she started lifting, Jane's body fat dropped seven percent. She 
says her self-esteem and health have soared. <P>


Jane Le Vieux<BR>
Lifts Weights<BR>
<EM>"I feel better about myself. Hopefully I'm going to extend my life and live  
to the ripe old age of 100."</EM><P>




New research from Penn State University says you can improve muscle 
mass and bone density by lifting just twice a week.<P>



Studies have shown that people in their 90s can triple their strength in 
less than two months by lifting weights.<P>

<EM>posted 8/20/96</EM><P><FONT size=2>



Forty million American adults do not know how to read. According to the national 
commission on education, the single most crucial factor in  reading success is 
having someone read aloud to you at an early age.  Find out how that task is now 
being tackled off the beaten path, in the doctor's office.
<P>


Timothy is here today for a doctor's visit. He doesn't know it, but he's about to get a 
prescription to read.<P>

New  Orleans, LA       <BR>          
<EM>"If parents can read to their children from birth, then those children are going to do 
better in school. We know that, that's very well documented."</EM><P>


The Reach Out and Read program starts in the waiting room with volunteer 
readers. It gives parents of at-risk children the information and materials they need 
to make books a part of their child's daily life.<P>


Anne Curran              <BR>         
Mother<BR>
<EM>"It's really nice that they have books that they can choose from and be able to take 
them home."</EM><P>



The books are given away through book drives and donations.<P>



Even at the tender age of one, Justin Lofton is benefiting from the program.<P>


Melanie Lofton      <BR>              
Justin's Grandmother	<BR>
<EM>"I never really noticed that even at nine months, eight months, seven months, six 
months they come to recognize things."</EM><P>

<EM>"We have done surveys and they show there's a greater number of books in the 
home and in some cases they're reading to the children more."</EM><P>


At Boston City Hospital where the program started, preliminary studies found 
families given books were eight times more likely to read, than families who did 
not receive the books.<P>



So now along with check ups on motor skills, language development and general 
health, these physicians are also making sure literacy milestones are being met.<P>



If parents themselves need to learn to read, they are referred to operation 
mainstream, a program set up to help them overcome illiteracy.<P>

Kimberly Butterwick used to use
Retin-A to reduce fine wrinkles, but
like millions of women, she soon
quit.<P>

 
Kimberly Butterwick<BR>
<EM>"The main problem with using
Retin-A is it's irritating, chaps the
skin and makes it red.  It's difficult to use."</EM><P>
 

But the last few weeks, Kimberly
has turned to Renova, the newest in the
arsenal of wrinkle-fighting
products.
<P>
Kimberly Butterwick<BR>
<EM> "Since I've been using the
Renova, it's more elegant, feels and
smells like a moisturizer.  It spreads
easier and I haven't had the trouble I
had with the old Retin-A."</EM><P>
 
 
And now, Kimberly Butterwick, that's doctor Kimberly
Butterwick from Dermatology
Associates, writes scores of
prescriptions for Renova for her
patients who want to minimize fine
lines.<P>

 
Dr. Kimberly Butterwick<BR>
Dermatologist<BR>
<EM>"The cream is in a moisturizing base.  Most all women use moisturizers.  And the old Retin-A was in a thin, cream base. This has more lubricating oils in it."</EM><P>

The FDA has just approved Renova as a
kinder, gentler version of Retin-A.
<P>
<EM>"It will have the same effect over
time.  If you're using the old Retin-A
and not having a problem, you could
continue.  It wouldn't make much difference using
Renova.  But for many people, including
myself, it was just too difficult to
use the old Retin-A because of dryness, chapping, and irritation."</EM><P>

But Dr. Butterwick cautions even with Renova, you want to start easy.<P>

 
 
<EM> "I used it every night for a
week, developed some redness and
scaling, backed off, and used it every
other night.  Then in a week I'll try
using it every night again."</EM><P>

And without the need for
additional moisturizers, you'll have
plenty of time to include Renova in
your beauty routine.<BR><A HREF="Stayhealthymain.html">-back-</A></FONT>

<H4><FONT color="#000080">Ritalin Alternative</H4></FONT><FONT size=2>
There's a new treatment that isn't a drug.  Ritalin.  It's a drug praised by many and criticized by just as many.  The  
prescription drug is used to help children and adults with Attention 
Deficit Disorder.  Some people are looking for an alternative.<P>

Krystle Bailey is a bright, energetic nine-and-a-half year old, thirsty for 
knowledge.  Up until 3 months ago, even Krystle admits she was also a terror.<P>


Krystle Bailey<BR>
Third Grader<BR>
<EM>"I was squirmy.  I couldn't sit still, I was loud.  I was bad.  And I didn't 
follow the teacher's instructions in the classroom."</EM><P>


Her teachers said she needed Ritalin.  Krystle's mom said no.<P>


Terri Bryant<BR>
Krystle's mother<BR>
<EM>"I feel that is encouraging a child to... you feel bad, take drugs. Makes 
you feel better.  I don't want to encourage that."</EM><P>


Ritalin certainly helps many children focus and learn better.  Some 
teachers say it's the difference between night and day.  Since it is a 
powerful stimulant, it's in the same category as cocaine and morphine.  Some researchers continue to look for an alternative.

Dr. Billie Sahley believes nutrition, not drugs, fights the best fight against 
Attention Deficit Disorder.<P>


Dr. Billie Sahley<BR>
<EM>"You have to correct the imbalances and that's what this is all about.  
Imbalances, not suppressing the central nervous system, so they'll sit 
there like a vegetables.  Correct the imbalance."</EM><P>


Dr. Billie Sahley<BR>
<EM>"The brain is the most underfed organ in the body, yet it's the busiest."</EM><P>

After testing for food allergies, Dr. Sahley and Krystle's mom decided to 
try a nutritional supplement, Kids Plex.  It was only a couple of weeks 
before they noticed a big change for the better.<P>


Krystle Bailey<BR>
<EM>"Cause I was making F's and D's and I've changed that to A's and B's 
and some C's."</EM><P>


Dr. Billie Sahley<BR>
<EM>"They've able to go to school.  They're able to do the work.  They're 
happy.  They've verbal.  They can communicate.  They make A's."  
They're drug free."</EM><P>


The makers of Kids Plex don't claim it's a magic powder.  They say the 
litmus test for success in battling A.D.D. is simple.<P>


Gary Lewellyn<BR>
Performance Nutrition<BR>
<EM>"Whether it's a pharmaceutical a nutritional material, whatever it is, in 
the end, it rises or sinks based upon whether it works and if it is safe."</EM><P>

Krystle Bailey<BR>
<EM>"Let me tell you it really helped me.  I don't like the taste, it tastes like 
banana, but it's helped me a whole lot."</EM><P>

Kids Plex is not available in any stores.  The product is sold through 
only a few doctor's offices or through performance nutrition.  To get 
more information, you can call 1-800-933-PLEX.<P>

<H4><FONT color="#000080">Ritalin Kids</H4></FONT><FONT size=2>
Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, commonly known as  A.D.D.  It's 
a neurological disorder that takes over the minds of children and steals 
away their focus and concentration.  It's estimated more than two million 
children suffer from it and now it is America's number one childhood 
psychiatric disorder.<P>



Mark and Blake Fisher have both been diagnosed with A.D.D. and take 
the drug Ritalin.  Ten-year-old Blake says it helps him focus and feel safe.<P>


Mark Fisher<BR>
Blake and Mark's father<BR>
<EM>"It slows him down to a medium speed so he can go ahead and focus 
on one thing and not be distracted by everything in the room."</EM><P>

Cindy Fisher<BR>
Blake and Mark's mother<BR>
<EM>"They come home from school and I can see the Ritalin start wearing off 
in the afternoons."</EM><P>


Kids with A.D.D. have trouble sitting still and concentrating.  Ritalin 
makes them attentive and focused.<P>


Marvin Silverman<BR>
Child Psychologist<BR>
<EM>"The theory is there's a part of the brain that has to do with attention 
span, that inside the brain is understimulated, it's too quiet.  And when 
the stimulant is given it gets that chemical working properly in that part 
of the brain, and now the child can focus and attend without being 
fidgety and restless."</EM><P>



These days more children are prescribed drugs to help them calm down, 
focus and cheer up.  The number of children given Ritalin has doubled 
in just the last 6 years.<P>


Susan Rogers<BR>
Son took Ritalin<BR>
<EM>"There's not a night I don't go to bed and want to wake up in the 
morning and say that Kenny is gonna be well."</EM><P>



Susan Rogers knows first hand the dangers of prescription drugs.  Her 
son Kenny took Ritalin for nine years to control his A.D.D.  He stopped 
taking the drug after doctors noticed there was too much of it in his 
system.  Kenny's doctors prescribed other drugs, as a replacement.   He 
had a near fatal reaction to one of them.<P>


Susan Rogers<BR>
<EM>"The nurse said when we got there probably another 10 minutes and he 
would have suffocated because he would have swallowed his tongue 
and died."</EM><P>



Kenny still has trouble focusing in class, but after nearly losing him to a 
drug overload, his mom says she'll work with his Attention Deficit 
Disorder in different ways.<P>




Marvin Silverman<BR>
<EM>"Not all kids may need medication, it depends on how the A.D.D. is 
affecting their life."</EM><P>



While experts say some children benefit from Ritalin, for others it's being 
used as a quick-fix for busy parents and teachers with too many kids in 
class.<P>


Marvin Silverman<BR>
<EM>"Medicine makes it easy."</EM><P>

Michele Williams<BR>
Vice President<BR>
Children and Adults with Deficit Disorder<BR>

<EM>"If the people who were saying these things lived with a child like ours, 
they wouldn't feel quite as strongly that you shouldn't ever put a child on 
drugs."</EM><P>


Michele Williams, mother of two A.D.D. children, runs a local chapter of 
CH.A.D.D., a support group for parents of A.D.D. kids.  She says claims 
of A.D.D. being a trendy diagnosis are unfounded.<P>


Michele Williams<BR>
<EM>"There is more publicity, people are more readily able to get the 
information and what happens when you get the information is that 
people begin getting the diagnosis and that doesn't make it a fad."</EM><P>



Another reason parents should think hard before putting kids on Ritalin is recent studies found it may cause cancer.  While the FDA says it still  believes Ritalin is a safe drug, it felt that parents should have this 
information.  In a recent survey, almost half of the pediatricians said they spent less 
than an hour evaluating children before prescribing Ritalin to them.  
Interestingly, Georgia and Michigan lead the country in the amount of 
Ritalin taken.   In part two of our series, we'll take a look at an 
alternative to drugs to control A.D.D.<P>

The massage technique called rolfing was designed to fight gravity. Many 
people with back and neck problems say it releases their tension and 
relieves their pain.<P>

Benjamin Sanderford had a mountain bike accident that left his shoulder 
hurting.<P>


Benjamin Sanderford<BR>
Rolfing Patient<BR>
<EM>"I was having muscle spasms, and I couldn't get that muscles to release. I 
heard about Rolfing through some of  my peers, so I decided to come in 
and get fixed."</EM><P>



Rolfing was designed to heal body parts by strengthening the body's 
foundation.<P>


Mary Kimberlin<BR>
Certified Rolfer<BR>
<EM>"It could be because of your ankle. Because if we have one ankle that rolls 
in, just like you'd have a building and the foundation isn't straight, that's 
going to affect everything all the way up and through."</EM><P>



During the sixties and seventies, Rolfing picked up some misconceptions. 
the biggest one is that it's extremely painful.  <P>


Richard Merbler<BR>
Certified Rolfer<BR>
<EM>"What I tell them is usually they're going to hurt more getting out of bed in 
the morning than they do in session."</EM><P>


The 800 certified Rolfers worldwide aim at relief through release, deep 
pressure applied to different areas with the elbows and hands. They say 
this counteracts the pull of gravity.<P>


Mary Kimberlin<BR>
<EM>"We're all at war with gravity every day. If you think about it, our picture of 
old age is someone who's crumpled up who's sort of lost the war."</EM><P>


Benjamin Sanderford<BR>
<EM>"And once you get that release I'm much more energized, and I just feel like 
a kid again."</EM><P>



Rolfing was not created to be merely therapy. The basic intent was to 
educate and restore people's spirits, and through that, it would be 
therapeutic.<P>

Massage is becoming increasingly popular.  But there are so many 
types of massage available today, where do you go, what should you 
ask for and how much should you pay?<P>


Steve Panzik spends 3 to 5 hours a day out on the water, burning 
muscles.   As captain of Philadelphia's Temple University rowing team,  
he understands the benefits of massage therapy.  <P>

<EM>"If there's a certain muscle region not warmed up enough you, could 
easily pull that or do something to that extent.  Having that massage to 
warm up kind of gets all the blood flowing through all the muscles." </EM><P>

<EM>"A good massage is one that addresses a problem at hand."  </EM><P>

Sports medicine expert Doctor Michael Weinik claims anyone who 
performs repetitive movements can be helped by massage.  It relaxes 
the muscles and helps prevent injuries like muscle tears and strains.  
massage has been quoted in medical literature since 2700 B.C.  There 
are many types.   <P>

<EM>"There's Swedish massage, there's Shiatsu, there's reflexology which is 
considered a form of massage, deep myofacial work.  Not one type of 
massage is particularly better than any other one overall, but each type 
of massage has benefits for a specific problem."</EM><P>

If you're looking for a good masseuse, check with a health club or gym 
for the name of a certified massage therapist. <BR>


Massages can cost anywhere from 25 to 50 dollars for a half hour.  
Insurance companies often cover the cost if you have a doctor's referral.  <BR>

Usually transplants are reserved only for those who would die without them.  
Now breakthroughs in medicine are allowing doctors to transplant nerves and 
someday maybe even limbs.<P>



Last summer Rebecca Case wasn't throwing any balls.  The three year old 
almost had her arm severed in a power mower accident.<P>


Randy Case<BR>
Father<BR>
<EM>"There was no elbow socket, most of the bone was gone out of the upper part.  
The two main nerves were gone out of the three."</EM><P>


Until a few years ago, Rebecca's arm would have been amputated.  But 
pioneering work with nerve transplants is helping spare even the most mangled 
limbs.  In a day-long surgery, nerves from a cadaver are transplanted into the damaged 
limb.  The foreign nerves become a trellis to help the severed nerves grow 
together again.  Eventually feeling and movement return.<P>


Susan Mackinnon, M.D.<BR>
Surgeon<BR>
Washington University<BR>
St. Louis<BR>
<EM>"So unlike any other transplant there is this replacement of the foreign nerve 
with the new nerve, and we use the transplant only until that replacement 
occurs."</EM><P>


Breakthroughs in the lab with certain drugs are making nerve transplants 
possible. Without these drugs the body would reject the foreign tissue.<P>


Susan Mackinnon, M.D.<BR>
<EM>"You would find out exactly what's foreign in the tissue you want to transplant 
and specifically block the body's ability to react to that foreign agent."</EM><P>


By the time Rebecca is in college, doctors may be able to transplant not only 
nerves but limbs, and that's something to smile about.  So far the nerve transplant procedure has been performed on only four people 
worldwide.  All of them have been able to keep limbs that would normally have 
been amputated. <P>

As AIDS continues to spread, so does a
sight-robbing virus called CMV
Retinitis. It's the number one cause of
blindness in AIDS patients. One doctor
is stopping their loss of vision.<P>



Patients can be treated intravenously,
but that has risks, including kidney
damage.<P>


William Freeman, M.D.<BR>
Ophthalmologist<BR>
University of California San Diego<BR>
<EM>"There are side effects of the drug,
and the biggest problem of the IV drug
is while they work initially, they
begin to fail within a couple months."</EM><P>



Eye surgeon William Freeman has a
simpler and more effective way to save
a patient's sight. Instead of giving
the drug through an IV, Dr. Freeman
injects a tiny amount directly into the
infected eye.<P>


William Freeman, M.D.<BR>

<EM>"We have found in our lab that this
drug lasts for a vey, very long time
when one puts it in the eye.  It seems
to completely protect the retina if
it's injected into the eye once every
six weeks."</EM><P> 



Dr. Freeman has used eye injections on
80 patients. So far, it has stopped the
virus every time. <P>


William Freeman, M.D.<BR>
<EM>
"It essentially solves the problem of
CMV destroying the retina."</EM><P>


Fifteen percent of the patients experienced
some swelling in the eye after the
injection. None of them developed a
resistance to the drug.<P>


Dr. Freeman wants to make the treatment
available to transplant patients and
people with lymphoma because they are
also susceptible to CMV Retinitis.<P>

Schizophrenia is a disabling psychiatric illness. It affects more than one and a 
half million people in the United States. Medical experts say many of those 
who have it suffer from loud auditory hallucinations or voices. Until now, little 
was known about how or why those voices occur. But, researchers at UCLA's 
School of Medicine are coming up with some answers.<P> 



This 34-year-old Wayne Carpenter has Schizophrenia.  He says he hears up to 10 
voices in his head at one time.<P>


Wayne<BR>
Schizophrenic patient<BR>
<EM>"It's kind of a mixture between a real hell and a real kind of a strange 
hallucination."</EM><P>



Medical experts say up to 70 percent of all schizophrenics hear voices.   
Doctors don't know why, but two researchers at the UCLA's Medical Center in 
Los Angeles have a theory.<P>


Mark Cohen, Ph.D.<BR>
Associate Professor of Neurology<BR> 
UCLA School of Medicine<BR>
Los Angeles, CA<BR>
<EM>"Schizophrenics hear voices because their normal process of thought is 
disrupted in such a way that what would ordinarily be thought of by us as 
thinking, appears to them as voices."  </EM><P>


The researchers conducted a study examining blood flow to the brain of 
several schizophrenic patients.  They analyzed their brains  through  an  MRI 
scan, watching patients  while they were hearing voices and also while they 
were listening to tapes of voices.  <P>


Mark Cohen, Ph.D.<BR>
<EM>"The very same regions which process normal speech are involved in the self-
generated language that we call auditory hallucinations."</EM><P>



The researchers say understanding which area of the brain is activated when 
schizophrenics hear voices will help doctors select the right medications for 
them.<P>


Mike Green, Ph.D.<BR>
Clynical Neuropsychologist<BR>
UCLA School of Medicine<BR>
Los Angeles, CA<BR>
<EM>"Once we've isolated a particular brain system, we can then begin a search of 
drugs that act most directly on that particular system."</EM><P>


Getting the right medication quickly may help silence those disturbing voices 
for Wayne and others like him. Researchers at UCLA say their findings also 
ease the stigma of schizophrenia for patients.  By allowing them to see on 
computer how their brain functions, they can understand that their disorder  is 
caused by a biological problem and not just a mental one.  <P>

For some teenagers and young adults few things are more upsetting 
than acne.  In fact, those who have it spend about 4 hundred million 
dollars a year on medication.  Now a promising new treatment could 
help doctors clear up acne.<P>



When college student Greg Weckman  walks on campus he feels 
conspicuous.  Greg is one of 17 million Americans who suffer from acne. <P>


Greg Weckman<BR>
Acne Patient<BR>
<EM>"It's frustrating. . .very frustrating.  Because you go and meet people and 
you're wondering are they looking at my face or are they looking at the 
acne.  Do people see beyond that?"</EM><P>  



Greg is participating in a pilot study at Washington University that uses 
a light with a topical medication called a photosensitizer.  Used together 
doctors suspect they'll shrink the oil-producing glands that cause acne. <P>


Luciann Hruza, M.D.<BR>
Dermatologist<BR>
Washington University School of Medicine<BR>
St. Louis, MO<BR>
<EM>"The lesions in many of the patients appear to be drying up.  The 
patients don't seem to be having any problem with it.  Patients tell me 
that the pain in the areas that they had from the acne has been 
decreasing, so we're very encouraged by the early results."</EM><P>  



Photodynamic therapy has been used in the past to treat patients with 
skin cancer, pre-cancerous conditions and psoriasis.  Doctors are 
optimistic it will have excellent results with acne as well. <P>


Luciann Hruza, M.D. <BR>

<EM>"We're hoping to decrease the amount of other treatment the patients 
will need. . .pills, creams, those sort of things to allow patients more 
freedom in their life.  To come in for a quick treatment every month or 
two or possibly even cure their acne completely."</EM><P>  



Other advantages of photodynamic therapy are that it provides nice 
cosmetic results, and it eliminates the hassle of using oral and topical 
medicine.<P>

There are support groups for virtually every disease. Learning how to be your own best support is the focus of a new study.<P>



<EM>"I am not the woman I used to be. Surgeons and fate rearrange clay body humbled past modesty."
</EM><P>


Poetic words spoken about the harsh realities of breast cancer. Betty creath's battle began five years ago. So did a new self-help program called SHIP. Betty remembers how ship kept her spirits afloat. <P>


Betty Creath<BR>
Breast Cancer Survivor<BR>
Tucson, AZ<BR>
<EM>"I feel that if I hadn't had that knowledge that they had supplied to me and the support that they gave me those six weeks, I think I would have just floundered." </EM><P>


Carrie Jo Braden, Ph.D.<BR>
SHIP Project<BR>
University of Arizona<BR>
Tucson, AZ<BR>
<EM>"Problem solving is one of the skills we work on. The ability to frame things in non-negative ways is another thing that we work on and to the extent that we can help people strengthen the belief in themselves." </EM><P>


<EM>"Is there anything in particular that you need to discuss today as far as any problems you've been having recently with your treatment?"
</EM><P>


For ten weeks, a team of nurses call breast cancer patients to discuss everything from chemotherapy side effects to how the illness may be affecting a spouse. <P>


Carrie Jo Braden, Ph.D.<BR>
<EM>
"We can read charts, we can help people interpret their medical care, we know how to talk with their physician."</EM><P>



Art and poetry by Betty and others illustrate how SHIP teaches women to be their own best support. The study on self-help found that three months after medical treatment, SHIP patients were taking better care of themselves and returning to work and family roles faster than women without any intervention. <P>




Dr. Braden says older women seemed to do the best in SHIP. The next step of the study is to look at ways to help younger and minority women bounce back faster.<P>

Every year, tens of thousands of Americans have operations to ease their 
back pain. There may be another option to check out before resorting to 
surgery.<P>


Jewel Woodward is limping toward hope.  Jewel has been nagged by a searing pain in her hip for more than a year.  Despite physical therapy, the pain lingers. <P>


Andy Cole, M.D.<BR>
Baylor University <BR>
Medical Center<BR>
Dallas, TX<BR>
<EM>"If a patient is not improving with good, aggressive, conservative care, we 
need to find a way to move them off center, to get them improving more 
quickly." </EM><P> 


Jewel is on the operating table, but there's no scalpel in sight. Instead of 
surgery, some back experts are turning to needles to ease patients' pain. <P>


Andy Cole, M.D.<BR>
<EM>"We can put the medicine around that nerve under X-ray guidance so that 
they get the medicine directly on the area of injury." </EM><P>



With patients awake, doctors inject a dye near the pain so they can spot 
nerve damage. Then they inject pain-blocking medicine to coat and 
deaden frayed nerves. Patients bodies heal themselves. <P>


Andy Cole, M.D.<BR>
<EM>"Our aim with these advanced techniques is to give the body a hand to get 
better more quickly."</EM><P> 




Jewel's procedure is over about 15 minutes after it started. Good news:  the shot hit the mark.<P> 


Orthopedic experts say the most common advice for back pain, bed rest, may be wrong. A recent study showed most people who continue normal activity recover the fastest.  Another recent study showed no matter what type of doctor patients see for a sore back, a specialist, family doctor or chiropractor, 70 percent fully recover within six months.<P>

<B>High-Risk Pregnancies:</B> It's estimated that about one out of every four women will experience pregnancy complications this year, sometimes leading to the birth of a premature baby. When babies are born preterm, they have a higher risk for serious health problems. Statistics show that over $5 billion a year is spent 
nationally on neonatal intensive care. One baby born later, instead of earlier, will save thousands of dollars, not to mention the long-term savings of a healthy start in life.<P>

<B>The Statistics:</B> According to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the National 
Center for Health Statistics, of the 3.9 million women bearing babies annually: <P>
* 1,600,000 women will have placentas that form too low in the uterus...17,500 of which will remain too low and necessitate C-sections<BR>
* 350,000 women will go into labor too early<BR>
* 195,000 will come down with viral infections<BR>
* Of the 6.5 million pregnancies concieved in the U.S. a year, almost one third of them will end in miscarriages.
<P>
<B>Symtoms Of Preterm Labor:</B><BR>
Continuous or intermittent menstrual-like cramps<BR>
Pelvic pressure<BR>
Increase or change in vaginal discharge<BR>
Regular uterine contractions or tightening sensation in stomach<BR>
Nagging feeling that something is not right<BR>
Low, dull back pain<BR>
Abdominal cramping, with or without diarrhea
 <P>

<B>The Stress Of Bed Rest:</B> Bed rest is no bed of roses for mothers-to-be. They experience a number of emotions during their pregnancies such as a loss of independence and income, a sense of isolation, feelings of inadequecy and helplessness, guilt and fear for their unborn child.<P>

<B>Sidelines:</B> Sidelines is a national support network with chapters reaching every region in the U.S. Each chapter provides peer counseling through caring, trained volunteers who also experienced a high-risk pregnancy. It was created four years ago by Candace Hurley, a Laguna Beach, CA, mother of two who had 
two high-risk pregnancies. "When I became a high-risk pregnancy patient, I realized there was no such organization," says Hurley.  "I felt extremely hopeless. I didn't think I could get through my pregnancies," she adds, "My doctor linked me up by phone with a woman who had a similiar  experience."  It was this phone 
buddy that motivated Candace to start her support group. "Our goal is to provide support and education to women with complicated pregnancies," she explains.
<P>
<B>Cost:</B> Sidelines' counseling is free to women with high-risk pregnancies. There are, however, nominal charges for its publications and parents' support packets.

Over a million women have received silicone breast implants in the United States.  About 
10% develop complications including leakage, rupture and infection. Some say they 
have also developed other chronic ailments.  Until now, researchers have not been able 
to pinpoint the cause.  In one study however, they're hot on the trail with a new blood 
test.<P>


Merry Grant<BR>
Had Silicone Implants<BR>
<EM>"If you take an iron and you put it on your flesh and you pull it away thats what the pain 
was like and it started moving all over my body."</EM><P>

Toni Butts<BR>
Had Silicone Implants<BR>
<EM>"One part of the right side of my chest went into gangrene. That's how severe. My chest 
was completely black."</EM><P>

Elaine Donnelly<BR>
Had Silicone Implants<BR>
<EM>"We lost our home, we lost our cars."</EM><P>


The common denominator here is silicone breast implants gone bad.  The symptoms are 
endless as are trips to doctors to beg for treatment.  Until now medical research has not 
supported the women's claims.<P>


Elaine Donnelly<BR>
Had Silicone Breast Implants<BR>
<EM>"They thought I had Hodgkins Disease for a while.  And then they said Lupus and then 
they said no we really think it's psychosymatic."</EM><P>



Finally, a new blood test has confirmed that Elaine Donnelly has large amounts of 
silicone in her body. Tulane University researchers have come up with the blood test that 
shows a unique reaction to silicone. It's a reaction different from Lupus, Hodgkins or 
Scleroderma.<P>


Robert Garry, Ph.D.<BR>
Microbiologist<BR>
Tulane Medical School<BR>
New Orleans, LA<BR>
<EM>"So, it's a new disease not one that people have described before."</EM><P>


The test is known as an anti-polymer antibody test or A.P.A. Researchers say it's the 
first time they have hard evidence the symptoms these women feel are a real, 
completely new disease.<P>


Robert Garry, Ph.D.<BR>
<EM>"There's been a lot of controversy about it. I'm hopeful that our work here can sort of 
resolve some of those controversial aspects of it and let people focus in on the real 
disease, that's being caused by these implants."</EM><P>



And for these women, they say the find has not come too soon. Finally, their chronic 
ailments are being recognized as a real disease caused by their silicone implants.  The blood test is available to physicians through Autoimmune Technologies, a private 
company in New Orleans, at a charge of 
$200 dollars.<P>

The pap smear revolutionized the way women are tested for cervical cancer, 
but the test is less than perfect.  In some studies false-negatives have run as 
high as 50%.  Doctors have boosted the test's accuracy with some high-tech 
help. <P>




Critical care nurse Yvonne Johnson knows how devastating cancer can be. not 
only does she witness it at work, Yvonne lives with the knowledge that she's at 
risk of getting the disease.<P>


Yvonne Johnson<BR>
Candidate for Study<BR>
<EM>"I have a long family history of cancer of ovary, breast, lung.  I have yearly 
checkups and I always keep my own information." </EM><P>


This year's checkup included a regular pap smear that got special treatment 
from two new devices; Papnet and Autopap.  Papnet seeks out suspicious 
looking cells.<P>


Bill Tench, M.D.<BR>
Pathologist<BR>
Palomar Hospital<BR>
<EM>"They've actually trained the computer to look for these cells and to do the best  
job that it can."  </EM><P>



Papnet produces 128 highlighted images from each slide. The device also tells 
the pathologist where to find specific cells on a slide and magnifies them for a 
closer look. <P>




Autopap detects cervical cancer cells in a different way.  It scans slides, 
analyzes the cells,  then tells the technician if the cells look suspicious.  In test 
runs, Autopap detected abnormal cells in 75 percent of the slides that were 
previously called normal. <P>


Bill Tench, M.D. <BR>
<EM>"We know that we're never going to reduce the number to zero. But the two 
technologies do provide different information and different answers." </EM><P>




Papnet helped technicians track down abnormal cells on Yvonne's pap smear.  
Neither device will replace the need for technicians, but they will help give 
women like Yvonne more accurate, lifesaving results.<P>



The Autopap system is available at six sites across the country, Papnet is 
available at more than 139 labs. Running a pap smear through Autopap is $20 
plus the cost of the pap smear.<P>

There are about four million people in the United States with Alzheimer's Disease, an incurable, progressive disease that attacks the brain, and impairs reasoning and 
memory.  While researchers work to find a cure, therapists in Maryland are 
experimenting with a kind of new-age therapy to help patients cope with the fear 
and anxiety brought on by this devastating disease. <P>



Miss Elaine Lilly has Alzheimer's Disease.  It has eroded her memory, leaving her 
confused and unable to care for herself.  But in this special room, Miss Lilly's 
therapist helps her escape the confusion. <P>



It's called Snoezelin, a Dutch word which describes a relaxing 
environment that stimulates the senses.  Projected images and columns of bubbles 
wash the room in gentle color.  Aromas like orange and coconut awaken the sense 
of smell and touchable objects like seashells trigger fond memories of long ago.  Snoezelin therapy was first used in Holland to treat children with mental illness.  So far, it appears to benefit  the elderly as well.  Preliminary studies show that 11 out of 12 patients who participated were significantly happier after a Snoezelin session.  Researchers also noted that most 
patients showed an increased interest in their surroundings, and fewer signs of 
fear.<P>


Mary Jo Evans, Director<BR>
Occupational Therapy<BR>
Keswick Care Center<BR>
<EM>"And I see that a lot of people physically relax.  They seem less guarded.  There 
may be more eye contact."</EM><P>


Therapists here hope the Snoezelin Room will reduce the need for certain 
medications.<P>


Mary Jo Evans<BR>
<EM>"It's something we're looking at as being very promising in terms of a non-invasive 
intervention for when an individual is anxious or agitated."</EM><P>



Research into the psychological benefits of Snoezelin continues.   But for now, 
patients like miss Lilly believe this special room is simply a beautiful place to be.  Therapists at Keswick say the Snoezelin Room is used for family visits as well.  Family members of Alzheimer's patients have noticed their parents are more like 
themselves again in the relaxed environment of the special room.<P>

For many people a hospital stay can be frightening.  But imagine how 
apprehensive the hearing-impaired must be when they enter the hospital. 
One hospital is leading the way speaking out to deaf patients.<P>



Six month old Jessica Alvelo is perfect in every way, but bringing her into 
the world frightened her deaf mother Edith...that is until she met Marie 
Pramov.  Marie serves as the ears and voice for hearing-impaired people 
like Edith at a time when they most need them.<P>


Marie Pramov<BR>
Coordinator of Deaf Services<BR>
Cooper Hospital-University <BR>
Medical Center<BR>
Camden, NJ<BR>
<EM>"It would be comparable to one of us traveling to another country and 
becoming ill...being seen by a doctor and not realizing what is wrong, what 
the diagnosis is, what the treatment is going to be.  It makes it very 
frightening."</EM><P>



Marie is rare in today's budget- tight medical world.  She's a full-time deaf 
interpreter on the staff of Cooper Hospital- University Medical Center in 
Camden, New Jersey.  She has a deaf daughter and a nursing 
background.  She helps patients understand the illnesses they have, the 
procedures they will undergo, and the discharge instructions they must 
follow.  An invaluable service to Edith who had a complicated pregnancy 
which resulted in a C-section.<P>


Edith Alvelo<BR>
Deaf Patient<BR>
<EM>"Well this was very hard with the hearing people, I couldn't understand what 
was going on....and I felt like I had to have an interpreter,  that was very 
helpful especially while I was having the problems to have the Cesarean".</EM><P>




Marie says serving as a deaf person's ears helps patients make informed 
decisions, instead of depending on others to make decisions for them.  Most hospitals use freelance interpreters for deaf patients, and they can 
wait several hours even days for a person trained in American sign 
language to answer the call.  <P>

<H4><FONT color="#000080">Spider Danger</H4></FONT>

<STRONG>Danger On Eight Legs:</STRONG>
Many spiders produce venom that they inject into their prey to parlyze and kill.  In the United States, the Black Widow and the Bown Recluse produce venom that's harmful to humans.  The black widow's bite can cause:
<P>
<UL>
<li>Severe pain
<li>Muscle spasms near the bite site
<li>Heavy sweating, cramps
<li>Nausea
<li>Vomiting
<li>Difficulty breathing and a jump in blood pressure.
</UL>
<P>
Symptoms can continue for several days and in rare cases, cause death.  A bite from a brown recluse causes: severe pain, blistering, ulceration and death of tissue surrounding the bite site.
<P>
<STRONG>Fighting the Bite:</STRONG>
There is an antivenin (antidote) for black widow bites, but none for the brown recluse.  Conventional treatment includes painkillers and care of the wound to prevent infection. Because the proteins from the venom can cause death of the tissue surrounding the bite, some cases require cutting away that area and skin grafting.
<P>
<STRONG>An Unconventional Approach:</STRONG>
A study published by the Oklahoma State Medical Association suggested a shocking way to treat bites.  Researchers conducting the study used a stun gun to deliver 45 to 50 volts of electricity to bite sites on 21 patients with confirmed or suspected spider bites.  The study's author, Carl Osborn, M.D., claimed that tissue damage was arrested in every case after just one treatment, and that none of the cases required removal of tissue or skin grafts. According to Donald Kunkel, M.D., medical director of the Samaritan Regional Poison Center in Phoenix, Arizona, other studies have found that the use of electricity to arrest tissue damage did not help and could, in some cases, be dangerous.  He suggests using a suction cup, sold in most camping or sporting goods store, as a safer alternative.  Applying negative suction to the bite area won't extract out the venom, but it will trap it and prevent it from spreading through the body.
<P>
<STRONG>First-Aid Tip:</STRONG>
If you have been bitten or stung by "something" but don't know what, call your nearest poison control center immediately.  They can help identify the bite and determine whether you need to get medical help fast.  If you experience pain soon after being bitten, get to an emergency room.  Doctors advise that you do not cut open a spider bite to remove venom, this may lead to a secondary infection.

It's estimated that eight-million Americans have the brittle bone disease called 
osteoporosis.  Each year, 500-thousand of those people will end up with a spine so 
weak, it actually collapses.  It's called a vertebral fracture and once it happens, little 
can be done to reinforce the already fragile spine.  For years, bed rest and painkillers 
were the only treatment.  But today, doctors are experimenting with a new way to glue 
broken spines back together again.<P>


	

Genevieve Steinchomb loves to watch her son and grandson practice soccer moves.  
Sometimes she even participates a little. Nine months ago, this kind of activity would 
have been impossible, because Genevieve was in a wheelchair.  Osteoporosis had eroded her spine so badly that her vertabrae began to collapse.  Surgery to repair her fragile spine would make matters worse, so she was told nothing could be done.<P>


Genevieve Stinchcomb, Spinal <BR>
Fracture Patient<BR>
<EM>"I was at a point where something had to be done.  I was in severe pain.  I couldn't lift my 
left arm out or lift up or anything without pain."</EM><P>



Then she found out about something new.<P>


Gregg Zoarski, M.D.<BR>
Neuroradiologist<BR>
University of Maryland Medical Center<BR>
Baltimore, MD<BR>
<EM>"The technique that we're using to treat fractures can be performed on an outpatient 
basis, it's relatively easy to perform, it's a safe procedure and it can get patients up and 
mobilized much quicker."</EM><P>



The procedure uses an acrylic epoxy to stabilize the spine without major surgery.  When 
the epoxy is the consistency of toothpaste, doctors inject it into the collapsed vertebra, 
using x-rays to guide them.  Within a few minutes, it becomes rock-hard.  It's light, yet 
strong enough to reinforce the spine, relieving pressure and pain.  The procedure is done 
with a local anesthetic, and patients can be out of the hospital and walking within a day.<P>




It's given people like Genevieve a second chance to stand up and take part in life again.<P>


Genevieve Stinchcomb<BR>
<EM>"I've still got my mind.  I just don't have part of my body.  But now I can get 
around.  I'm glad I had it done." </EM><P>


The medical cement has been used in the past to treat fractured spines, but the 
procedure involved major surgery, general anesthesia and a long stay in the hospital.  By 
injecting the cement into the spine, patients can stay awake during the procedure, and 
since there's much less physical trauma, patients usually can leave the hospital the next 
day.  And as you may have guessed, the injection of cement is a fraction of the cost of 
major surgery.  <P>

Every year 300 thousand Americans seek
help for epilepsy. Many can control
their seizures with medicine, but for
some, drugs don't help. A new option
may work.<P>




Travis started skating just last
summer and he's already in a hockey
league, despite his epilepsy. It's a
battle Travis has fought his whole
life. <P>


Colleen Michell<BR>
Son Has Epilepsy<BR>

<EM>"Like in kindergarten, he would be
scribbling, and he gets very
aggressive, and he would pick up the
table and knock it over."</EM><P>


During his 20 years, Travis has endured
endless drug combinations. He also had
two brain operations to try to re-wire
a key part of his brain.<P>


Richard North, M.D.<BR>
Neurologist<BR>

<EM>"That area fires erratically, and the
cells fire together, not following as
they should. They influence other cells
to follow, and it begins to spread as
more cells become involved into an
epileptic seizure." 
</EM><P>


For the two million epileptics like
Travis who can't be helped with
medicine, neurologists are now testing
an implanted nerve stimulator that
sends electrical messages to the brain.<P>



Richard North, M.D.<BR>
<EM>
"What you're doing is tying up all the
telephone lines so they're busy so the
seizure has no way of spreading." </EM><P>



With periodic fine-tuning, the implant
has worked well for Travis. <P>


Travis Michell<BR>
Has Epilepsy<BR>
<EM>"It works sometimes. They fix it up. It
works a couple months, then they come
back." </EM><P>



Travis may not make it to the National
Hockey League, but his mother says he's
gone a lot farther than she thought he
would. <P>


Collen Michell<BR>

<EM>"He goes to school, he works, he plays
hockey now. He's functioning again. As
long as he can function at a normal
life, that's all I ask for."</EM><P>



The nerve stimulator is already used in
Europe, but it's still being tested in
the U.S.<P>


The nerve stimulator might have a cost
advantage: a lifetime supply of
epilepsy medicine can cost as much as
140 thousand dollars. The implant will
be about six thousand dollars.<P>

Lawrence tells us, <EM>"It makes you aware that you can do
it, if you just will." </EM><P>

Researchers say not using the affected
arm after a stroke is  called "learned
non-use." <P>
 
 
 
Dr. Edward Taub of the University of Alabama Medical Center says,  <EM>"Later on when there's
a slow recovery of function so the
person really could use the arm if he
tried he's already learned not to use
the arm and he doesn't try."</EM><P>
With the sling, 25 of 27 patients
tested  improved their ability to get
around the house.  Until now, stroke
patients had few options.<P>
 
 
 
Dr. Taub tells us, <EM>"As a result
they're discarded on the trash heap of
society not for any lack of caring
simply because there's no technique
available for helping them."</EM><P> 
Stroke patients must have good balance
and some movement in the wrist and
fingers to participate in this therapy.
For Lawrence, the program was a second
chance. <P>

Lawrence Gillespie admits, <EM>"From this I've learned that it will
get easier."</EM><P>

   The technique is still experimental
and researchers say it may be available
in physical rehabilitation departments
within two years.
   In addition to the hospital in
Birmingham, it is also being used at
Emory University School of Medicine in
Atlanta.<BR><A HREF="Stayhealthymain.html">-back-</A></FONT>

Each year a half million Americans suffer a stroke.  For those that survive, 
recovery is a long and tough process.  But a new treatment is making it easier 
and faster for patients to get back on their feet.<P>



Three years ago, Gloria Wickersham's smile vanished after a stroke left her 
paralyzed.  Her love of dancing could only be realized through her dreams.<P>


Gloria Wickersham<BR>
Stroke Patient <BR>
<EM>"It was hard.  It was hard, amazingly.  But I'm a survivor you know."</EM><P>


Gloria was determined.  With the help of a new treatment, she has made a 
remarkable recovery.  <P>


Gloria Wickersham<BR>
<EM>"You can live or you can die and it's as simple as that, you know, and I lived."</EM><P>



Researchers at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center found 
that by combining the use of amphetamines with physical therapy, patients 
recover faster and better. <P>


Delaina Batson, Ph.D.<BR>
Neuroscientist Southwestern Medical Center<BR>
Dallas, Texas<BR>
<EM>"The patients who receive the drug had almost double the recovery on the 
motor scale that we used of those patients who received the placebo."</EM><P>


Treatment begins 30 days after a stroke.  Low doses of Dexedrine are given to 
patients every 4 days for 10 sessions.  Thirty minutes after the drug is given, 
patients start physical therapy. Researchers believe the treatment works by 
stimulating neurochemicals which activate parts of the brain left undamaged 
after the stroke. <P>
  


Gloria was told she would never speak or dance again. She has proved them 
wrong. <P>


Gloria Wickersham<BR>
<EM>"Just one arm is not available but everything else is the same...and my 
dancing has improved dramatically."</EM><P>


Doctors say patients continue to show improvement even after they stop 
taking the drugs.  <P>

<H4><FONT color="#000080">Swallowing Nightmare</H4></FONT><FONT size=2>
We live in a society that places a great emphasis on food.  While eating may 
be something you take for granted, millions of Americans have trouble 
swallowing.  This problem can be so severe, it turns one of life's pleasures into 
a nightmare.<P>



In a society that enjoys food, Debbie Schmidt was once an outsider.  Due to a 
severe swallowing problem, Debbie could not enjoy the simple act of eating.  <P>


Debbie Schmidt<BR>
Swallowing Patient<BR> 

<EM>"When food would get stuck, you felt like you couldn't breathe at all.  Like only 
one - either your esophagus was open or your windpipe.  And in this case, my 
esophagus was just staying open and it wouldn't go down."  </EM><P>



Normally, we chew our food and it travels down our esophagus.  But some 
people have a physical narrowing in the esophagus that causes food to get 
stuck.  Debbie Schmidt's condition was even more complicated.  <P>


Joel Richter, M.D.<BR>
Gastroenterologist<BR>
Cleveland Clinic<BR>
Cleveland, OH<BR>
<EM>"She's got a problem in that the muscle of her esophagus doesn't work, a 
syndrome we call achalasia."</EM><P>


A balloon like this finally brought relief.  Doctors pass it down the esophagus 
and inflate it with just enough pressure to open the tube without doing damage.  <P>


Joel Richter, M.D.<BR>
<EM>"What you're trying to do is stretch that muscle and tear it just enough to open 
it up.  But not so much that you make a hole."  </EM><P>



Barium x-rays show how the stretching procedure worked for Debbie.  Before 
treatment, this white mass of liquid barium sits in Debbie's esophagus 
one, two, even five minutes after she swallows.  After treatment, the liquid 
flows through the esophagus easily and disappears like normal.  For Debbie, 
successful treatment means once again enjoying one of life's biggest 
pleasures.  <P>



Besides balloon treatments for muscle damage in the esophagus, doctors at 
the Cleveland Clinic are trying a new therapy which involves injections of a 
watered down poison called botulinum.<P>

If you suffer from warts, chances are you've tried everything from freezing 
to burning them off.  Both therapies can be painful and unfortunately, don't 
always work. Now some people are using the power of the mind to ward off 
warts. <P>



Twelve-year-old Jake Woodford has waged war on the virus that caused 35 
warts to grow on his hands.  His weapon...hypnosis.  Several months ago, Jake's hands were covered with warts.  But with a daily dose of hypnosis, the warts have disappeared.  <P>


Jake Woodford <BR>
Suffers from Warts<BR>

<EM>"You've just got to take five minutes away from your time, just sit down in a 
quiet place anywhere actually, just as long as you can concentrate, and 
that's it."</EM><P>  



At the University of Massachusetts Medical Center in Worcester, 
Massachusetts, Doctor Martin Young teaches patients the art of self-
hypnosis. <P>


Martin Young, Ph.D.  <BR>
Child Psychologist <BR>
U. Mass. Medical Center<BR>
Worcester, MA <BR>
<EM>"If we allow or train an individual to relax the muscles in their body, they 
tend to be able to focus or concentrate greater on their thoughts and 
feelings and then change physiology and internal functioning more."</EM><P>  



Through hypnosis, patients are able to lower their skin temperature.  A 
thermometer placed on Jake's finger shows his hands are indeed getting 
colder.  <P>


Martin Young, Ph.D.   <BR>

<EM>"If you create cold, you decrease the blood flow, then potentially, we are 
starving the virus that causes the wart."  </EM><P>



Patients are also encouraged to ask their body's immune system to attack 
the wart virus.  No one knows exactly how these techniques work.   But for 
half of all patients whose warts resist traditional therapies, the power of the 
mind has proved to be an amazing cure. <P>



Doctor Young says patients who practice self-hypnosis every day for three 
weeks to three months see results.  He warns against using a "hypnotist" 
for treating warts and suggests people see a licensed healthcare 
professional who is trained in hypnosis.<P>

<H4><FONT color="#000080">Thyroid Underactivity</H4></FONT><FONT size=2>
Jamie Kofler has a bounce in her walk
and a smile on her face.  These days
anyway.<P>



Jamie Kofler tells us, <EM>"About a year ago I just wasn't
feeling as much energy as I normally would."</EM><P>


And at the young age of 25, it was
interfering with her life.<P>

<EM> "I wasn't physically as active in
sports, slept alot more, more of a
homebody than normally, so resting was a priority."</EM><P>

But there was nothing specific Jamie
could point to until she went to
Scripps Clinic for her annual
physical.  Her doctor found a swelling
in her neck, did some tests, and
told her she had hypothyroidism, an
underactive thyroid gland.<P>

Endocrinologist Dr. George E.
Dailey says, <EM>"It's pretty tricky because of
insidious nature. Thyroid underactivity
typically develops slowly over months and years.  Fortunately, we can completely
replace the function of the thyroid
with a tablet, so it makes it one of
the easiest things to treat in
medicine."</EM><P>
 
The most common symptoms are muscle
cramping, weight gain, constipation,
cold intolerances, for underactivity.
The opposite for overactivity, lose
weight, diarrhea and the intolerance to heat.<P>


Other symptoms include sleepiness and
fatigue, memory loss, dry, coarse skin,
depression and hair loss.<P>

A simple blood test confirmed Jamie's
diagnosis and a simple tablet of
synthetic thyroid hormone every day has
relieved her symptoms with no side
affects.<P>


   Thyroid problems affect 10 percent
of women over 50.
   But men and younger people can also
be affected.<P>
   Thyroid underactivity is more common
than overactivity. 
   Left untreated, an underactive
thyroid can increase your risk of heart
disease and aggravate depression.    <P>  
   Often, diagnosis of a thyroid
problem can rule out
depression, eliminating the need for
anti-depressant medication.<P>
<P> 

   However, if you're feeling lousy and
it's not your thyroid, maybe it is
depression. 
   Depression is on the rise among
women.<BR><A HREF="Stayhealthymain.html">-back-</A></FONT>

Brian Woods is on his way to the dentist with what looks like a strange brace on his hand. It's a device to help his mouth. Despite his best intentions, Brian couldn't stop sucking his thumb.<P>

<EM>"I kept on promising my parents that I'm going to stop, I'm going to stop."</EM><P>

Brian's mother, Bonnie,  told us, "But as he got older, it became a constant feature. His thumb was in his mouth all the time." <P>

They tried everything including coating his thumb in salt, pepper and vinegar. They even wrapped in it socks and tape.  Nothing worked until they tried the aluminum thumbs out device.<P> 
 
Bonnie described the brace: <EM>"It's metal, it's cold. It's not comforting."</EM><P>

The inventor, Monte Pettiet, spent three years and several thousand dollars developing it.<P>

He said, <EM>"I haven't heard of a situation yet where I've heard of a child putting it in their mouth at any time. It's just not something they want to put in there." </EM><P>

Dentists say prolonged thumb-sucking can cause the mouth and teeth to form incorrectly. It can also lead to ridicule by friends and family. Brian stopped sucking his thumb in less than eight weeks with the device.<BR><A HREF="Stayhealthymain.html">-back-</A></FONT>

If you go to the hospital with chest
pains, you could be having a heart
attack. Then again, you could just have
a bad case of indigestion. It's often
up to emergency room doctors to decide.<P>

Dr. John Drstvensek, an Emergency Room Physician and Medical Director of the Emergency Department 
of Grant Medical Center in Columbus, Ohio, says,
<EM>"Chest pains in the emergency
department is our number one chief
complaint."</EM><P>


Dr. Drstvensek tells us, <EM>"Everyone that
presents to an emergency department
with chest pain fortunately does not
have heart disease. And that's our job
to sort out."</EM><P>
Even with modern day medical
technology, it could take doctors
anywhere from six  hours to several
days to diagnose a heart attack. But
not anymore, thanks to a blood test
using a new biochemical marker called
Troponin-I.<P>

Dr. Dorothy Lordo, a Researcher and Technical Director of Laboratories
Grant Medical Center says, <EM>"Troponin-I is a contractual protein
that's only found in heart muscle. So
when we monitor its presence in blood,
it does indicate that it's coming from
the heart and not another source."</EM><P>

Once blood is drawn, lab technicians
analyze it using the new marker. In as
little as 20 minutes, doctors know
whether the patient's having a heart
attack.<P>

According to Dr. Drstvensek, <EM>"It will
allow us more quickly and more readily
to diagnose more subtle cases of
coronary artery disease or heart
disease." </EM><P>
Dr.  Drstvensek says
the new marker will not only give heart
patients peace of mind, but may also
save their lives.<BR><A HREF="Stayhealthymain.html">-back-</A></FONT>

<H4><FONT color="#000080">Umbilical Cord Blood</H4></FONT><FONT size=2>

   Doctors have known for decades that
the left over blood in the umbilical
cord is rich with cells.
   However, when bone marrow
transplants were perfected for treating
cancer, the technology was pushed aside.
  However, today there is a dramatic
shortage of bone marrow.
  To fill the gap, doctors have
rediscovered cord blood.<P>
  A company called the Cord Blood
Registry has made it easy to preserve
this life saving fluid.
   To do it, you simply take a
collection kit along with you when you
give birth.
   After the blessed event, your doctor
gathers the blood and you ship it
overnight to the Registry.<P>
<EM>"As long as we get it within
38 hours and there's no damage to it.
So you ship it to us by one of the
overnight delivery companies. We will
process it, evaluate it and then freeze
it and store it at the blood bank at
The University of Arizona."</EM><P>

   You can bank the blood cells for the
life of your child to fight a variety
of cancer.<P>
<EM>
"It is a perfect match with
the baby of course, because it's their
blood. However, due to the fact that it
needs less than perfect matching for it
to work, which is different than bone
marrow, its use by other members is
greatly improved. Not only does it work
as well as bone marrow, from a clinical
stand point, but there are fewer side
effects after the transplant when using
cord blood as compared to bone marrow."</EM><P>

    Dr. Stephen Horowitz and his wife
Melinda, who's a nurse, were aware of
cord blood.
  When they found out about the
Registry they wanted to be pioneers of
this technology for their soon to be
born child.<P>
Dr. David Horowitz says,
<EM>
 "I would have a little
sensation of safety in my own heart
that I would be able to help the child
survive because I put something away
for the future."</EM><P>

 Melinda Horowitz tells us,
<EM>"It's such a broad spectrum
chance of curing so many different
diseases. You'd like to think your kid
is never going to have any problems,
but with everything that's out there
now days you have to kind of think  the chances are more than likely
they might potentially have a problem
later in life.   And this will always be
there for kids."</EM><BR><A HREF="Stayhealthymain.html">-back-</A></FONT>

Have you ever felt unsteady and lightheaded for no apparent reason? 
You could be experiencing vertigo. It's a common disorder affecting 20-
percent of the population. Researchers have come up with some simple 
exercises to cure the dizziness.<P>

A year ago, Carla Sutherland would not have made it  across this plank.  
Even the swings would make her dizzy.<P>


Carla Sutherland<BR>
Suffers vertigo<BR>
<EM>"Usually what will happen is that everything will start swirling and 
swirling and a lot of times unless I have somebody there I just fall 
down."</EM><P>

Carla suffers from chronic vertigo, or dizzy spells that strike without 
warning.  It's often caused by an inner ear disorder .
But for Carla and millions of other vertigo sufferers,  relief is in sight.  
According to researchers at Baylor College of Medicine, a few simple 
head exercises can cure the dizziness.
<P>

The idea is to move so fast, you make yourself dizzy.
Researchers say the exercises work by tricking the brain into thinking 
the dizziness is normal and to just ignore it.
<P>

Helen Cohen, Ed.D.<BR>
Occupational Therapist<BR>
Baylor College of Medicine, Houston<BR> 
<EM>"The treatment alleviates the vertigo and in doing so makes it possible 
for them to go back to driving their car, taking care of the kids, getting 
dressed, doing all the little routine activities of daily living."</EM><P>



The home exercise program should be done daily.  Researchers say 
patients can see results within a month.
The program has put Carla back on her feet.
<P>

Carla Sutherland
<BR>

<EM>"The other day it started to happen, and I started doing the exercises as 
soon as I felt it coming and it stopped.  I wish that I'd found them a lot 
sooner."</EM>
<P>


Head trauma,  viral infections or even high doses of certain antibiotics

The American Medical Association estimates that one in every 200 people 
will develop Parkinson's Disease, a disorder that affects movement, 
speech and swallowing.  There is no cure, but a new video game created 
by  Arizona researchers can detect the disease before symptoms appear. 
Early detection can help battle the disease.<P>

What seems like light hearted fun is actually serious business for Chris 
Tisch.  The speed of her wrist movement can tell researchers if she's 
developing Parkinson's Disease.<P>


Erwin Montgomery, M.D. <BR>
Neurologist, University of Arizona<BR>
<EM>"In Parkinson's disease these patients move the same regardless of 
which  kind of task which kind of target they have to move to. And it's 
actually that difference in their velocity that is the best factor in identifying 
the Parkinson's patient."</EM><P>

Richard Brown had Parkinson's Disease for over a year before it was 
diagnosed ten years ago. If it had been caught  earlier, drug therapy 
might have calmed Richard's  tremors and made swallowing less difficult.  
Richard believes the video test can give others the fighting chance he 
never had.<P>


Richard Brown<BR>
Parkinson's patient<BR>
"They're non-invasive and they're harmless tests and if it showed early 
onset of the disease I think it would be well for them to know it."<P>




The sense of smell often disappears in a Parkinson's patient.  A scratch 
and sniff test can detect the disease 80 percent of the time.  When the 
video game was added, the accuracy for detecting Parkinson's Disease 
rose to over  90 percent.<P>


Erwin Montgomery, M.D.<BR>


<EM>"So the combination of them really gives us a lot more power in terms of 
identifying a person with Parkinson's disease and a lot more accuracy."</EM><P>




Chris sailed through the tests, but her family history of Parkinson's will 
always put her at higher risk.  Dr. Montgomery hopes that one day the 
video game will become as routine during annual physicals as 
mammograms and cholesterol readings.<P>



Dr. Montgomery wants to test the game on more healthy individuals 
before he makes it available to the public. Then he estimates the cost for 
the series of tests will be about fifty dollars.<P>

Most of us think of virtual reality as a game.  But for the doctors of tomorrow, 
virtual reality is changing the way they learn.<P>



Dr. Giora Hahn learns how to do an anesthetic block.  This procedure is difficult, and dangerous, because the anesthesiologist must move his needle within millimeters of the aorta.<P>


Giora Hahn, M.D.<BR>
Anesthesiologist<BR>
University of Colorado, Denver<BR>
<EM>"This is no walk through the park."</EM><P>


Dr. Hahn is learning in a virtual reality lab.  His patient is plastic.  A robotic arm 
attached to a computer simulates muscle and bone and even lets Dr. Hahn feel 
a heart beat as the needle comes close to the aorta.<P>


Kenneth Niejadlik. M.D.<BR>
Anesthesiologist<BR>
University of Colorado, Denver<BR>
<EM>"As in a flight simulator, you can crash and burn with this dummy.  We do have 
the complications built in, but at the end of the day, you walk out of the lab, 
have a cup of coffee, and discuss what your problems were, unlike an actual 
patient, where you have a much more serious aftermath."  </EM><P>




This surgical simulator uses data from a real cadaver.  The cadaver was cut 
into slices a millimeter thick and digitally photographed.<P>


Victor Spitzer, Ph.D.<BR>
Biologist<BR>
University of Colorado, Denver<BR>
<EM>"It's data that we can interact with.  We can see the interior of what we're made 
up of.  Well, you can see that in a cadaver.  But we can interact with it.  We can 
touch it, we can feel it, we can cut on it.  This isn't quite yet what you would do if 
you were taking it apart as a cadaver with a scalpel, but that can come."</EM><P>



Medical professors say they've come a long way from teaching anatomy on 
plastic skeletons.  Technology will help give the doctors of the future better 
training than ever before.  Scientists at the University of Colorado have created a visible man and a visible 
woman.  You can travel through both on C-D ROM or the Internet at

Macular Degeneration is the leading cause of legal blindness in people over the 
age of 50.  Reading, driving and even recognizing a familiar face become 
impossible as the disease progresses.  The most common therapy, laser 
surgery, only works in about half the patients.  But now, a new experimental 
treatment aims to stop the disease in its tracks.  <P>



Charles King can barely read the first three lines on this eye chart.  He suffers 
from age-related macular degeneration.<P>


Charles King<BR>
Patient<BR>
<EM>"As it advances, you can't read. You just can't put the letters together to make the 
words up and follow the sentences."</EM><P>

King has the kind of macular degeneration where abnormal blood vessels grow 
under the retina.  Eventually, they bleed, leak fluid and cause vision loss.<P>


Joan Miller, M.D.<BR>
Massachusetts Eye & Ear Infirmary<BR>
Opthalmologist<BR>
Boston, MA<BR>
<EM>"The retina is the film in the eye, sort of like the film in the camera, that lines the 
back of the eye.  And the macula is really a small part of the retina but it's the 
part that's designed to give you fine resolution to see things in detail.  And 
macular degeneration affects that part of the retina."</EM><P>



Laser surgery is the most common treatment but it doesn't always work.  So 
doctors in Boston are testing a new technique called photodynamic therapy.<P>


Joan Miller, M.D. <BR>
<EM>"What we're trying to do is make the laser more selective.  To come up with 
something that just damages the abnormal blood vessels and leaves the film 
intact."</EM><P>



To do that, a chemical dye called "P.B.D." is injected into a patient's vein.  The 
dye collects only in the abnormal blood vessels and is activated when the light 
from a laser is shined into the eye.  The dye then selectively damages the walls of 
the abnormal vessels.<P>


Joan Miller, M.D. <BR>
<EM>"If we could just stabilize people early in the disease with reasonable vision, that 
would be a major advantage over where we stand now."</EM><P>



Charles King will be followed for several months to measure the safety of the drug 
and to see whether the abnormal blood vessels in his left eye can be closed off 
and destroyed for good.<P>



This is by no means a cure for age-related macular degeneration.  The goal of 
this treatment is to stop the disease from getting worse, not to restore vision 
loss.  <P>

   The man we spoke with wants to remain
anonymous so we'll call him Joe. 
   He suffers from severe depression
which has lead to other problems.<P>
<EM>"I was having a very bad
time with my self. I was unable to make
decision. I was unable take care of
myself and I became very, very
psychotic."</EM><P> 

   Joe needed to be institutionalized.
   But instead of being admitted into a
mental health hosptial he came to a different sort of treatment
facility - Vista Balboa.<P>
   It's a converted historic house
across from Balboa Park which provides
a home like setting for the course of
treatment.<P>
  
<EM>  "Clients here, as they
become more stable, are involved in
helping run the house. They help with
preparing the meals, help with the
shopping. As they become more
stabilized we have higher expectations
of them to engage in all the normal
kinds of activities as if your were
living in a house."</EM><P>

   Without the expensive overhead of a
hosptial building,  the Vista Balboa
program costs less than half of a
hospital stay.<P>

Dr. Hobie Hawthorne of Vista
Balboa says, 
<EM>"Before the institution of
these programs we had basically in
patient hospitalization and out
patients treatment programs and there
was really nothing in between or
nothing that served as an alternative
to the hospital. This type of facility
gives the physician yet another choice
in their trying to figure out what is
the best treatment of the client."</EM><P>

  Residents at Vista Balboa are here
voluntarily.
  During the 12 day stay they are
treated for all types of mental
illness.<P>

   Residents undergo the same kind of
therapy and modes of treatment as they
would in a hospital.
   However, the whole experience is 
geared toward being cost effective.<P>

<EM>"We try to help the client
achieve their highest level of
functioning in the shortest amount of
time."</EM><P>

That philosophy seems to have worked
<P>for Joe.


 
He tells us, <EM>"I sleep well at night. I'm
actually looking forward to getting up
these days."</EM><BR><A HREF="Stayhealthymain.html">-back-</A></FONT>

<B>Diabetes Facts: </B> Sixteen million people in the United States have diabetes.  Its a serious disease that affects the bodys ability to produce or properly respond to insulin, a hormone that is needed to convert sugar, starches and other food into energy.  The cause of diabetes is a mystery, although both genetics and environmental factors such as obesity and lack of exercise appear to play roles.  There are two major types of diabetes: <P>
	
	*Insulin-Dependent (type I):  An auto-immune disease in which the body does not produce any insulin. This most often occurs in children and young adults.  People with type I diabetes must take daily insulin injections to stay alive.  
	<P>
	*Non-Insulin-Dependent (type II):  A metabolic disorder resulting from the bodys inability to  make enough, or properly use insulin.  It is the most common form of the disease.  Type II diabetes accounts for 90 to 95 percent of diabetics.
<P>
<B>Victories For Vitamin E:</B>  Diabetics face an increased risk of atherosclerosis, a condition in which arteries become clogged with fatty deposits.  According to researchers at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas, the increased risk of atherosclerosis may be curbed with high doses of vitamin E.  Numerous studies have shown that vitamin E, an antioxidant, can reduce susceptibility to heart disease in nondiabetic patients by inhibiting the oxidation of low density 
lipoprotein (LDL), the bad cholesterol.  This oxidative process is believed to lead to atherosclerosis, as it speeds up the development of plaque in the arteries. Few studies have dealt with diabetic patients until now.  Twenty-eight men and women with insulin-dependent diabetes (type I) and non-insulin-dependent diabetes (type II) participated in the study.  Some received a placebo, others, 1,200 milligrams of vitamin E.  The trial lasted for eight weeks. Researchers found the group taking vitamin E showed a 40 to 45 percent reduction in LDL oxidation.
<P>
<B>Any Side: </B> For people taking blood thinners, doctors recommend caution in using high doses of vitamin E. There is a possibility of increasing the bleeding tendency by taking more than 1,000 milligrams a day. 
<P>
<B>Recommended Dosage:</B> The Recommended Dietary Allowance of vitamin E is just 10 milligrams. But for diabetics with heart disease, doctors say its a good idea to take 400 milligrams of vitamin E each day.

Running is one of America's favorite sports, but pounding the pavement 
can take its toll. As you're about to find out, physical therapists now 
have an innovative way to look inside the foot and spot trouble before it 
starts.   You put plenty of pressure on your feet just walking around.  Running is 
even more stressful.<P>


Melissa Hatley<BR>
Physical Therapist<BR>
Mayo Clinic<BR>
Scottsdale, AZ<BR>
<EM>"In walking it's about one time your body  weight, and running, it's two-
and-a-half to three times your body weight going through your feet, 
knees and back."
</EM><P>


That kind of pressure, plus an old injury to her left foot was giving Becky 
Puetz more pain than pleasure during her daily run.<P>


Becky Puetz<BR>
Runner<BR>
<EM>"I did have some discomfort in the arch, in the foot, in my shin and 
things like that."</EM><P>




Ignoring pain can lead to irreversible damage to the back, feet or knees.  
This paper thin shoe insert is part of a device called an F-scan.  It uses 
3-D imaging to reveal foot problems.  The two-hour evaluation gives therapists the information they need to 
help the runner get back on track.<P>


Melissa Hatley<BR>
<EM>"We can counsel them on running technique, counsel them in different 
shoe wear, placing an orthotic in their shoe, different exercises or 
stretches they would benefit from."</EM><P>


Becky's evaluation called for custom shoe inserts and stretching 
exercises. Now she's running pain free.<P>


The F-scan can also be used to diagnose foot injuries and spot 
developing sores in the feet of diabetics.  The $250 evaluation is 
covered by most insurance companies.<P>

Remember when your mom told you to wash the dirt off your veggies 
before you eat them. Now researchers say, she might have only been 
warning you about half the danger.  Almost everyone knows that you're supposed to wash your vegetables 
before you eat them, but it's not just to get rid of loose dirt and grime. 
It's also for the things you can't see.<P>


Chris Smith<BR>
Grocer<BR>
<EM>"You definitely need to wash it.  Best thing to do is wash it.  Make sure 
you get all the excess dirt off or something we missed."</EM><P>



That something could have to do with the origin of your favorite fruits. 
Fruits like peaches, pears and plums could be shipped in from countries 
where the safety standards aren't equal to those in the U.S.<P>


Doug Paone, M.D.<BR>
Menorah  Medical Center<BR>
Shawnee Mission, KS<BR>
<EM>"The FDA has actually done studies on certain vegetables and found 
up to 17 different biological substances on one specific item.  Any kind 
of soft vegetables where there's nooks and crannies where some of 
these pesticides can hide down there.  Just take a look at lettuce and 
that's all it is, is nooks and crannies."</EM><P>



The top 5 produce with high pesticides levels are: strawberries, bell 
peppers, spinach, cherries, and peaches.<P>


Doug Paone, M.D.<BR>
<EM>"If you just do a good job of rinsing, and I don't know if you need to take 
steel wool and brush it, but do a good job of rinsing off the vegetables, 
take your time, and do a good job.  When you really think you've don't a 
really good job, that's what the FDA really recommends too."</EM><P>



It may be impossible to scrub off every single particle of pesticide but 
washing your fruits and veggies could lead to healthier eating habits.
One way to reduce the chance of ingesting produce laced with 
pesticides, is to buy organically grown fruits and vegetables.<P>

When you head to the sink for a drink of water, do you  think about what's in your 
glass?  Probably not.  But recently, a dangerous parasite has been found in drinking 
water around the country.  One outbreak caused over 
400,000 people to become ill and led to the deaths of more than 100 people living with 
aids or HIV.  One AIDS advocacy group calls this parasite a major public health threat, 
because it continues to slip through water treatment plants and into your home.<P>



This refreshing glass of cold water looks crystal clear, but a high-powered microscope 
might reveal these living in your drink.  They're spores from a kind of parasite called 
cryptosporidium.<P>


Thaddeus Graczyk, Ph.D.<BR>
Public Health Researcher<BR>
Johns Hopkins School of Public Health<BR>
Baltimore, MD<P>
<EM>"There are eight species of crytposporidium.  Only one of those eight species is 
infectious to humans.  This is cryptosporidium parvum."</EM><P>


Cryptosporidium parvum is called C-parvum for short.   The spores they produce are so tiny, 
two-thousand of them could fit on the head of a pin.   But if you happen to get a mouthful 
of them in your drinking water, you could end up with severe diarrhea, abdominal pain, 
fever and fatigue.  For people with weakened immune systems, C-parvum could be a 
death sentence.<P>



The trouble starts with cows.  If their feces contain C-parvum spores, rain will wash the 
parasite into the water supply. The microscopic spores can slip through water treatment 
plants, undetected.  But researchers have found that an enzyme immunoassay, or 
E.I.A. test is much more effective than current water tests.  It's accurate, easy and fast.  A positive reaction shows up as two blue dots.  Currently, this test is not yet available to water treatment plants.  But if you're 
concerned about the safety of your water supply, you can take precautions at home.<P>


Thaddeus Graczk, Ph.D.<BR>
<EM>"The best thing to do is to boil your water for at least one minute."</EM><P>


Bottled water is another option for keeping your body healthy and your water truly 
crystal clear.  Dr. Graczyk stresses that there are eight species of cryptosporidium and only one, C-parvum, is dangerous to humans.  Children under age five and people with weakened 
immune systems are most at risk. Current tests can not distinguish between the 
harmless types and the harmful one. The E.I.A. test does the best job, but it needs to 
be modified before it can be used by water treatment plants.  He adds that once 
detected, C-parvum can be killed if the water supply is exposed to disinfectants like 
chlorine.<P>

<B>Starving to Death:</B> One out of every 100 teenage girls is diagnosed with anorexia nervosa. Anorexia is the pursuit of thinness by starving one's self to death. Anorexia is generally considered a 
psychiatric disorder in which the person tries to find control and get a sense of identity.  Many young girls and teens with this condition struggle to make themselves "perfect" physically, and usually have 
tremendously high expectations of themselves and how they should look.  <P>

<B>Anorexia and Bulemia:</B> The classic characteristic of this disorder is how the body reduces from not eating meals.  Food is severely restricted, and the whole pattern of eating becomes bizarre in most cases.  Following extended periods of starvation, some anorexics gorge themselves, then use induced vomiting or take laxatives to purge themselves. This condition is known as bulimia.  
<P>
Warning Signs of Anorexia:<BR>
*restriction of food intake<BR>
*bizarre, ritualistic, or superstitious behavior associated with food or animals<BR>
*social withdrawal from friends<BR>
*moody, irritable behavior<BR>
*menstruation flow stops
<P>

<B>What Happens to the Mind and Body</B>: Many anorexics say dieting and getting positive feedback that comes from weight loss, can sometimes send people down the spiral of denial which can 
lead to anorexia. In some cases, anorexics lose sight of what a healthy or attractive body weight should be, and work towards losing more and more weight.  Psychologically, anorexics often suffer from obsessive-compulsive behavior, social isolation, anxiety, a revulsion towards fat and compulsive, excessive exercising.

<H4><FONT color="#000080">A Winning Diet</H4></FONT><FONT size=2>
<B>Fueling An Athlete's Body:</B>
Athletic activity of any kind can take a lot out of a person's body  nutritionally.  Along with burning calories, the body also loses minerals through perspiration.  Registered dietitian Heidi Allison of Columbia Healthcare in Phoenix, Arizona, says eating a variety of foods from the five food groups can give you a good start. She suggests that athletes should focus on getting plenty of complex carbohydrates.  They are found in grains, pastas, breads, cereals and rice.  Vegetables like broccoli, carrots and cabbage are good sources of Vitamins A and C, which promote healing (important for those potential sports injuries).  Bananas are a good source of potassium that's often lost through perspiration, and oranges are loaded with Vitamin C, helpful in easing sore muscles.
<P>
<B>Nutrition No-Nos:</B>
Athletes are naturally adventurous and competitive, so they are willing to try anything that gives them the winning edge. But some of these practices can be dangerous. 
<BR>
- Drinking raw eggs can leave you susceptible to salmonella poisoning.  Allison says raw eggs also contain a toxin called avidin.  It binds to the B-Vitamins in the blood and could cause a Vitamin B deficiency. A better protein choice: low fat cuts of meat and poultry.
<BR>
- Eating a candy bar before competition won't  give you an energy boost,  just the opposite. It raises your blood sugar level very fast and triggers an insulin surge. When you have high levels of insulin in your blood, you feel fatigued. A better energy booster: crackers or pretzels.
<BR>
- Caffeine can give you a boost, but there's a downside. Caffeine is a diuretic, which means you'll lose precious body fluids needed during physical activity. Limit coffee, tea and caffeinated soft drinks before and during competition. A better fluid:  water or sports drinks.
 <BR>
- Trail mixes are handy and tasty, but they are also loaded with fat and sugar. A better 
sports snack: an orange or banana.
<BR>
- Power Bars or Energy Bars are high in complex carbohydrates, but some are also high 
in sugar. Be sure to read the labels.
<P>
<B>When To Fuel Up:</B>
When to eat is as important as what to eat.  Allison suggests eating a light meal like a bowl of spaghetti with tomato sauce about two hours before a competition. To keep 
yourself from getting dehydrated, drink 16 ounces of water one hour before competition, then again 15 minutes before.  Keep a sports drink handy during competition, especially if you plan on an activity that will last more than one hour.

Vitamin C isn't just for treating the common cold anymore.  Now it can help 
improve your skin and take years off your looks.<P>

Mel Elson, M.D.<BR>
Dermatologist<BR>
<EM>"It works, that's different from a lot of things on the market."</EM><P>



The product is Cellex-C, the latest anti-aging treatment. It's an 
anti-oxidant cream that contains the highest concentration of Vitamin C.  Dermatologists say it reduces the effects of aging as effectively as Retin-A. 
What do users say?<P>


Janet Rutledge<BR>
Vitamin C User<BR>
<EM>"I could tell a difference in the texture of my skin within a 10-day period."</EM><P>



Eighty percent of skin aging comes from exposure to the sun, pollution and 
smoke. Retin-A and alpha hydroxy acids reverse wrinkling by peeling away the 
skin's outer layers. But Duke Medical Center researchers know how to get 
Vitamin C deep into the skin to stop damage.<P>


Sheldon Pinnell, M.D.<BR>
Dermatologist<BR>
Duke Univ. Medical Cntr.<BR>
<EM>"What we have found is a way to get large amounts of Vitamin C into the skin. 
A formulation trick....20 to 40 times what you can get by oral ingestion."</EM><P>


Protection is important in combatting the sun. U.V.A. rays cause sunburn and 
stimulate tanning.  U.V.A. rays attack the collagen and connective tissue under 
the skin. Duke Medical Center studies show that Vitamin C encourages new 
collagen growth.<P>


Mel Elson, M.D.<BR>
<EM>"So instead of just torturing the skin with acids, we are nourishing the skin with 
vitamins. And this, I think is the first big, first big breakthrough."</EM><P>



Dr. Elson says other skin care products can complement Vitamin C, and he 
recommends patients ask their dermatologists about them.<P>




Although Duke holds the formula patent, the product is being marketed as 
Cellex-C by a Canadian company. One bottle costs about $75 and lasts 3-4 
months. It's available through physicians and licensed skin care professionals.<P>

Every year, 1,400 American women are paralyzed, confined to a wheelchair 
for part or all of their life. One of the many challenges those women face is 
finding good healthcare.  Now there's a place where disabled women can visit 
the doctor without having to feel uncomfortable.<P>


For Judy Panko Reis every day is a challenge.  She was a victim of a brutal 
crime. <P>

Judy Panko Reis<BR>
Disabled Woman<BR>
<EM>"I was with my then fianc and we were in a state park camping and we were 
criminally assaulted in the middle of the night." </EM><P>


He was murdered and she was left for dead with a crushed skull. Years later 
she married and decided to start a family.  That was another challenge.  <P>

Judy Panko Reis<BR>
<EM>"I had never really talked to anybody that had a disability like mine that could 
advise me or guide me on how to change a diaper with one hand, or bathe an 
infant with one hand."</EM><P> 


She turned to a place where she felt more comfortable.  The Rehabilitation 
Institute of Chicago and Health Resource Center for Women with Disabilities 
offers support and friendship.  They also have a specially-designed chair. <P>


Mary Beth Gahan was born with cerebral palsy.  For her, a gynecological 
exam on a regular table was impossible.  She went for years without a check-
up.   Disabled women have heard some amazing things.<P> 

Kristi Kirschner, M.D.<BR>
Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago<BR>
<EM>"All you have to do us stand for a couple of seconds and we can get your 
mammogram. For a woman who is paralyzed, who uses a wheelchair, it's just 
simply physically not possible."</EM><P>


Dr. Kirschner says this center is one where disabled women will always be 
respected and treated with dignity.  <P>


Dr. Kirschner says it is a slow movement to get accessible healthcare for 
disabled women.  One reason is because only 20% of spinal cord injuries are 
in women.  The Health Resource Center plans to develop a program targeting 
disabled teenage girls, another lost minority according to Dr. Kirschner.<P>

At any given time, an estimated 160,000 Americans are on dialysis because 
of kidney failure.  Doctors are now  finding that a lot of them could have  
been spared dialysis by early detection and intervention.  Just as doctors 
can prevent heart attacks, they can do the same for kidney disease. <P>



Most of us know the danger of plaque build-up in our coronary arteries.  But 
you may be surprised to learn the same thing can happen in your renal 
arteries, the arteries of the kidneys. <P>


Andrew  Novick,  M.D.<BR>
Kidney Surgeon <BR>
Cleveland Clinic<BR>
Cleveland, OH<BR>
<EM>"And if the vessel becomes completely obstructed, so that no blood is 
passing to the organ through the vessel, the organ will die.  And death of 
the kidney in that context is analogous to a heart attack." </EM><P>



John Kennedy had already lost one kidney to renal artery disease when 
the problem struck again. <P>


John Kennedy <BR>
Kidney Patient<BR>
<EM>"We knew there was a very short window wherein we had to do something 
or I was going to lose that kidney also.  Because the first one I guess was 
lost in 24 to 48 hours."
</EM><P>


To save John's remaining kidney, surgeons at the Cleveland Clinic turned 
to a highly sophisticated technique called "bench surgery."   Picture the 
classic "old workbench" where talented hands mold wonderful creations 
and make needed repairs.<P>



Surgeons apply the same approach to the human body.  They remove the 
kidney, re-route the blood supply at the workbench, then transplant it back 
into the patient.  The procedure allows doctors to work on smaller blood 
vessels they would otherwise not be able to  reach. Bench surgery freed 
John Kennedy from being dependent on dialysis or undergoing a kidney 
transplant.  <P>


John Kennedy<BR>
<EM>"It's allowed me to have a very normal life.  I do not do anything any 
differently than I do when I had two fully functioning kidneys." </EM><P>



One thing renal artery disease patients do have to do is watch what they 
eat.  Just like people with heart disease, they have to follow a low-salt, low-
fat diet and keep close tabs on their blood pressure.<P>

Love scenes steam up our television almost
every night. Fitness experts say couch
potatoes can bring that intimacy into
their own lives too. <P>
 
 
Personal Trainer Penny Price says,

<EM> "When you start exercising, your
testosterone level goes up for men and women, so naturally
your sex drive is going to be
increased."</EM><P>

For Sharyn Trapp, fitness is essential.
She credits exercise for her satisfying
private life:  <EM>"So I feel better about sharing myself
in any way, certainly in an intimate
way." </EM><P>

Mark Simmons has been training with
Penny Price for 10 months and according to Penny, <EM>"Mark comes in, and he tells me how
his wife loves his body, loves his rear
end, and how she likes the changes that
have occurred in him during the
workout."</EM><P>

Mark tells us,

<EM> "It's like using a skiing analogy.
It's like going from the blue slopes to
the black slopes. It's just picked up
the intensity a little bit." </EM><P>

Experts say exercise improves all the
ingredients for passion: it boosts
self-esteem, increases strength and
endurance and gets people more aware of
their bodies. <P>
 Penny says, <EM>"There are no specific
exercises that are going to make you
sexy, but the overall thing, just doing
the cardio work, doing the weight
training and eating right, is going to
create an incredible body that will, of
course, allow you to have freer, more
open sex." </EM><P>

Penny says exercising 45 minutes, three
times a week is a great start for
rekindling your flame.<BR><A HREF="Stayhealthymain.html">-back-</A></FONT>

The most common side effects associated with chemotherapy and radiation are nausea, vomiting and pain.  To help patients cope with their cancer treatment and take control of their disease, alternative therapies are being used at more reputable centers.<P>



Last summer, Nancy Patray lost both breasts to cancer.  Now, to completely rid her body of the disease, she'll receive chemotherapy every three weeks for the next year.  But conventional therapy is only half her strategy.  Yoga, a method of mind and muscle relaxation, is also part of her battle plan. <P>

<EM>"People get so sick from chemo.  If they had no hope or no way of releasing the stress in dealing with it internally, I think their prognosis would be a lot worse." </EM><P>

<EM>"It is a mental approach to their therapy  which allows them to give themselves the message that, yes, I'm sick today, yes, this therapy may not make me feel very good, but I know it's self limited, I know it's going to go away and I know I can come through the dark abyss a better and whole person."

Yoga doesn't cure cancer, but it helps patients cope.<P>

<EM>"For many patients, they're actually able, by going into a relaxation state, they are actually able to reduce the amount of nausea and vomiting.  And pain actually, is the other big one.  We have really found that patients are able to get a much better control over their pain threshold when they are able to focus on something more positive and different."</EM><P>



Several years ago, a study from Stanford University in California showed breast cancer patients who participated in weekly support group therapy and self-hypnosis lived longer than women who did not participate.  Sharon MacDonald says the mind can make a major impact on the prevention of illness and the treatment of disease. <P>

<H4><FONT color="#000080">Zapping Spinal Tumors</H4></FONT><FONT size=2>
Spinal tumors aren't common but they're usually deadly.  Of those who get 
them, only 10% survive.  But that statistic may be changing.  Doctors at the 
University of Maryland Medical Center are experimenting with a combination of 
old and new treatments that is giving new hope to people who had no hope 
before.<P>



Three years ago, Cindy Gaisior felt an unusual pain in her back.  Her fiancee, 
James, thought it might be a pulled muscle.  She guessed a kidney stone.<P>


Cindy Gaisior<BR>
Patient<BR>
<EM>"The pain progressively got worse and it wasn't until about June that a physical 
therapist pressed on it and bout sent me across the street."</EM><P>

Alan Levine, M.D.<BR>
Orthopedic Oncologist<BR>
University of Maryland Medical Center<BR>
Baltimore, MD<BR>
<EM>"She had a tumor that was about the size of a grapefruit, and the difficult part of 
her tumor was it was in the back of her spine, it was along the side of her spine, 
into her chest, and also went inside of the spinal canal and compressed her 
spinal cord very severely."</EM><P>

Not long ago, a tumor like this would be a death sentence.  The traditional forms 
of tumor treatment, aggressive surgery and radiation, weren't an option, 
because they likely would damage the spinal cord and other organs.  But today, doctors are experimenting with a combination of surgery, external 
radiation and a kind of internal radiation called brachytherapy, in which tiny radioactive seeds are placed next to the tumorconfining the radioactivity to a small area.<P>


Pradip Amin, MD<BR>
Radiation Oncologist<BR>
University of Maryland Medical Center<BR>
Baltimore, MD<BR>
<EM>"The brachytherapy combined with the external radiation is able to deliver the 
maximum amount of radiation with maximum sparing of the surrounding 
tissues."</EM><P>




So far, of 20 patients who have had this combination therapy, 16 are tumor-
free.  Cindy is one of them.  Her two-and-a-half year battle has been a difficult 
onebut now she and James are ready to plan the wedding they've had to put 
on hold.<P>



Passing the two-year mark has indeed been a milestone for Cindy since most 
spinal tumors grow back within that time.   When she reaches five years, 
tumor-free, her doctors say they'll consider her completely cured.<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT size=2>
<STRONG>Fat intake:</STRONG><BR>
To calculate the maximum fat grams you should eat in a day, divide your weight by three. Example: a 150 lb. woman should have no more than 50 grams of fat per day. This calculation should help you keep your total fat calories at 30 percent each day.<P>


<STRONG>Daily eating habits:</STRONG> <BR>
 	Eat 5 servings of fruit and vegetables each day.<BR> 
 	Make vegetables the main course, protein the side dish.<BR> 
 	Beware of convenience foods.<P>


<STRONG>Exercise:</STRONG><BR> 
A 30 minute brisk walk can easily burn an additional 500 calories weekly.
</BLOCKQUOTE><P>

 	Embrace your natural shape and don't compare yourself to others.<BR>

Wouldn't you love to be Jim Carrey?  You make more money than anyone could possibly use by acting silly. "Ace Ventura," "The Mask," "Dumb & Dumber," "Batman Forever," all hits.

     Now, as he begins his new Ace Ventura sequel, Carrey's achieved an exalted state of peace at a Hindu Temple.

  And why not?  It's easy to be exalted when your movies make as much money as his.   And Jim, Did you know this sequel made 40 million bucks last weekend?  I know.  I can't believe it either.

   As for a plot, Ace is off to Africa to find a sacred white bat.

    And he begins by driving like a guy coming into Jack Murphy 20 minutes late for a Charger's game.

    Soon, Ace is on foot in the jungle, searching for his bat.   In one sill sequence after another, Jim Carrey proves that he does physical comedy like no one else working today.  Most of it is pure silliness and this movie is just one long excuse for Carrey to pull off his "12-year-old boy"
sense of humor stunts.  He could have been filmed in a bare living room and "Ace Ventura" would be nearly as funny.<P>

    Is this great art?  No.

    Profound.  No.

    But sometimes, you want to spend 7 bucks and see something very silly
 And on that count, Ace Ventura is literally right on the money.  40 million worth and counting.  So the REEL story on "Ace Ventura-When Nature Calls"...I'll endure the hoots of the "serious" movie critics and give it 2 and 1/2 reels out of four.

      It's juvenile, often in bad taste and politically incorrect.
     Just what it set out to do and besides that, it's funny!

      "Ace Ventura-When Nature Calls" will relieve you of seven bucks but I think the silly laughs are worth it. <BR>

When you're a big Hollywood star, it's hard to have a good fantasy.  After all, you have all the fame and money you could want.  Which explains why so many actors wind up playing the President of the United States.  Finally, someone who has a cooler limo than you!  Now, in "The American President," it's Michael Douglas' turn to act out this actor's fantasy, along with co-star Annette Bening.  He's the dashing, pool-playing, utterly charming leader of the free world.  She's stunned!  A brash lobbyist who's suddenly been asked out on the date of a lifetime by the widowed President.  She leaves her meager offices behind and finds herself in the Oval Office.  In one funny scene after another, we're reminding that the President is no average Joe, or Bill, or Ronnie.<P>

"The American President" could have been a success by just stringing together funny moments like making jokes about the Presidency.   Another successful film, Dave, did just that.   But this movies goes beyond showing us a President forced to reconcile his public pronouncements with private actions, battling his conscience, showing us how a principled person might actually rise above the mire of Washington politics.  And the charm of this movie is that it's able to do that while maintaining a light, old-time movie feel.   Director Rob Reiner's touch is almost perfect, a gentle mix of fantasy and real-life, modern observations. <P>

      So the REEL story...an almost perfect 3 and a 1/2 reels out of four.  Conservatives will choke on the political slant of this movie and the knock-em dead conclusion isn't quite as knock-em dead as it needs to be.  But Douglas and Bening are a delight to watch.  So is this movie.  "The American President" gets my vote and deserves yours, too. <BR>

Out this holiday weekend in San Diego, one of the best movies of the
year, one that blasts off like a rocket, explodes with suspense, and
returns you back to your seat breathless.   It's Tom Hanks starring, Ron
Howard directing.  The true-life space saga, "Apollo 13."<P>
  

The three astronauts, played Hanks, Kevin Bacon and Bill Paxton thought they
were headed for adventure but instead they got a nightmare. One of the great joys of this movie is the special effects.  Even though the astronauts and their wives understood the danger, and even
though the first moonwalk had happened less than a year earlier, the
public had gotten bored with this "space" stuff.  Indeed, everything was routine on Apollo 13 until they flipped an innocent little switch.  The explosion that resulted has crippled their ship.  And getting back
depends on surviving one  spacey cliffhanger after another.  It also
depends on the crew not cracking under the pressure.<P>


Director Ron Howard has put together one terrific film in "Apollo 13".  He
avoids his usual mistake, laying on the emotions too thick.   Instead, he
lets the inherent, very real life-and-death drama stand for itself.  Good performance from Hanks and great support from Bacon, Paxton and Kathleen Quinlan as Hank's courageous wife.<P>


For some of us, its amazing that 25 years have passed since this happened.
An entire generation that has been raised on fake space drama like Star Trek and Star
Wars can't really appreciate the dangers and courage shown by America's
early astronauts.   Besides being first-rate entertainment, "Apollo 13"
educates a lot of movie-goers who have never heard the story of these
real-life American  heroes.  So, the REEL story..."Apollo 13" sent me into orbit with great entertainment,
smart script, a noble subject.  I give it four reels out of four, the best movie of the summer.

<FONT color="#000080"><H4>"Babe" and "Clueless"</H4></FONT>   <IMG SRC="reelfull.GIF"> <IMG SRC="reelfull.GIF"> <IMG SRC="reelfull.GIF">  <STRONG>-3 reels-</STRONG><P>
<FONT size=2>

Okay, our movie summer is quickly sinking into fall thanks laregely to a soggy 
"Waterworld."  But today, I'm here to recommend two very different summer movies.  The first is a complete surprise and parents, pay special attention.<P>   


"Babe" looks like a forgettable kid's movie.  Cute animals...been done. But 
amazing technology and some sure movie craftsmanship take you a place filled with 
surprises.  It's a magical farm where you really believe the animals talk and one little pig 
learns a life lesson  you and your kids will long remember.   Won't spoil it.  But I 
recommend it.  "Babe" ia a well-crafted, smart film for kids.
<P>

     And then there's a smart, well-crafted movie about older kids.  Their funny farm is a rich, pampered Beverly Hills high school.  Prime among the clueless in "Clueless" is a young lady named Cher, played with 
dead-on dumbness by Alicia Silverstone.  Hopelessly naive about the outside world, she's perfectly adapted for hers.  Let 
the rest of us worry about paying bills and  promoting world peace.  For a delicious hour and a half, director Amy Heckerling takes us inside the lives of 
folks who know what's important.  Repeat after me, boys, clothes, cell phones, parties and boys.  The dialogue in "Clueless" is crisp and funny, the performances a great send-up of 
teen life in California.  And while the whole thing sort of loses its way after about an hour, "Clueless" is worth 
it for the portrait it gives us all of the terrible, thrilling and so important trials of 
teenagers in the 90's.  Alicia Silverstone steps forward as a young actress with great promise, and she's 
able to show us that maybe her character and the way she thinks is not that 
dumb or different from what we all must do in life.
<P>

In the end, both "Babe" and "Clueless" feature naive central characters who learn 
important lessons and share them with the audience.  So the REEL story...first "Babe", a solid 3 reels out of four.   Kids love it, parents will appreciate the message and you really will believe these animals are talking to you 
and each other.  And also 3 reels for "Clueless."  It's a much more mature movie--like duh, of course, you know that.  "Clueless" is crisply written, showcasing new and talented actors.  
<P>

    After a summer soaked with high-budget, low-brainpower movies like "Waterworld," 
these two, "Babe" and "Clueless", are just the opposite and just what we need.<BR>

<FONT size=2>I hear it all the time.
    Why doesn't Hollywood make more of those old-time wholesome movies?
    All we get is violence, special effects.
  Just make one of those 
good, smart, special films and we'd go!
   Oh, yeah?
Last weekend, "Mortal Kombat," the violent clone of the video game, collected lousy reviews 

and 23 million dollars.  <P>
 
  Meanwhile, on the very same weekend, another kids' film filled with heart and heartfelt 
messages, opened and we gave it a mere one-6th of "Mortal Kombat's" box office.
     Based on the popular kids' books, it features seven teenage girls who form a 
babysitting business.
   And while they sit the kids, these girls also learn about boyfriends, truth, honesty, and
 sharing.<P>

    Pretty good values compared to "Mortal Kombat's" kick in the guts.
  But beyond teen humor, we also face their very real problems.  
  For instance, the divorced dad suddenly shows up unannounced and makes life confusing for 

the leader of the club.  The lesson this girl learns about life, and how to treat the most 
important people in her life is a worth the price of admission.
   But there's so much more and it's well-done.  The girls, headed by Schuyler Fisk, are talented and appealing.  
    This is exactly the kind of movie parents, critics and even thinking teens say they 
want.
    So I dare you.  Go see it!  The REEL story...a solid three reels out of four.  It's fun, it's smart and if somebody doesn't go see "The Babysitters Club" instead of "Mortal Kombat," just guess what Hollywood is going to give you more of, and when it happens, who can we blame then?<BR>

Are you hungry for a good meal and a great movie?  
   Here's my suggestion for the weekend.  Head to your favorite Italian restaurant and then go to the movies to see something called "Big Night."  It's about two Italian brothers who run a wonderful restaurant that's failing.
  Failing?  How could it be failing?  After all, they have great food and impeccable service.  Tucci's character is a splendid his and his brother a world-class Chef.  But Mama Mia, the problems.  A competing restaurant has flashing lights, good music, and fake-Italian food that Americans love.<P>

      While one brother stews, the other brother is cooking.
It's about food, loyalty, family and romance. 
    And like great Italian food, it starts with only the best basic ingredients.  In movie-making, that means you start with great writing, you roll in a generous portion of fascinating, believable characters and topped off with more than a dash of inspired direction.   <P>
       
The REEL story on "Big Night"...a gourmet feast...4 reels out of 4.  And who gets credit for this, one of the year's very best movies?  Stanley Tucci.  He co-wrote and directed.
    Tucci, you may remember was the star villian last year in ABC's "Murder One" here on Channel Ten.
   TV's loss is film's gain.  And you should treat yourself to this "Big Night" at the movies.    <BR>

Today, our humble movie
review  will perform an
important public service.
     I'll be saving your
time and money!
     This week, the #1 film
in America is "Black
Sheep," a comedy starring
Chris Farley of Saturday
Night Live.
    If you're thinking about
seeing the #1 film in
America and expecting some
laughs, watch this review
first.
<P>
Handsome Al Donnelly is
gonna be the next
Governor.   His only
problem with
electorate is his Black
Sheep Brother
Mike, played by Chris
Farley.  This brother is ao
dumb he can't find the
brake pedal in this truck.  And I couldn't find
the laughs they're trying
to pedal in this movie.
          Is it funny that he
staples his hand to a tree?  Farley can be
funny but this material so
bad, so incompetently
timed and filmed, so
sophomoric, it's an insult 
to sophomores.
       Poor David
Spade, another comic who
can be hilarious, has
nothing to do.
Which is what I suggest
for you, too.  Have
nothing to do with this
movie.  It's not just that it's
stupid humor.  I live
stupid humor.  I'm still
taking heat because I liked
"Dumb & Dumber."  But "Black Sheep" is
just badly made.  Day and
night get confused, people jump into lakes
and come out totally
dry--that sort of thing.<P>
      The REEL story on
this movie...take a look. 
No Reels.  It's a
comedy and I almost
smirked...once.  You can
get those kind of laughs
in the popcorn line.
        Save your money
because in a word, "Black
Sheep" is....baaaaaaad!

<FONT size=2>
With a title like "Bogus," you might think it's subtitled "The Dick Morris" story--but no cheap political jokes, please.
    "Bogus" stars Gerard Depardeau and Whoopi Goldberg and it begins with a phone call to Whoopi.
The call that changes her single-yuppie life forever.  A friend has died and that friend's young boy is now hers to raise....Good Luck!
    And let's hope we're not teaching the kid to drive.
     Meanwhile, at 30-thousand feet, the boy's imaginary friend chooses the wrong place to materialize...an airplane bathroom.
Bogus helps the boy through this difficult transition to a new "Mom."  
 <P>
What we have is an attempt in this movie to be very whimsical, childlike and magical.
    From the first frames, we know that the tough-talking Whoopi character is going to be won over by Gerard Depardeau's supposed charm, learning about life's charm in the process.  Big Surprise.
    And note to her agent--no more roles where Whoopi plays an irritable professional forced to deal with ghosts.
     "Bogus" tries so hard to be light and charming that its failure to charm is all the more annoying.  
   Scenes like a dream sequence where Goldberg and Depardeau go ballroom-dancing are just awful, so leaden and clumsy that Fred and Ginger could sue. <P>

    Amid the rubble, there are some good things in Bogus.  The young boy in this film, Haley Joel Osment from TV's "Jeff FoxWorthy Show," really is pretty charming.  Some of the settings are fresh and fun.
   But famed director Norman Jewison is responsible for this uncharming mess, which gets just one reel out of four.
   About the only thing that rings really true in this movie is the title.  "Bogus" IS.

The worst injustice, the biggest loser, in this week's Oscar Nominations?  I think it's John
Travolta.  His work in "Get Shorty," a movie that got shorted this week by the Academy, was outstanding and worth another Best Actor nomination.  So, I suppose, it's some consolation, he's got the #1 movie in America right now.  It's "Broken Arrow," the government's slang term for a Lost nuclear weapon.  It's appropriate this movie begins with a stealth bomber flight because this is a movie that sneaks up on you.  You think it could be a serious, realistic look at the issue of stolen nuclear weapons.  But when co-pilot Hale, played by Christian Slater, bales out and the stealth plane crashes, we see the truth.  The other pilot, Travolta, is a bad guy out to steal the weapons for profit.  And he's a cocky cockpit jockey.  Many of the scenes are those male-bonding testosterone-fests where about half-way through you forget about plot, or plausability.  With director John Woo conducting the mayhem, you realize that everything and everyone on the screen will eventually blow up.  It's when you stop asking this movie to make sense that it starts to be fun, silly, but fun.  You gotta love any movie that has this line:  "Would you mind not shooting at the thermonuclear weapons?!" <P>

The REEL story...I give it two reels out of four.  In fact, since we're still in Valentine's Week,  I suggest putting this on a double-feature with "Waiting to Exhale."  That way, a couple could go to movies this weekend and each could  make fun of the other
sexes silly hormone-based fantasy.

<FONT size=2>

It's Memorial Day Weekend (May 26), the official start of the summer movie
season.  And among movies opening today in San Diego, summer is whatever you
want it to be.<P>


Summer, when you're young, is about love.  So, Drew Barrymore and Chris
O'Donnell make all the mistakes in "Mad Love."   Ah, the folly of youth.  If
you're old enough to not want to get back with your first love, you're
probably too old for this film.
Summer is also about action and if you want old action, check out Mel Gibson's gutsy
"Braveheart" which looks just like Leam Neeson's "Rob Roy."   How about
modern action?  That sounds like "Johnny Mnemonic" with Keanu Reeves as a
cyber-style Fed Ex guy about to get his bytes squished on the evil
information highway.<P>


And finally, summer is about whimsy.   You'll find it somewhere in "Casper," the story of the comic-book's friendly ghost.   Dad
and Daughter come to a scary house to chase out the ghoulies.


"Casper" is stuck somewhere between "Beetlejuice" and "Pinocchio," trying return
to life as real boy.
But he's trapped with the Larry, Curly and Moe of the spirit world.


The special effects in "Casper" were done by the folks who made the dinosaurs
of "Jurassic Park" and these spooks are spooktacular.
Unfortunately, though, we're able to see thru all the plot twists as easily
as we see through the ghosties.

But this is summer, after all, so who's thinking?  The effects and look of
this film make "Casper"
frighteningly fun to watch.<P>


The REEL story...summer rules are in effect now so don't think too
hard and give it three reels out of four.  Your kids over about six will love it and there's enough in "Casper" to interest adults, so I say head off
to the theater to see it, or you'll get a haunting feeling that you've
missed the first fun movie of the summer. <BR>

<FONT size=2>
Whenever Al Pacino
throws his considerable
talent behind a project, it
deserves attention.
     In his new movie,
Pacino is the Mayor of
New York. 
      And that means this
week, your trusty movie
critic is heading for a visit
to "City Hall."

     A street shooting leads
to the death of an
innocent kid, and all too
quickly, the shooting also
leads to a story of hanky-
panky politics in New York
City Hall.
     At the center of it is the
charismatic, center-stage-
loving Mayor. 
Hizzoner, Al Pacino.  Pacino is, as usual, a
riveting presence
whenever he's on the
screen.  With this much
star power, I'd like to give
"City Hall" my
approval.
    But you're going to
have fight "City Hall" all
the way through to make
much sense of it.
    Whenever Pacino's
not on the screen, this
movie drags.  It talks
too much, and it's really
about the moral crisis of
his assistant, played by
John Cusack.  And unfortunately, "City
Hall" breaks one of the
central laws of
movies, the central
character is duller than
anyone around him.   
    And Cusack attempts
an annoying Louisiana
accent that seems to go
away in every other scene. <P>
    So the REEL story...
"City Hall" does not put
your hard-earned movie
money to work.  It gets just two reels
out of four, despite a great
cast.  The plot is too
complicated to even try
to explain.  Cusack is stuck in a
dull role.  Martin Laudau,
Oscar winner last year, is
wasted here.   Bridget
Fonda barely breaks through
the background.  "City Hall" is Pacino's
playground but it doesn't
deserve your vote.<BR>

Director Spike Lee is shaking up audiences this weekend in San Diego and around the country with his new "Clockers."  It's a tough, no compromise look at the inner city, typical of Spike's films.

   But this one revolves around a murder and mystery, yet another drug-related shooting on a hot summer night in Brooklyn.
   So, who did it?
   Right away, one young man confesses.   A good, hard-working guy with a family and no record.
   Which makes no sense to street-smart cop Harvey Keitel.
   It looked to him like some kind of drug thing.  
   So who really did it?  Suspect #1 is Strike, the brother of that man in jail.
   Strike's drug-dealing is well-known.  And it appears to everyone, including the cop, that he had the motive and the opportunity to pull the trigger.  So, again we ask--who did it?  Well, Spike Lee is not going to make things easy for you.  Just when you think you know,  you find out that the answer is not so obvious.  Along the way, you are a witness one enlightening scene after another. <P>

   Clockers is a very good, very challenging movie.
   Once again, Spike Lee takes your preconceived notion of both movies and life and turns them upside-down.
   The result?  You leave the theater questioning your own way of thinking.  Thinking!!  What a refreshing change after the summer.
   The REEL story...3 1/2 reels out of four.
   The usual Spike Lee warnings apply to "Clockers":  tough language and sudden violence.
  But the usual praise too:  Innovation.  A fresh view.  "Clockers" is for adults, of course.  I recommend it. <BR>

<FONT size=2>

"Courage Under Fire."  It's been called an Oscar-worthy movie.  I'll have an opinion about that in a moment.
   But let's give it credit.  In a summer of silly special effects, it's actually about ideas and people.
    The main person, Colonel Serling, played by Denzel Washington, is pursuing an idea called truth.
      He used to patrol the Middle East but his battlefield is now closer to home.<P>

Colonel Serling is now patrolling the halls of the Pentagon, a nasty desk job.   All because he mistakenly blew up one of the Army's own tanks during Desert Storm.  The Army covered up that error, and now, his duty is to investigate whether to award the Medal of Honor, for the first time, to a woman.  Played by Meg Ryan, Capt. Karen Walden died while helping her troops escape surrounding Iraqis.  As the Colonel digs ever deeper, he doggedly pursues the truth wherever it may lead and he takes no prisoners.
 
<P>
    This is the rare film that's about the big things, like truth and integrity and moral absolutes.  That's risky for money-conscious Hollywood, where an empty spectacle like "Independence Day" can rake in the money.  But this film has one very honest thing going for it.  And that's the performance of Denzel Washington.  He's terrific as a flawed hero trying to make peace with himself after a tragic mistake.<P>
   So the REEL story...Is this an Oscar caliber-movie?  Well, almost.  I give it 3 reels out of four.
    Washington may be nominated for his role, but Meg Ryan is not really believable and she and Denzel never share the screen.    <BR>

<STRONG>  -3 1/2 reels-</STRONG><P>
<FONT size=2>
The first big summer hit has arrived in San Diego.


It's "Crimson Tide," the military thriller set aboard a modern-day Navy
submarine.   Let's hop aboard the U.S.S Alabama.
  

It's a sealed little underwater world so when Denzel Washington and Gene
Hackman (as the sub's two highest officers) start to disagree, it turns
into a noisy, bumpy pressure cooker.   Nasty Russian rebels may be launching
captured nuclear missiles at the U.S.  These guys are there to fire our own
weapons at them if that's true.  The problem is that after a couple unscheduled fires and explosions,
the radio isn't working quite right.<P>
  

So, here's the dilemma, wait and lose the war.  Or fire the missiles now
and maybe start a war that otherwise wouldn't happen.  So, what do they do?  Well, let's just keep arguing.  These two are starting
to look like they're married.  This is tense, edge of your seat, end of the world kind of
stuff and it works great.   The team that made "Top Gun" did "Crimson
Tide" and they really have the touch when it comes to this kind of
muscle-bound military action.   And unlike "Top Gun," there's no silly
subplots about romance or living up to Dad's expectations.<P>

 
There's even a(pardon the pun) deeper message to "Crimson Tide."   Should
soldiers fight to beat the enemy or should they fight to prevent war
altogether?  Good question and one you can debate for a long time.  But there's no
debate this is a good movie.  Te REEL story...I say, take the plunge and see this thriller now...it's
three and a half reels out of four.  You are whisked away for nonstop action from the first frame and
deposited, dizzy with suspense, two hours later.  "Crimson Tide" is a tense and
terrific start to the summer movie season.<BR>

In sports, the cliche is that "records are made to be broken."  And in the sports movie biz, Stallone and the Rocky movies should soon, to use another cliche, "be feeling the heat."  
   Rocky's record for most sports movie sequels may soon fall...to the Mighty Ducks.    
We're up to 3 now with "D3."   And speaking of broken records, that's what this series has become.
<P>
It's a whole new schoolyear but the same old hijinks for those wacky Mighty Ducks.
    Emilio Estevez is gone, they've got a new coach played by Jeffrey Nordling.        But even this tough guy can't stop even more wacky Ducks hijinks in the stuffy old Edden Hall Academy.
       However, the school, its teachers and the hard-ice coach, who's obviously unaware of the power of sports marketing, can make the Ducks take off their best-selling jerseys.
   <P>
Oh yeah, well, let's just cut the crucial final game.  You can tell it's important because it's shown in slow-motion.  Bet those Ducks can win it.
    And please NOTE just how much time is left on the clock.
Think he's gonna score?  Think those last 3 seconds could really last that long?  
Think there will somehow be a "D4: The Ducks Grow Unwanted Facial Hair?"
   Count on it.   And count on me to say that like each Rocky movie, these just keep getting more and more strained and silly.<P>
    
The REEL story... one reel out of four.  That one is for your pre-teen in the family who hasn't seen a lot of good movies.
   For the rest of us, especially the poor adults forced to watch D3, let's hope the puck stops here.    Matter of fact, if you're looking for a good kid's movie and haven't seen "Fly Away Home," I would recommend you go to that instead.  It's a movie about geese that beats this movie about ducks in almost every way.

Finally, now you can escape all the advertising and actually see this weekend's big movie.
    The new version of "101 Dalmatians."  And the first question to answer, who's the big star of this picture?
    Of course, you say, it's gotta be the puppies.
     After all, they get the title roles...all 101 of them.<P>
      But, in this remake of the classic animated feature, Cruella de Ville not only steals the puppies...she steals the show.  That's Glenn Close, of course, pulling off the delightfully wicked thievery.
       Jeff Daniels and Joely Richardson are just fine as the human parents of all those Dalmatian pups.
       But it's when Close slithers in that this live-action movie really comes to life.  
  And we know how it all goes...Cruella wants Anita's Dalmatian pups, so she sends in her bumbling crooks to actually nab the little creatures and even they think the pups are cute.
    As this movie gets overrun with doggie paws...I paused, to reflect on how easy it would be for this movie to go bad...after all, it's competing with our memories of a classic.
   <P>
    But this version doesn't compete at all...it compliments those memories.  So many shots are carefully reconstructed to remind you of the original, that this live version is almost a tribute.  But that's faint praise. This new "101" is updated, fresh and very funny, even if you never saw the animated film.  Glenn Close is amazing as Cruella and I promise that you and the kids will laugh your spots off.
 I give it 4 reels out of 4. "101 Dalmatians" succeeds at everything it tries to do.  This weekend, forget turkeys.  I suggest you go the dogs.

<FONT color="#000080"><H4>"Dangerous Minds"</H4> </FONT>  <IMG SRC="reelfull.GIF"> <STRONG>-1 reel-</STRONG><P><FONT size=2>
Every few years, Hollywood turns out another one.
   The classroom movie.  "Blackboard Jungle," "To Sir with Love," "Dead Poet's Society," "Stand and 

Deliver," even last year's "Renaissance Man."

   Angry students versus the new teacher.
    Now, it's Michelle Pfieffer's turn in "Dangerous Minds."
      And it's very familiar.
      It's the inner city.  And living there, the usual movie-made collection of bright, but
 misguided youth.
    Into a classroom out of control arrives Michelle Pfieffer.
    She, preposterously, is an ex-Marine.
    Just out of a bad marriage, she's starting life over and is offered this classroom full 

of attitude and anger.<P>

     Yes, I know this is based on a true story, that the new teacher really was a Marine.
    But Michelle Pfieffer?  She's trying hard but she's just plain miscast, and that's 
only the most obvious problem in a very flawed film.  What else?  Well, Michelle's vaguely Southern accent comes and goes, as does her intelligence.  She's shrewd one minute, hopelessly dumb the next.
      But the big downfall in this and all these classroom inspiration movies is that real learning never happens the way it has to in a movie, in one blindingly clear moment of 
insight.
   If it did, we'd all go to school for a few minutes, play that scene, and then be smart 
and well-adjusted and insightful.  Thus, when those "movie" moments of inspired learning take place, they never ring true.  So, the REEL story on Dangerous Minds...it's a "D."   Just one reel out of four.
   Its more proof that when it comes to classroom movies, Hollywood can't seem to learn its

lesson.   People, real people, just don't learn like that.
    The result?  Another movie that doesn't make the grade.<BR>

<EM>Air Date -- 2.7.97</EM><P>

Summer movies used to come out at just one time--summer.  How silly. 
Last year's first big summer movie came out in early May.  It was the
disaster film....Twister.  Now, it's early February and this year's first summer flick is out right
now.<P>
<IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC="dante2.jpg" WIDTH="178" HEIGHT="133" ALT="Linda Hamilton & Pierce Brosnan"><P>
It's Dante's Peak, starring Pierce Brosnan and Linda Hamilton.  This
disaster film  starts with a scene that San Diegans might mistake as
something more peaceful. When the explosive gas and dust first spews out
of Dante's Peak, it looks like the gentle fog rolling in over Point
Loma.    But instead, it's a full-fury volcanic eruption and you're
right in the middle of it.  Just one of the many dazzling effects in
"Dante's Peak."
<P>
Like any good disaster movie, this one has em all.  Whether it's a
twister or an earthquake or a volcano, you need to see the collapsing
buildings, the collapsing highways, of course, the abandoned, crying
child.
   <P>
But I'm getting ahead of myself.  Before you see all the mayhem, watch
out for the crashing helicopter(you must have the set-up dialogue that's
in every disaster flick).  "I'm telling you, before you go and evacuate
this town, you need MORE scientific evidence than just a hunch."
<P>
That, of course, is the required confrontation between competing
experts.  And there's "Oh, yeah, that's what you said before Mt.
Helens!" And the necessary "Gee, Harry, I hope you're wrong about our
little volcano."
<P>
But you and I have to hope the man predicting the explosion is right. 
Without the eruption, all we have is Walton's mountain.  And that really
would be a disaster.  Instead, we have a breathless, mindless rush of a
movie.  
<P>
<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="dante.jpg" WIDTH="178" HEIGHT="133" ALT="Dante's Peak"><P>
The special effects are awesome, the plot is just there to set up them
up.  The actors...Brosnan, Hamilton and the others are utterly
interchangable with the people in Twister or Independence Day.  The
stars are the computer-generated effects and they are no disappointment.
    <P>
So the REEL story on Dante's Peak...3 reels out of 4. If this movie had
bothered with a believable plot it might have rated a perfect 4.
     
It's spectacular, exciting, preposterous and utterly-forgettable moments
after you leave the theater.  In other words, it's a summer movie in
February and it's a blast.

The end of the year's almost here and that means time for those Best of 1996 Awards leading up to the Oscars.  Earlier this week, one of the most respected lists, from the New York Film Critics, came out.  And it's pick for Best Film was a surprise.
    It's "Fargo"--the quirky little Coen brothers film about murder and mystery in the Midwest.
   With its strange characters, funny Minnesota accents and twisted look at ambition, it may seem an odd choice.  But I, too, found it one of the best two or three movies of the year as well.<P>
     Earlier this week, the National Board of Review picked this movie as the best of 1996.  It's the low-budget Australian film "Shine," which comes out later this month here in San Diego.   
     The star, little-known outside of Australia, is Geoffrey Rush, who plays a mentally-challenged musician in the film, also won Best Actor Awards yesterday from the New York Film Critics.<P>
     Winning their award for best screenplay, Albert Brooks, for his hilarious new comedy, "Mother," which stars Debbie Reynolds as Mother.   "Mother" opens in San Diego on January 10th, but I got a chance to see this movie last week, and I think Brooks deserves the award.
     Another surprise in the category of best supporting actress.  Rock star Courtney Love for her role in"The People versus Larry Flynt.
     Once again, those are the New York Film Critics Awards.  Oscar nominations come out in February.<P>
     And now, on to another Holiday movie that will not be an Oscar contender.  Sylvester Stallone in "Daylight."
  It's just another crowded night, traffic crawling through New York's Holland tunnel.  But somebody's in a hurry and BOOM.  A horrific explosion tears the entire tunnel apart.  That's when things really heat up in this film.<P>  Stallone plays a fired city worker who knows Holland tunnel inside and out.  And since he was fired for getting people killed in some other disaster, this is his chance for underground redemption.  All he has to do to get a bunch of trapped survivors outta here, and all he needs is an idea of how to escape.   Sorry, Sly is fresh out.....of ideas, that is...not the tunnel.
It's at this point, you realize that "Daylight" is simply "The Poseidon Adventure" without the boat.   Then, you just wait to see who survives. <P>
   In Daylight, the special effects are good, but that's hardly enough.
   Give this movie 2 1/2 reels out of four.  Stallone fans will be satisfied, they like the action and won't mind the lack of story, but for the rest of us, it's a bad case of tunnel vision.

It's hip.  It's star is hot, and the advance word?  It's "Pulp Fiction Does Mexico."  That's enough to get me and a lot of other San Diegans out to the theater this Labor Day Weekend to see "Desperado."  Hunk Antonio Banderas is "El Mariachi"-- The man in black, roaming modern-day Mexico with his guitar case, looking for revenge.

      Seems nasty drug dealers killed the only woman he loved, shot him through the hand and ruined his day.

     So, he's out to even the score.  Antonio cruises the dive bars, weapons hidden in the trusty guitar case, blasting death and destruction from his double-barrelled fingers.  The violence in "Desperado" is, let's say, indulgent.  Excessive.  How about way too much.  And along with extreme violence, we get, of course, sex.  Antonio meets a gorgeous bookstore owner who's in bed, literally, with the hated drug dealer.  Guess who she's attracted to next?!  In his attempt to make a movie dripping with sex, sweaty posturing, and long, lingering ballets of death and blood and exploding body parts, director Robert Rodriguez forgot something.  He forgot to make a point.<P>

  Unlike "Pulp Fiction," whose director Quentin Tarantino shows up in this movie, "Desperado" has nothing interesting to say about all the macho violence and decadence we see on the screen.  Depending on your taste, there's a lot to like in this movie. 
   If, let me warn you, you're not offended by gratuitous death and tough, tough language, you'll see interesting actors, bizarre storytelling, lots of pure, preening style.  But the REEL story, ultimately a Latin letdown...just two reels out of four.  Banderas is fun to watch but his character would be just as much fun if "Desperado" were not so disappointing.<BR>

Down at your friendly multi-plex, 1996 is turning into the year of the Monkey.  First, there was "12 Monkeys."  Now, there's just one.  In a movie called "Dunston Checks In."  Actually, its an orangutan.  And if you're a parent looking for a good family film this weekend, listen up to see if it's worthwhile, or if it's star, Dunston, will make a monkey out of you!

Dunston, of course, is the orangutan.   And you don't cast an orangutan in a movie unless the aim is comedy.  In this case, low comedy, set in a high buck New York Hotel.  Dunston, as so often happens in real-life, is able to roam the hotel undetected, causing grief for all the snooty guests and exasperated hotel manager Jason Alexander.  As this movie grinds thru all the obvious jokes, laughs are so rare, you have plenty of time to wonder.   What  are Jason Alexander and Faye Dunaway doing in this?  She's Leona Helmsley telling poor Jason to get his kids and "that monkey" under control.<BR><BR>
 
Movies like this can work when the animal in the starring role is given something funny to do, has some personality to share and some role in the plot.  In "Dunston Checks In," this poor monkey never shines.  Yeah, I know, Dunston's an orangutan.   And this movie is a turkey.  The REEL story...Just one reel out of four. 
 Wait for the videotape.  Even then, young kids will search hard to laugh at any of the jokes.  My 3-year-old had seen most of them before.  And this note to Jason Alexander and Faye Dunaway.   Check up on your agents....now!  Any more movies like this and your careers will amount to so much monkey business.  <BR>

Thirteen years ago, Hollywood turned out a landmark film that changed the style of moviemaking.  "Terms of Endearment" won Oscars for Best PIcture, Best Director, and acting Oscars for Jack Nicholson and Shirley MacLaine.  And it's brought in a decade of movie all trying to copy it's winning blend of comedy and tragedy.
<P>
Now, "Terms" has a sequel and Shirley MacLaine brings back her masterpiece role of Aurora, the overbearing head of a dysfunctional family.
<P>
It's 15 years later.  Now, Aurora Greenway is tormenting a whole new generation of relatives, principally her granddaughter Melanie.  Juliette Lewis as an uncanny Debra Winger look and act-alike.  Despite all those years of meddling and nagging, Aurora still needs to run everybody's lives.
<P>
Jack Nicholson returns as well.  His part consumes all of about five minutes in this film.    
<P>
And let's give a nod to San Diego's own Marion Ross, who's already been nominated for a Golden Globe for her role as Aurora's housemaid.  Her performace here is far beyond the "Mrs. Cunningham" we know from TV, but is expected from local audiences who've seen her at the Old Globe and La Jolla Playhouse.  Ross may see an Oscar nomination for this part.  
    <P>
And what about the whole movie??
<P>
Well, if you're interested because you LOVED the original "Terms of Endearment", you'll probably leave the theater wondering why this movie isn't as satisfying.  After all, it's got the big stars, the huge life-altering changes of the original.  But "The Evening Star" lacks one element that made the original so charming, the sparkling comedy that softens the emotional punches.
    <P>
"The Evening Star" is full of stars and good performances, but it's not in the same constellation as the original.

<H4>"Fair Game"</H4></FONT>  <IMG  SRC="reelhalf.GIF"> <STRONG>-1/2 reel-</STRONG><P><FONT size=2>
It's been a bad Fall for a lot of Hollywood's biggest names.  Stallone, Demi Moore, Denzel Washington have all had movies that were absolute box office disaster.   So what better time for super-model Cindy Crawford to come out with her first acting effort.  Good word, effort, because that's what it is to sit through her new film, "Fair Game."<P>

Cindy is a high-powered Miami lawyer, always in a mini-skirt.  William Baldwin is a cop out to protect her.  We don't quite know why, but someone is out to kill Cindy (maybe they're fans of great acting).  Anyway, when her gorgeous waterfront house is blown up, she's really on the run.  In fact, running the gamut of emotions, from A-to-B.  There are of dozens of telegraphed plot "surprises" that "Fair Game" gives away in a virtual lack of imagination feast.  <P>And the answer to the question all of San Diego is asking, can Cindy Crawford act?
For the answer, let's pull out a paper bag, and sure enough she's still in here.  That's right, can't act her way out of a paper bag.  She's gorgeous, of course, and Cindy does sneak in a few nude shots, so she'll get her audience.  But folks, the REEL story on "Fair Game"...just 1/2 reel out of 4.  That's for some exciting (if silly) stunts.  Otherwise, this is a lame, predictable and preposterous mess.  Cindy's first movie is fair game.  Perhaps her next should be called Game Over. <BR>

First, opening tonight in La Jolla, the Oscar-winner for best picture..the film many think was simply the best of the year and no, it's not "Braveheart."  He's a dog named Grommit, and along with his human partner Wallace, they star in "A Close Shave," winner of the Oscar for Best Animated Short.
It's the hilarious work of British genius Nick Park and it's the Star of the annual Festival of Animation at the renovated Museum of Contemporary Art.  The Festival has 13 short films, all off-beat, all interesting, most just plain fun.  The Festival begins tonight and runs through Memorial Day Weekend.  Tickets are $7 dollars at the door.<P>
   And in those "regular" theatres, Cher is back after six years off as the star of a supposed black comedy called "Faithful."  She's a rich wife whose depressed, those memories of an expensive wedding fast-fading when, surprise...she turns around to see a hitman in her house.  Sent by the nasty hubby to kill her for insurance money, the hit man thinks she's been unfaithful.  

Hit man Chazz Palmentieri along with Cher talk, and talk and we learn that he thinks women and pets cause all of life's troubles.   Does anyone really talk like this, especially a hit man and his victim?  No, but they talk like this in stageplays and Palmentieri originally wrote faithful for the stage.  Unfortunately, what can work as a thoughtful and funny piece on stage can fall flat on the big screen where audience and actor cannot play off each other's reactions. <P>

So the REEL story on Faithful...like a bad marraige, it just isn't going to work.
    It's being marketed as a comedy, but the subject matter is just too dark.  The characters aren't likeable and the dialogue is all that weighty "playspeak" which never works on film.
  I give "Faithful" just one reel out of four.
My recommendation: If you're looking for good comedy, go to La Jolla and see "A Close Shave." <BR>

<FONT size=2>
The cast is strong--Robert
Duvall and James Earl Jones. 
But in the excellent new
movie, "A Family Thing,"
the impact of the message
is stronger.
      Duvall's character, 
Earl, is an Arkansas good
ol' boy, set in his
ways his racist ways until
he gets one shock after
another.
    First his mother dies
then, before he can
recover, she delivers an
even bigger shock  
   Turns out Mom left Earl a
letter to be read only
after she died.
           In the letter, he
find outs his real mother
was a black woman who
once slept with his Dad
and then died giving him
birth.
      As her dying wish,
Earl's Momma wants him
to go to Chicago to find
his long-lost half-
brother, a cop named
Ray.

       What follows this first
meeting is Earl's
transformation from bigot
to member of a loving
black family.  

     Irma P. Hall, who plays
eccentric Aunt T. manages
to steal the film out from
under Duvall and James
Earl Jones--quite a feat.
     And as this family
shares it's history with
Duvall's character, we're
touched by the changes
we see in him.<P>

     As usual, Duvall is
excellent and this is a
film that he pushed to get
made.
     Like his "Tender
Mercies," it's ideas are
subtle; what a refreshing
thing in a movie.
     And as his strong-
willed character learns
that the world is not
always the way it
appears to be.  There's a
great lesson for everyone
who sees it.
   So, the REEL story, on "A
Family Thing"...three and a
half reels out of four.
    Strong performances, a
worthwhile message, and
subtle storytelling.  They
make "A Family Thing" a
movie we should all see. <BR>

"Fargo" is one off-beat
movie experience.  It
comes from the Brothers
Coen, who've given us
"Raising Arizona," "Blood
Simple" and "Barton Fink."
     Their new movie is
called "Fargo," but let's
keep our MIdwestern
geography straight.  Fargo
is in North Dakota, but
this movie is about
Minnesotans.
     Desperate
Minnesotans!   Car
salesman Jerry
Lundegaard needs money
bad, so he hires two dumb
crooks to kidnap his own
wife.    That way, he can
collect ransom money
from his rich father-in-law.<P>
      First, the kidnapping
is bungled, then, there's
murder, and suddenly car
salesman Lundegaard is
in way over his fuzzy-
hatted head.
        And when bodies
start turning up in the
Minnesota snow near the
little town of  Brainerd, the
female police chief is
called in to investigate. 

They talk funny and
when a frantic Jerry tries
to get the ransom money,
his rich father-in-law
smells something funny. <P>


One of the great delights
of a Coen Brothers' movie,
you have no idea where
they're taking you.
     And this trip down the
bleak, snow-covered
roads of Minnesota takes
you into some dark,
desperate corners of the
human experience.
     But it's fun!  There
are a lot of comic
moments.   And it's
twisted, sometimes
frighteningly violent, but
always with a point.
      This is typical of Joel and
Ethan Coen, who are from
Minnesota themselves.<P>
   The REEL story on
this movie...3 reels out of
four.  Go to "Fargo," and
take a trip into a heartland
of original moviemaking.
   Do I like it?  As they say
in Minnesota, yah, sure!

<FONT size=2>
Who says Hollywood never has a new idea???  How 'bout me!  One of the most popular Holiday movies is a sequel of a remake of an old-fashioned idea.  It's Steve Martin's "Father of the Bride Two."   The man who couldn't give up his daughter to marriage in the original has a new surprise awaiting him.  It's the 90's, but George Banks still hasn't left the sitcom 50s.  Perfect car, home and family.  And when his darling daughter announces that she's now expecting and he's about to be a Grandfather, Martin's character goes wacko again!  He refuses to grow up and goes on a youth kick.  New haircut, new attitude, new spunky attitude toward his Harriet Nelson-style wife, played by Diane Keaton.  And when the doctor calls them in for some big news, it comes as a shock.   She reminds him, "You are, you dummy."  Remember that new "spunky attitude?"  Still, he refuses to believe he can be a dad & grandad at the same time.<P>
    

The thing that makes "Father of the Bride Two" so profitable is the same thing that makes critics hate it.  It's such a retread of the old styles--bumbling dad, idealized home, perfect kids, and there's just nothing new to like.  But audiences, especially those who saw and loved Father of the Bride One, can be instantly familiar with it all.  So what's the REEL story on this film?  Well, truth is, if you didn't see the original, you won't pay to see this.  So, based on that, I give it three stars out of four.  If you liked the first "Father of the Bride," you'll be satisfied and you'll probably forget it before you find your car in the parking lot.

<FONT size=2>
Opening today in San Diego, a star vehicle, a revenge fantasy and required viewing for Lady Diana.
      In "The First Wives Club," three of Hollywood's leading actresses have teamed up to fight back against a terrifying foe--the scoundrel hubby.
<P>
It just happened to Goldi Hawn.  Same thing for  Bette Midler, and Diane Keaton, too.  They've all been dumped by their husbands and replaced by younger women.
     And, sure, there's weeping, wailing on the wedding bed, but most of all, there burns deep inside their cosmetically reconditioned chests a need for a sweet revenge.  Our ladies hatch their schemes for revenge.  But when their caught breaking inside the hubby's high-rise love nest, the only way out is a little star-powered slapstick.
<P>
It's got great writing, snappy scenes made crisp by three of today's best comic actresses.
      Only at the end, when our ladies break into an "I am woman, hear me roar"
songfest to celebrate their revenge does this movie go a bit too far.   But by this time, most of it's biggest fans will be roaring their approval.
    <P>
So the REEL story on "The First Wives Club," I'm giving it 3 reels out of 4.  One for each of the stars....this is a star-powered powerhouse of a movie.  It's a closer-to-home cousin of "9 to 5," the old Lily Tomlin, Jane Fonda, Dolly Parton movie about sexism at the office.
   Men will have trouble with all the male-bashing in this movie, but I heard a lot of woman cheering along with their laughter.  "The First Wives Club" will be the first hit of the Fall season.

<FONT size=2>
Looking for a good movie to share with your kids? One that they'll enjoy and you can admire (that's pretty rare...).  I recommend a movie out right now in San Diego that's about what happens when creatures are faced with challenge of flight.
Not just birds...but people faced with flying into new challenges, too.
Anna Paquin is a young woman raised in New Zealand.  But her Mom's death forces her to get to know her long-lost Dad
and move to his home in Canada.  Dad, played by Jeff Daniels is a wacky inventor.   
He makes flying machines, makes jokes, tries to make  life okay again for his daughter.
She'd rather spend her time alone, raising some geese she hatched from eggs.
These geese think she's the Mom, and when she has to go to school, she thinks Dad can't handle her "kids." 
He copes, but when the geese grow up, they need to migrate with their Mom.
     That's when "Fly Away Home" takes off, literally.   <P>
Great photography abounds in this movie.  But beyond the pictures, the movie carries an emotional message for both kids and parents.  It's about the bonds that hold all of nature's creatures together.
  "Fly Away Home" is directed by Carol Ballard, who did "The Black Stallion" and "Never Cry Wolf."  
Nobody puts nature on film better than Ballard.
   But beyond the photography, which is stunning, there are moments of inspiration in this movie that surpass the pictures.  
     The REEL Story...I give "Fly Away Home" 3 and 1/2 reels out of four.
  The only warnings for parents, kids younger than about six may not deal well with the death of the Mom early in the movie, 
and later on, there are a couple moments of strong language that weren't really necessary.
    But those small quibbles aside. "Fly Away Home" soars, for kids and anyone lucky enough to go to the movies with them.

<H4>"French Kiss"</H4> </FONT><IMG SRC="reelfull.GIF"><IMG SRC="reelfull.GIF"> <STRONG> -2 reels-</STRONG><P>  
<FONT size=2>
It's #1 at the box office this week and why not. A Springtime romance
starring one of Hollywood's hottest actresses.
 

It's a sure winner called "French Kiss," set in, you guessed it...Paris.  Uptight Meg  Ryan is there
battling rude Frenchman, especially a crudester named Luc, who she meets on
the flight over.  What brings Meg to Paris is her former fiancee, played by
Timothy Hutton.  He's fallen big for a sultry French doll and Meg is
tracking him, hoping for one last chance to talk some sense into him.
Smarmy Luc, played deftly by Kevin Kline, is tagging along as comic foil.
After chasing her old boyfriend for half the film,
Meg finally finds him, sunning in the South of France with the new woman.  
To lure him back, she cops a new attitude of indifference.<P>


To give "French Kiss" its due, Kline is funny, Meg Ryan is charming, but I
have one big problem with this movie and here it is.  From frame one, you
know who's going to wind up together.  The trailers give it away.


That puts our star and the film's producer, Meg Ryan, in the same old tired
position.  A woman who needs to find a man in order to make her life
complete.  Dumped by one man, she rushes to him, and is damaged
goods, incomplete, a failure until she's either won him back or found
another.  Please Meg, you're woman.  A powerful women in Hollywood.
Let's hear you roar.

    
There's a key point in "French Kiss" where it appears that Meg will break
away from these drippy men in her life, learn from their errors and be
strong and go on. <P>


If the producer, Meg Ryan, did this to appease the audience, I'm insulted.
The REEL story...just two reels out of four.  Meg Ryan goes all the way to
Paris for a someone she shouldn't go to Poway to see.


And blows a chance to give us a new kind of '90s romantic comedy.
"French Kiss?"  Try French Cop-Out.

Ever since he was Vinnie Barbarino on "Welcome Back, Kotter," John Travolta has fascinated America.  His performance in "Saturday Night Fever" practically defined the 70's.  And yeah, he sorta missed the 80s, but Travolta's return last year in "Pulp Fiction" instantly put him back among film's top stars.

    Now, he's out to top himself with the new movie "Get Shorty."<P>

    Travolta is Chili Palmer, a hip, supremely confident mob loan shark collector.   Fall behind in your payments, you say hello to Chili.

   Sent to Hollywood to collect a few bucks, Chili runs into a star played by Danny DeVito and the man who owes him money--a dimwit director of slasher movies.  Harry Zimm, played by Gene Hackman.

   Luckily for everyone involved, Chili is a movie fan and he wants into Hollywood and out of loan sharking.<P>

   That's enough plot.  I'll let you discover the joys of this off-beat pleasure for yourself.  You'll enjoy Rene Russo as a smart, cynical actress.
   She's just one of a half-dozen players that make "Get Shorty" a tall treat.
     Look for Travolta to get an Oscar nomination for his work.

    And Hackman, Delroy Lindo and, especially a very funny Dennis Farina, deserve mention, too.  But make no mistake, as Chili Palmer himself might say, this is Travolta's film.

      And I couldn't help thinking this character could be the guy who grew up and out of "Saturday Night Fever."<P>

       That's the kind of career-symmetry that Oscar voters love...so the REEL story on "Get Shorty"... not only is this a four out of four rave from me, 
"Get Shorty" will be long on Oscar votes, as well. <BR>

Well, it's only been a few
days since the glamour of
the Academy
Awards, which you saw
along with over half-a-
million other San Diegans
right here on Channel 10. 
    And traditionally, 
there's always a post-
Oscar letdown at the
movies, but this is
ridiculous.
    This weekend, if you're
a parent looking for a
family movie, things have
completely gone to the
dogs.

What do I mean?  I
mean movies about dogs
are turning up more often
than Mel Gibson at the
Oscar podium.<P>
    Opening this weekend,
this movie, "All Dogs Go to
Heaven Part 2."
     Lots of dogs with
halos, a follow-up to that
successful film.  And also opening this
weekend, actually re-
opening, Disney's
animated dog and car
picture, "Oliver &
Company."
    This movie about a
bunch of street smart New
York pooches and a cat
named Oliver first
appeared in 1988, just
before Disney hit
animation gold with "Little
Mermaid," "Beauty & The
Beast" and all the rest.
       This film never
made it out on video.
        So, typical of Disney
marketing, wait 7 years til
a new generation has
grown, and collect more
bucks from older product.
        Look for this on
video later this year.<P>
        And one more dog
picture for families--this is
Homeward Bound
"Two, Lost in San
Francisco."
        Another sequel, and
we follow another bunch
of pooches and a smart-
aleck cat lost in another
big city.
       In this movie, famous
actors are the voices of
the characters.  
The plot--trying to leave
San Francisco and return
home.  Michael J. Fox and Sally Field are just a few of the popular voices.<P>

Since "Babe," we've learned
that Hollywood can make
animals talk, or look like it.  In "Homeward Bound"
movies, they don't even
try and that's no longer
enough.
   So the REEL story...
it's pleasant and
unchallenging for kids
under about eight, give it two
reels out of four.  
Parents, though, will get
bored.  "Oliver and Company"
does a little better.  Good
songs by Billy Joel, Huey
Lewis, Bette Midler, and
great-looking Disney
animation.  Based on the
old Dickens tale, it rates three
reels out of four for
parents and their kids.
      In fact, it's pretty
doggone good.  <BR>

It's the biggest event of its kind right now and it features grown-men acting like children.
     No, it's not the Republican Convention.
It's the movie--Jack.  And no, not Jack Kemp.
   Instead, Robin Williams is a boy with a strange disease that makes him age 4 times faster than normal.
Which means Jack is a regular 10-year-old trapped in a 40-year-old body. 
     He looks grown-up, but like any kid, fear can still send him leaping into his parents' bed.  
     But Jack must also worry about things other kids don't know.  Things like shaving or pondering his own fast-forward mortality.
       That's tough, especially when he goes to a new school and has to explain his unbelievable predicament to his skeptical class. 
But Jack is able to win them over, buying them grown-up treats like Playboy.  Now, invited into the super-secret treehouse, they wanna know his biggest secrets. <P>
With famed director Francis Ford Coppola in charge, and with such profound subjects life and death, youth versus wisdom, tolerance versus fear, you expect "Jack" to reach for moments beyond the typical comedy.  
But, you know what, you never get it.  The obvious comparison for this movie is Tom Hanks' "Big."   Hanks also played a kid trapped in a grown-up body.  But "Big" is a much better movie. 
   In "Jack," everybody knows Robin Williams' character has a disease and will die soon.
      That kills a lot of the comedy, and just when Coppola looks like he's about to make a profound point with this movie, he merely reminds us we're all mortal.<P>
      So the REEL story...a disappointment.  Just 2 reels out of four.  Williams never unleashes his wild humor and Coppola's direction never lives up to his past work.    
        You know, Bob Dole may be happy he put Jack on the ticket here in San Diego.  But "Jack" really isn't worth your ticket at the movies.

<FONT size=2>It was a book many baby boomers grew up reading, so now that baby boomers control Hollywood, it's only natural that "James and the Giant Peach" has now made it onto film.
       Thanks to just-invented technology, this 35-year-old story jumps off the screen.<P>
James is the boy hero of this weird and wonderful tale.  He's a young British orphan, abused by his wicked Aunts named Spiker and Sponge.
      So when a 20 foot high peach grows in his yard, he does the only reasonable thing you can do when confronted with gigantic fruit.  No--not fruit
salad, he climbs in.
      And with that, James undergoes a magical transformation.
James wants more than anything to visit New York City.  So using their big peach as a boat, the bugs and James head out to sea.  Richard Dreyfuss is the centipede.  Susan Sarandon, the spider.<P>
      This movie looks a lot like the inspired 1993 movie "The Nightmare Before Christmas."  And that shouldn't come as a surprise.
   
That's because the same director, Henry Selick, did both films.  And Tim Burton, known for his fantastic visual style, is the producer.<P>
   And the REEL story...
I give it three reels out of four.  
   There's nothing fuzzy about this peach movie.  The images are fanciful and fun and the message about following your dreams and believing in yourself is worthwhile.
    Young children, 5 or younger, might be scared by some of those weird bugs.
       For them, it could be the pits, but for the rest of us, this peach is pretty sweet. <BR>

Today a movie that's a truly unexpected gift from Hollywood.  A guy's movie..a gal's movie..a date movie, and most rarely, a thoroughly entertaining movie that's actually about something important to us all.
   It's "Jerry Maguire."  With Tom Cruise starring as a sports agent that's struggling with a personal crisis.

His problem: Jerry loves 
the money and glitz of big-time sports....he just hates the people and the complete lack of ethics.
    And when his stand for ethical behavior gets him canned...he decides to start his own business.
     Most everyone thinks he's gone round the bend when he suddenly asks for passengers to go along on his ego-trip.
The only one willing to help him start a new two-person agency is a single-Mom accountant, played with endearing charm by Renee Zellweger.<P>
        While Maguire tries to persuade his old athlete clients to come to his new business, she's telling him to stick with his principles.  We know where this is going, and their business relationship soon is a romance with a young son sandwiched in the middle.
    That's fine, but Maguire's not having much luck getting money-grubbing athletes to do business with a man with, OH NO, principles.
    In fact, his only client is an egocentric football player, an excellent performance from Cuba Gooding Jr. The scenes featuring these two in a battle of words, worlds and egos are the best in a very good movie.<P>
   How good is it...probably the best acting of Cruise's career, including "Rainman."
   He may get an Oscar nomination.  But there's so much else to love in this movie.  The writing, the smartness, the relevance to so-many people's "conflicted" lives.
    The REEL STORY..a rave.  4 reels out four.
    "Jerry Maguire," the sports agent movie, scores both a home run and a touchdown.

 I have a
special alert for parents.   
   Your kids have seen the
delights of "Toy
Story" and maybe even sat
thru the smaller joys of
"Balto," the cartoon tale
of a dog in the arctic.
    So, what about the
Robin Williams
movie, "Jumanji?"
    After all, it's about a
board game called
Jumanji and features
kids in most of the
starring roles.<P>
      It begins when this
kid discovers the game
buried underground.
       When he and his
friend sit down to play
this Jumanji, they see
why it was buried. 

The boy is sucked down
into the game, and isn't
seen again until a new
generation of kids find the
game, roll a 5, and up
pops Robin Williams.
      He's ready to play
Jumanji again and has to play
his now grown-up friend.  But
she's a bit reluctant.  
Everytime someone plays
this game, really bad
things happen.
        And that draws the
attention of both the
grown-ups in the
house and the police.<P> 

The special
effects in "Jumanji" are
excellent but they're also
excessive. 
  And as eye-
popping as they are, they
can't hide the flaws in this
movie.

The biggest one, those
expensive effects.  They're too scary for young
kids and too simple for older kids and adults.
          And since this is
about a board game, let's
roll the dice and finish
this review using the
appropriate language.<P>
        They had a <EM>monopoly</EM> on the great
talents of Robin Williams but
he's wasted.
     They risk everything
on dazzling effects.  But
the plot is a <EM>trivial pursuit</EM>.
   In the end, they have no <EM>clue</EM> about who it's
aimed at.
   So I'll give "Jumanji" just
two reels out of four.
     And parent's, be
warned.   If you were
thinking of taking younger
kids, don't do it.
   You'll be <EM>sorry</EM>.

<FONT size=2>
Finding a seat at the movie theatre may be the best thing about a new film opening today in San Diego called "The Juror." <BR><BR>

Demi Moore is a bored single Mom who naively thinks serving on the jury in a Mob murder trial could bring some excitement into her life.  The excitement arrives alright.  It's studley Alec Baldwin playing against character as the bad guy.  A Mob goon who orders her to vote not guilty.  If she doesn't, her son will pay the price.

Demi's friend suspect there's a problem and domestic little Demi tries to outsmart all the professional mobsters who've devoted their very lives to surviving in this threatening, violent world. <BR><BR>

 Believable?  Not a bit.  And in the process, "The Juror" commits one of the unforgivable crimes in a movie, presuming your audience is dumb.  So dumb it will not see huge holes in your script and this movie has great gaps of logic that they try to overcome with style and star power.<BR><BR>

The REEL story on "The Jury"....guilty of presuming the audience is stupid..or star-struck.   Just one reel out of four.  I don't think they should have ever let "The Juror" out of the box. <BR>

<FONT size=2>
Too bad bowling isn't an Olympic sport.  If it were, maybe a very interesting movie called "Kingpin" would get somebody's attention.
        After all, when someone has the courage to make a whole movie about bowling, and then has the courage to break Hollywood's tired rules, it deserves a look.  This movie is not only a bowling epic but it bowls over all the old movie cliches.
    Everything is fair game for a joke, everything from the world's worst behaved artificial hand to religion to animal rights.
     The main character, played by a courageous Woody Harrelson is a slimeball, so dirty you can almost smell him up there on the screen.
      And another creepy bowler, Bill Murray, tries to pair up with him to make money.  In the end, these two creeps wind up as rivals and Murray always finds a way to get to, pardon the pun, strike first.    
<P>
     In a complete departure from the Hollywood norm, "Kingpin" is not afraid to go into the gutter if there's a good joke waiting there.  In fact, it's downright amazing that this movie pays absolutely no attention to political correctness.  And the list of offendees is long--religious minorities, handicaps, animal rights groups, women and that's just the major ones.  But as you wince, you also laugh at the bizarre, inspired twists in "Kingpin," and usually, you laugh not quite understanding why.
      So the REEL story...3 reels out of four...if you're able to take a crude joke...many crude jokes.
       It's the weirdest, funniest movie this summer and the best bowling movie ever made, with room to spare.   <BR>

<H4>"Larger Than Life"</H4></FONT> <IMG SRC="reelhalf.GIF" WIDTH="15" HEIGHT="30" ALT="half reel logo">  <STRONG>- 1/2 reel -</STRONG><P>
<FONT size=2>

It's a movie about a frantic journey to San Diego.  That means, if you're a San Diego movie critic, you gotta see it.
    Bill Murray is the star, but he's not the biggest star in "Larger Than Life."
<P>
Murray's a sleazy motivational speaker.  He learns his Dad has died and left him a big inheritance....Big--like in an elephant-big.   Murray needs to get rid of his trunkload of problems so he solicits an offer from the San Diego Zoo.
Deliver the beast, collect the cash.  With that incentive, Murray is San Diego-bound on a cross-country pachyderm pilgrimage.
He travels by train, truck and on foot. <P>
   After too long on the road, Murray and his elephant arrive at what is supposed to be the San Diego airport.  I say "supposed" because San Diegans will instantly recognize that this is not really Lindbergh Field.  They run through the terminal, just as they ran through the whole film.  Only problem is, neither Murray nor the elephant are given any funny material.  And that's the biggest problem with this movie, pardon the pun.  Its makers obviously think that putting a large animal in strange situations is funny all by itself.  They never bothered to actually think of anything for that poor animal, or for Bill Murray, to do.<P>

    Murray gets off a few good ad-libs, but this movie is so poorly underwritten, it's a joke! In fact, that's only joke I could find is in this mess.  The REEL story...just 1/2  reel out of four.  The biggest loser this week may have been Bob Dole, but this elephant movie is also one large disappointment.  <BR>

<H4>"Lord of Illusions"</H4></FONT>  <IMG  SRC="reelhalf.GIF"><STRONG> -1/2 reel-</STRONG><P><FONT size=2>
     I'm depressed.  

It's the Post-Labor Day, going to the movies blues.
    Quality always dips in the movie houses this time of year.
    After all, if you have good product available, you release it during the summer, when the big audiences are there.

    Which means that the new stuff out in September is usually not great.
    Which brings us to stuff like "Lord of Illusions."<P>

Poor Scott Bakula is the cliche' hard-nosed, tough-talking private eye called in to uncover the mystery.

    People are dying all over, illusionist magician-types mostly.
   Seems an all-powerful monster is behind this.
   Called "Nix," apparently in reference to the amount of originality you'll see, Nix kills for the fun of it.<P>

 
   The entire movie is like every other forgettable horror movie to hit San Diego.
   The chase goes on til we come face to ugly face with the unkillable stock Hollywood  monster.  Yikes, he's got the girl and he's threatening to send her down "The Hole to Hell."

And I want to follow that girl down the hole if it would get me out of the theater.<P>

   It's not that "Lord of Illiusions" is that bad.

   It's just that it's nothing new.  How many times can you have an unkillable monster before you have an unwatchable movie?

  So the REEL story...a miserable 1/2 reel out of four. 

  The 1/2 reel is for the three or four sharp jolts this film delivers.  
   But I get that many scares driving into Channel 10 every day on Highway 94.
   Bottom Line--"Lord of Illusions" fools nobody.  We've seen it all too many times before.

<FONT size=2>
It's the most popular family movie out there right now.  And it features a winning performance by young Mara Wilson as Matilda.
        Matilda has a lot going for her.  She's cute, smart, has special powers I'll reveal in a minute.  But Matilda has one slight problem.
Matilda has the worst parents on earth, played by Danny DeVito and Rhea Pearlman.
   So, she takes her treasured books and heads off to school, where she meets a gentle teacher, Miss Honey, who appreciates her intelligence.
    When the parents find out about this awful thing, they're confused.  Isn't Matilda too young to go to school?
When Miss Honey drops buy to for a little parent-teacher conference, she herself gets her own lesson in amazing indifference from Mom and Dad.
<P>
Whenever Pearlman and DeVito, who also directed, are in this movie, it has a kind of wicked energy that's outrageous and fun to watch.   But they're not at the center of this movie.  Instead, you follow Matilda's school days with this witchy schoolmarm.  And since this is based on a famous kid's book you have to include its major plot device.

Which is that Matilda has magical powers.  She can change things around her at will, sort of like "Bewitched."<P>
     Now who am I to argue with famed children's author Roald Dahl, but this movie-version would have been more effective
without magic.
   The message that smarts and desire can lift you out of a bad situation is diluted by this fantasy-stuff about magic.
   So the REEL story...two reels out of four.  Mara Wilson, who was in Mrs. Doubtfire and Miracle on 34th Street, makes it three solid, engaging performances in a row.  Danny Devito does a good job directing. 
      But we need more of Devito the actor, and if the main character had relied a little less on magic, "Matilda" would have been more magical.

<H4>"Metro"</H4></FONT><IMG SRC="reelfull.GIF"><STRONG>-1 reel-</STRONG><P>

Why go to an Eddie Murphy movie?  Answer: because he's funny.  That's why last summer's movie, "The Nutty Professor," was so successful.  Eddie was funny. Something he hasn't been for about five years.
Now, in his new movie "Metro," Murphy is back to the cop image that was a hit when he was funny in Beverly Hills Cop.  The question--is he funny again?
<P>
For the answer, we head up north.  San Francisco may be beautiful, but it in this movie, it's overrun with urban terrorists.  Every day, the San Francisco SWAT teams have another nutcase to battle, and that means a police hostage negotiator played by fast-talking Eddie is always busy.
Psycho here, degenerate, there.  Eddie is supposed to be able to talk em out of any life- threatening situation.  But when yet another wacko ties his girlfriend to the railroad tracks, leaving him holding the button that keeps her alive, he's suddenly out of funny lines.
That's because, in the movie, this bad guy is as smart as Murphy's characters.  Suddenly, Eddie's fast-talking scams that work on duller brains are useless.  Eddie is reduced to guns and shooting, chasing and dodging, in order to avoid being killed, and that kills this movie.
<P>
About the time when he's reduced to jumping from a covertible into a cable car,  I jumped off.
In his best work, Murphy is allowed to be free to quip, to imitate, to be a free spirit.  In the first half hour of "Metro" that's exactly what he's allowed to do.  But then, "Metro"  turns into the generic action shoot-em-up where Keanu Reeves or Wesley Snipes or just about anybody could be the star.
That's a waste when you have Eddie Murphy and that's why this movie gets just one star out of four...because it's good for a one-fourth of its length.
This movie was supposed to be a good vehicle for Eddie Murphy, but it could have carried anybody.  And for you and me, "Metro" is not worth the ride.

The American election is just a few days away, so it's appropriate, I guess, we turn our attention to an acclaimed movie about a popular politician.  
  And if Clinton and Dole think American politics are tough, they should try it in Ireland.
 <P>
Irish politics in the early 1900s were, well, a bit more forceful.  With things like guns and bombs and angry mobs.
    At the center of Ireland's struggle for independence from the British--a dynamic, courageous leader named Michael Collins.
   Collins, as portrayed by Liam Neeson, is the right kind of politician for his country and his time.
Collins' passion for Irish independence is matched by his passion for an Irish good time.
<P>
This epic sweeps on through the years, showing us Collins as he makes the transition from freedom fighting rebel to statesman.  From young merry-maker to solid husband.
And in this movie, Liam Neeson gets married to Julia Roberts.  You didn't see her in those clips and that's just as well.  It's yet another disappointing performance from Julia.<P>
   But the rest of this movie works.  In fact, it almost works too much.  It's about 20 minutes too long as we follow Collins and his Ireland through the years. 
The REEL story...give it three reels out of four.  Give Liam Neeson his Oscar nomination.  He's terrific as the larger-than-life Collins.
      And this movie, which is about Ireland after all, is worthy of your green.   
     I recommend it.

They strap on their helmets, blast off into space and face all kinds of trouble as they try to head home.

   Apollo 13?  I wish.  That is an excellent film.
    But those plot points are also the basics of another movie now out in San Diego, a much worse movie.

   "The Mighty Morphin Power Rangers."
    And parents, before you send your kids to this film(even if it's a bargain matinee), read this review because this movie is no bargain.<P>


The world is full of powerful bad guys so thanks to Hollywood, we have our teen-age Power Rangers to save us.
   The U.S. Military, Judge Ito, Hugh Grant's sex drive--nothing is more powerful than these six Mighty Morphins.
    As for a plot--a nasty guy who can change into anything he wants to take over the world.
On the "bad" list, there's terrible dialogue, awful acting and the offensive message that "violence pays."
    The real time and money in Power Rangers went into enticing your kids to buy new toys.
    Otherwise, imagine Ed Wood with a big budget and you get this movie.<P>


Yes, it's that bad.  Kids, young kids, may not care.  But you should.  Sly could be the next Power Ranger but that's another movie and one I would dread.
    Let's get back to the Power Rangers...a miserable 1/2 reel out of four.
     A lousy message to send to young kids and a lousy attack on your pocketbook.  
    A 4 dollar ticket today will cost you 40 in toys before Christmas.
     Power Rangers--powerful bad. <BR>

<FONT size=2>
Has there ever been a more appropriate title?--"Mission Impossible."
  After the blockbuster success of "Twister," it may seem impossible for any movie to match that kind of success.
   But, this one could.  And not just because it begins with a message we all remember.
Your mission--take your audience on a breathless ride that's as good as what they remember from the old TV show. 
     And never mind that the old TV show wasn't really that great or that popular.
     You have the usual crew to pull this off, except for Tom Cruise, your head-hunk, who's
as brainy as he is brawny.<P>

I'm serious when I tell you that the thrills in this movie version of "Mission Impossible" are way better than the old TV show.
   Just as "The Fugitive," movie style, surpassed the old TV show, the same hold true here.
   Brian DePalma's direction sizzles, Cruise is all smarts and charm, and the shifting realities and alliances will keep you guessing till the final scene. 
      Matter of fact, I liked this film more than "Twister."  It has great special effects and a decent plot, something "Twister" lacks.
       And "Mission Impossible" has already set the record Wednesday for best opening day ever, beating "Jurassic Park."  How's that for doing the impossible?
   So the REEL story...3 reels out of four.  A dazzling, thrilling improvement on the old series.  "Mission Impossible" is mission accomplished. <BR>

It's always big news in Hollywood when Albert Brooks comes out with a movie.  That's because it happens so rarely.  For instance, it's been five years since his last film, "Defending Your Life."  For a lot of critics, this one included, that's too long a wait.  Brooks is not only funny, but smart and his films look at contemporary life in a way no one in Hollywood can match.<P>

Now, his film "Mother" opens this weekend in San Diego and, no surprise, it's good. 
Brooks has this nutty idea.  He's been in a couple bad marriages, so to understand women, he thinks he needs to understand why he can't get along with his own picky Mother.  So...he moves back home.<P>
    
Good theory...bad plan.<P>

He fixes up his old room while Mom, Debbie Reynolds, makes him a snack...12 pounds of frozen 3-year-old cheese!<P>

Eventually, Albert gets Mom out of the kitchen and into a fancy restaurant.  But even there, she won't get off his back.   From his hair to his driving to his failure in marraige, Mom is blissfully relentless in her attack.<P>

Reynolds is terrific in this movie as the Mom who drives Albert crazy.  She's already gotten an acting nomination from the Golden Globes.  Look for the Oscars to nominate her work as well.  They always love to recognize stars in roles like this.

And the <B>REEL</B> story on "Mother"...The first rave of the new year...4 reels out of four. <P>

Anyone who's ever had a mother will identify with this picture.  <P>

It's a funny idea, freshly done as only Brooks does it, with a real, powerful lesson about our parents that we all can use.  Mother?  We all love our Mother?  And I loved this movie.

<H4>"Muppets Treasure Island" and "Mr. Wrong"</H4></FONT><IMG SRC="reelfull.GIF"><IMG SRC="reelfull.GIF"><IMG SRC="reelfull.GIF"><STRONG>-3 stars each-</STRONG><P><FONT size=2>
Right now, two stars from TV with shows on Channel 10.  In fact, they are out with their new movies.  One is interesting to us because it was shot right here in San Diego.  And the other combines two classics.  The Muppets and the Pirate Movie.<P>

Step aside tradition.  Kermit and the Muppets are setting sail in the old Treasure Island tale.  And, shiver my timbers, it's a lot of fun for kids and their parents.  Of course, the Muppets are cute.  But their also irreverent.  And their dance numbers are better than anything you see on the Oscars or Grammys.<P>
    
But stealing the show is real-live Tim Curry.  He's over the top of the boat as villainous pirate Long John Silver.  I say we all jump aboard for this rollicking good time.   And while the Muppets look for Treasure Island, there's another movie I want to recommend. <P>
   
Ellen DeGeneres is a single woman looking for love.   And she's looking in San Diego. "Mr. Wrong" was shot on location here and that's fun.

But only part of it, as Ellen runs into Bill Pullman.  At first, he's charming, sensitive and there's sexual fireworks.  But, then Mr. Right, turns utterly loopy and threatens to ruin her tidy little life.  There's a lot that's clever and funny as Ellen's life in a La Jolla cottage is wrecked by this clown.<P>
      
Ellen DeGeneres proves she can join the Muppets in making a successful transition from TV to the big screen.
       

I wasn't sure she could.   But she handles the subtleties as well as the slapstick very well.  Sort of like Kermit and Miss Piggy come to think of it.   <P>
    
Let's get to the REEL Story on these movies.  I give "Muppets Treasure Island" a very hearty yo-ho-ho three reels out of four.  
Your kids will enjoy and so will you.  In fact, a lot of the material is thrown in just for the adults, which alone makes it a Treasure
among kids' movies.<P>

And as far as Ellen's movie, forget those nasty reviews this movie has gotten.  They've gotten "Mr. Wrong" all wrong.  I also give this film three reels out of four.  The San Diego scenes are great fun for those of us here, but that aside, it's well written, fresh and funny.  "Mr. Wrong" is alright.   <BR>

<H4>"Mrs. Winterbourne"</H4></FONT><IMG SRC="reelfull.GIF">  <STRONG>-1 reel-</STRONG><P>
<FONT size=2>
She's the star of her own TV talk show here on Channel 10.
   But now, Ricki Lake, has gone back to movie acting to star in her new comedy, "Mrs. Winterbourne" with Shirley MacLaine.
    Should Ricki stick to her day job?  Well, the way her character begins this movie, you'd think so. 

Connie Doyle's life is one long rainy night.  Her boyfriend tossed her out, she's pregnant.  She has nowhere to go.  She gets on a train, that train crashes, and when she wakes up...what a change!
   Her baby is born and they mistakenly identify her as Patricia Winterbourne, a young wife in a rich, snobby clan.
    And it doesn't take long for Brandan Fraser, the smart son, to suspect something's wrong with his "sister-in-law."<P>

    "Mrs. Winterbourne" is filled with touching moments, too many, in fact, to be believable.
    The plot and Richard Benjamin's direction of this film asks you and me in the audience to be as gullible and dumb as the rich family in this movie.  That's always a bad mistake.
    I went into this movie thinking I wouldn't like it and I was right, but for the wrong reason.  I thought Ricki Lake might not be up to a starring role.  Surprise, she is.  But, surprise, the script and veteran director Richard Benjamin let her down.
    The REEL story...just one out of four. <BR>

First of all, no Hugh Grant jokes!

That whole thing had it's 15 minutes.  Now, what about that other thing Hugh Grant does in Hollywood, you know, acting?

      The fact that his new movie is about how a young man should "grow up and act responsibly" almost makes me want to break my moratorium on jokes right now but I promised.
      An honest review, joke free, of "Nine Months."<P>


A couple gets great news.  We're having a baby!  
     Well, Hugh's character, a child psychologist, isn't ready.
   His baby is a bright red sports car, he loves sleeping late, fancy restaurants.
    How can he give it all up for a minivan, sunrise feedings and Chuck E Cheese?<P>

      His wife, Julianne Moore, and friends, led by professional jerk Tom Arnold are excited by it all and try to whip up some parental enthusiasm. 
But nothing seems to get ol' Hugh excited by Daddyhood, so the mom-to-be faces a crucial choice about the future. Will she leave him?  Will he ever change his attitude about babies?<P>

This whole movie, could have gone very wrong and very silly.

   But as he did with Mrs. Doubtfire, director Chris Columbus keeps the mood light, fast-moving, and mostly hilarious.

    In fact, "Nine Months" has some of the longest laugh-out-loud sequences of the year.  And Hugh Grant  fulfills his promise as a charming, light-comic leading man.   Along with Tom Arnold, who I also liked in this movie, you have proof that personal life and  professional acting skill are two different things. 
      Also, Robin Williams appears in this thing just enough to lift it over the top when its needed.<P>

    So, the REEL story...a solid three reels out of four.  Turns out "Nine Months" is like a real pregnancy.    Predictable pattern, ultimately satisfying despite all its distractions.  And yes, in the end, it delivers. <BR>

Maybe he'll do one picture for each American President.  He's done JFK and is out this week with Nixon.  Maybe we can look forward to Oliver Stone's next project--"Fillmore!" 
     
Well, maybe, but for this Holiday Movie Season, we'll settle for Nixon.<BR><BR>

Anthony Hopkins as the utterly graceless, constantly-calculating Nixon is a tricky marvel.  And as he did in "The Doors," "JFK" and "Born on the Fourth of July," Stone returns to a time he's done to death--the 60s and 70s.  But here, his cinematic skill helps us make sense of Nixon's time and the trap he set for himself in Watergate.<BR><BR>
   
In addition to Hopkins, Joan Allen as Pat will also get an Oscar Nomination.  At the icy dinner during Watergate, she tries to get inside his troubled head. 

As with his previous movies, Oliver Stone's "Nixon" will leave exhausted, outraged, and impressed.  At over 3 hours, I expected this movie to drag but it doesn't.
     
And, for once, Stone reigns in his tendency to hit you over the head with too-obvious direction.  I just wish he could control the urge to make stuff up.
    
With "Nixon," and with JFK for that matter, what we know about these men is so interesting that Stone could produce a fascinating portrait without having to embellish it with speculation about conspiracies, dreams, or whatever.<BR><BR>
   
So the REEL story on "Nixon"--almost a rave.  3 and 1/2 reels out of four.  Outstanding performances from Hopkins, Allen, Paul Sorvino as Kissinger, and about 15 other stars.

Richard Nixon will always be controversial.  But unlike the real thing,  "Nixon," the movie, deserves everyone's vote! <BR>

<H4>"One Fine Day"</H4></FONT><IMG SRC="reelfull.GIF"><IMG SRC="reelfull.GIF"><IMG SRC="reelfull.GIF"><STRONG>-3 reels-</STRONG><P>



Looking for a good date movie to start 1997?   Almost lost among all the Holiday films is a fun, gentle story that would be a big hit if not for all the competition at the box office. 
<P>    
"One Fine Day" stars George Clooney and Michelle Pfieffer.  Single parents, struggling through the worst day of their careers.  Clooney and Pfieffer not only hate their days....they hate each other.  In movieland, of course, that means that they'll end up in love.
<P>
But this movie takes the whole "hate-each-other" first scene to a new level.  Turns out their kids hate each other too.  And when these frantic parents get distracted and mistakenly switch cell phones, their lives are suddenly intertwined.
<P>
Any parent can relate to the frantic problems of balancing grown-up careers and the needs of young kids.  Finally, as Pfieffer is forced to choose between her child and her important adult business friends, she makes a memorable speech every busy parent would like to make to their bosses.  
<P>
In the end, ia it all is a little too pat, too preachy? 
 <P>
Well, a little, but "One Fine Day" is better than most of these "hate you, then love you" romances.  There's some smart writing, good chemistry between the stars, and a willingness to not follow the old and tired Hollywood conventions.
<P>
For instance, the title "One Fine Day" is not just an excuse to trot out an old song title to put in the soundtrack.  That's been done about a half-dozen times during the 90s. Instead. This movie is actually about one really awful day and what fine things can come of it.
<P>     
So the REEL story... Relax, enjoy the romance, forget some of the preeachier dialogue and give it 3 reels out of four.
<P>
"One Fine Day"...one fine movie?  Not quite.  How about one fun movie!!!

<H4>"The People vs. Larry Flynt"</H4></FONT><IMG SRC="reelfull.GIF"><IMG SRC="reelfull.GIF"><IMG SRC="reelfull.GIF"><STRONG>-3 reels-</STRONG><P>

Who is the great defender of America's values? Not some politician, or a flag-draped patriot.  In the new movie "The People versus Larry Flynt"...it's a pornographer.  Woody Harrelson plays Flynt, the real-life skin merchant who publishes "Hustler" magazine, a man who never intended to be the poster boy for free speech.<P>
Flynt's life is a constant swirl of sex, scandal and skirmishes with the law.
    Of course, most of "decent" America is outraged by his sex magazine and wants to do something even more outrageous, deny Flynt his freedom of speech.
      But Flynt himself isn't really all that upset.   He's concerned about his girlfriend, played by rocker Courtney Love, who wants to take away his freedom to engage in freewheeling sex, by proposing marriage...sort of.  And much as these two want to stay in bed (with each other and with who knows who else), they keep getting hauled into court   So is Flynt a hero for standing up for his rights?   Not in the traditional way of brave Hollywood heroes.<P>
   Director Milos Forman takes this picture beyond that.   Just as in his "Amadeus," we saw Mozart as something beyond the traditional idea of a musical "genius."  Gee. Mozart and Larry Flynt.
There's an odd pair, but director Foreman has made compelling films about them both.  
      And he's gotten an amazing, surprising performance from Courtney  Love as the drug-and-sex addicted lover.
       But we find out too little about what really makes Flynt act the way he does.     And in contrast to the great musical backdrop of Vienna that made Amadeus soar, the naked sleaze pit that is Flynt's life will make a lot of people reluctant to watch this movie.<P>
         The REEL story....let's give "The People vs. Larry Flynt" 3 reels out of four.  Some critics have called this film the best of the year.  It's not.  It's a good movie but not a great one like Amadeus.      
   But as he uncovered all those bodies, Flynt also uncovered some powerful truths about this country, and that makes this a really revealing movie.

4th of July Weekend. Home-Grown. All-American.  But in the movie theaters of San Diego, it's a Holiday packed with new movies featuring foreign, bizarre creatures...Aliens from Outer Space.
<P>
In "Independence Day," the aliens are just plain nasty.
Blowing up whole cities is not the way to make friends.
   And Independence Day is not an exercise for your brain.  Bad Aliens, good humans and great special effects.  Just sit back and enjoy the fireworks, the fights and the fearsome aliens.
    But the other big movie opening this week is "Phenomenon" and it asks you to think--about aliens and yourself.<P>
    John Travolta is just a small town good ol'boy.
But when he's shot thru with a white light from above, he's transformed into someone completely different.  
The uh....say it, John, the light...the aliens.  Of course, that's just ridiculous to his small-town friends.  And he's embarrassed to share all he knows, even with the doctor, played by Robert Duvall.  For most of an hour and a half, "Phenomenon" is a great movie...unpredictable, insightful.  Then, it all goes wrong.<P>
It runs out of ideas.  That seems impossible--the first part of this film glides along with fresh writing, quirky observations.
    I won't give it away, but the conclusion is so disappointing.  It's like a whole different set of bad writers finished this project.
    The reel story..."Phenomenon" almost is one...3 reels out of four.  Travolta's good.  So is most of the movie.  Give me a different ending, it would be Phenomenal.

<FONT size=2>
It's become the biggest annual movie event of the '90s.  The day when
Disney's next animated blockbuster hits the screen.


That day is today (June 23) in San Diego.
  

Does anyone not know that  "Pocahontas," successor to Lion King, Aladdin and
Beauty and the Beast, hits local theaters this morning.<P>

   
Let's zoom in for a closer look at our pal Pocahontas.  What we have is a
more serious theme and look than past Disney animated features.   Clashing
with the simple life of the tribe, a shipload of ambitious Brits, prime
among them, John Smith, voiced by Mel Gibson.
The ship, led by the greedy Governor Ratcliffe, is out to plunder the
landscape for Gold, singing all the way.<P>


In spite of a looming war between the British and the natives, romance, must bloom between
John Smith and Pocahontas.  And Pocahontas has to have cute friends to please the kids and the
marketing folk.  Meeko is a chow-hound raccoon.  Along with a pesky hummingbird, Flit, they
fulfill the "cute"  quotient.   And that's part of the problem.  With each
huge success, Disney's formula becomes more familiar and predictable.
Forbidden romance, cute sidekicks, Broadway songs.<P>


And because of the subject matter, Disney is so careful to be politically
correct that there's not much time for fun.   Thus, the REEL story on
"Pocahontas"....a very correct 2 and 1/2 reels.  Decent
songs, passable story, a wholesome lesson for kids and adults packed into a
movie you have to admire.   
But that I didn't love.

<FONT size=2>

Today, two movie thrillers.  One classic..one new.  Both very good.
   First, opening today in San Diego, the restoration of Alfred Hitchcock's "Vertigo" with Jimmy Stewart and Kim Novak.
    This new release with restored color and enhanced audio is winning raves and this is your chance to see this head-spinning, ground-breaking film the way you should--up on the big screen.  It's only one screen, by the way the AMC Mission Valley Theaters.<P>
     And while "Vertigo" was cleaned up, another thriller, "Ransom," is cleaning at the box office.
   It made 34 million last weekend, far more than the next ten most popular films combined.<P>
    It features Mel Gibson, the rich target Dad, whose son is kidnapped.  And that means powerful executive Mel has no choice but to wait for a phone to ring.  
And when that phone rings, it's the kidnapper who calls the shots.
    Gibson and Rene Russo are the frantic, stressed-out parents willing to do anything, pay any price to get out of this.  
   Leroy Lindo is the cool FBI agent trying to get their boy back using all the old traditional government tricks.
   But after playing cat and mouse on the phone, Dad can't take it anymore.
    He's not that thrilled with shelling out a multi-million dollar ransom.
    And he's beginning to doubt that the FBI has all the answers when it comes to this crime.
    That's when this thriller really moves into its highest gear, with director Ron Howard deftly at the controls.  
<P>   
When Gibson's character decides to go on TV to directly challenge the kidnapper in a game of electronic chicken, Ransom's tension is explosive.
    In fact, when the movie hits its tense finale, the term "explosive" is only too appropriate.  That ending is my only disappointment with "Ransom," which I give three reels out of four.  Won't give the ending away, but I was disappointed that, in the end, Director Howard caves in to Hollywood's fixation on violence and guns.
   Gibson's character is smarter and more courageous than everyone around him.  It would have been appropriate to have those smarts bring this picture to a more satisfying end.

Unless you've been living under a rock, you probably know the big movie opening this weekend is "The Rock," an action-film starring Sean Connery and Nicholas Cage.  And what is "The Rock?"   It's Alcatraz, of course.  And Sean Connery is the only man to ever escape.<P>
    Pitted against him, a ram-rod stiff, medal-laden General played by Ed Harris.
      Harris will launch nerve gas on San Francisco unless his demands are met.  He wants the government to pay honor and money to the families of men lost during super-secret missions.
      Nice motive...nut-case solution.  To stop him, Connery must break into the place he broke out of 30 years ago, and going with him is lab-nerd chemical freak Nicholas Cage.
Yes, you are...because no one else can disarm those nasty nerve gas rockets.  
Nerve gas, helicopters, automatic weapons--so many boy toys...so little time.<P>
      And, yes, this whole thing is dripping testosterone, but "The Rock" manages to go beyond the usual action flick.  Connery and Cage make a terrific team as they dodge the assembled mayhem.
    The script is funny and doesn't take this whole preposterous thing too seriously.
     And under the direction of Michael Bay, the pace is breathtaking, pounding and intense, and for action fans, there's a car chase that makes Bullitt look like slow-motion. 
One problem.  After 2 hours, "The Rock" exhausts both its ideas and its audience.
       You're ready to escape, but they keeping shooting and blowing things up.  Enough!    
   Cut about 20 minutes and this would be the perfect summer action movie.
        As it is, the REEL Story...3 and a half reels out of four.  Funny, surprising moments.
Good characters, amazing action.  "The Rock" is solid.

<FONT size=2>


It's the #1 movie in San Diego and the nation and has a cast that includes Robert DeNiro, Brad Pitt and Dustin Hoffman.  
     Sleepers is not about people forced to pay attention to the Political campaigns.  It's about four kids and the harsh pains of growing up.
<P>
Life's easy and fun in Hell's Kitchen in 1960's New York.  Sure, we drop off payments from the Mob to the police on the street, but hey?  Everybody understands.
   Only when a silly prank with a stolen hot dog cart goes wrong do these friends get in trouble with the law.  The court sends them to a corrupt reform school where sadistic Kevin Bacon makes their young lives  torture.
<P>    Much later, when the young kids turn into adult Brad Pitt and Jason Patric, revenge for those reform school tortures is their obsession.   But to pull off their revenge, this pair needs their old friend, Father Bobby the priest to testify...to something that never happened.<P>
Will the priest overcome his moral dilemma?  Will the grown men get revenge for crimes committed against them as boys?
   Those are the central questions in "Sleepers."  But as the crimes and sins and revenge schemes pile up in these movies, I was asking other questions.  Such as, why is one of most talented directors, Barry Levinson, wallowing in a story that has so few redeeming elements.   Unlikeable characters, burning need for revenge, lies to avenge horrid sex crimes.  
   Nasty stuff.<P>
The REEL story...a disappointing two reels out of four, considering the cast.
   And another beef about that cast, there are so few scenes with DeNiro, Hoffman and/or Pitt working together. Don't they like each other?
    And at almost two and a half hours there are times when "Sleepers" deserves the title.

<H4>"Space Jam"</H4></FONT> <IMG SRC="reelhalf.GIF"> <STRONG>-1/2 reel-</STRONG><P>
<FONT size=2>
The topic today..space.  2 films.  One great...one dreadful.
    Let's begin with great.
It's opening this weekend at the Space Theater in Balboa Park.  It's called "Cosmic Voyage" and it uses the newest computer gizmos, including some at UCSD, to produce a view of our world, from small to big, that we quite literally have never seen before.
From our normal human scale, you quickly shrink down to the most minuscule, using new computer technology to show you DNA and other teeny-tiny stuff as you've never it.
   And just as quickly, you zoom out to the scale of the entire universe and a stupendous scene of galaxies colliding.
  This cosmic voyage is a wonderful, smart, educational space odyssey.<P>

   And then...there's "Space Jam"...the most popular picture in America right now.   It's everything the IMAX film is not.  It has cartoon characters and absolutely nothing interesting or fun to say.
   Beside toons, there are humans, especially basketball star Michael Jordan who is snarred to play some nasty space monsters in a "Fate of the Universe" courtside showdown. 
<P>
Please, try to convince your child to avoid the commercial-heavy, story-free "Space Jam" which rates a dribbling 1/2 reel out of 4 on my movie scale.  Believe me, all the good lines in this film, both of them, are in the trailer, which your kids have seen 15 times since last summer. 
    Instead, take them, even if they're kicking and screaming, to Balboa Park and the Space Theater for "Cosmic Voyage."
      Someday, they'll thank you.  And you'll see the universal wisdom of my space movie tip right away.

It has the look and promises the thrills of "Alien."

   A big sci-fi film out in San Diego right now called "Species."
    It starts with an interesting premise...suppose aliens called us up and started giving us cool tips like the secret to clean, limitless energy..and then said "Hey, try our little science experiment with DNA."<P>



Maybe you tried this in High School.  
   Aliens give us new DNA instructions.  We grow a new super baby. 
    But just as the scientists realize this is a horrible trick, the beast escapes.
    It can reproduce faster than Hugh Grant.  Soon, it'll grow enough copies of itself to end civilization as we know it.


    It's now  walking around masquerading as model Natasha Henstridge. 
   She hits the Los Angeles club scene which can be a really scary place even if you're an alien death machine.
    She's looking for men to mate with.
      As you'd expect, she has no trouble.
<P>
     

    This is a film that starts with an intriguing premise that we've been talking for years and then tosses it aside for a silly, ordinary, done it a million times Monster Chase.
     Ben Kingsley has no business in this and Forrest Whittaker is way better than this material, too.
    The special effects are fine.
     It's only the characters, the stupid plot, and the botched opportunity to make a thrilling film about a fascinating topic that bothered me.<P>


  So, the REEL story on Species...
    Last week, this was the 2nd most popular movie in America.  It deserves to be the two hundred and second.
   Send this thing back to whatever solar system that alien monster came from.
   1/2 a reel out of four.   Even on video, it wouldn't be worth the rent.  "Species" deserves to be extinct, and soon, it will be. <BR>

<H4>"Spy Hard"</H4>  </FONT> <IMG SRC="reelhalf.GIF"> <STRONG>-1/2 reel-</STRONG><P>
<FONT size=2>He's got a San Diego spy code name...WD-40.  And I can't even tell you his real name because this is still a family channel.
   But in the new comedy spy spoof, "Spy Hard," the star has a lot of work to do.  Leslie Nielsen is running as fast as he can.  "Spy Hard," in fact, should be called "Try Hard," as in too hard with parodies of virtually every popular movie of the past few years.  But even with a frantic pace and guest stars like Pat Morita, this thing just isn't fresh or fun.   I've always liked silly movies like this "Naked Gun," "Hot Shots" and, of course, "Airplane."  In this entire movie, I laughed exactly once.  And that was during Weird Al Yankovic's title song, not something written into the script.<P>
     So what's missing in "Spy Hard?"  The production team of Zucker, Abrahams and Zucker, the brains behind the Airplane Movies and most of the other funny spoofs of the last decade.
     They had no part in this bomb and no part is exactly what Leslie Nielsen gets, too.
   The REEL story...I give it half a reel out of four...for Weird Al's title song.
    That's worth about 50 cents of your 7 buck ticket.  
After the opening credits are over, you can "Spy as Hard" as you want but you won't find any laughs. <BR>

<H4>"Striptease"</H4></FONT>   <IMG SRC="reelfull.GIF"> <IMG SRC="reelfull.GIF"><STRONG>-2 reels-</STRONG><P><FONT size=2>
It's got sex, comedy and a 12-million dollar star.  It has everything except a lot of clothes!  Opening this weekend in San Diego, it's "Striptease."  
     But instead of opening on a sweaty runway, we begin in court and a guy in a robe!
The judge has just stripped Demi of her world.  Come up with big bucks now, or lose her daughter to a slimy ex-husband.
   The only way for an out-of-work secretary to take on that kind of cash--take off her clothes.
    Mom turns stripper at a flashy-trashy Miami nightclub.  Demi does a great job stripping in this film but behind the scenes, her character is ashamed of what she's doing.    
That's because of sleazeballs in the audience like a dirty-minded Congressman played with lusty glee by Burt Reynolds.

And you'll feel this performance squishing any respect you had left for politicians.<P>
   With Moore, Armand Assante as a friendly cop and good cast to help, I wanted to like this tale of a noble Mom fighting for her child.  But this "Striptease," like some of the dancers, has flaws that should have been covered up. 
What kind of flaws?  Well, how does a nice Mom suddenly come up with a half-dozen different strip routines, complete with elaborate costumes and custom music in just a couple days.
       Nancy Kerrigan and Gypsy Rose Lee combined didn't have this kind of production.
        I know, I know, I'm supposed to be so knocked out by Demi's body, that I should worry about those kind of details.  But I found time to care.
        Also, the best jokes in this film are all given away in the trailer so if you've seen that, save a few bucks.  
     The REEL story on "Striptease"...just two reels out of four.
    After a couple of weeks on local movie screens, I predict the audience will be yelling "Take It Off!, Take It Off!" <BR>

It's gotten one of the biggest promotional pushes of 1996.  Written, directed and featuring 2-time Academy Award winner Tom Hanks, it's "That Thing You Do."
     It's the story of four kids in rock band caught up in the glamour of bigtime show business.  Like alll rock bands, they don't start out famous.  They're just a bunch of teens with a dream.
      Their ticket to greatness gets punched when their dumb drummer hurts himself and they have to enlist the kid at the appliance store to help them at the school dance.
       He brings them energy, excitement, a name, the WONDERS, and an ironclad offer from a local agent, who promises to get their record on the radio.
       The agent keeps his word, and within a few days, the girlfriend of the bandleader hears the band's song on the radio, and the whole town is in for a change. <P>

Under Hanks direction, this movie captures the giddy energy of teens and rock music and just keeps building as more and more band members hear their song on the radio.

So, maybe you're asking by now, where's Tom Hanks?  Isn't he in this movie? 
Answer?  He's there and he's good as a Hollywood record producer who guides "The Wonders" to fame.  
  He's not around in the opening half of this movie and Hanks shows enough self-control to keep his part relatively minor.
    And while this is not a "big" movie about grand subjects, it's an awfully good time with young appealing actors and enough small touches to make you admire Tom Hanks as director.
   The REEL story..."That Thing You Do" is a hit.  I liked it enough to give it 4 reels out of four.
    For Tom Hanks, "That Thing You Do" proves that those things he does...acting and now, writing and directing and maybe selling popcorn..are things he does very well.

He's one of America's hottest sex symbols.  He also spent his last movie in a dress!    A movie that could have been called "To Wong Foo..thanks for nothing, Patrick Swayze.

    Now, he's wearing the pants, hoping to win back his fans in his new movie "Three Wishes."<P>

   It's 1950s California!  (A lush and beautiful recreation of it, by the way).
   A young boy is trying to cope with growing up without his Dad, who was a victim of the Korean War.  His Mom, Mary Elizabeth Mastroantonio, is having a tough time, too.    It's the 50s, remember, so she can't really go off and work.  Her kids need her and her friends would never understand.

    She and the kids need a miracle and it arrives in hobo Patrick Swayze.  A guy you can talk to.  Patrick, as everyone soon learns, has some very magical connections.   And uses them to teach this family about life.

      Could be hokey, and in fact, some of this story's attempts at fablemaking don't work. But there are other moments from director Martha Coolidge that deliver chills of delight. Patrick Swayze returns to the kind of role that brought his greatest success, playing a ghost, or an angel, something from another world.<P>

     The REEL story....a mixed success....2 1/2 reels out of four.

    My advice is if you like Patrick Swayze(in pants), you'll like "Three Wishes."

    As for me, I'll use one of my wishes that this movie had been more consistently magical.

Last summer, Kevin Costner was making headlines, if not money, with the financial sinkhole called Waterworld.  
   This summer, he's got himself into a different kind of hole, a golf hole, in a movie called "Tin Cup."  
 Costner is Tin Cup McAvoy, a talented golfer wasting his life and gift away at a lonely West Texas driving range.   
      He's built a scruffy and comfortable world around lazy drinking buddies and a slow backswing.
      When a beautiful psychologist, played by Rene Russo, comes in for a few lessons, we all know where this is heading, even if the characters don't.  
      We're all about to get a lesson, and it's about more than golf.<P> 
  
     For romantic tension, Don Johnson enters as Russo's boyfriend.  He's a stodgy, successful golf pro who always beats Costner.  But now, the contest is about love.   
 Exposed?  Vulnerable?  Sounds like Costner's first meeting with the studios after his "Waterworld" fiasco.
   This is much more familiar, safer ground for Kevin.  Thank goodness golf is played on land.
     And thank goodness there's a big audience out there for movies which make you feel good, without making you think.<P>
    <P>
Costner shows he still has the kind of star power that allows him to charm his way past a silly, predictable script.  In "Tin Cup," he's fun to watch, even though this movie often heads into the rough with its message about taking chances and reaping rewards.
  So the REEL story...a ho-hum par....2 and a half-reels out of four. <BR>

     Everybody's talking about the fact "Toy Story" is the first all-computer generated feature film.  But I'd like to talk about something else....like, the plot.  

   Yes, this movie is already part of technical Hollywood history...but is it worth watching?

      I have an emphatic answer.

    But let's begin at the beginning of "Toy Story," at young Andy's House, and it's a big day for all concerned. 

     Why?

     Because it's Andy's birthday which means new toys will be joining the crew in his bedroom. That makes everyone a bit nervous--job security, you know.<P>

   The computer-generated toys and scenery are gorgeous.

   But no matter how good a movie looks, it's still the story that matters, and they didn't call this "Toy Story" for nothing. The leader of the toys, really sort of their class president, is Woody.  An old pull-toy cowboy. Woody's been the favorite for years.  But thanks to this Birthday party, Woody, voiced by Tom Hanks, has a new, powerful rival.  He's Buzz Lightyear, the latest, super-nifty new action figure.  With the voice of Tim Allen, Buzz doesn't understand that he's just a toy.  He thinks he's a real space-invader and this is foreign territory.  This is a hilarious, innovative adventure.

    And like Roger Rabbit back in the 80s, this movie used new technology to tell a story that could be told no other way.  Kids will love it's simple action and its message of loyalty and friendship.   Adults can enjoy it at an entirely different level.  There are plenty of jokes for everyone. Young and old.

    And there's more.  It's been almost a week since I've saw this movie but I'm still dazzled by its look.   Unlike anything you've ever seen.<P>

    About the only criticism I can offer is that there are too many obvious product plugs, and if you've haven't seen them already, get ready for the barrage of holiday toys from this movie. But, hey, this is Disney, after all and there are lots of other less-deserving movies out there doing the same thing.

   So the REEL story on "Toy Story"...a rave 4 out of four. 
An inventive, fresh story and wonderful time for your whole family.  My 3-year-old loved it.  I loved it.  <BR>

No, it's not the tell all confessions of Lassie and 
Morris.  Instead, it's a winning romantic tale, starring one of our sharpest young actresses, Janine Garafalo.

Abby is a talk show host, but she's no Rush Limbaugh.  Her speciality is not politics, it's pets.  She hands out smart advice on dogs and cats.
    But, Abby's self-esteem is so low, she thinks she's a Bowser herself, especially next to her gorgeous but dumb friend played by a blonde Uma Thurman. 
      When a cute guy calls with his pet problem, then asks her out, Abby's so flustered, she tells him she looks like her beautiful friend, her beautiful and empty friend.
     
When the guy comes in to the radio station meet his talk-show date in person, the girls are ready to do their switch.<P>
      Well, we know were this tale about beauty and inner beauty is going to wind up.   But it's done with enough style and Janine Garafalo carries her starring role with such charm, that it's a pleasant ride.
   Yes, it's Cyrano without the nose but the script is funny and breezy.  Ben Chaplin and Garafalo have  enough chemistry to make this one of the best date movies of the year.
      So the REEL story on "The Truth about Cats and Dogs"...It's a like your favorite pet.  It's cute, cuddly, makes you feel good and never asks too much from you.   I give it three reels out of four.<BR>

It's a natural phenomenon.
It's huge, it's loud, it's destroying everything in it's path...it's "Twister"--the movie!
    It's the biggest May movie opening ever and everybody's going to see it.  And why?  Well, not because of any big Hollywood star.
Movies are usually about people, in this one, Helen Hunt and Bill Paxton.
   But let's waste no time getting to the real star.
Yes, special effects wizardry is what's putting so many of us in those theater seats, whether it's the actual cyclone or what the storm is leaving behind.<P>
    
One of the most amazing things about "Twister" is it's ability to keep us from laughing out loud at all it's improbable crises and it's unimaginative plot.
     Under the direction of 
Jan De Bont, who also did the breathless movie "Speed," we almost forget that the romance between Paxton and Hunt is telegraphed from the first moment and that these folks run into more tornadoes in a day than real storm chasers will see in a lifetime. <P>
     
For all it's new technology, "Twister" succeeds because it follows the oldest summer movie formula around....lots of action and no need to think hard about anything (in fact, thinking too hard about "Twister" will diminish your enjoyment.)
     So the REEL story..."Twister" leaves you exhausted, blown away, like the characters, by great special effects.
    I'll admit to being sucked in by it's appeals...3 reels out of four. <BR>

<H4><FONT color="#000080">"Two If By Sea"</FONT></H4><IMG SRC="reelfull.GIF"><IMG SRC="reelfull.GIF"> <STRONG>-2 reels-</STRONG><P>

<FONT size=2>They're two of Hollywood's hottest, hippest rising stars.  Acid-tongued Denis Leary and sweet Sandra Bullock.  The two are now teamed in the appropriately named new comedy "Two If By Sea."  It starts with promise, a couple of funny, modern-day Bonnie and Clydes.  He's just stolen a famous painting, she's just along for the ride hoping that he'll someday go straight, settle down, be the "marrying" kind.  In the meantime, as the cops close in, we nag.
  
At this point, not only the cops lose direction, so does the script.  Instead of being a tightly-written, full of edgy banter, we get all squishy soft and silly.  As this movie drags itself into a predictable, soggy conclusion, my mind kept wandering off, trying to imagine how good these two actors could be in the right movie.  Which this isn't.<BR><BR>

The REEL story on the disappointing "Two if By Sea"...It's two if you ask me, just two reels out of four.
 At this point in her career, it appears Bullock is trying to show that she can be perky and attractive in any character she tries, this time as New Yawhhk girl.  She barely succeeds.   But Leary is famous for exploding with clear-eyed anger.   And I spent the whole movie waiting for his character to "go off" but it never happens.  Which means "Two if By Sea" is too bad, too tame, too dull, to be avoided.

 We all know the actress Diane Keaton.  Now, get ready for Diane Keaton--the director.    Her first feature, "Unstrung Heroes," is a film that shows great promise.

       It's a story of a boy growing up in 60s L.A., finding heroes in his confusing life.
 Little Steven, played by Nathan Watt, has a right to be confused.
    His dad is the classic wacky inventor and he's surrounded by weird relatives.  His Mom, played by Andie McDowell is the family's steady anchor.
    But she's very sick, maybe dying.

     It all to much for a 12 year old.  So, to escape the pressures, Steven decides to go live with his eccentric uncles.
     How weird are they?  Well, Michael Richard's leftist paranoid character makes "Kramer" seem almost normal.

     After living with this Uncle, little Steven decides to practice his Jewish faith and atheist Dad, played by John Turturro, is unhappy.   Should a young boy believe in God?  Do we have a right to happiness?  Who's really important to a child and his parents?<P>

 "Unstrung Heroes" touches on alot of lofty subjects like this.
    Life, death, truth and first time movie director Diane Keaton handles them deftly.   There's so much promise, so many good scenes in this movie, that I really look forward to seeing her next project.<P>

     But sometimes, the characters in this movie are so thinly drawn, so superficial,  I was wishing for something else.
      Specifically, the book from which this movie was created.
      There are times when characters are feeling emotions and acting in ways that I can't quite relate to--and I wanted to know more about them.
      But under Keaton's direction, I cared about them.<P>

    So the REEL story...3 reels out of four.  "Unstrung Heroes" is a movie I recommend.   And I recommend we keep our eye on Diane Keaton, "Director."

                 The #1 movie in
America is a modern riff
on the old Hollywood
classic--a love story that
pairs two established
names, then pits the world
against them.<P>
         Robert Redford and
Michelle Pfeiffer are the
names in "Up Close and
Personal" and one thing
is clear from the start.
It's all about star power. 
Redford and Michelle
Pfeiffer living in a
business that's all about
lighting up the screen--TV
News in Miami.<P>
    Pfeiffer starts out doing
local weather...badly.  But
with her Boss Redford as
mentor, she learns how to
do serious news, changes
her name from Sally
Atwater to Tally Atwater,
and is quickly on the road
to stardom.
   Unfortunately for her,
that road takes her to
Philadelphia and away
from her mentor and the
man she's grown to love.
<P>
 
What's best
about this movie is the time
these two big stars spend
glowing at each other up
there on the big screen.

As for the plot, it's
straight out of the movie
recycle bin.
      People who work in
TV can howl about the
movie's inaccuracies, but
nobody else cares, or
should.<P>
    The REEL story on
"Up Close and
Personal"...two reels out of
four.  One each for the
pure glamour of Redford
and Pfeiffer.
     You never forget that
you're watching two stars
instead of two believable
characters.
    Up Close & Personal?
Good title, but hardly the
appeal of this movie.
     It's not about the
story, it's the stars.  <BR>

It was a surprise hit last summer--the Brady Bunch movie.  So, of course, the curse that comes with the liking a first effort like that was that you're doomed to see another one.   And now, it's time for "A Very Brady Sequel."
<P>
It's been a year, but it's still the groovy 70s for the Brady's, until the doorbell rings.  Whoa...nasty real-time complication in our sit-com Brady World...two hubbies for Momma Carol, what a problem!
    But nothing compared to the rival of the two Brady sisters.  To prove her worth, drab Jan invents a fake boyfriend to impress her beautiful older sister Marcia.  Nice try, Jan.  
<P>
When you make a movie about an old TV show, even the first time out, it's really a sequel. That's makes this one have to work even harder to succeed.  And you probably think I'm going to say it doesn't.  Well, it does.  I had a good time.   I admired the obvious affection the filmmakers have for the original TV show, and I laughed at the scandalous fun they have with these silly characters as they stumble into the 90s.
        It's the same mixture of ridicule and "old-shoe" comfort we all experience when we watch those hopelessly dated TV shows of the 60s and 70s.<P>
    So the REEL story...  I'll swallow hard and proclaim 3-groovy reels out of four.
Don't like the Brady's?  Skip it.  But for the audience they're trying to reach, this sequel works, and it's neato-cool.

<FONT size=2>
This movie has become a true phenomenon.  After all, Oprah did her whole show on it earlier this week here on Channel 10.  It's "Waiting To Exhale," the story of four young black women struggling to make sense of their lives and relationships.  Whitney Houston and Angela Bassett head the cast, and it's a film that obviously touches a nerve, because it's touching off a lot of discussion in San Diego.  No matter where these women turn, they keep getting entangled with men who cheat, run away and treat them like disposable dirt.  Even a rich woman, played by Bassett.  She's about to go out to a party with her husband of 11 years when he decides to give her the bad news about his white mistress.  What a jerk!  That's one of the problems with "Waiting to Exhale."  That guy and all the men in this movie are such awful human beings--such stereotypes that it's hard to take the film's message seriously.  But because these losers remind so many people, especially black women, of people they've known, screenings of this movie have turned into pep rallies of female disgust.  For instance, I went to this movie in Mission Valley on Tuesday Night and the place was packed with women, cheering and booing every movie like it was a Chargers game.<P>
       
Like "Fatal Attraction" and "Indecent Proposal," "Waiting to Exhale" is a simplistic tale, full of silly stereotypes and frothy emotions and able to spark heated passion in a whole bunch of folks.  For that it deserves credit and I'll give it 2 stars out of four.  But often, the women involved commit the same sins, infidelity, fixation on their appearance, and obsession with finding a man that they ridicule just seconds earlier.  Others may find it this movie the source of endless debate, but when it comes to "Waiting to Exhale," I'm waiting for it to make more sense. <BR>

<H4>"The War at Home"</H4></FONT><IMG SRC="reelfull.GIF"><IMG SRC="reelhalf.GIF"><IMG SRC="reelfull.GIF"><IMG SRC="reelfull.GIF"><STRONG>-3 1/2 reels-</STRONG><P>
I want to recommend an excellent movie nobody will see.  It's a tough subject, and Disney, who's marketing it, makes it tough to see.  It's in only one theater here in San Diego and just two in LA.
   But this movie "The War At Home" is worth finding.  It about the Holidays in one typically American home...but it's not exactly heartwarming stuff.<P>

It's Thanksgiving morning in the prosperous Collier home.
   But nobody's in a Holiday mood.  The son, Jeremy, played by Emelio Estevez, has been back from Vietnam for a year now, but can't seem to readjust.
    His only peace comes outside, thinking, by himself.
    His sister, Kimberly Williams, tries to understand, but straitlaced Dad and manipulative Mom only get angry.
      And when sullen Jeremy gives Mom, played by Kathy Bates, another cold shoulder, she explodes.
    That particular scene is just a sample of the often-uncomfortable dialogue in this film.
<P>     
Where most movies would cave in to happy endings, "The War At Home" refuses to relent in its painful  gaze at this flawed family strained to the breaking point.
As difficult as this is to watch, it's wonderful filmmaking.  Estevez, who starred, directed and produced, and his real-life Dad, Martin Sheen, who urged his son to make this film, are both excellent.
   It's refreshing to see a movie that makes absolutely no compromises to just to please an audience so that it can make more money.
And when this film comes to it's explosive conclusion, you walk out of the theater emotionally wrung out, intellectually challenged, and thinking about what you just saw.<P>
    I give "The War At Home" 3 and 1/2 reels out of four.   A win there, but in the battle of the box office this season, the War At Home will struggle.  
    It's only at the Hillcrest Cinemas.   And only for those of us willing to stash our Holiday cheer for a couple hours.

So, after a year of hearing how Kevin Costner was breaking the budget, how is "Waterworld"...the(repeat after with me) most expensive movie ever made?
I've got the answer.

But this tale of a world without land roamed by Costner's Lone Mariner begins and ends with one astounding fact:  &#36;175 million dollars. First thing you notice, &#36;175 million buys you a really dark Hawaiian tan.

&#36;175 mill also buys you a really gnarly boat.  A 60-foot Trimaran that would make Dennis Conner turn green.
What &#36;175 million doesn't buy is a complex plot.  
<P>
The world's all wet.  
A little girl has a tatto on her back that will lead what's left of humanity back to dry land.
Out to steal her, nasty pirates called smokers. 
In scenes that looks like something you might expect next summer at Sea World, the bad guys attack the floating fort where Kevin the Mariner has found refuge.    
But the Mariner must still beat the main bad guy, the Deacon, played Dennis Hopper. The Deacon has kidnapped the girl with the tatto.   Except for the lack of twirly mustache and nearby railroad tracks, this is all something right out of old melodrama.
<P>
To be fair, "Waterworld" has a lot of good action, decent effects and its a breathless two hours.  But so are a lot of other films that cost 1/3rd the money.
You keep waiting to be dazzled, but it never happens, and for 175 million, you deserve dazzle.
You also deserve a decent performance from Costner but you don't get it.
As in Robin Hood, he can't seem to settle on one accent.
Dennis Hopper is a lot of fun but I went into this expecting some of the crisp, good-humored adventure of the Indiana Jones movies.
Not there.  Also, the plot is so simple it could be effectively staged, probably for far less money, by your kid's 5th grade class in the La Mesa community swimming pool.
<P>
So the REEL story...&#36;175 million buys just two and a half reels out of four.  

That's about &#36;70 million a reel.   Good action, good effects, lousy storytelling and a bad performance by your lead.
"Waterworld"....Universal sunk a lot of money into it and it sunk. <BR>

<H4>"White Man's Burden"</H4> </FONT>
 <IMG SRC="reelfull.GIF"> <STRONG>-1 reel-</STRONG><P><FONT size=2>
It's an interesting idea--what would happen in a United States where the 
blacks where an all-powerful majority and whites were an oppressed minority?

     We're about to head into that world in the current movie--"White Man's Burden."  <P>John Travolta is just a working man, delivering a package to his bosses' boss.    After he's accused of peeping on the wife, which he didn't do, he's fired.   And being a poor white, losing his meager paycheck is a mortal blow.

    He's evicted, his family split up.

      He goes to the haughty black suburbs to pound on the  gate of his bosses' palatial mansion.   But, of course, the boss, Harry Belafonte, is far too busy putting together a new deal with his black business buddies to deal with the petty complaints of a fired white man.  So, Travolta, who asked for two minutes of the bosses' time, instead takes two days and hides out in the white ghetto after Travolta kidnaps him. As you'd expect, the ordeal is too much for a rich business mogul.<P>

     In scene after scene, we're supposed to build up sympathy for Travolta's character.  From his eviction, to the unsympathetic stops at the unemployment office to a comically overdone scene of police brutality, black cops beating up Travolta because, of course, at night, all whites look alike.

      But instead of sympathy for Travolta, all these "reverse-the-racial stereotypes" scenes evoke an emotion that the producers of "White Man's Burden" never intended.
    I found myself saying 'I get it, I get it.'

    Instead of opening my eyes to racism in new ways, I sat in the theater  offended.  Throughout this film, the presumption is--I can understand overt racism only if it happens to someone of my own race.

   No, I can understand racism if it happens to any human being like myself, black or white or any color.   <P>

      So the REEL story...a disappointing one reel out of four.

      Presenting America's racial problems so that an audience will see it from a different perspective is an intriguing premise.  And it was done much better earlier this Fall by Spike Lee in "Clockers."

   If "White Man's Burden" sounds interesting you, I suggest you wait for "Clockers" to come out on video instead. <BR>

<H4><FONT color="#000080">Cappuccino Champions</H4></FONT><FONT size=2>

The prices on home espresso machine have come down.  But Consumer Reports warns, shop carefully.  One from a top brand just proved disappointing when testers tried to use it to make the trendy drinks, latte and cappuccino.<P>

To make a good cappuccino you need foamed milk.  And at Consumer Reports, testers used graduated beakers to find out just how much foam home espresso machines could make.  One machine made excellent espresso, but when it came time for the milk, it ran out of steam.  It's made by Braun and called the Espresso Cappuccino Pro.  It claims it can brew "up to four cups of restaurant quality espresso or cappuccino in one operation."  But it could only steam enough milk for one cappuccino.<P>

Much better:  several machines at half the price.  Their espresso isn't top-notch, but if you're adding milk, you probably won't taste the difference.  Testers recommend:  one by Krups, called the "Il Primo" at 75 dollars.  Its parts go in the dishwasher so it's easy to clean.  Less expensive but harder to clean, one by Mr. Coffee, model ECM8.  It sells for 45 dollars.  Both machines have frothing nozzles which can help a beginner to get good thick foam.<P>

There is a machine in the tests that will give you both good steamed milk and terrific straight espresso.  It costs much more, 190 dollars.  It's the Estro, model number 410.  The Estro is only sold at Starbucks.<P>

<STRONG>Here's how to reach the companies mentioned in this report:<P>

Braun (617) 592-3300, Krups (201)767-5500, Mr. Coffee (216)464-4000.</STRONG><BR><A HREF="troubleshoot.html">-back-</A></FONT>

<H4><FONT color="#000080">Better VCR's</H4></FONT><FONT size=2>

It's the hottest selling season for VCR's.  After its latest tests, Consumer Reports says very good VCR's are more affordable than ever.  Consumer Reports just tested 22 VCRs, both Hi-Fi and monophonic, from RCA, Sony, GE and other makers.  As always, the main concern was picture quality.  And testers found it can vary greatly from one model to another.<P>

A poor image came from a monophonic VCR by Goldstar, model E448.  It was one of the worst tested in terms of picture quality.  And for sound quality, no surprise, the hi-fi stereo models did best.  And many of them are about as affordable as monophonics.  So Consumer Reports says it makes sense to get a hi-fi VCR.  <P>

If you're shopping for one, the Sony 760HF is one good choice at under $400.  Testers say it has excellent sound and picture quality and extra features, like a jog-and-shuttle control for easy tape editing.  But if like most people you don't edit tapes but simply play them, there's a more affordable choice.  Testers say the 220-dollar VCR by GE, model 4528, offers a clear, sharp picture along with high-quality sound.<P>

<STRONG>Here's how to reach the companies mentioned in this report:  Goldstar (201)816-2000, Sony (201)930-6432, GE(317)241-9330.</STRONG><BR><A HREF="troubleshoot.html">-back-</A></FONT>

Fisher-Price has long made audio monitors so concerned parents can keep tabs on a baby napping in another room.  Not it and other companies are making video monitors for the nursery.  Consumer Reports just tested them.<P>

Consumer Reports called on parents to test a new device for checking on your baby.  It consists of a camera and transmitter mounted in the nursery and a video monitor you can put in any other room in the house.  It promises you can see what your baby is doing even in a dark nursery.<P>

Besides the Fisher-Price Video Monitor, Consumer Reports tested two other video monitors in the lab.  One called baby Cam as well as Safety First's TV Monitor System.  All three packages show sharp, clear close ups of babies.  But, in the tests, the monitors all gave small, fuzzy images.  <P>

Most parents thought a video monitor wasn't worth it, regardless of the picture quality.  They said an audio monitor did a find job alerting them if their baby was crying.  And instead of 300 dollars for a video monitor, you'd spend a lot less--under 50 dollars.  If you do consider an audio monitor, Consumer Reports cautions before you rely on it, test it in your home.  If the signal gets blocked by an obstruction or if you are too far away, you may not hear your baby.<P>

<STRONG>Here's how to reach brands mentioned in this report:  Fisher-Price (800) 432-5437, Smart Choice (800) 444-6278, Safety First (617) 964-7744.</STRONG>

Each year at the start of the big toy-buying season, Consumer Reports' kids' magazine Zillions tested to see which of the new crop of toys are the most fun.  But this year, one that looked like a sure winner turned out to have a serious safety hazard.  One of the most unusual new toys out this season is an electronic listening device called the Supersonic Ear.  
<P>
The 19 dollar toy is made by a company called Wild Planet.  It says you can use it to "listen to birds, insects and other natural sounds".  But when Consumer Reports videotaped kids playing with the toy, it turned out the kids listened to almost anything.  And they soon spotted a problem.  Some of the sounds that came through the headphone were painfully loud.<P>

Grownup testers in Consumer Reports labs checked to see how serious the problem was.  They fitted the headphones on a model of a child's ear.  Then they set off an alarm.  The Supersonic Ear more than tripled the sound.  It has no volume control, and testers say even common sounds heard through the toy could cause accelerated hearing loss.  Consumer Reports has rated the Supersonic Ear Not Acceptable.  Testers say it's just too easy to pick up unexpectedly loud sounds that could cause long-term damage to a child's hearing.  Consumer Reports has urged the government to recall the Supersonic Ear.<P>

Supersonic Ear has gotten a lot of publicity this fall.  It was listed as one of the toys of the year in the November issue of the Disney magazine, Family Fun.  It was also offered as a prize in a contest in the October issue of the magazine, 3-2-1 Contact.  <STRONG>Here's how to reach Wild Planet Toys, makers of Supersonic Ear:  (415)247-6570. </STRONG>

One of the latest got-to-haves for kids is an electronic organizer.  They're expensive, as much as 60 dollars.  So, Consumer Reports children's magazines asked kid testers to see if they're worth it.  <P>

At first, one of the testers was intrigued with the electronic organizer he tested for consumer reports.  It's called Casio's Message Sender Diary and costs 30 dollars.  J.P. tried using it as an address book for his friends' phone numbers, and then flipping over to a calendar to keep track of his baseball games.  What he liked most about it was that it stored all your information in one small thing.  <P>

Other youngsters tried a second electronic organizer by Casio and two by Sharp ranging in price from 30 to 60 dollars.  More money usually meant more memory so you could store more data.  But the kids found instead of storing data, they spent more time playing the games that come with the organizers.  In fact, the gadgets turned out to be an easy way to waste tine rather than organize it.  And, for many kids, after just a few days, the novelty wore off.  Devices that at first seemed like got-to-haves became has beens.<P>

If your child wants an organizer, Consumer Reports suggest borrowing one first.  Have your child try it out and see if it will be a tool or just a short-lived toy.<P>

<STRONG>Here's how to reach the brands mentioned in this report:  Sharp (201) 529-8200, Casio (201) 361-5400.</STRONG>

Prices on compact camcorders are coming down.  Consumer Reports just tested the latest models from top-selling Sony, RCA and other brands to see if lower prices mean lower quality. <P>

"Last year, you wouldn't have gotten a color viewfinder for this price."

If you've been shopping for a compact camcorder, no doubt you've been told you get more for your money these days.  You'll hear claims like that for both types of camcorder:  VHS-C, the kind of cassettes you can play back in your VCR and eight-millimeter, the kind you connect directly to your TV set for playback.<P>

Consumer Reports just tested eleven mid-priced camcorders.  And testers found some do give you more than ever before.  For instance, eight-millimeter camcorders using the Hi-8 format.  Tops in the ratings:  An 850-dollar Hi-8, Hitachi's model VM-H620A.  Testers say it gave the sharpest pictures they've ever seen from a camcorder in its price range.  <P>

To see the very best images from any Hi-8, your TV must have what's called an "S-Video" input."  If your set doesn't have one, there are two other options.  One is a standard eight-millimeter.  Rated among those:  Hitachi's VM-E220A, with high marks for picture and sound.  Your other option is a VHS-C camcorder.  One standout:  Panasonic's PV-A206.  Consumer Reports says it's the best compact VHS tested.  And best of all, these standard camcorders cost less than the Hi-8--each around $600.<P>

Among those Hitachis:  The model number for the Hi-8 is the VM-H620A, and the standard 8-millimeter's model number is the VM-E220A.  The top-rated VHS-C is Panasonic's model PV-A206.<P>

<STRONG>Here's how to reach the brands mentioned in this piece:  Hitachi (914) 332-5800, Panasonic (201) 348-7000.</STRONG>

By now the only people who haven't heard about McDonald's new burger, the Arch Deluxe, are Martians.  McDonald's spent millions to launch it, with TV ads, billboards, the works.  Consumer Reports looked behind the hype to see what you're getting.  This was one of the TV commercials that helped launch the Arch Deluxe:<P>

"Arch Deluxe?  Mmmmm...Care to join us?"  "Introducing the burger with the grown-up taste, McDonald's Arch Deluxe."<P>

Consumer Reports just evaluated the Arch Deluxe for its nutritional content and taste tested it to decode that "special-grown-up" taste.  Testers found the Arch Deluxe was basically a somewhat better version of a Quarter Pounder with cheese.  But it costs slightly more.  Compared to the Quarter Pounder with cheese, the Arch Deluxe has more complex flavor.  The bun is firmer and it also is more flavorful.  And it has a more interesting texture, mainly because of the lettuce and the slice of tomato on the Arch Deluxe.<P>

Another component supposedly appealing to adults--the sauce.  Tasters didn't detect anything too new.  Based on their evaluation, the sauce tasted like a mixture of dark brown mustard and mayonnaise, with a hint of ketchup.  As for nutrition, the Arch Deluxe had no benefits for grown-ups or anyone else.  It has just little over 30 grams of fat, which is about the same as the Quarter Pounder with cheese.  Basically, that's half the fat you're allowed in one day.<P>

If you want to eat a lower-fat meal at McDonald's, try the regular hamburger.  It's smaller, but it's also less expensive and has one third the fat.  In general, it's getting harder to find low-fat fast food.  McLean Deluxe is gone, and now McDonald's has cut back on salads, too.  Taco Bell cut back its Border Lite foods.  And both Taco Bell and Burger King have increased the size of some portions increasing both calories and fat.<P>

<STRONG>You can reach McDonald's at (708) 575-3000.</STRONG>

There's a new way to get behind the wheel of a used car--lease it rather than buy it.  The low monthly payments are tempting, but Consumer Reports says consider carefully before signing up.<P>

It's true leasing may cost less up front, and buying often means higher payments, and buying often means higher payments, but buying can be a better deal in the long run.  If you buy a car, even if you have to take a loan, you'll eventually own the car.  And there's a good chance the value of the car is going to outweigh the higher payments.<P>

Here are some tips to help you save money if you do decide to lease.  The lower the value of the car, the lower your lease payments will be.  Second tip, make sure the lease time is short, no more than three years.  And third, check the number of miles you're allowed to drive each year without being charged a penalty.  Also, check how much longer the car will be covered under the warranty.  You may need to extend the warranty so check how much that will cost.  Besides checking the warranty, Consumer Reports says also look for a guarantee that the car is in good condition.<BR><A HREF="troubleshoot.html">-back-</A></FONT>

More and more people are keeping a close eye on their blood pressure with at-home monitors.  These electronic devices can cost $150 or more.  But Consumer Reports warns, not all at-home monitors give accurate results.<P>

This cardiac nurse is showing a patient how to use an at-home blood pressure monitor.  Like many hospitals, hers recommends them often now.<P>

Eve Mogadam<BR>
Cardiac Care Nurse<BR>
<EM>"A patient's blood pressure changes a lot during the day.  And so, trying to monitor a patient and base their treatment on just one reading that we get once a month or every six months when they come to the doctor, it doesn't give us that much information."</EM><P>

Most at-home monitors read your blood pressure electronically, so they're easy to use.  But after testing 17 models, Consumer Reports says not all blood pressure monitors are accurate.  In fact, testers found, the most expensive--those that fit around your finger--are the least accurate.  Consumer Reports says every finger monitor they tested was rated not acceptable.  These instruments are so inaccurate and inconsistent that people would have a devil of a time tracking their own blood pressures.<P>

There are two other types of monitors, those that circle your wrist and those that you wrap around your arm.  Consumer Reports found the arm-wraps most accurate.  In general, they found that the closer to the heart, the more accurate the machine.  Thus, the upper arm models work better than the wrist models.  And arm wraps are the least expensive.  The highest rated was the $80 monitor by A-N-D, model UA-767.  And like most electronic models, it inflates automatically.<P>

Parents count on child safety seats to protect their youngsters.  But in recent tests at Consumer Reports simulating a 30-mile per hour car crash, a safety seat failed.  It's the same test that three seats failed last year.<P>

The first time Consumer Reports crash-tested an infant seat called the Evenflo Travel Tandem the seat passed.  The dummy stayed firmly belted and restrained.  But this first test was done without its base.  The base is designed to make the seat more convenient to use.  You can leave the base strapped in the car and snap the seat in and out.  But Consumer Reports found a problem.  When it tested the Evenflo Travel Tandem with the base, the seat failed.  The buckle broke loose and the dummy was no longer restrained.<P>

To double check its findings, Consumer Reports tested two more Evenflo Travel Tandems.  Although one passed, the other failed catastrophically.  The dummy went hurtling through the air, completely unrestrained and unprotected.  Consumer Reports says the weak area is where the buckle assembly attaches to the seat.  The seat was rated not acceptable when used with the base.  <P>

If you own one of these seats, Consumer Reports cautions, even though it's less convenient, strap it into the car without its base.  In addition, Consumer Reports has notified Evenflo and the government of the problem and urged a recall of the Travel Tandem.  If you own one of the seats, call the company so it can notify you if and when it has a plan to fix the problem.
<P>
<STRONG>Evenflo can be contacted by calling 1-800-448-6924 or writing to Evenflo at 1801 Commerce Drive, Piqua, Ohio, 45356.</STRONG><BR><A HREF="troubleshoot.html">-back-</A></FONT>

More and more people are turning from dentures to dental implants to replace missing teeth.  Some 400,000 implants are performed each year, at prices up to $4,000 per tooth, and often with no insurance coverage.  If you're considering implants, Consumer Reports has some advice that can save you money.<P>

Paul Miller's dentist is checking his dental implants.  Although they were expensive, Paul got implants because his dentures never fit.  They were loose and they hurt his gums.  Consumer Reports says that's about the only good reason to get dental implants.  Implants make sense only if you're absolutely sure you can't wear dentures.  And also if you don't want bridgework because, in order to attach it, good teeth have to be filed down.<P>

But implant surgery is complicated.  It involves drilling into the bone.  Metal pins are screwed into the bone and replacement teeth are attached to the pins, as many as eight pins for a full upper plate.  But in some cases the pins can come loose.  And re-anchoring them can take months and cost thousands of dollars more.  Consumer Reports says, if you decide on dental implants, do what Paul did.  First, get an experienced doctor, preferably one who's done at least 50 implants.  Then ask the doctor if the implant system he or she uses is accepted by the American Dental Association.  To get A.D.A acceptance, an implant system has to prove itself effective in actual  use in two five-year clinical trials.<P>

Consumer Reports says those precautions can lessen the risk of having to re-do the implants.  And that can save you thousands of dollars.  One way to find a dentist experienced with implants is to call the American Academy of Implant Dentistry.  That number is (312) 335-1550.  <P>

<H4><FONT color="#000080">Fax Facts</H4></FONT><FONT size=2>

Fax machines are getting more affordable.  Consumer Reports just tested all the major brands, including Brother, Sharp, Panasonic, Canon and Hewlett Packard.<P>

Consumer Reports tested the two basic types of fax machine.  One kind uses a roll of special thermal paper.  The other uses plain paper.  Some of the machines that use plain paper didn't deliver clear crisp faxes.  The lettering is not fully formed and it looks kind of fuzzy.  But some of the plain paper fax machines did a good job.  The best in the test--the Hewlett Packard 700.  It's expensive -- 500 dollars -- but testers say it's a good choice if you send and receive lots of faxes and if you like the convenience of plain paper.  <P>

Far less expensive, but a little less convenient are thermal fax machines.  The problem is the paper can turn brown over time, especially if it's exposed to heat or light.  So faxes you want to keep should be stored in a dark, cool place, or photocopied.  Still Consumer Reports says for many people a good, basic thermal-paper fax machine gives the best value for the money.  Testers recommend the Brother 625.  At 240 dollars, it's one of the least expensive.  And it can use a special kind of thermal paper which looks and feels more like plain paper.<P>

Consumer Reports also tested fax-combos that serve not only as a fax machine, but also as a computer printer and scanner.  Testers say the combos don't perform any of their tasks as well as separate components.  But the combos do take up less desk space and that's the primary reason to consider one.<P>

<STRONG>Here's how to reach the brands mentioned in the piece:  Hewlett Packard:  415-857-1501 and Brother:  908-356-8880.</STRONG><BR><A HREF="troubleshoot.html">-back-</A></FONT>

<FONT size=2>
<EM>posted 8/22/96</EM><P>
One out of every eight Americans now has a beeper.  They're being snapped up by families as well as businesses.  Consumer Reports  priced beepers across the country and has some money saving tips.<P>


You don't just buy a beeper, you also need the service that will page you.  Consumer Reports compared prices across the country and says shop for the service first, because it's the biggest part of the cost.  But the shopping is not easy.  Consumer Reports found the way rates and costs are quoted to be very confusing.  To really compare deals you need to know the annual cost of the beeper and the service.  That averages about $200 a year.<P>

As you compare services, check how many pages they include.  The average number that people receive is 200 a month.  Not every service gives you that.  Some services give you only 100 pages a month and then charge you for every page after that.  That can get expensive.  And don't spend more money than you have to.  Your contract may, for a fee, offer to limit your costs in case the beeper is stolen, lost or destroyed.  Consumer Reports says the beepers are so durable and so inexpensive, it's generally not worth it.<P>

Another money saver:  Limit the area where you want to be able to be tracked.  Anywhere in the country can cost $25-35 per month.  But if you can limit the range to just a few states, what some call local paging, it's cheaper, more like $6-12 a month.  Also, the Federal Communications Commission doesn't monitor the quality of services provided by paging companies.  The only way to know if a paging service will work for you is to try it.

There's a new hazard for children in the home:  vinyl miniblinds.  The Consumer Product Safety Commission found some have enough lead to cause lead poisoning.  And families with children 6 and under should throw away their blinds to be safe.  Consumer Reports has a way for you to tell if your blinds have the problem.<P>

Valerie White, like many parents now, is concerned the vinyl miniblinds in her apartment could be hazardous to her child.  Millions of imported vinyl blinds contain lead and have been shown to cause lead poisoning in children.<P>

Valerie White<BR>
Miniblind Owner<BR>
"Me and my 1-year-old daughter moved into this apartment complex and I heard about the lead in the mini-blinds, so I wanted to check it out."<P>

The only way for parents like Valerie White to know for sure whether their blinds have lead is to test them.  At Consumer Reports Susan Cronin and Bert Papenberg looked for a way to test vinyl blinds at home.  They tried a kit called Lead Check Swabs which had worked well in past tests detecting lead in paint.  The way the test works, if it shows up yellow, you don't have a lead and therefore no lead hazard.<P>

Testers found the swabs did a good job on blinds.  And worked very quickly.  When Valerie tried the same test on her blinds, the swab turned red, which means her blinds have lead.  The Kit she used is the one testers suggest you use if you want to check your blinds.  They're called Lead Check Swabs.  And if your blinds turn out to have lead, do what Valerie's done with hers, throw them out.<P>

You can buy Lead Check Swabs in hardware stores and home centers.  They come in various sizes.  A two-pack sells for roughly 6 dollars, a four-pack about 9 dollars.  If you're shopping for new blinds, the CPSC says manufacturers have stopped using lead and you should be able to find blinds marked "lead-free" in stores.<P>

<STRONG>Here's how to reach Lead Check:  505-651-7881.</STRONG>

A water slide called the Super Crocodile Mile is for sale this summer at Toys R Us and other stores.  But Consumer Reports' children's magazine, Zillions, warns the toy can be hazardous, despite how much fun it seems to be in its commercial.<P>

In the commercial for the Super Crocodile Mile, you see kids running and diving onto the slippery slide.  But Consumer Reports cautions don't let an older child or adult use it.  A warning to that effect is right on the slide.  It says it's only for 5 to 14 year olds and not for adult use due to possible neck or other serious injury.<P>

Although the manafacturer says it's had no reports of serious injuries, Consumer Reports says the slide is similar to another that has.  It's called Slip N Slide and was made by other manafacturers up until 1992.  One man died using it.  And at least 6 others suffered spinal cord injuries.  <P>

In a home video shot at the night of one of the accidents, it looks like an innocent dive onto a Slip N Slide.  No one realized the man was hurt until he couldn't move.  He is now partially paralyzed.  This type of accident is less likely to happen to children because they are shorter and lighter.  But children can still be seriously injured.  In the instructions for the Crocodile Mile, it says children over 125 pounds should not use this product.  But with one of the older  slides, a child only 13 years old and 116 pounds fractured his neck.  So Consumer Reports warns use caution with any of these slides.  Keep adults and larger children off of them.<P>

<STRONG>You can reach the makers of Crocodile Mile by calling 407-498-4000.</STRONG>

If your kids can't get to a pool, Consumer Reports tested some toys to help beat the heat.  Consumer Report's magazine for kids, Zillions asked youngsters to try out a couple of this year's toys guaranteed to get you wet.  One is called Super Soaker Twister.  To play:  attach the mat to a garden hose.  A referee calls out the colors and you have to touch them on the mat.  The more you play the wetter you get.  Some kids liked the 20-dollar game but others weren't crazy about the body contact.<P>

The youngsters also tried Shout and Shoot for about the same price.  Fill the tank and put it on.  It's voice activated - shout into the microphone and soak your friends.  Some testers loved it, and got it to spray as far as ten feet away.  But testers got a bigger blast out of the new double barrelled version of the Super Soaker water gun.  It sprayed targets as far as 20 feet away.  Fill it up with cold water, pump and pull the lever to shoot.  All the pumping left some kids pooped, but that didn't stop them from rating Super Soaker their favorite.  It costs about 25 dollars.<P>

<STRONG>Here's how to reach the products mentioned in this piece:<P>
Larami:  Super Soaker Twister, Super Soaker XXP-275 (209)439-1717<BR>

When it comes to microwaves, most shoppers think of size and power first.  Consumer Reports tested the latest models and found the biggest ovens aren't necessarily the best.  Consumer Reports tested microwaves from G.E., Sharp, Panasonic and other makers.  In all, 28 models in a variety of sizes, from compact ovens about right for a dinner plate to mid-size models that can accommodate a larger plate or casserole dish to family-size and large size microwaves, with room for even bigger casseroles to rotate. <P>
 Overall, testers found, most microwaves can handle the jobs we use them for most.  Like reheating leftovers and defrosting frozen foods.  In fact, several models make those jobs easy, with features like "Automatic Defrost."  Another feature testers found helpful: Digital displays called "word prompts."  They help you cook step-by-step.  Some of the highest marks went to a larger oven, the family-size Sharp R-4H17.  It sells for $200.<P>
  But Consumer Reports says you can do just as well with a slightly smaller oven:  The 140-dollar mid-size General Electric, model JE940.  It gets high marks for heating and defrosting.  And testers even have praise for its window.  It's one of the clearest, they say, for keeping an eye on what's cooking inside. <P>

Snack foods made with the controversial fat-substitute, Olestra, are now being sold in three test markets.  Besides no fat, they promise good taste.  Consumer Reports tested to see just what they offer, good and bad.<P>

Here's what they look like:  The new "Max" snacks, tortilla and potato chips made by Frito Lay with the no-calorie fat substitute, Olestra.  Consumer Reports tasters sampled the Olestra chips.  And, without knowing which was which, they compared them to Frito Lay's baked low-fat and regular chips.  Testers found the Olestra chips did taste good.  They said most people probably wouldn't know they're fat-free.  They taste just about as good as the full-fat chips, and far better than the low-fat chips.<P>

While Olestra sounds like a dieter's dream, Consumer Reports points out, the Food and Drug Administration has only approved it for snack foods.  And they have to carry a warning:  Olestra may cause abdominal cramping and loose stool.  Consumer Reports says that's not the only potentially serious health problem involved.  As Olestra passes through the digestive tract, it absorbs some nutrients from some foods you may have just eaten and takes them right out of the body.<P>


To offset the losses, Frito Lay is required to add vitamins to the chips.  But other lost nutrients aren't replaced.  So far, Olestra has not been approved by the FDA for any other foods.  And Consumer Reports says, before it is, much more research is needed on Olestra's effects.
Right now, the Olestra chips are only sold in three test markets:  Cedar Rapids, Iowa; Eau Claire, Wisconsin; and Grand Junction, Colorado.  <P><STRONG>Here's how to reach Frito-Lay:  (800) 483-7486.</STRONG><BR><A HREF="troubleshoot.html">-back-</A></FONT>

For the toughest cleaning jobs in the kitchen and bathroom, most people use scouring cleansers.  Consumer Reports just tested all the leading brands like Bon Ami, Comet and Ajax to see which clean the best.<P>

The scrubbing machine is the heart of Consumer Reports' test to see how well cleansers clean.  The sponge moves back and forth 1000 times at a uniform pressure across a glass panel coated with bake-on lard.  Afterwards Consumer Reports checked to see how much each cleanser was able to scrub off. <P>

All the cleansers did at least a good job of getting the panel clean.  That was true whether it was Bon Ami, Comet or Ajax or any of the 16 products tested.  Testers also checked how well the cleansers got out various stains -- everything from rust to one of the toughest stains of all -- dried soap scum.  <P>

A cleanser called Bar Keepers did the best job.  But it left behind a lot of scratches.  So save Bar Keepers for tough stains you can't get out any other way.  For most jobs in the bathroom, you're better off buying a cleanser that scratches less.  Testers say the best choice is Bon Ami.  It did a good job on a variety of stains.  And it is also one of the least expensive cleansers.  Bon Ami is available in most grocery stores.  You'll find Bar Keepers Friend in some grocery stores as well as hardware stores, K-Mart and Walmart.<P>

<STRONG>Here's how to reach the brands mentioned in this story:  Bon Ami (816) 842-1230, Comet (513) 562-1100, Ajax (212) 310-2000, Barkeepers Friend (317) 636-7760.</STRONG><BR><A HREF="troubleshoot.html">-back-</A></FONT>

The makers of Levi's are getting the jump on a hot new trend -- women's custom-fit jeans.  The price is steep -- more than twice you'd pay for most regular jeans.  Consumer Reports tested to see if they're worth buying.<P>

Here's how Levi's makes what it calls a "personal pair" of jeans.  The salesperson measures your waist, your hips and what's called your rise.  Then you try on a prototype.  The first pair may not fit perfectly.  One you find a pair you like, the salesperson puts in an order for one cut to your measurements.  The cost:  65 dollars.<P>

Consumer Reports checked out what you get.  The first thing they noticed is the 65 dollar jeans didn't come with a top-quality zipper.  You have to make sure the tab is placed in the down position to lock it.  If you leave it in any other position, it opens right up.  As for the fit, testers found the jeans did fit, but not well enough to justify 65 dollars.  You can easily find a pair of jeans for 30 dollars that will fit you just as well.  <P>

All you need is your favorite pair of jeans and the same tool they use in the Levi's store -- a tape measure.  Measure across the waist.  Measure 9 inches down from the waist to determine the hip.  Measure across the hip.  Measure the rise both front and on the back side.  Bring your tape measure to the store and measure before you try them on.  That way you can find one that fits without trying on a lot of pairs.<P>

Consumer Reports recently tested women's jeans and recommends several you can buy off the rack that cost around 30 dollars.  One good choice:  Lee Classic Fit, or, if your waist is small in relation to your hips, the Chic Junior Relaxed Classic.  Levi's personal fit jeans are sold in Levi's stores located in the following cities:<P>
CA:  Costa Mesa<BR>
FL:  Boca Raton<BR>
GA:  Atlanta<BR>
IL:  Skokie<BR>
KS:  Leawood<BR>

Tours and cruises can cost thousands of dollars.  If at the last minute you can't go, you're liable to lose all your money unless you've bought travel insurance.  But, Consumer Reports Travel Letter cautions, all policies are not alike.<P>

Helen Epps and her mother laid out more than seven-thousand dollars for a trip to Egypt.  At the last minute they couldn't go.<P>

Helen Epps<BR>
Vacationer<BR>
"About ten days before the trip was to begin, my aunt, my mother's sister was diagnosed with a serious illness.  We decided we had to cancel."<P>

Fortunately, Helen and her mother had travel insurance that refunded all their money.  A good policy offers three key types of coverage.  You need coverage if you or a family member gets sick.  You need trip insurance if your travel plans are interrupted.  And you need coverage if the tour operator or travel supplier goes out of business.  <P>

You can buy travel insurance from your travel agent or from the cruise line or the tour that's putting together the trip.  But Consumer Reports says those are not the best choices.  If you get your insurance directly from the tour operator or from a travel agent, you're not really protected if they go out of business.  Your best bet is to buy the insurance directly from the insurance company.  A good policy will run about five or six percent of the total cost of the trip.<P>

Consumer Reports Travel Letter surveyed the field and found some best buys in travel insurance-- A Tour and Cruise Policy from Access America, Plan A-129 from a company called CSA, or a customized policy from Travelers.  The policies from CSA, Access America and Travelers have an added benefit.  They cover the cost of emergency medical evacuation at no extra charge, if you get sick or have an accident in a remote area. <P>

<STRONG> Here's how to reach the insurance companies mentioned in this report:  Travelers at 800-243-3174, CSA at 800-348-9505 and Access America at 800-284-8300.</STRONG><BR><A HREF="troubleshoot.html">-back-</A></FONT>

Engine and motor oil treatments have been selling for decades, and they're still going strong.  Consumer Reports tested to see if they give car engines the extra protection they promise.<P>

These taxi cabs are testing motor oils for Consumer Reports.  Some of them are also testing products you add to the oil, hoping for even better engine protection.  The products:  Slick 50 Engine Treatment.  It claims "Proven Protection."  STP Engine Treatment.  Its label says "Reduces Engine Wear."  And STP Oil Treatment.  Its claim:  "Formulated to Reduce Engine Wear."  Consumer Reports put each of the treatments in three cabs.  <P>

After 60,000 miles, the engines were taken apart.  And testers checked for wear and harmful deposits.  Consumer Reports says the treatments seemed to make little difference.  They found that the engines with the oil and engine treatments had virtually the same amount of wear and deposits as those that didn't have the treatment.  So, the treatments showed no advantage there.  But one showed a potential disadvantage.  The STP Oil Treatment made the oil much thicker than plain oil.  And Consumer Reports says that could be a problem in the winter.  Cold temperature makes a motor oil thick.  If an oil treatment makes the oil even thicker, it might not flow through your engine quickly enough to prevent engine damage.<P>

So, Consumer Reports says it found no reason to add any of the treatments tested, as long as you're using a high-quality oil.  One final note:  STP Engine Treatment is no longer being manufactured.  But Consumer Reports found it still available on store shelves recently.  And until supplies run out, you, too, might find it still being sold.<P>

<STRONG>Here's how to reach the brands mentioned in this report:  Slick 50 - (800)562-5928, STP (203) 731-2300.</STRONG>

The Neon burst on the scene more than a year ago with commercials that portrayed it as a car so friendly it said "Hi."  Now the Neon, sold both at Plymouth and Dodge dealers, is in its second model year, and Consumer Reports looks at how well it's holding up.<P>

Andrew Wetsorp has had more trouble with his Neon than he thought he would with a new car.  It makes an annoying rattle the dealer hasn't been able to fix and last summer the air conditioning broke.  Andrew is not alone.  Consumer Reports most recent survey of its subscribers found people with Neons had more problems than owners of any other small car.  Consumer Reports found the Neon had more than 50 problems per hundred cars.  Whereas the most reliable small car had only about 11 problems per hundred cars.<P>

Like Andrew, some owners complained of rattles and broken air conditioners.  Others had problems with the electrical system, the fuel system, the exhaust system, the brakes and the suspension.  And there were many complaints about faulty windows, doors, wipers and locks.  Consumer Reports says getting a new Neon is like getting a car with as many problems as the average old car.<P>

If you are in the market for a small car in the same price range, around 15-thousand dollars with the options most people want, Consumer Reports says there are better choices.  They include:  the Honda Civic that offers a comfortable ride for a small car, the Mazada Protege that's relatively roomy and the Checy Cavalier and its cousin the Pontiac Sunfire that have quick steering and well laid-out controls.  All have a much better record of reliability than the Neon.<P>

The makers of Rogaine say sales have sky-rocketed in the last two months.  That's after the hair loss treatment became available without a doctor's prescription.  Consumer Reports took a look at Rogaine's new marketing campaign.  If you listen closely to the new commercial for Rogaine, you see it only promises to help "some" people who are losing their hair.  <EM>"Rogaine goes to the root of your hair and for some people gets it to grow."</EM>  But, <EM>"some people"</EM> isn't very many, says Consumer Reports.  If you read the fine print on the box, you see your odds aren't very good.  Only about one in every four men show even modest hair growth.  And truly dense hair growth is very rare.  That's true whether you try the blue box that says it's for men or the white box that says it's for women.  The ingredients are the same.  The different colored boxes are just a marketing strategy.<P>

The commercial also tries to make the best of Rogaine's limitations.  "What do you have to lose?  Nothing I guess, except more hair."  But the odds are you'll also lose quite a bit of money.  A one month supply costs 30 dollars.  It may take four months, or 120 dollars, before you get any results.  And to see your best response, it can take up to a year.  That's 360 dollars.  And it doesn't stop there.  Even if you find Rogaine is helping your hair grow, you'll have to keep on using it twice a day indefinitely.  If you have to stop using it, any hair you've grown will fall out. <P>

Bottom line, Consumer Reports says trying Rogaine is an expensive gamble and the odds are against you.  The makers of Rogaine have also launched a new shampoo called Progaine.  While it doesn't claim to help you grow hair, the names seem to imply that it does.  Consumer Reports says that it doesn't. <P>

<STRONG>Here's how to reach Upjohn, makers of Rogaine:  (616) 833-6546.</STRONG><BR><A HREF="troubleshoot.html">-back-</A></FONT>

Temporary tattoos are a hit with kids.  Some come free in boxes of cereal or packages of gum.  Others cost about a dollar for several in a pack.  Consumer Reports kids magazine, Zillions, tried them out with a team of tattoo testers.  Consumer Reports' Zillions magazine asked  youngsters to test the staying power and removability of temporary tattoos.  It was no problem finding recruits.<P>

The youngsters tried two basic types.  The first type goes on wet skin.  You press down firmly and then pull off the paper to reveal the image.  A second type goes on dry skin.  Then you hold a damp cloth over the tattoo and wait 30 seconds.  Then you pull off the paper backing. <P>

The kids put tattoos of both types down their arms and inspected them every day to see how long they lasted.  Consumer Reports also took a slide every few days to chart the progress.  The tattoos that went on wet skin were gone after a day or two.  The ones that went on dry skin lasted longer, some almost a week.  But, if you want to get them off sooner, Consumer Reports found rubbing alcohol does the best job.  It just takes a couple of swipes.<P>

Consumer Reports has a caution:  only use temporary tattoos that list the ingredients on the label.  On some people the tattoos can cause a rash and as long as you have a list of ingredients a doctor may be able to tell you what caused it.<BR><A HREF="troubleshoot.html">-back-</A></FONT>

Mountain bikes that cost less than $200 are big sellers.  But Consumer Reports found two were not safe last year:  They were almost impossible to stop when wet.  This year two more have the same problem. <P>

This is one of the toughest tests Consumer Reports gives bikes.  It measures how long they take to stop in wet weather.  A stop in 18 feet or so is considered good.  But among the six bikes in this year's test, two couldn't do anything close to that.  One bike by Huffy travelled 55 feet before it stopped.  It was judged not acceptable.  Its full name, the Huffy Bay Watch.  A bike from Zanzibar continued for 75 feet before it finally stopped.  This bike just went way past what Consumer Reports considers to be acceptable wet stopping distance.  So Consumer Reports rated it not acceptable.  Again, it's the Magna Zanzibar.<P>

The problem is the brakes on both bikes are side-pull brakes and the rims are made of shiny steel.  Both are okay in dry conditions, but not in wet.  Steel rims are slippery when they're wet.  And side-pull brakes are not the most powerful.  This is a bad combination in wet weather.  Consumer Reports advises you not to buy any bike with side-pull brakes and shiny steel rims.  They just won't stop you soon enough on a wet day.  If you're shopping for bikes and trying to avoid steel rims, testers say take a magnet.  If it sticks, it's steel.<P>

One bike by Huffy that Consumer Reports tested last year failed the braking test and was rated not acceptable.  It's still on the market and it's called the Huffy Blades.  Both of the not acceptable bikes passed the government's braking standard for bikes.  But that's a brake test on dry pavement.  There's no government test for braking when wet.<P>

<STRONG>You can reach Dynacraft, the maker of the Dyna Zanzibar at 508-881-2129.  You can reach Huffy at 513-866-6251.</STRONG><BR><A HREF="troubleshoot.html">-back-</A></FONT>

If you're shopping for a mountain bike costing less than $200 be careful.  Some have serious braking problems.  However, Consumer Reports just tested two that do stop safely even when wet.  Consumer Reports first walks the Huffy Eco Terra through the sprinklers to get it wet.  Then they simulate a panic stop on wet pavement to see how long it takes the bike to react.  To pass this test, a bike has to stop in 40 feet.  This bike took only 18.  One by Murray called the Astra also did well, stopping in 19 feet.<P>

Of the two bikes, the Astra is less expensive.  But testers are concerned the braking system may not hold up.  The rim is painted and after a while the paint will wear off and will get down to plain steel.  In the past, Consumer Reports has had problems with braking performance with plain steel rims and this type of brake.  The Eco Terra has a better type of braking system.  Its rims are aluminum and it has cantilever brakes.  Cantilever brakes are very powerful.  And aluminum rims are less slippery when wet.  This whole system works very well in the rain.<P>

The Eco Terra is made by Huffy and sells for about $170.  Testers say don't expect it to be as enjoyable to ride as a more expensive bike, but if you go out only a couple hours a week this might be okay for you.  Before you buy the Eco Terra testers suggest you ride it and ride bikes in the $200-300 price range to make sure it's right for you.  <STRONG>You can reach Huffy at 513-866-6251 and Murray at 800-528-5087.</STRONG><BR><A HREF="troubleshoot.html">-back-</A></FONT>

<FONT color="#000080"><H4>Best Skates - Part I</H4></FONT><FONT size=2>
Rollerblading is already more popular with adults than tennis and fast overtaking golf.  Consumer Reports tested a range of skates for everyone from beginners to devotees.  The tests included an unusual setup to check rollability.  The skater, outfitted in protective gear, is harnessed to a treadmill.  Testers at Consumer Reports found this a good way to judge how easily skates roll.  On top-quality skates the wheels spin freely and require little effort to skate in.  The tests showed some skates roll much more easily than others.<P>

Next, it was outside for the braking tests.  A radar gun made sure the testers were skating an even seven miles an hour.  When the testers reached the orange cones, they hit the brake.  All the skates stopped safely.  Then the testers checked how easily the skates turned.  Some moved around the cones without trouble.  Others took a lot more effort.  They were so stiff, the testers couldn't balance properly.  That made it harder to maneuver around the cones.<P>

In the end, the best in the tests were the most expensive.  But testers say if you skate more than a couple of times a week, they'd be worth it.  One good choice--the Rollerblade Macroblade Maxxum.  It sells for $279.  Another winner is made by Roces called the LAXALF.  It's $285.  Both handle very well and roll smoothly even on rough pavement.<P>

<STRONG>Here's how to reach the brands mentioned this story:  Roces (800) 770-8750 and Rollerblade (612) 930-7000.</STRONG>

Consumer Reports just tested Rollerblades and other in-line skates.  The best cost hundreds of dollars.  But if you're just starting out or you only plan to skate a little on the weekends, testers found some good buys.<P>

No matter what your level of skill, some skates make skating a lot more enjoyable.  You want a pair that lets you bend your ankle forward so you have better balance.  You should look for a skate that lets you get in the proper position.  It should have what's called a "hinged cuff."  A skate with a hinges cuff allows you to flex your ankle forward so you can maintain your balance while you're skating.  Also make sure the wheel bearings are high quality.  The initials ABEC mean they've met specific standards and will spin more freely than wheels without the ABEC rating.<P>

As for brakes, there are several types.  Consumer Reports says the easiest to masters for beginners is what's called a cuff-activated brake.  When you push your foot forward, your leg pushes the cuff back, which pushes the lever back, which pushes the brake into the ground stopping you.  For a skate with this type of brake, testers recommend one by Rollerblade called the Spiritblade ABT.  It sells for $159.  With a little more effort, you can learn to use a heel-stop brake.  Testers say a best buy with that brake is the Ultra-Extreme made by a company called Ultra-Wheels.  It sells for $139.  Like any good skate, it has cuffs that le you flex your ankles and ABEC-rated bearings that deliver a smooth, easy ride.<P>

At the store, you'll see cheaper adult skates selling for as little as $50 or $60.  But Consumer Reports says don't be tempted.  Testers said they were uncomfortable and hard to use.<BR><A HREF="troubleshoot.html">-back-</A></FONT>

<H4><FONT color="#000080">Better Blue Jeans</H4></FONT><FONT size=2>

Jeans are more popular than ever.  Over half a billion pairs were sold last year.  Consumer Reports just tested 34 different kinds of blue jeans and found some from big name makers have zippers that could let you down.  <P>

Plenty of people who wear jeans don't know what a double-cam zipper is.  But Consumer Reports says a double-cam zipper is worth looking for.  But many jeans just come with a single-cam.  A single-cam zipper is if the tab is in the up position, it opens right up.  Double-cam zippers are more secure.  And there's a simple test you can do in the store to check for them.  Take the tab and push it in the down position, it locks.  Take the tab and push it in the up position and lock it.  If it doesn't fall apart in either position you have a double-cam zipper.  You should also check for flaws in the fabric.  If thread is missing, it can cause a weak place in the denim.    This can wear in the wash and you'd be left with a hole.<P>

In the end, the testers did find several jeans that were well-constructed.  For women Lee's Classic Fit is a good choice.  So are jeans made by Riders called Relaxed Fit.  Both cost between 25 and 30 dollars.  Consumer Reports tests also turned up some good choices for men:  one from the Gap called Easy Fit and one from Lee called Relaxed Fit.<P>

<STRONG>Here's how to reach the manufacturers mentioned in the story:  Lee & Rider (913) 384-4000, Gap (415) 952-4400.</STRONG>

Many people have trouble getting blue jeans that fit.  And after testing jeans Consumer Reports says that's not surprising.  Testers found problems with sizing and shrinkage.  One of the tests was done with the help of a special machine nick-named Johnny Jumper.<P>

Meet Johnny Jumper.  Consumer Reports outfitted him with inflatable hips and legs so he could fit snugly in any pair of jeans.  He's hooked to pistons and pneumatic tubes so he can stretch jeans the way you would after they're washed.  In all, Johnny Jumper tried on dozens of just-washed jeans from major brands.  They all shrank, but Johnny Jumper showed they all stretched back in the waist, hips and thighs.  The length was a different story.  Consumer Reports found that some of the jeans shrank an inch or more in length and this didn't relax or stretch back out when the jeans were worn.  Testers found the jeans that shrank the most were some from Wrangler, Bonjour and Rustler.  So you may want to buy those on the long side.  <P>

Another problem:  you can't count on the label to tell how jeans will fit.  You may think those labled slim fit will be slimmer than those labeled relazed fit.  But testers found that's not always the case.  Still another problem:  testers found you can't count on jeans from the same brand, in the same style and size to fit the same.  Lee Relaxed Fit was the worst.  Consumer Reports took two pairs of jeans, both a size 12 medium.  However, one pair is three inches larger in the hips than the bottom pair and the length is two inches shorter.  So when you finally find a pair of jeans that fits, don't buy a second pair without trying that one on too.<P>

Obviously, if you buy jeans by catalog, you can't try them on to make sure they fit.  But Consumer Reports found a good choice:  women's Relax Jeans from the Lands' End catalog.  The measurement table was very helpful in getting the right size and the sizes were consistent, so if you buy one pair, a second pair is likely to fit also.<P>

<STRONG>Here's how to reach the brands mentioned in the story:  Wrangler & Rustler (910) 384-4000, Bonjour (212) 398-1000, Lee (913) 384-4000, Lands' End (800)356-4444.</STRONG><BR><A HREF="troubleshoot.html">-back-</A></FONT>

For most of us, springtime means more activity.  Consumer Reports has tested some products you can buy to treat the aches and pains that go with it.<P>

Doctors say the best way to treat minor aches and pains and reduce swelling is to apply an cold pack as soon as possible.  Consumer Reports just tested two kinds of cold packs:  Ones you can keep with you, they get cold when you squeeze them.  And packs you have to keep in a freezer.  Each one was tested on a simulated arm.  It's a copper pipe heated to body temperature by water circulating through it.  It's covered with fabric to act the way skin would, as an insulator.  And it's covered temperature sensors.  The cold pack is then applied around it for observation.<P>

The computer showed how well each pack cooled the test arm down.  The portables proved good for on-the-spot first aid.  Packs you keep in the freezer get colder; they're reusable, and may have other advantages.  Some of them have a wrap around them.  And they cost a little more, but they're good because they can hold the pack on and keep it compressed against you.  But you don't have to spend the $20 or more a cold pack can cost.  Consumer Reports says, for a dollar or two, a bag of frozen mixed vegetables works as well with most packs.  And it's reusable.  So you can go several games on one bag.<BR><A HREF="troubleshoot.html">-back-</A></FONT>

<FONT size=2>
If you're in the market for a used car, take note.  Consumer Reports says there are some you should avoid due to serious transmission problems.  <P>

Polly Bijur and her husband bought a Ford Taurus new in 1991.  Last year, while on the highway, its transmission failed.<P>

Polly Bijur<BR>
Car Owner<BR>
"My husband was able to coast off to the side of the road and the car just stopped.  He couldn't get it into reverse or forward.  He couldn't get into any gear after that."<P>

Consumer Reports says a transmission should last for the life of the car.  But hundreds of people have told the magazine they've had transmission troubles with three Ford cars from 1991--the Taurus, its twin, the Mercury Sable, and the Lincoln Continental.  In Consumer Reports' annual survey last year, nearly 20% of the respondents who owned a '91 Taurus, Sable or Continental said they had serious problems with their transmission in the previous year.  That's nearly four times the average.<P>

Two years ago, Ford extended the transmission warranty on those models to six years or 60,000 miles, whichever comes first.  And when Polly submitted her nearly $1,600 repair bill, Ford reimbursed her.  But now Consumer Reports says other owners might not be so lucky.  Many of these '91 cars are close to the 60,000-mile mark.  So the warranty's about ready to expire, just when the owners need it most.  And Ford says they won't re-extend the warranty.<P>

So, Consumer Reports says to avoid these used cars:  the 1991 Ford Taurus, Mercury Sable and Lincoln Continental.  And if you own one of those cars and have transmission problems, try to get your local Ford dealer to fix it at no cost.<P>

Ford isn't alone.  Consumer Reports says Chrysler is having transmission problems with some of its older model minivans.  They're the 1989, '90 and '91 Dodge Grand Caravan, Plymouth Voyager and Chrysler Town & Country, along with their 1992 4-wheel drive versions.<P>

<STRONG>You can reach Ford's customer assistance department at (800)392-3673 or Ford headquarters at (313)322-9600.</STRONG>

Full-sized sport utility vehicles can now cost $30,000 or more.  So, less expensive models are becoming more popular.  Consumer Reports says at least one maker is taking advantage of this with a car that seems like a SUV but isn't.  It's called the Outback, as in the rugged outdoors.  And its commercials show it driving through water and even over railroad ties.  Subaru calls it the world's first sport utility wagon.  But Consumer Reports says the Outback isn't designed to go where sport utility vehicles go.<P>

The owner's manual states that the Outback is not designed for off-road use, and as a matter of fact, it's even unacceptable for rough roads.  Consumer Reports says that's because it's really a Subaru Legacy station wagon made to look like an SUV.  But testers found there are small cars that are genuine SUV's.  They are the Suzuki Sidekick and its twin, the Geo Tracker, and two new models, Suzuki's super-small X-90 and the Toyota RAV4.  In repeated trails at the test track, all of these proved to handle and stable even in sharp turns.  They get better fuel economy than full-sized SUV's, up to 12 miles per gallon more, which means they're also less popular.  And they're less expensive, with prices starting under $15,000.  Consumer Reports says, if you're looking for economy and off-road driving, these small SUVs are worth considering.<P>

<STRONG>Here's how to reach the manafacturers mentioned in the story:  Subaru (609) 488-8500, Toyota (310) 618-4000, Suzuki (714) 996-7040, Geo (313) 556-1385.</STRONG><BR><A HREF="troubleshoot.html">-back-</A></FONT>

Before returning a rental car, you used to have to hunt around for a gas station to fill the tank.  Now car rental companies have a new system that sounds like a lot less hassle.  Major car rental companies like Avis, Hertz, Alamo and Dollar are promoting a new deal on gasoline.  Rather than returning the car with a full tank, you buy the tank of gas that comes with the car and return it empty.<P>

In a recent nationwide investigation, Consumer Reports found rental outlets going to extremes to push this option.  At the Dollar outlet in Orlando, the fuel was already added to the bill even though no one asked for it.  Consumer Reports says buying gas in advance is almost always a bad deal.  When you return the car, you don't get a refund for any gas left in the tank.  And, of course it's nearly impossible to return a car completely empty.<P>

And there may be another problem:  you may get overcharged.  At the Hertz outlet in Newark Airport, a sign was posted saying that gas was sold at the going rate.  Problem was it wasn't the going local rate.  When Consumer Reports checked nearby gas stations, they were all selling gas for 10 to 20 cents less a gallon.  So, if you fill the car up yourself, you'll save money.  But make sure you return it as full as possible.  If you don't Consumer Reports found car rental companies will charge you three or four dollars a gallon to top off the tank.<P>

One more tip about rental cars and gasoline.  Check the gauge when you get it in to make sure it's full.  Consumer Reports found about one third of the cars it rented during its investigation came with less than a full tank.  If that happens to you, report the problem to the rental office before you drive off.<P>

<STRONG>Here's how to each the companies mentioned in the story:  Avis (516) 222-3000, Hertz (201) 307-2000, Alamo (305) 522-0000, Dollar (918) 660-0033</STRONG>.<BR><A HREF="troubleshoot.html">-back-</A></FONT>

The cost of returning a car has gone way up.  But, after a nationwide investigation, Consumer Reports has found several ways you can cut your costs.  This is one of the most expensive ways to rent a car...walk up to a car rental counter without a reservation.  Consumer Reports says the price you're quoted will be the highest they have.  You get the best deal of all is you make a reservation several weeks in advance.  <P>

Consumer Reports says it also pays to compare prices.  It called eight major rental companies and found for the same size car in the same city for the same week, you could save as much as $185 on a weekly rental by shopping around.  At the time Consumer Reports checked, National had some of the cheapest rates and Thrifty the most expensive.  But you won't know for sure unless you call.  And be sure to ask about any discounts for membership in Triple A or other organizations.  Typically, discounted rates are 10-40 percent cheaper.  So it pays to ask.<P>

If you need a rental car for more than a couple days, you get the best rate by calling the car dealer in the city you're visiting.  Consumer Reports found a Ford dealer in Seattle that offered a weekly rate of $139, while the national outlets wanted almost twice as much.<P>

<STRONG>Here's how to reach the companies mentioned in the story:  Avis (516) 222-3000, National (612) 830-2121, Thrifty (918) 665-3930.</STRONG><BR><A HREF="troubleshoot.html">-back-</A></FONT>

Electric outdoor grills are the latest alternative to charcoal.  They cook without a flame.  And at $100 to $300, they cost less than many gas grills.  When Consumer Reports tested grills, it looked at two electrics, including one that's earned praise for its looks.  One grill, made by Thermos, is called the Thermal Electric.  When it was introduced in 1993, it won several awards for its design.  Popular Mechanics magazine said, "Barbecuing takes on a futuristic look" and Appliance Manufacturer magazine said, "Outdoor cooking will never be the same."  <P>But Consumer Reports says the Thermal Electric has a design problem.  Its instructions say, "Do not touch hot surfaces.  Use handles or knobs."  But testers found, that doesn't always help.  The handle on the lid is positioned so that when you raise the lid, the hot edge can touch your wrist.  And the edge of that lid can reach 230 degrees.  That's hot enough to cause a painful burn.  Consumer Reports gives a Not Acceptable rating to the Thermal Electric by Thermos, because of that problem.<P>

The other electric grill tested doesn't have that design flaw.  But testers found it took a long time to heat up--56 minutes.  That's compared to less than 14 minutes for many gas grills.  As for cooking, the electrics got mixed reviews.  Both grills did a good job with slow-cooked meats like chicken and fish.  They were juicy and not dried out.  But neither grill got hot enough to really do a good steak.  Consumer Reports says from the two tested, it's easy to see why electrics are a lot less popular than gas or charcoal grills.<P>

<STRONG>Here's how to reach the manufacturer mentioned in the story:  Thermos  (815)232-2111.</STRONG><BR><A HREF="troubleshoot.html">-back-</A></FONT>

Drug companies now spend upwards of 400 million dollars a year advertising prescription drugs directly to you.  By government regulation those ads must carry detailed information about side effects.  Consumer Reports found some of them don't tell you everything you need to know.<P>

You can't buy prescription drugs from a pharmacy without a prescription.  But drug companies hope you'll ask a doctor to prescribe their medicine once you've seen their ads.  Consumer Reports showed dozens of advertisements for prescription drugs in popular magazines to a panel of 32 doctors.  They found while many of the ads supply useful, accurate information, others omit certain facts. <P>

Take this ad for Habitrol that says it can "increase the chances of stopping smoking."  It says you can increase your chance of stopping smoking with the medication.  But it doesn't say most people stop smoking on their own.<P>

This ad for a drug to treat a condition called rosacea says pimples may be the first sign you've got it, but left untreated you can get "broken blood vessels" and your "nose can swell."  Only in fine print does it say the drug just helps treat papules, pustules and erythema.  In nontechnical language, that means it only treats pimples and redness.  No matter what problems the ads claim to solve, all promote drugs as the treatment.  It's promoting a serious medication with potential side effects for a problem most children simply outgrow.<P>

Bottom line, these ads aren't public service messages.  They're meant to sell drugs.  And the drug they're advertising may not be the best choice for you.  If you want to get unbiased information about drugs, there are several good reference books in the library.  That includes one from Consumer Reports called "The Complete Drug Reference." <P>

<STRONG>Here's how to reach the drug companies mentioned in the piece:  Habitrol:  Ciba (908) 602-6600, Metrogel:  Galderma Laboratories  (610)454-8000.</STRONG><BR><A HREF="troubleshoot.html">-back-</A></FONT>

There's good news for grownups who have been shelling out 30 dollars or more for electronic games for their kids.  Consumer Reports' children's magazine<EM> Zillions</EM> found good ones that cost much less.<P>

Consumer Reports asked dozens of youngsters to try out siz hand-held electronic games.  With some you push a changing pattern of lighted buttons.  Some are based on popular board games.  Others offer several games in one.  All are battery-powered and beep like crazy.<P>

Most of the kids lost interest in the most expensive game in the tests.  It's based on the show Jeopardy and costs about 30 dollars.  The youngsters were much more impressed with two that cost much less.  One called Electronic Uno, is modeled after the popular card game Uno.  The kid-testers also like a dice game called Electronic Yahtzee.  They found it fast-paced and easy to master.  Both costs about 20 dollars.<P>

Not only are Electronic Uno and Electronic Yahtzee some of the least expensive games, they come with batteries included.  With some others, you have to buy the batteries separately.<P>

<STRONG>Here's how to reach the manafacturers mentioned in the story:  Talking Jeopardy by Tiger Electronics (708) 913-8100, Electronic Yahtzee by Milton Bradley (413) 525-6411, Electronic Uno by Micro Games of America (818) 894-2525.</STRONG><BR><A HREF="troubleshoot.html">-back-</A></FONT>

<FONT color="#000080"><H4>Seat Belt Alert</H4></FONT><FONT size=2>

The seat belts in more than eight million cars built in the late nineties have serious defect.  Manafacturers alerted car owners a year ago, but the number of injuries blamed on the belts continues to grow and Consumer Reports says only about ten percent of the problem-belts have been fixed.<P>

Chris Gavin's Acura is one of eight million cars that came with seat belts with a fatal flaw.  As they get older, they start to break.  Some owners notice the buckle no longer locks securely.  But most people, including Chris, don't know they're at risk.<P>

Chris Gavin<BR>
Acura Owner<BR>
<EM>"I never had any problems with the seat belts.  I never had anything pop out or anything like that."</EM><P>

But Consumer Reports' David Pittle says the belt can break without warning.  And when it breaks you have no protection.  The seat belts are found on many cars built from 1986 through 1991.  They're in many Japanese cars, as well as some from Ford, General Motors and Chrysler.<P>

You can tell if you have one of the problem belts by looking at the number embossed on it.  
If it begins with <STRONG>TK52</STRONG> or if you see <STRONG>A7</STRONG>, you should get it fixed.
The following vehicles have seat belts affected by the recall:<P>

<STRONG>Acura:</STRONG>  1986-91 Integra; 1986-90 Legend; 1991 NSX.<P>

<STRONG>Chrysler:</STRONG>  Dodge--1986-91 Colt;  1986-89 Conquest; 1986-91 Ram/Ram D-50; 1987-89 Raider; 1991 Stealth.  Eagle--1989-91 Summit;

If you're planning to go online, you'll need a modem.  That's the device that links your computer, by phone line to the internet and online services.  Consumer Reports says, good news:  The modems that work the fastest are now more affordable.<P>

Engineers at Consumer Reports tested some of the fastest modems available.  They sent pages of information over simulated phone lines to see how fast each modem can send and receive it.  The smallest measure of data is called a "bit."<P>

Chris Bucsko<BR>
Consumer Reports<BR>
<EM>"We tested  modems capable of speeds up to 28,000 bits per second.  If you're just starting out, we recommend 28.8 modems, because they make the information on the internet most accessible."</EM><P>

If you're shopping for a 28.8 modem, you'll find two kinds--internal and external.  Internal modems are circuit boards that go inside your computer.  They cost less but they can be hard to install.  Comparable external modems cost more but they're easier to install.  You just plug them in.<P>

So if you're a novice, Consumer Reports recommends you consider an external modem.  The highest marks for external 28.8 modems went to ones made by U.S. Robotics.  These are called Sportster V-34 models.  They are made for both Mac and IBM-compatible computers and sell for about $220.
<P>

Testers say they can be one of your fastest links to the internet.  The manufacturer says it will be discontinued soon but you still might find it on the store shelves.<P>

<STRONG>You can reach Robotics at 847-892-5010.</STRONG><BR><A HREF="troubleshoot.html">-back-</A></FONT>

They used to be called "disposable" cameras, but now they're called "single-use" cameras.  You use them once and turn them in with the film for developing.  Consumer Reports tested more than 20, from top-selling Kodak, Fuji and other brands.<P>

Sales of single-use cameras are booming as more and more people find they come in handy, especially tourists.  The cameras come pre-loaded with film.  You take your pictures and drop off the entire unit for developing.  The cameras are priced from eight to $15, with flash.<P>

Consumer Reports tested 21 cameras to see what kind of pictures you can expect.  One common problem is that basic features can be downright crude.  For instance:  viewfinders.  Viewrfinders on many of these cameras are basically holes in a box without a lens.  And that makes them rather imprecise, and the worst of them only show you about half what you actually get in the print.<P>

And, as for the picture quality, testers found noticeable differences.  Among them, the most expensive camera tested, the $15 Kodak Fun-Saver Pocket Flash.<P>

  But the good news:  Two that sell for only $10 did just as well--the Konica Film-In-Flash and one by Fuji, the Quicksnap Flash.  Testers say these models give some of the best prints you can get from this kind of camera.<BR><A HREF="troubleshoot.html">-back-</A></FONT>

Consumer Reports just tested hiking boots.  They're fast becoming the footwear of the nineties.  Sales are growing faster than for any other type of shoe.  On the trail, hiking boots are the ideal footwear.  But deciding which pair to buy can be daunting.  There are so many brands and styles to choose from.  And in the store, you can't tell which ones are likely to hold up.  Consumer Reports just tested boots both in the lab and on the trail.  One from a major manafacturer, New Balance, failed.  The eyelets came off on six of the eight pairs tested.  And once the eyelet's gone, you can't tighten up the boot anymore.<P>

Consumer Reports rated the New Balance Rainier not acceptable.  It's model number is H815.  The manafacturer is no longer making it, but you may still find it in some stores.  Testers also found you can't tell just by looking how much traction you'll get.  However, there is a problem you can test for.  If a boot has a lot of give, it will be less stable.  Your foot could twist on a rocky trail.<P>

In the end, testers top-rated a boot that earned high scores for stability, traction and support.  It's made by Salomon and is called Adventure 5.  It costs about 100 dollars and testers say it would be a good choice on rocky trails and for light backpacking.  Before you buy the Salomon Adventure 5 or any other boot, make sure it fits.  Consumer Reports says that's really more important than anything else.  <P>

Also, if you only walk on well-groomed trails or around town, you may want a lighter-weight boot.  Consumer Reports recommends the Nike Tumalo Two.  It offered better support than other light-weight boots.<BR><A HREF="troubleshoot.html">-back-</A></FONT>

Vitamin-enriched drinks with names like "Ensure," "Boost" and "Sustacal" are heavily advertised.  They promise to give you a balanced meal, plus extra energy, all in an eight-ounce can.  Consumer Reports' newsletter on health checked to see if they're as good as their ads claim.<P>

In its commercial, "Ensure" claims to be a source of complete balanced nutrition.  But "Ensure" and other products, including "Boost" and "Sustacal" are made mostly of water, sugar, corn syrup and vegetable oil.

And Consumer Reports says despite their claims, they don't provide complete or balanced nutritions.<P>

These products don't give you the phytochemicals that you get from fresh fruits and vegetables.  And those chemicals are really needed to help protect us from heart disease, cancer, as well as other diseases.<P>

These drinks do contain vitamins and minerals.  But Consumer Reports says most adults, even busy or active adults, don't need extra vitamins, minerals or calories, for that matter.  But these liquids have up to 250 calories per can, as much as a chocolate milkshake.<P>

So you might wonder how Ensure makes the claim:  "Ensure.  Recommended number one by doctors."<P>

Doctors do recommend these drinks, but only for patients who need liquid supplements.  That means the people are too sick to eat solid food.  And those people are usually in the hospital.<P>

Consumer Reports says, unless you can't eat solid foods, chances are you don't need any of these drinks.<P>

If you want a quick snack, you can find healthier foods than these drinks.  For example, low-fat yogurt and some fresh fruit.  It will give you the nutrients you need without all the calories.

<FONT color="#000080"><H4>TroubleShooter:  Safer Swing Sets</H4></FONT><FONT size=2>
You can spend more than a thousand dollars on a swing set these days.  So you want to make sure it's one your child will have fun on--and do it safely.  Consumer Reports has some advice on what features to look for.  Swing sets come in all shapes and sizes, from metal sets for less than $200, to wood sets with thousand dollar price tags.  To see if you need to spend top dollar, Consumer Reports surveyed hundreds of swing set owners.  And testers watched two dozen kids play on a variety of sets to see what rides would be worth a parent's investment.<P>

Todd Marks<BR>
Consumer Reports<BR>
<EM>"We observed that kids loved activities they could play on together, rather than one at a time.  They liked the lawn swings, the gliders and had lots of fun with the platforms."</EM><P>

As for the slides, the kids loved the spiral tube type the best.  As for the swings, Consumer Reports found the kids like soft, flexible, belt-type seats instead of hard plastic ones.<P>

Todd Marks<BR>
Consumer Reports<BR>
<EM>"And that's a good thing, too, because if you get hit by a hard swing you're more likely to get hurt."</EM><P>

The good news:  Consumer Reports says you can find metal seats for less than $200 with enough features to keep kids happy.  But metal seats are often light enough to tip over easily.  Testers say a good way to make them safe is to dig holes and plant each foot in cement.<P>

And there's more you can do.  150,000 children are injured each year because they have fallen off swing sets.  So testers say, protect your kids:  No matter what kind of set you but, put in a six to twelve inch cushion of wood mulch or sand.  It should go under the set and extend at least six feet around it.  Consumer Reports says it makes a soft and safe landing pad for your kids.<BR><A HREF="troubleshoot.html">-back-</A></FONT>

Swing sets are supposed to be fun.  But when Consumer Reports tested a variety of swing sets, some were so hazardous, testers judged them "Not Acceptable."<P>

Consumer Reports first tested a set made by Hedstrom called "Star Cruiser."  When kids lean back and pull the handle on the set, the seat tips over.  Kids may think is fun but Consumer Reports' head of testing David Pittle says this is a serious safety problem.<P>

R. David Pittle, Ph.D.<BR>
Consumer Reports<BR>
<EM>"When this swing flips over like this, and the child's hand accidently lets go, they can go crashing into the earth head-first, and risk serious injury."</EM><P>

Because of that safety problem, Consumer Reports judged those swing sets "Not Acceptable."  They're the ones by Hedstrom with the Star Cruiser ride.  If you already own any Hedstrom set with the Star Cruiser, Consumer Reports says:  Remove the Star Cruiser.  Testers also found other sets with safety flaws.  Several had spaces where a child's head could get stuck.<P>

R. David Pittle<BR>
Consumer Reports<BR>
<EM>"This is a problem that's far too common.  On some of these rungs, if a child falls through their body and their head will go through.  But here's a space where the body can go through and it's too small for the head, and the head will become entrapped."</EM><P>

One other problem:  pinch-points.  They're often on rides with handles that move back and forth.  If a child's finger can fit between the handle and seat, it can be pinched or crushed.  So, testers say, when you shop for a swing set, make sure a small finger can't fit between moving parts.<BR><A HREF="troubleshoot.html">-back-</A></FONT>

TWA won't tell you.  Chances are your travel agent won't either.  But you can now save 20% on TWA flights, and Consumer Reports' Travel Letter tells you how.  Consumer Reports had people call to ask about 20% discounts on TWA flights.<P>

Caller<BR>
<EM>"For a round-trip fare on a flight from Chicago to Miami, I found that there was about a $144 difference."</EM><P>

Another Caller<BR>
<EM>"I saved $265 on a trip from New York to Los Angeles."</EM><P>

The discounts are the result of a deal between TWA and its former chairman, investor Carl Icahn.<P>

David Heim<BR>
<EM>"Icahn got more than $600 million in TWA tickets at a very low, wholesale price.  Now you can get them from him at 20% off."</EM><P>

The discounts are not available through TWA itself, or through most travel agents.  You can get them through Icahn's agency, Global Discount Travel.  The discounts apply to most TWA flights, domestic and international.  They reduce not only Coach, but Business and even First Class fares.  And they even give you 20% off TWA's own advertised fares, like this one.  But to be sure you're getting the best fare for the route you're flying, Consumer Reports says, shop around.<P>

David Helm<BR>
Consumer Reports<BR>
<EM>"Make some phone calls.  See what the lowest price on any airline is for your flight.  See what kind of deals your travel agent can get you.  Then call to find out what the Icahn fare is."</EM><P>

Armed with that information, you can compare and go with the cheapest fare.  <STRONG>The toll-free number for Global Discount Travel is 1-800-497-6678.</STRONG>  One other advantage of the Icahn discounts:  There's no need to rush to get them.  Consumer Reports says, with more than $600 million in tickets to sell, the deal is likely to be good for several years.<BR><A HREF="troubleshoot.html">-back-</A></FONT>

<H4><FONT color="#000080">Better Motor Oil</H4></FONT><FONT size=2>
Consumer Reports has gone inside the engines of New York City taxi cabs to test motor oils.  It's the magazine's biggest and most expensive test ever.  One that could save you money--and maybe even your car.<P>

75 New York City taxis took part in Consumer Reports' test.  Inside each engine is one of 20 motor oils from Quaker State, Pennzoil and other brands.  Test director Don Mays explains, cabs and their engines are the perfect test vehicles.  The stop-and-go driving of taxi service gives motor oils a very severe workout.  Plus, taxi cabs accumulate a lot of miles over a very short period of time."<P>
<FONT size=2>
Early on in the project, identical engines, all even painted the same blue color, went into the cabs.  Identical engines meant each oil would be tested under the same conditions.  Then the cabs are sent out on their regular rounds.  Now, most have completed their 60,000 test miles.  The engines are being checked for wear and tear deposits.  And testers say they're already seeing some differences.<P>

Don Mays<BR>
Consumer Reports<BR>
<EM>"When we're all through, we hope to be able to tell you which are the best oils for your car, and how often you should change your oil."</EM><P>

For now, says Mays, no matter what brand of oil you use, there's one thing to look for.<P>

Don Mays<BR>
Consumer Reports<BR>
<EM>"Make sure that the oil you get has got a starburst symbol on the label.  That indicates that the oil meets the highest performance standards."</EM><P>

These oils usually cost no more.  But tests show they can save wear and tear on your engine, cut down on deposits and even give you better gas mileage, no matter where you drive.<P>

Consumer Reports warns, if you have a new car, using oil without the starburst may void your engine warranty.  Testers say the oil should also have the right thickness grade.  For instance, 10-W-30 or 5-W-30.  To find the grade recommended for your car, check your owner's manual or the oil cap on your engine.<BR><A HREF="troubleshoot.html">-back-</A></FONT>

Every year, five thousand Americans die of a highly infectious virus called Hepatitis B.  Consumer Reports says there's a way to prevent it, but not enough people know about it.<P>

Brian Sullivan almost died from Hepatitis B.<P>

Brian Sullivan<BR>
Hepatitis Patient<BR>
<EM>"For me it reached the point where I was in a coma and required a liver transplant to save my life."</EM><P>

Brian would have never gotten sick if he'd had the vaccine that can now prevent the disease.  Consumer Reports says it could be vital for your family.<P>

Marvin Lipman, M.D.<BR>
Consumer Reports<BR>

<EM>"Hepatitis B can be a deadly disease.  It's 100 times more contagious than AIDS.  The good news is we have a vaccine to prevent it.  The bad news is most people don't get it."</EM><P>

Consumer Reports says if all children got the vaccine we could wipe out the disease.  The easiest time is when they're babies and getting all their other shots.  But that's not happening.<P>

Marvin Lipman<BR>
<EM>"Some pediatricians just aren't pushing the vaccine hard enough.  One of every three babies is not getting the vaccine.  Make sure yours does."</EM><P>

If your children weren't immunized as babies, it's not too late.  Get them immunized by the time they're 11 or 12 and before they're sexually active.  That's one of the main ways the disease is spread.  Although the shots cost about 100 dollars, the government has a free program for some children.  And more and more HMOs and other insurance plans now cover the cost.  Whatever the cost, Brian says it's worth it.

Brian Sullivan<BR>
<EM>"I wish, in hindsight, I had done it."</EM><P>

Brian is lucky he survived.  But for the rest of his life, he will be infected with the virus.<BR><A HREF="troubleshoot.html">-back-</A></FONT>

More and more people are filtering their tap water.  They want it pure and they want it to taste good.  Carafe water filters are inexpensive.  Consumer Reports tested to see how well they work.<P>

Like many people, Jameela Donaldson no longer drinks water straight from the tap.  She runs it through a carafe filter.<P>

Jameela Donaldson<BR>
Carafe User<BR>
<EM>"Sometimes my water just didn't taste very good.  And I thought this would be the most inexpensive way and the quickest way to just pour some water in and just get some nice clean water easily."
</EM><P>

Too see how clean today's carafe filters make water, Consumer Reports testers spiked it--first with lead and then with chloroform, a carcinogen found in chlorinated water.  Then they measured how much each filter removed, as well as testing for odor and taste.<P>

Geoffrey Martin, Ph.D<BR>
Consumer Reports<BR>
<EM>"All the carafes we tested did a decent job of removing lead and all of them did at least a fair job of removing chloroform from the water."</EM><P>

That included the top-selling Brita, like Jameela has.  It was okay but not the best in the tests.  Another called Glacier Pure did a great job of removing contaminants and improving taste but it took a long time, approximately 45 minutes to filter a half a gallon.  Much faster was one called Ecowater.  It took only seven minutes to filter half a gallon.<P>

Geoffrey Martin<BR>
Consumer Reports<BR>
<EM>"The Ecowater is a good combination of convenience and performance.  It does a good job at removing contaminants.  It's well designed and it's filter cartridge lasts up to one hundred gallons."</EM><P>

The Ecowater sells for about 25 dollars and because it has long-lasting filters, you won't have the added expense of changing them often.  Consumer Reports has a health caution.  Don't expect these filters to do more than they can.  They cannot remove bacteria.  If you're told to boil your water because it's contaminated, these filters will not help.<P>
<STRONG>
Here's how to reach the brands mentioned in this report:<BR>
Ecowater:  612-739-5330<BR>
Brita:  510-271-7292<BR>
Glacier Pure:  617-568-1360<BR><A HREF="troubleshoot.html">-back-</A></FONT>

The recording industry is selling something new to "golden oldies" fans.  They're called Gold CDs--re-released albums on gold plated compact discs.  They cost more, and Consumer Reports checked to see if they're worth it.  You'll find big-selling albums from years past on Gold CDs from a variety of artists and labels.  And you'll find big price tags:  About $30 each--twice or more than what a regular CD costs.  That's because the new, gold-plated versions claim to be made with extra care and, so, promise better sound.<P>

To check out that claim, Consumer Reports compared the gold and regular versions of five re-issued recordings.  The music varied, from Pink Floyd to Bob Marley to Simon and Garfunkel.  Dean Gallea is one of three audio experts who listened.<P>

Dean Gallea<BR>
Consumer Reports<BR>
<EM>"We were able to hear some differences.  Some of the Gold CDs had deeper bass, and some wider range of sound, but we're especially trained to be sensitive to those differences."</EM><P>

To get a more typical assessment, Consumer Reports also asked some non-technical staffers to listen.  They compared as Dean switched back and forth from Gold to regular CD.  The staffers preferred the regular CDs about as often as the Gold CDs.<P>

Paul Reynolds<BR>
Consumer Reports<BR>
<EM>"Whether you'll prefer the sound of a Gold CD may be mostly a matter of taste.  For most people it may not be worth the extra money for the small difference that they'll hear in sound."</EM><P>

So, says Consumer Reports, don't buy any Gold CDs unless you can listen and compare it with the regular version, in the store.<BR><A HREF="troubleshoot.html">-back-</A></FONT>

How good is your bank?  That's the question a Consumer Reports survey set out to find--comparing checking account fees at the ten largest banks in twenty-five of the biggest cities in America, including San Diego.  What do they find? <P>
 
The information Consumer Reports gathered is for an average United States bank customer. Of course, precise costs vary, depending on how you use a bank.  This survey is based on writing seventeen checks and making four ATM withdrawls per month, two from your bank, two withdrawls at other banks.  <P>

<STRONG><FONT size=2>Here are the results for San Diego:</STRONG><P>

<FONT size=2><EM><CENTER>note:  Regency Savings doesn't offer ATMs and First National charges $25 annual ATM fee on some accounts</CENTER></EM></FONT><P>
Consumer reports nationwide survey of banks also found average fees within one city could vary by $40 a month. They also suggest that if you run your account down to a few hundred dollars, and you dont bounce checks, a no-minimum account is likely your best bet.<P>

However, if you like a cushion in your checking account, consider minimum balance account which pays interest and gives you a break on fees for other services.<P>

So how does your bank stack up? Should you change banks? Here's more good advice from Consumer Reports:<P>

Review your statements over the past several months, find your lowest monthly balance and determine how many checks you write on average.  Use this to find which checking account works best for you.  Its an issue of convenience and savings. <BR><A HREF="troubleshoot.html">-back-</A></FONT>

<H4><FONT color="#000080">Domino's Pizza Check Charges</H4></FONT><FONT size=2>
We ordered a pizza to test a consumer complaint.  A complaint that reaches the TroubleShooter on the Internet.<P>

Debbie Mirages was surprised when she called her neighborhood Domino's Pizza to place an order.  All these years Debbie has been buying pizza from Domino's, paying by check and never had a clue she pays more than cash customers.  And the more she thought about that 20-cent charge, the more it bugged her.  That's why she tapped the TroubleShooter via E-mail.<P>


We ordered from the same Domino's where Debbie shops, a franchise on Felicita Avenue in Escondido.  Our researcher paid by check, and sure enough was charged an extra 20 cents for his pizza.  And we found this is standard procedure with Domino's.  The corporate office in Ann Arbor, Michigan told us franchisees may do as they like and that most corporate stores charge the 20 cents.

Spokeswoman Maggie Proctor said this isn't nickel and diming: <EM>"Domino's is a cash business, she says, and they have a right to charge customers for the convenience of writing checks."</EM>

Further, she said consumers have an obvious choice: <EM>"Pay cash, write a check, with the fee, or go someplace else."</EM><P>

As for that check fee, the bank that processed Debbie's checks said they have several commercial account options.  And if this Domino's is paying a fee per check, they need to change their banking option.<BR><A HREF="troubleshoot.html">-back-</A></FONT>

<H4><FONT color="#000080">Outdated Baby Formula</H4></FONT><FONT size=2>
TroubleShooter shoppers fanned out across the county, looking for outdated baby formula.  Their search was inspired by a young mother who's baby got sick after drinking bottled formula.  Mary Ann Lazos did a little detective work, and found other stores also sell outdated formulas.<P>

Is this outdated formula harmful to babies?  TroubleShooter asked The Food and Drug Administration, which requires these dates.  The FDA says formula should be used by the date on the container.  But, the FDA says formula is safe to use up to a year after this date without risking a baby's health.  But, Dr. Martin Stein of UCSD still recommends parents take these dates seiously.  He says, "I think it's common sense."  With this said, we set out to see who's selling out of date formula.<P>

We shopped  a number of communities, making our first sweep in January.  Here's what we found:<P>
<STRONG>The following stores had no outdated formula:</STRONG><P>
<STRONG>South and Southeast San Diego:</STRONG><BR>

Lucky - Highland Avenue<BR>
Iga - Federal Blvd.<P>


<STRONG>La Mesa:</STRONG><BR>

Ralphs - Grossmont Blvd.<BR>
Vons - 8011 University<BR>

7-11 - Mission Blvd.<BR>

Ralphs - Mission Blvd.<BR>
Lucky - Turquoise Ave.<BR>
Longs - Mission Blvd.<P>

<STRONG>La Jolla:</STRONG><BR>

Vons - Girard Ave.<BR>
Longs - Eads<P>


<STRONG>Carlsbad:</STRONG><BR>

Vons - Tamarack Ave.<BR>
Payless Drugs - Avenida Encinas<P>

<STRONG>The following stores had outdated formula:</STRONG><P>


Vons:   Garnet Ave. & Navajo Road<BR>

Ralphs:  6700 of University Ave., Carlsbad/Avenida Encinas, Sports Arena, Villa La Jolla Dr.<BR>

Lucky:   6400 University Ave.<BR>

Thrifty Drug - Governor Dr.<BR>

Longs Drug - West Point Loma Blvd.<P>

In fairness, we went back a month later to check these stores again.  Just this past week, we found three stores that still have outdated formula on their shelves.<P>

<STRONG>Still Outdated: </STRONG><BR>

Ralphs - Villa La Jolla Dr.<BR>

How much profit is your HMO making from your health care?  How much does your health plan spend on paperwork?  These are two of the important questions answered in the California Medical Association's third annual Knox-Knee Health Plan Expenditure Summary which was released today.<P>

The CMA report of all California HMO's demonstrates that as much as 25% of each health care dollar, paid by businesses and consumers, is used by some for-profit HMOs for paperwork, advertising and multi-million dollar executive salaries and profits.  The CMA report also includes a three year comparison that shows an overall trend toward increased profits and administrative costs of California HMOs.<P>

<CENTER><font size=5>The 69th Annual Academy Awards</font><br>
<STRONG><EM>Live on ABC March 24, 6PM</EM></STRONG></CENTER><P>

<CENTER><STRONG>And the <a href="http://www.oscar.com/1-fst.html">NOMINEES</a> are....</STRONG></a><P></CENTER>

<IMG ALIGN="LEFT" SRC="oscar.gif" WIDTH="99" HEIGHT="286" ALT="Oscar Statue"><P>

The idea is simple enough. Bring together a dedicated group of film artists
                     for one night every year to celebrate and honor their finest achievements.
                      Recognize the best among the group with foot-high golden statuettes in
                        the shape of a knight, and cap off the affair with a celebratory party.
                                 Such is the annual rite known as the Academy Awards. 
<P>
                      Because those being honored are among the most talented, expressive,
            and creative -- not to mention, famous -- individuals working anywhere, it is perhaps
         inevitable that this simple ceremony has become the magnet for a billion pairs of eyes the
          world over. Oscar Monday is synonymous with entertainment. From comedy to tears,
       thrilling suspense to sublime performances, high fashion glamour to timeless elegance -- the
                                                             Oscars have it all. 

<P>
                      Only time will tell what surprises and delights await viewers of the 69th
                     Annual Academy Awards presentation on March 24, but one thing is for
                                               sure. It will be an unforgettable night. 

           <P>
            Don't forget to dial up <a href="http://www.oscar.com"><STRONG>oscar.com</STRONG></a> once the awards telecast has wrapped on ABC to  complete your memorable 1997 Academy Awards experience!

 <A NAME="How"><STRONG><FONT SIZE="+1">How To Get Air Time On KGTV:</FONT></STRONG><P>
<STRONG>Community Affairs Guidelines:</STRONG><BR>
If you work for a nonprofit organization, you know how hard it can be to get publicity for your events. San Diego's 10 can help.
	We make free air time available to qualified nonprofit organizations through public service announcements. The FCC no longer requires us to grant time to any specific group, but airing your message is important to us. It's part of our commitment to serving the community.<P>


<STRONG>Up & Coming:</STRONG><BR>
Up & Coming is a community calendar created for your use. It's a 30-second public service announcement (PSA) that airs Monday through Friday at various times throughout the day. Each PSA contains three separate announcements. These announcements are for activities hosted by you-San Diego's nonprofit organizations.<P>


<STRONG>To be listed on Up & Coming, please send us:</STRONG><BR>
<UL type=square>
<LI>
 A typed press release two to three weeks prior to your event. Include the who, what, when, where, why and list any admission fee.
<LI>
A phone number viewers can call for more information.
<LI>
A fact sheet about your organization.
</UL>

Please don't send us slides because we aren't able to use them in production.  
We receive hundreds of announcements from nonprofit groups like yours and we make every effort to include all of 
these activities in Up & Coming. However, the quantity we receive makes it impossible for us to publicize them all. 
Your activities will get priority if they have wide appeal and are free to the public or charge a nominal fee. Up & Coming 
changes on a daily basis.  <P>
 
<STRONG>Taped Public Service Announcements:</STRONG><BR>
Your organization may have a pre-produced taped PSA (Public Service Announcement)
 focusing on general information and education about your programs and services. 
Feel free to send it to us as long as it is a nonprofit, nonpartisan, and nondenominational announcement. 
Your spot has a better chance of running if it's 30 or 60 seconds in length. 
<P>
Although we accept PSA's on 1-inch, 
3/4-inch or betacam tapes, we prefer betacam. We also prefer PSA's that aren't dated so we can run them at any time. 
If we're able to schedule your PSA, we'll provide you with a list of times it aired.  Because of the limited air time available 
and the quantity of requests, we ask that these tapes cover general information only and appeal to viewers in San Diego.
 And it's best to provide viewers with a local phone number for more information. 
<P>
Remember, specific events are covered 
in Up & Coming.  If you have questions about our requirements for Public Service Announcements, feel free to call the 
Community Affairs Department at (619) 237-6214.<P>



<STRONG>Sponsorship for Nonprofit Events:</STRONG><BR>
We're honored by the many invitations we receive to sponsor events hosted by nonprofit groups, but it's impossible for us to participate in all of them. We do, however, review all written requests and respond as soon as possible. Please remember to submit your requests for sponsorship in writing.<P>


<STRONG> News Coverage:</STRONG><BR>
If you'd like news coverage the day of your event, send a press release to:<P>
<FONT COLOR="PURPLE" FACE="Arial,Times New Roman,Helvetica">

The Creative Services Department at KGTV/San Diego's 10 offers a "real life" internship program.

Here's how the program works:<P>

<STRONG>Long Term Projects:</STRONG><BR>
We'll assign you a long term project that fits your career goals (i.e., producer, copywriter, etc.).  If there's a "real life" project available for you to do, we'll have you do it.  If not, we'll assign you a mock project with real deadlines and a staff member to help you.  This way, you'll have something that shows potential employers your creativity.  Some projects you might work on include: <P>

<FONT SIZE=2><STRONG>QUESTION FOR THE WEEK OF 5/20/96:</FONT></STRONG><P>

<FONT size=2>Admiral Mike Boorda, Chief of Naval Operations, committed suicide Thursday
after learning about a media inquiry into whether he had improperly worn military decorations.  Do you feel the press has gone too far in their investigation of Admiral Boorda or has he been given the benefit of the doubt?</FONT><P>

<FONT SIZE=2><STRONG>WHAT YOU SAID:</FONT></STRONG><P>

<FONT size=2><EM><STRONG>Submitted by Jo A. Cartwright, Oceanside 5/20/96</STRONG></EM><BR>
I don't feel the Media or the Press has overdone their coverage with 
regard to the suicide of Admiral Boorda,so far; however, I strongly 
believe that this man was a good military leader, fair, decent and a 
loving man.  If the worst thing he ever did was wear two medals he 
wasn't personally awarded, so what!  From what I've heard from the 
coverage so far on the Admiral, his contributions and the lives he's 
positively affected, far outweigh this err in judgement. Afterall don't 
we all have some kind of skeleton in our closets? I'm sure we've all 
done something during our life time that we aren't particularly proud 
of.  I have heard enough on this subject and believe it should be left alone. 
Let the Admiral go with the level of dignity he truly deserves and not 
muddy the waters any further. 
<P>

Whenever you have truth it must be given with love, or the message and 
the messenger will be rejected. <BR>

<EM><STRONG>Submitted by Ron Palacz 5/24/96</STRONG></EM><BR>
I feel that the media frenzy focused on Boorda is absurd 
and just goes to show that the blood thirsty newspaper 
coverage of this horrific incident was over exaggerated.
Not that I condone such actions but come on, the guy was just
wearing the wrong medal.  Why such a big deal over a wrong 
medal?<P>

<EM><STRONG>Submitted by Edith M. Gise 5/27/96</STRONG></EM><BR>
The Admiral seems to me to have been a real person.  If my dad were alive he could probably 
shed more light on the issue of ribbons and associated stuff, [stars, vees,etc.].  Dad was black 
shoe Navy.  Perhaps someone in the WWII old Navy would have an idea.  But I feel the real
answer for me as a civilian;  far to much noise about a very small item.  The man did some really
good things for the Navy and for that matter all the services.  I have a problem with the amount
of smoke blown around and the complete lack of any fire.  Something in my gut says there is 
perhaps something else that happened.   Something that is being covered by the smoke and
mirrors.<P>

<EM><STRONG>Submitted by John Sable 5/27/96</STRONG></EM><BR>
I too think that possibly the press hounded a good man into making a terribly wrong decision. Those of us with a brain have been trying to get the Clintons to own up to much more serious breaches in morals,and ethics.  My heart goes out to Mr. Boorda's family.  I think the press needs to use a better filter when deciding to go public with this kind of story.  Thanks KGTV for being sensitive and discerning.

<FONT SIZE=2> <STRONG>QUESTION FOR THE WEEK OF 5/27/96:</FONT></STRONG><P>
<FONT size=2>
Last week, Bob Dole resigned from the United States Senate to devote his time to campaigning for the Presidency.  Do you think this was a good move for Mr. Dole and the Republican Party?<P>
</FONT>
<FONT SIZE=2><STRONG>WHAT YOU SAID:</FONT></STRONG><P>
<FONT size=2>
<EM><STRONG>Submitted by Peter Singer 5/30/96</STRONG></EM><BR>
Concerning his resignation, who cares?!?!?  This just means that his political career is over earlier than otherwise anticipated.
<P>
<STRONG><EM>Submitted by Nancy A. Jefferis 5/30/96</EM></STRONG><BR>
Regarding Senator Dole's resignation...I think that the Senator and the 
Republican party are beginning to realize that they have no chance of winning 
in November.  This is just a last ditch effort to gain publicity.  Dole was 
probably trying to show the American people that he believes in his platform 
(whatever that is) so much that he is willing to give up something for it.  
However, I don't think the American public cares.  At this point the American 
people (and all of its special interest groups) have been too threatened by 
the Republican message.  People don't want a government of exclusion, division 
and negativity.

<FONT size=2><STRONG> QUESTION FOR THE WEEK OF 6/3/96:</STRONG><P></FONT>

<FONT size=2>Israel's Prime Minister Elect, Benjamin Netanyahu, was elected to power last week.  How do think this will affect the Middle East Peace Process?  </FONT><P>

<FONT SIZE=2><STRONG>WHAT YOU SAID:</STRONG><P></FONT>

<FONT size=2><EM><STRONG>Submitted by Bernard Higgins 6/3/96</STRONG></EM><BR>
I belive that the election of Benjamin Netanyahu as Prime Minister of 
Israel has to impact the peace process.  Anytime there is a change in 
the leadership of an investigative (looking into peace) body there has 
to be an impact.  However I don't think that PM Netanyahu is 'stupid'.  
While some of the Israeli goals may change or be modified slightly to 
reflect his entry into the decision making process (it's got to have 
his flavor now), I think he understands that there is too much at 
stake for him to take an opposing stand and not allow for any give and 
take.<P>

<STRONG><EM>Submitted by Deric Prescott 6/4/96</EM></STRONG><BR>
With the election of Israel's youngest prime minister, I believe the 
peace process may be slowed, but it will not stop.  Recent warming of 
relations between Mr. Netanyahu and Prime Minister Peres might allow for 
his continued presence as a cabinet member.  So long as the Labor Party 
is included in any coalition government, the peace process will remain on 
track.

<FONT size=2><STRONG>QUESTION FOR THE WEEK OF 6/10/96:</STRONG></FONT><P>

<FONT size=2>The Freemen reject the validity of the U.S., state and county governments.  Now, a letter signed by three jailed Freemen leaders warns Montana state legislators of possible liens against their property if lawmakers do not convene a grand jury inquiry into the federal government's actions at the Freemen compound in Brusett, Montana.  Should the Freemen be stopped?  Has the government and the state of Montana been forceful enough?  What's the best solution?</FONT>
<P>
<FONT size=2><STRONG>WHAT YOU SAID:</STRONG></FONT><P>

<FONT size=2>
<EM><STRONG>Submitted by Barry Edmonds 6/11/96</STRONG></EM><BR>
  How can the Freemen refute the validity of U.S. Government and then try to
use the U.S. Laws to put a lein on property?  Sounds hypocritical to
me. They try to use the very system they disavow.
  The fact of the matter is that they have broken the laws of the land and
should be arrested and tried accordingly. The FBI and other agencies should
put a lein on their property to recover the costs of the operation.

<FONT SIZE=2> <STRONG>QUESTION FOR THE WEEK OF 6/17/96:</FONT></STRONG><P>
<FONT size=2>


Last night, a predominantly black church was destroyed in North Carolina, the second suspicious church fire in the state in less than two weeks.  It's the fifth fire in June and at least the 32nd, mostly in the South, since January 1995.  Has the government done its share in trying to stop this trend?

As deplorable as these cowardly acts are, I don't see how the government 
can prevent them.  Perhaps now would be an excellent time for those 
professing to be "a good Christian" to practice their faith.  Get 
together, black and white church members, and talk to each other.  Find 
out how you can assist and support each other.  Invite each other to 
services at your respective churches.  The only thing that can stop hate 
crimes, whoever they are aimed at and however they are manifested, is 
through communication and understanding.</FONT>

<FONT size=2>Do you support California's "Three Strikes" Law?</FONT>

<STRONG><EM>Submitted by Massoud Ajami 6/25/96</EM></STRONG><BR>

Yes I do support the three strike law.  The cost of capturing them, sending them 
to the court system until they are sentenced, is more than keeping them 
in jail continously, not including the damage they have done outside.  But 
one has to remember, the law being so rigid, that sends a man to jail for 
25 years to life for stealing a piece of pizza, is obsurd.  On the other hand, getting a traffic ticket and not showing up in court, 
is a "crime" by itself.
<P>
<EM><STRONG>Submitted by Bryan Wilson 6/27/96</STRONG></EM><BR>
I used to be a gang member, drug dealer, and thief at one time.  What people are failing to realize is it is not just stealing a piece of pizza, or a shirt, etc, that they are getting 25 to life for.  They are getting 25 to life for all of the other crimes they have committed.  I know, I used to be one of them.  Al Capone committed murders and ordered murders, but the law could never get him on murder charges.  So, they got him for tax evasion.  The Three Strikes Law does the same for todays career criminals.  You can bet if you caught them for something small, that there is a huge mountain of other crimes that they were not caught for.  All of these Three Strikers have LONG rap sheets.  They are EXACTLY the people that the Three Strikes Law is for.  Gang members on my street are going straight because of it.  It  works.  Take it from an EX-bad guy!

<STRONG><EM>Submitted by Loretta Burke 6/27/96</EM></STRONG><BR>
I definitely support the three strikes law.  Crime is rampant.  Anything 
is better than doing nothing.

<FONT SIZE=2><STRONG> QUESTION FOR THE WEEK OF 7/1/96:</STRONG><P></FONT>
<FONT size=2>In light of last week's terrorist bombing, do you think the United States should keep troops in Saudi Arabia?</FONT>
<P>


<FONT SIZE=2><STRONG>WHAT YOU SAID:</STRONG><P></FONT>
<FONT size=2>
<STRONG><EM>Submitted by Suzanne Davis 7/1/96</EM></STRONG><BR>
ABSOLUTELY!!  That part of the world has the potential to be one of the 
worlds most volatile regions.  We have seen only a glimpse of the wrath 
that can be brought upon innocent people and nations by the ruthelessly 
barbarous and power hungry regimes that continue to remain in control. 
Saudia Arabia has welcomed America's assistance in keeping the enemy at 
bay, and thus has provided us with the resources we need to protect 
America's interests.  Though the loss of American lives is a terrible 
thing, we have always and must continue to be willing to pay that price 
for freedom.  Perhaps a better solution to pulling our troops out would 
be to provide them with the means to do their jobs the best they can 
with the best available resources and protection.  Why is it that ALL 
Americans expect to have their freedom defended but the majority of the 
people encourage cutting military spending.  When things like this happen 
they are outraged that better precautions weren't taken, yet they are 
the very ones who are responsible.<P>

<STRONG><EM>Submitted by Bryan Wilson 7/4/96</EM></STRONG><BR>
Our whole economy is based on oil.  If we do not protect it we could have a very drastic and unpleasant change from the best country in the world to a third world living standard. It is not pleasant, but it is that simple.  Cargo jets, trains, ships, trucks, EVERYTHING that we depend on and enjoy runs on fuel made from it.  Just look around at all of the PLASTIC in your life, and ask what you would do without it? It is a matter of survival, and we are greatly blessed by God to have men and women willing to risk their lives so that we, our children, and our grandchildren and theirs can have a decent life. I thank all of them, and God  Bless them.<P>

<STRONG><EM>Submitted by J.D. Baker 7/5/96</EM></STRONG><BR>
I believe that it is appropriate to maintain troops in Saudi Arabia and 
other parts of the Mideast.  What I feel is inappropriate is the lack of 
support for the military by the civilian leadership.  Why is a RETIRED 
General reviewing security?  What makes him smarter than the active duty 
generals and admirals?  I see him as political appointee, and as such, he 
can be easily dismissed.  He represents the hand waving that masquerades 
as support for the military in the Clinton administration.

<FONT SIZE=2><STRONG> QUESTION OF THE WEEK 7/8/96:</STRONG><P></FONT>
<FONT size=2>A new strain of the AIDS virus has been found in the United States.  How concerned are you about the safety of the nation's blood supply?</FONT>
<P>


<FONT SIZE=2><STRONG>WHAT YOU SAID:</STRONG><P></FONT>
<FONT size=2>
<STRONG><EM>Submitted by John Eveland 7/6/96</EM></STRONG><BR>
As long as the CDC and blood labs keep up with all that they currently do
I feel that the nations blood supply will withstand any increase or new 
AIDS strains.  I work for a hospital and also donate blood, platlets and 
plasma and I feel that if standars are maintained in testing and handling 
there should be no problems. <P>

<EM><STRONG>Submitted by Julie I. Fichtner 7/8/96</STRONG></EM><BR>
I believe that the only way that one can avoid developing, or contracting any 
new strains of the aids virus is to abstain from any form of sex until 
marriage
and also stress the importance of good hygene, moral standards and a good
knowledge of God's word on the subject of premarital sex, incest, adultry, 
fornication and gay activities in our community.

Once this country sees fit to return to the high morals that were set up by 
our
founding fathers, then we will begin to see this country start to turn around 
and
stress good morals, obedience to the law of the land, respect for others and
pride in themselves as well as in their country and community.

I pray that our medical profession will see the need to stress abstanance from
sex til marriage and that our church pastors, priests, lay leaders and 
teachers
stress this need in their messages.  When parents, teachers, pastors, priests
and lay leaders begin to set the right kind of examples for kids, then and 
only
then will we return to the high moral standards that this great land was 
founded
upon by our founding fathers.

I feel that an industry which holds so many human lives in the balance has 
an obligation to insure the utmost safety and security for those 
passengers.  I think that everyone will be understanding enough to 
tolerate potential inconveniences given the magnitude of the consequences 
for lax control.  <P>

<STRONG><EM>Submitted by Sally Wisdom 7/22/96</EM></STRONG><BR>
Even with the terrorist attacks on aircraft and federal building, etc., 
USA citizens treat security with a cavalier attitude.  The thinking seems 
to be "it won't happen to me."   Security at the San Diego airport is a joke.  It has improved, but anyone 
really wanting to "slip something through" could easily do so.  We spend billions to "aid" other countries, but cannot spend millions for 
state-of-the-art equipment to detect bombs in aircraft, which will kill 
travelers.  Security should never taken lightly.  Security is not an inconvenience.  
Lack of security can ruin not only one's day, but a family's days for 
years.<P>

<EM><STRONG>Submitted by Jaclyn Mosler 7/24/96</STRONG></EM><BR>
Yes, I do believe that the U.S. Goverment could do more as far 
as airline security goes, But then again if someone is (or 
group) wants bad enough to blow up a plane, an airport,etc...
they will find a way to do it, and I really don't think all the 
money on earth will stop it. What the U.S. Goverment needs to 
do is to provide 1. Better training  for airport security 
guards & better pay.  IF your going to pay someone $4.25hr, 
your going to get $4.25hr work.

<FONT size=2>Do you feel Olympic child athletes are pushed too hard to win, at the expense of their physical and mental well-being?</FONT>

<FONT size=2>
<EM><STRONG>Submitted by David M. Gaines 7/31/96</STRONG></EM><BR>
The real question is whether or not children who don't have parents 
involved in their lives are better off mentally & physically.  Where do you draw the line between what is too much or too little 
involvement (pushing) whether its academics, work, or athletics. If it 
is for the child's best interest and not the parents own glorification.  What I feel is not going to be what others feel. But what I think is 
best for my child is a responsibility that is mine.  People today are driven by feelings and not reasonable responsible 
thoughts. Example: the decay of our society caused by the welfare 
state.  I don't think that pushing a child in athletics is harmful when it is 
proportioned with teaching of life skills ie, values,character, and good 
everyday survival skills of living with and communicating with others.  Bottom line if the parents are raising the children as opposed to 
pushing that responsibility off on the government let them alone this is 
a free country last I was aware!<P>

<STRONG><EM>Submitted by Gary G. Hedberg 7/31/96</EM></STRONG><BR> 
I think in the case of women's gymnastics this is the case.  Many of the
girls competing are simply that girls.  They are not women.  I think that
female gymnastics competition should be divided by age groups to Girls
Gymnastics say under 16 or 18 and WOMEN's gymnastics being that group older
than that.  Hearing that some of these poor young athletes have been
'programmed' into their sports by overzealous parents and coaches if
abhorring.  Some of these mere children have had multiple corrective
orthopedic surgeries for injuries they have received in training.  This was
not the intent of the Olympic Games, I don't believe.  They should rename
the Olympics to reflect the adolescent age group that has come to represent
so many of the events (gymnastics, diving, etc).

<STRONG><EM>Submitted by Sally Wisdom 8/7/96</EM></STRONG><BR>
No! No! No!  No illegal alien from ANY COUNTRY! 

I personally know of a situation where a couple, illegal aliens, working 
as household/garderner help, brought first one of their daughters to the 
area and enrolled her in high school.  The next year they brought their 
other daughter to the area and enrolled her in high school.  Neither the 
parents nor the daughters spoke English.  I doubt they speak much more 
English after being here four or more years.

I have lived, legally, in several countries (we were not a 
military/State Dept/etc. family), and lived on the "local economies."  
None of these countries would have allowed us to enter or remain in the 
country as illegal aliens, much less let my children attend school as 
illegal aliens.  Why do our state and federal governments think we have 
to let these people sap our tax-supported resources?  

Illegal is illegal ... just as unique is unique ... not somewhat, a 
little bit, or very.  Bring our military back from Bosnia and put them on 
our borders to staunch the flow of illegal aliens entering our country.

<STRONG><EM>Submitted by Todd Way 8/8/96</EM></STRONG><BR>
I don't think that the children of illegals should have access to schools or
benefits provided by the US government.  If you will check it out, children of illegal
alien (US or other countries) parents who reside in Mexico have no access to
schools in Mexico.  Has KGTV ever done a story on what it takes to become a
legal resident of Mexico?  I think you will find it very interesting.

Will Jack Kemp help or hinder the GOP ticket?

<FONT size=2>
<STRONG><EM>Submitted by Donna Mitchell 8/13/96</EM></STRONG><BR>
Hinder.  At least in California.  I think picking Kemp gives some 
insight into Doles true feelings on the issues.  He (Dole) has to 
say the correct things to be elected...whether they are his true 
feelings or not.  In choosing Kemp he has made a bigger statement 
about where he really stands.  

Or, have no effect what so ever.  After all, this is the VP position
we're talking about.  The biggest do-nothing position in government!<P>

<STRONG><EM>Submitted by Julie Fichtner 8/13/96</EM></STRONG><BR>
I don't think that Jack Kemp will hamper Bob Dole's chances of election.  I 
feel that he will actually help him get elected due to the fact that he is highly 
respected by the nation, not only for his football years, but for what he has 
done for the nation while serving in various capacities in our Nation's 
Capital as a Representative, Secretary of Housing and Urbin Developement, etc.<P>

<STRONG><EM>Submitted by Jim Givaudon 8/13/96</EM></STRONG><BR>
Jack Kemp will help Bob Dole's presidential candidacy. I look forward to
supporting the ticket.<P>

<STRONG><EM>Submitted by Karl Taube 8/14/96</EM></STRONG><BR>
Seeing that Bob Dole knew that the convention was being held in San Diego,
Jack Kemp was a very good choice...and he knew it.  But, outside of the
southwestern states, I'm not convinced that most people are convinced that
Kemp is the best person for Dole.  Some feel that their "opposite-ness" that
had been a sore point in the past is actually a boost to the Republican party
ticket because there's an illusion that any (or every) bad situation can be
made out to be "Shangri-La" ... if the Republican's have anything to do with
it.  Most of the Republicans, and even some of the Democrats, tend to like
Kemp over Dole.  And in the Republican's mind, anyone one that beats Bill
Clinton is a "winner," no matter who they are.  In my opinion, if the
Republican party wins the November election, it will be because more
supporters like Kemp more than they like Dole.<P>

<STRONG><EM>Submitted by Chuck Taylor 8/14/96</EM></STRONG><BR>
Yes, I think he will be a valuable asset to the Dole campaign, regardless
of what Cokie Roberts and the ABC left wing gang think.  He adds a new
dimension and following to the ticket. <P>

<STRONG><EM>Submitted by Don Andon 8/14/96</EM></STRONG><BR>
Choosing Kemp was a master stroke. Followed closely by Gen. Powell's
speech.  The nadir of the convention has been the astonishingly
tasteless comment by NBC's Tom Brokaw following the tribute to President
Reagan.  Even though he is your network competitor, you will all be
tarred by the brush of public hostility engendered by Brokaw. 
Deservedly so.

Ross Perot running for President will only hurt Bob Dole's slim chance of
being elected.<P>

I like Ross Perot, but to tell you the truth, I don't think he has a 
chance against Clinton or Dole.<P>

<STRONG><EM>Submitted by Neal Brooks 8/21/96</EM></STRONG><BR>
I don't really think Ross Perot has any real chance at the presidency. 
While he does have a very loyal following, I don't think that his party
can be considered a "contender" for quite some time.  Much as in the 92
election campaign, he is definately a viable "spoiler" for whichever
party he decides to target.<P>

Mr.Perot is a perfect example of what's wrong with politics. The fact 
that he can buy his way in gives me the willy's. Yes, Forbe's did the 
same thing - I know. But, that does not change the fact that these guys 
would probably never entered the arena had it not been for there 
financial positions. By the way, has Ross ever really said anything about 
what he would do if elected ?

<STRONG> QUESTION FOR THE WEEK OF 8/26/96:</STRONG><P>
<FONT color="#000080"><STRONG>Should national political conventions receive extended media coverage?</STRONG></FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><STRONG>WHAT YOU SAID:</STRONG><P></FONT>

<STRONG><EM>Submitted by Julie I. Fichtner 8/26/96</EM></STRONG><BR>

No!!!  I feel that there is too much bias in media coverage of the 
conventions.
I feel that the public doesn't have a chance of making up his own mind about
whether or not he likes what he hears from the various candidates who are to be 
nominated as President.

The media tries to tell the public just what each person is saying and treats 
the public as if they don't have any sense to come in out of the rain.  I am 
sick and tired of the media trying to explain everything that I hear by the 
canadates on their agenda.  I would like to be able to make up my own mind.
<P>
<STRONG><EM>Submitted by Don Andon 8/30/96</EM></STRONG><BR>
Anyone on-line with a computer really does not need the networks for
ANY  news coverage.  RealAudio, The IBM News Ticker, a half dozen
newspapers and search engines combine to provide far more news than any
network ever did. And with the advantage of doing one's own filtering;
not being subjected to the (mostly) liberal agenda of the networks.  New
York (and Atlanta) is undoubtedly aware of what's happening.  And they
are scared to death.
  I predict the nightly newscasts as we know them now, have a terminal
illness which will prove fatal in less than 5 years.<P>

<EM><STRONG>Submitted by Elizabeth W. Taff  9/2/96</STRONG></EM><BR>
No, the 1996 conventions received far more coverage than they 
deserved. They were obscenely expensive and boring but beautifully 
choreographed and managed in order to prevent any spontaneous political 
moments from occurring. The media would provide far more informative and 
entertaining material if they simply showed Brady Bunch reruns. The 
conventions have absolutely no relationship to democracy any more.<P>


<STRONG><EM>Submitted by Joseph Ricci 9/3/96</EM></STRONG><BR>
You Bet!!!!  Without coverage of the national convention...there will be a de-synthesis of 
American politics and the election process!  One should express him or her 
self to the process of choosing a President to appriciate the power each and 
every one of us have...  the best way to accomplish this is through the 
media....and by far the media one should use to catch the flavor of the 
excitement is television.

<STRONG><EM>Submitted by Joe Ruelas 9/3/96</EM></STRONG><BR>    
Absolutely!  Swift action is the only thing Mr. Hussein seems to understand!<P>

<STRONG><EM>Submitted by Tyler Arciaga 9/3/96</EM></STRONG><BR>
Yes,  Mr. Hussein should know by now not to bully other smaller 
countries that are allied to the U.S.  <P>

<STRONG><EM>Submitted by Don Tran 9/3/96</EM></STRONG><BR>
Of course, if Mr. Hussein deserves it, which I think he obviously does, then
he should face the consequences.  The way he is acting resembles a high
school bully.<P>

<EM><STRONG>Submitted by Ray Thomas 9/3/96</STRONG></EM><BR>
In my opinion, to be concise, "No."  Clarification Please:  Mid-1970's and -80's Iraq/Iran border disputes, yada, yada... USA military advisors, etc aid to Iraq after Iran had taken US hostages...  Early 90's Desert Storm Iraq in deep kimchi.  Mid-90's Iran/Iraq and USA bombing Iraq...  BOHEKA!  Is it only in my mind or the collective memory of our Nation that treats this as "new" news?<P>

<EM><STRONG>Submitted by Red Newberry 9/4/96</STRONG></EM><BR>
We should not have waited so long.  When the new no fly zone takes
effect, Wednesday, if any airplanes take off from those two air fields.
level the two air fields. That man is crazy and only understands one
thing. cripple him as soon as possible.<P>

<STRONG><EM>Submitted by Bill Laird 9/4/96</EM></STRONG><BR>
It is indeed unfortunate that Saddam Hussein only understands brute force. 
Most sane humans learn at an early age that force accomplishes only
temporary results.  It is my firm belief that actions taken by the U.S. are
the lowest level of response to the brutal aggression that Saddam has shown
to a downtrodden minority.  I believe that stronger, more forceful action
is completely warranted.<P>

<STRONG><EM>Submitted by Bill Jones 9/4/96</EM></STRONG><BR>
Yes, Bill Clinton rarely makes a political mistake.  If not now, when...
The longer you wait, the more costly it may become.<P>


<STRONG> <EM>Submitted by John Smith 9/5/96</EM></STRONG><BR>
  I don't think it was right for the U.S. to launch missiles against
Iraq.  I do not agree with Saddam Hussein. But the U.S. government never
cared about the Kurds, they didn't care about them when turkey invaded Iraq
with 35,000 troops to wage war against the Kurds, when turkey used the no-fly
zone as protection for their own jet fighters less than a 1 1/2 years ago.
The U.S. did not care 1980's when Hussein was a trusted ally and was killing
the Kurds.  
       But Clinton is bombing Iraq anyway.  And this decision does not hurt
Hussein it only hurts the innocent civilians and their children (since the
embargo more than 500,000 children have died of malnutrition). 
       Clinton is not interested in protecting the Kurds he just wants to be
reelected.  Prior to the bombing Bob Dole had begun claiming that Clinton
was weak and vacillating on Saddam Hussein.  So when Clinton saw the
opportunity it became irresistible.  <P>

<STRONG><EM>Submitted by Morgan 9/5/96</EM></STRONG><BR>
I am very sad to witness that a great country like the United States,
which calls itself a civilized nation, still
finds itself, this late in the 20th century, trying to resolve
every international problem it encounters by the use of brute force. It is
my opinion that our country should have realized by now that war actions
do not solve any problems, and only waste resources and efforts which
could be utilized to reach more beneficial goals. <P>



<EM><STRONG>Submitted by Paul Wells 9/6/96</STRONG></EM><BR>
No!  Hussein is admittedly an international slug and deserves 
quick dispatch, but...he was invited into the area to assist one
of his old Kurd enemies, Massoud Barzani (who is losing an internal
squabble with another Kurd faction supported by another international
slug - Iran).
We have not been as quick to provide our missile muscle in the
internal conflicts between Northern Ireland/Great Britain, Burundi
(Hutu's and Tutsi's - estimated 150,000 dead), Russia/Chechny
(estimated 80,000 dead), within South Africa, Liberia, Bosnia
(peacekeeping only - and the latest information says that our 
role as peacekeeper is not working), ad naseum.  We have all the
makings of a major internal conflict even within the borders of 
our next door neighbor to the south.
The U.S. has sat idly by, physically, and watched murder most 
awful, mayhem and atrocities across the world.  I keep asking
myself therefore, why is Saddam Hussein and the Kurds so 
different?  Is the answer oil, some sense of patriotic outrage, 
political mileage (election time is nigh)...?  Is it because
Saddam, like Richard Allen Davis, gave the Mighty United States
the finger...?
Oh yes...how can Hussein the Horrible invade his own country?
<P>

<EM><STRONG>Submitted by Justin Kram 9/6/96</STRONG></EM><BR>
No, we shouldn't have attacked. I guess we all were expecting another
war. At least I was. It's important to protect Kuwait, the primary source
of our oil, but war doesn't and never will solve any problem.<P>


<STRONG><EM>Submitted by Cap Pelletier 9/7/96</EM></STRONG><BR>
Should the U.S. have launched the missiles?  That is a very difficult question 
to answering in a few short words.  Actually, I believe, there is no short 
answer to the question.  Obviously, if what we are lead to believe by the 
media and our government, Iraq is a renegade country that ignores the mandates 
of the world.  However, as long as they are in their own country and 
apparently doing little harm the real question is just what are we 
accomplishing with any attacks.  We certainly do not have anything to fear 
from Iraq and with minor exception the rest of the world doesn't either.
It is a shame the world didn't take firm action back during the so called Gulf 
War by removing Saddam Hussein.  Unfortunately, that chance has 
passed the world by and now the world is saddled with his presence.  I, for 
one, feel we should simply let him alone, unless he becomes a "real" threat to 
the area and/or the U.S. national interests.
Additionally, two missile attacks comprised of some 40+ missiles is not too 
much to think about.  If our country (the president?) was serious about 
inflicting damage and teaching a lesson to Iraq we would have done 
considerably more.  I feel the missiles were nothing more than a political 
move, in this time of the race for the presidency, on the part of President 
Clinton.  He is not a strong (hawkish) leader, but simply is trying to put a 
tough face on for the voting public.  We should all remember just where he was 
during the Vietnam conflict.
Now with all of my meandering about, my answer is:  yes, we should have 
launched missiles at Iraq.  In addition, we should have done more, but I 
really do not see our current political leadership taking that sort of step.  
Oh well, it's simply business as usual for President Clinton.  Say one thing 
when it's political and do something else when it's political!<P>

Submitted by Mike Gerzen 9/8/96<BR>
I have not understood why Mr. Hussein's places of comfort like the 
palace have not been distorted. He does not show any effect to the death 
& destruction of his military. The impact needs to inconvenience him 
more than his country. 
I also believe that the people there don't approve of the treatment they 
are receiving no matter how they feel or trust Mr. Hussein. Know matter 
what they believe they know they can't change it. 
If this was to happen here we might not understand or agree but most of 
us would try to protect our homes & our families.<P>


<EM><STRONG>Submitted by Epitacio Colunga 8/9/96</STRONG></EM><BR>
In my opinion, the U.S. should have finished Saddam Hussein in the first
attempt to bully the small country of Kuwait.  However, it seems that this last
attack to Iraq, could well be interpreted as a second Vietnam, since this time
the attack was being done to the same country, Iraq, and apparently, help had
been asked from Saddam Hussein.  I also believe, that this was an attempt by President Clinton to boost his image in the political campaign on which he is running for reelection.<P>

<STRONG><EM>Submitted by James Dill 8/9/96</EM></STRONG><BR>
Yes, and they should of finished off Saddam Hussein too.<P>


<STRONG><EM>Submitted by Patrick Allen 8/9/96</EM></STRONG><BR>
The United States should do every thing in their power to blow
that clown and all of his fanatic followers of the face of the
earth.		<P>

<STRONG><EM>Submitted by Fern Renee Schuster 9/9/96</EM></STRONG><BR>
No.  I think that it will take a crazy pyscho to take down Tyson, and 
even at that, Tyson will still have to be having a real bad day!<P>

<EM><STRONG>Submitted by Charles Herring 9/10/96</STRONG></EM><BR>
I think that his "opponent" was too intimidated, as shown at the news 
conference don king held. i.e. respect.<P>

<EM><STRONG>Submitted by Janean Johnson 9/10/96</STRONG></EM><BR>
I think that Mike hits pretty hard and that most of the individuals who 
come up against him have no idea how hard.  Just give Mike the other belt 
he's missing, and let's call it a day and spare Hollyfield the 
embarassment.  <P>

<STRONG><EM>Submitted by Ray A. Simmons 9/10/96</EM></STRONG><BR>
I have no doubt that Tyson can take Seldon any day, But most of my
friends agree that Selson was not hurt as bad as he wanted people to
believe. The ref made a good call because of the way Seldon was acting.
Bruce would have went down for a third time ending the fight and most of
the people would be happy.<P>


<STRONG><EM>Submitted by Joe Ruelas 9/10/96</EM></STRONG><BR>
In the shady sport boxing, one never can tell, however, it seems a little fishy
when a champion falls due to non-contact punch. So yes, it's a definite 
possibility.<P>

<EM><STRONG>Submitted by Curtis Kons 9/11/96</STRONG></EM><BR>
No--just stupid!
<P>

<STRONG><EM>Submitted by David Curtis 9/11/96</EM></STRONG><BR> 
In my opinion, it was fixed.  there is no way a World Heavyweight Champion
could get a glancing hit off the top of his head and go down like that.
The little elbow to the back of the head was too minor to affect the
fighter's knock down, as well.  Maybe they need to classify the 
World Heavyweight Champions of which there is many, many belts
with the WWF Champions.  For those people who paid to see the
bout on PPV should be ashamed to trust Don King.  The 
Ulitmate Fighting Championships are nearly banned in all 
states because it is real.  GET REAL MIKE TYSON and
DON KING!<P>

<EM><STRONG>Submitted by Andrew Parker 9/13/96</STRONG></EM><BR>
I think anytime you have one manager (i.e. Don 
King) representing both fighters, your going to
have certain conflicts of intrest.  You could tell
that Seldon was extremely nervous before the fight, 
he took one punch and decided to collect a paycheck 
and get out of there.  It is also worth noting that 
the ref (i.e. Richard Steele) has been involved in 
many controversial calls.

<STRONG> QUESTION FOR THE WEEK OF 9/16/96:</STRONG><P>
<FONT color="#000080"><STRONG>Should gay marriages be legal?</STRONG></FONT>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><STRONG>WHAT YOU SAID:</STRONG><P></FONT>
<FONT size=2>
<STRONG><EM>Submitted by Mrs. Scott 9/16/96</EM></STRONG><BR>
   By all means, these types of unions should be legalized- why should
a fair proportion of the citizenry not have to be responsible for his/her
mate?  Insurance, social security, etc. are all services/benefits that
should be extended to any committed relationship.  After all, these
individuals are paying in just the same as the legally recognized marital
partners are.  Some large companies are already recognizing domestic unions
in their benefits' packages.  <BR>

        Recognition of these unions, via legal means, would ensure that each
partner would receive the benefits/responsibilities as any other marital
union must assume. No one in a committed, long term relationship should have
to be 'left out in the cold' if such a union 'divorces'. Quite often there
are children and substantial amounts of property involved. If such unions
were legalized, the family courts could dispense no-fault, rapid justice as
compared to being stuck for years in civil litigation.  This would remove
the moral element and treat these unions in a more humane way- gee, just
like they're like us or something???!!!!!<P>

<STRONG><EM>Submitted by Clyde Parsons 9/16/96</EM></STRONG><BR>
I feel that gay marriages
should be allowed only to protect the partner.  I think that it would be
good idea so that if something were to happen to me then my partner
would be able to make decisions on my behalf.  We could receive the same
benifits as other couples since we have been together for almost 8
years.<P>

<STRONG><EM>Submitted by Mark Horne 9/17/96</EM></STRONG><BR>
I don't understand how a society that repeatedly attacks homosexuals for
their perceived promiscuity can then deny them the right to live in a
legally recognized, committed relationship.  They pay the same taxes as
we do--it's a non-issue.  And could should gay marriages in any way
threaten MY own heterosexual marriage?  I don't think so!  Could gay
marriage do anything but strengthen this country's diminishing sense of
family values?  I think we need all the help we can get!<P>

<STRONG><EM>Submitted by Julie Fichtner 9/18/96</EM></STRONG><BR>
No, Gay Marriages should not be legalized.  God did not create Adam and Fred, 
he created Adam and Eve.  God has a morbid hatred of homosexuality
that he destroyed Sodom and Gomorah because of their lifestyle.  
<BR>
In the Old Testament, God told the Israelites to stone to death anyone who 
engaged in homosexual acts as well as engaged in sexual acts with animals.
He also said that fornicators and adulterors were also to be stoned for their 
illicit lifestyle.  The Bible condems homosexuality, so we as Christians 
should do the same, since it is a command from God.<P>

<EM><STRONG>Submitted by Joe Ruelas 9/18/96</STRONG></EM><BR>
NO, Its wrong!, Legalized gay marriages have no place in our society. It just doesn't fit!<P>



<STRONG><EM>Submitted by Jacque E. Van Cleef 9/20/96</EM></STRONG><BR>
I don't believe they should be allowed. Marriages were originally
intended to legalize the procreation of the human race and the
protection of children. Same-sex couples, while entitled to their
privacy and their "pursuit-of-happiness," do not fill the bill!

If he weren't so hell bent on getting Clinton reelected, he would be 
interesting to hear.  he's the only one who has actually talked about 
the fact that social security and medicare need to be addressed.
<P>

<EM><STRONG>Submitted by William E. Neil 9/24/96</STRONG></EM><BR>
  Ross should have the right as should Nader since both represent their 

perspective parties. Since when do polls listing the chance of being 

elected become a criteria in the democratic processs or is it their ideas
that their parties represent that freighten the status quo.<P>

<STRONG><EM>Submitted by  J.C. Sartor Sr. 9/24/96</EM></STRONG><BR>
   I believe ROSS PEROT or anyone running for President has the right to
enter the debates.  Without the debates, how are we to really know who is
running?  Yes, I agree that Ross Perot doesn't have much of a chance to
win...  Nether does the name caller, DOLE, but he will be at the
debates...... why?  Lets have the whole group;  Clinton, Dole, Perot, Nader, and etc at the
debates--  Let the best man win.  And let the same thing go for the Vice
President debates.<P>

<STRONG><EM>Submitted by Dave Kalwick 9/24/96</EM></STRONG><BR>

By excluding Ross Perot from the debates, the American public is being 
fed a censored version of political views as dictated by parties in 
power.  Sounds a lot like Communist thinking to me.<P>

<EM><STRONG>Submitted by Mike Shirley 9/24/96</STRONG></EM><BR>
Yes, but not becuase he is a viable candidate.  He shot himself in the
foot 4 years ago when he pulled out of the race for a month due to his
"concern" for his daugher's safety.  That sunk all chances 4 years ago. 
This, his 2nd election race, is futile no matter how much money is
spent.

But RP would cause focus the other 2 real candidates on real issues. 
Just as he did last election.  Unfortunately, he ended up essentially
getting Bill Clinton elected by splitting the vote.

And we are still in a race of not voting for who we don't want to be our
next president...

<STRONG> QUESTION FOR THE WEEK OF 9/30/96:</STRONG><P>
<FONT color="#000080"><STRONG>Should Chris Gywnn's game winning double get him a renewed contract with the Padres? </STRONG></FONT>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><STRONG>WHAT YOU SAID:</STRONG><P></FONT>

<STRONG><EM>Submitted by JC Sartor 9/30/96</EM></STRONG><BR>
I believe Chris should have the opportunity to continue to play with the
Padres.  If aloud to play more, who knows- another Tony...  The gene pool
don't go to far from home!  Book ends should not be split up.<P>

<EM><STRONG>Submitted by Jennifer Thompson 10/1/96</STRONG></EM><BR>
Chris should have his contract renewed.  His batting average isn't a 
fair reflection of his abilities.  It's going to affect a player's 
average when he's only used off the bench every once in a while.  
And even though this has been a tough year for him, he still came 
through in a clutch.  And if he performs when it really matters, that's 
what counts.<P>

<STRONG><EM>Submitted by Chris Carmichael 10/2/96</EM></STRONG><BR>
Why are you asking this question?  Really.  The only qualified answer, is,
let the Padres decide.  They have the right to resign, or tell him to pack
his bags.  Don't get me wrong, I've followed the Padres this year, and the
professional baseball team battled it out in the western division.
Second guessing Bruce, Bob or the organization won't do me, a FAN, any good.<P>

<STRONG><EM>Submitted by Tyler Arciaga 10/2/96</EM></STRONG><BR>
Yes, I think the Padres should renew his contract becuase he is a clutch 
hitter in tough situation, and he does better when he plays on the same 
team as his brother.  I don't think it should be for that one hit, but 
for all of the clutch hits that he has gotten through out the season.  
The double will help his situation as a Padre.
<P>

<STRONG><EM>Submitted by Vincent Hiep 10/3/96</EM></STRONG><BR>
We all love Tony Gywnn but to let Chris ride on his back is just out of
the question.  This is profesional baseball.  Players make more money in
one year than most people hope to make in their lifetime.  Chris neither
have the records nor the skills to be as good as Tony.  Disregarding
Chris' past performance and renew his contract because Chris shined at a
critical point of the game is unacceptable.  'Yes' to this question is
strictly out of sentiment to Tony and the spark of the moment when Chris
came thru.

<STRONG> QUESTION FOR THE WEEK OF 10/7/96:</STRONG><P>
<FONT color="#000080"><STRONG>Do you think the presidential debate influenced voter opinion?</STRONG></FONT>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><STRONG>WHAT YOU SAID:</STRONG><P></FONT>
<FONT size=2>
<EM><STRONG>Submitted by  Javier R. Ramos 10/7/96</STRONG></EM><BR>
Despite his extensive political experience, Bob Dole came across as
a nervous novice incapable of convincing even his own party following
of his worthiness for the presidency.  Of Clinton I offer this:  no 
substance, but adequate enough to defeat the opposition and slither
past us his tired liberal policies consisting mainly of liberal
give away to the non productive at the expense of the rest of us. 
Therefore, I was not influenced by the first debate, unfortunately. <P>

<STRONG><EM>Submitted by Vincent Hiep Nguyen 10/7/96</EM></STRONG><BR>
Not really, I watched the news every day and I don't change my mind over a
short debate.  I don't think a debate can change how most people vote.  Most
people know who Dole and Clinton are by now and a debate is not going to
expose anything we haven't heard before.  By the way, the debate was very
boring.  Both of them keep throwing statistic and figures at us; I think
'figure don't lie but liars figure'.<P>


<EM><STRONG>Submitted by Magdalena Rivera 10/9/96</STRONG></EM><BR>
It's truly amazing that people watched the debate, and yet heard 
nothing that was said.  Bob Dole tried to rid himself of the 
"mean-spirited, cold" man that he is, but he had no success!  He did 
not answer any of Jim Lehrer's questions.  Instead he used his sixty 
seconds to try and slander the President.  When asked what he would do 
as president, he simply pointed out what the President had done.  His 
party will forever try to win with a campaign that tries to damage the 
character of its opponent.  Sorry, Bob, you failed!
	On the other side of the stage was a confident man who had the record 
to prove his worth and work.  President Clinton has hard facts to 
support his hard work for the past four years.  Mind you, I am not 
giving him the sole credit, but when he campaigned in 1992 and told us 
all that he had planned as president, he did exactly what he claimed.  
Way to go, Mr. President.  
	Bob Dole said during the debate that he learned a long time ago that 
a man's word is his honor.  By that statement, the President is an 
honorable and dedicated man who cares for his country, not just a 
select few like Dole and the Republican party.
	It's a shame that we must divide ourselves in sex, class, race, and 
now party, but as a university student who is planning to teach, I 
must stand by the party who promotes education for all and who does 
not want to do away with the Department of Education.  I guess Bob is 
afraid that if all our children and their families are educated, they 
will then know that he is wrong and completely unsubstantiated!<P>

<STRONG><EM>Submitted by Tyler Arciaga 10/9/96</EM></STRONG><BR>

I don't think the debate influenced me because these men have been in 
public office for more than 20 years each.  I judge them on what they 
have done in the past 20 years and not on a two hour "Mud Slinging" 
Contest.  <P>

<EM><STRONG>Submitted by Judy Freeman 10/9/96</STRONG></EM><BR>
These on-air diatribes are not debates, but long winded attempts, by 
both candidates, to advance their agendas.  Many people would appreciate 
a "none of the above" category on the ballot that would force the 
nomination of some worthwhile candidates, whatever their party 
affiliation.  I do not believe a significant number of opinions were 
affected by the first Clinton/Dole meeting nor do I expect that to 
change unless one of them makes a major mistake.

<STRONG> QUESTION FOR THE WEEK OF 10/14/96:</STRONG><P>
<FONT color="#000080"><STRONG>Do you think marijuana should be legalized for use under a doctor's orders?</STRONG></FONT>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><STRONG>WHAT YOU SAID:</STRONG><P></FONT>
<FONT size=2>
<STRONG><EM>Submitted by Andy Newmann 10/14/96</EM></STRONG><BR>
I believe that marijuana should be legalized, but only under the
strict supervision of a doctor for medical purposes.  There are many very
ill people who would benefit from the pain reduction and appetite
stimulating properties of this drug.  Currently, a marijuana derivative, Marinol, is already available for
this purpose.  The cost of this drug exceeds that of an equivalent dose of
regular marijuana by a very large amount, however.  The drug companies make
huge profits, while terminally ill patients either pay or suffer.  This is
an outrage.  Why not legalize it now?<P>

<STRONG><EM>Submitted by Bill Blake 10/15/96</EM></STRONG><BR>
I am 50 years old and NEVER even tried marijuana, so I don't really know
what it's like.
If it will help ill patients to recieve this for medicinal purposes and at
a reasonible price, then I say, why not give it a try. The only drawback I
see, is that hundreds of people may be flocking to their doctors and trying
to convince them that they really need the marijuana for an ailment that
doesn't really exist.  Time will tell.<P>

<STRONG><EM>Submitted by Page Stambaugh 10/15/96</EM></STRONG><BR>
I am concerned about legalizing marajuana.  As I understand it the latest 
bill would allow almost anyone to grow and use mj.  When we look at the 
decline in America today I think we should be looking for positive answers 
not escapes.  I am not convinced about mj helping the termally ill.  I do 
think that marajuana legalization will make way for the legalization of 
other potentually harmful drugs.  We have all the hoopla over not 
smoking tabbaco so why on earth would we want to legalized 
another smokeing bomb?  Maybe I don't understand all the positions, but I 
think that using the termally ill is a 'smokescreen' to the legalization 
issue.  When my mother was dying of cancer she said she concidered mj 
and I did not take issue with her but I don't see how that would have 
helped her.  It would have hindered the time we did share before she 
died.<P>

<STRONG><EM>Submitted by Dave Curtis 10/17/96</EM></STRONG><BR>
I have glaucoma in both my eyes.  This condition if not treated throughout my entire
life will cause blindness, as I am told.  The optical nerve becomes damaged 
as pressure builds thus destroying pixels of vision that is irreversible.  You tell
me, would you use marijuana if it might help prevent you from going blind.  I 
think the answer is obvious.   Sure marijuana might have side affects.  I've
also seen many legal prescribed drugs having side affects.  <P>

<STRONG><EM>Submitted by Magdalena Rivera 10/17/96</EM></STRONG><BR>

Is not marijuana an organic weed (for lack of a better term) that grows
naturally from the earth?  And do not most of our pharmaceuticals come
from natural, organic substances of the earth?  If anyone has been
through the rainforest exhibit at the SD Zoo, he or she would know that
there is the question that if we destroy all the rainforests in the
world without further investigating their plant and organic life, we may
be in jeopardy of missing the cure for AIDS or cancer.  
	I do not agree that legalizing marijuana for medicinal use is simply a
ploy to make way for legalizing other drugs.  We all know that marijuana
is one of the most abused drug around the world.  However, we also know
that for terminally ill patients who suffer from effects of chemotherapy
and the HIV virus marijuana is a helpful, safe alternative to other
prescription drugs.  There are no major side effects that will cause
pain or discomfort.  On the contrary, the whole reason for its use in
this context is to stimulate an appetite and relieve pain.  What could
possibly wrong with those effects?
	It's just that society has already agreed that marijuana is a narcotic
and that it's use is strictly forbidden.  However, if we reverse that
connotation, perhaps we could help these suffering patients live more
comfortably.  After all, doesn't everyone trust his or her physician? 
Why would a doctor prescribe marijuana if he or she did not believe in
its benefits for these patients?  We need to realize that a physician
will not prescribe marijuana for just anyone who comes in for an
ailment.  It is obvious that its use is for the specific effects of pain
reduction and appetite stimulation.  
	I trust that if it were to be legalized, the medical community, as well
as the FDA, would control its use and dosage just like any other
pharmaceutical.  I believe in searching all alternatives to help
terminally ill patients, and if marijuana helps them then so be it.

<STRONG> QUESTION FOR THE WEEK OF 10/21/96:</STRONG><P>
<FONT color="#000080"><STRONG>Do you agree with President Clinton's "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" policy on gays in the military?</STRONG></FONT>

NO!<P>

<EM><STRONG>Submitted by Earl Charles 10/21/96</STRONG></EM><BR>
The military should NOT be the place to try and experiment with the
acceptance of a socially unacceptable immoral lifestyle.  History has
proven over the last 3,000 to 4,000 years that this immoral lifestyle is
socially unacceptable.  Therefore our nations leaders should NOT try and
force the acceptance.<P>


<STRONG><EM>Submitted by Kevin Hill 10/21/96</EM></STRONG><BR>
I agree with president clintons policy about "Dont Ask, Don't Tell."

Additionally, I feel that the issue of being gay or not, is a sexual
preference that, like heterosexuality, is not discussed openly amoung
your co-workers and casual freinds.

I also beleive that if the commanding officer feels that a soldiers
homosexuality is reducing the effectiveness of his/her unit, that
officer has the right and responsibility to remove said individual from
the unit.  

Basically, this issue boils down to one major point.  The military is
formed to fight wars and enforce law.  If a soldier is causing problems
with any issue, he should be removed or transferred to somewhere that he
is not likely to cause problems.  If the soldier cannot be moved to an
area that he will not disrupt, then a discharge is called for.
<P>

<EM><STRONG>Submitted by Mike Bekemeier 10/22/96</STRONG></EM><BR>
No I do not!  I served 4 years in the US Navy from July 1970 through July
1974, and was honorably discharged.  I am a gay man, I have always been gay.
 I was not asked and I didn't tell, so I received a 4 year good conduct award
the same day I was discharged.  That was twenty years before President
Clinton's new policy!
President Clinton's "Don't ask, don't tell" policy didn't change anything!
 Anybody who says otherwise, just doesn't get it!
<P>

<STRONG><EM>Submitted by Phuong Nguyen 10/22/96</EM></STRONG><BR>
No.  I do not agree with President Clinton's policy.  It is infringement on 
the rights of the people of the United States.  If he were to continue this, 
then none of us should say anything about what we eat, how we dress, where we 
go, or any of the other things we do as free American!
<P>


<STRONG><EM>Submitted by Larry West 10/22/96</EM></STRONG><BR> 
A couple of your other respondents seem to be confused.  Earl Charles thinks
that 3000 to 4000 years of history indicates that homosexuality is immoral
and socially inacceptable.  Well, history isn't that simple: it's never been
a popular trait, but the Greeks and Romans didn't find it unacceptable, and
the early Christians were divided on it.   More recently, societies with
centralized authoritatian power structures (Nazi Germany, for example) have
repressed it (often fiercely), but more open societies have generally looked
the other way.
<BR>
Phuong Nguyen seems to have not understood the question.  As
commander-in-chief and as president, Clinton has to make (sometimes with
Congress) policies for governing the armed forces, which are part of the
government.  These policies don't apply to individuals outside the
government.   The question here is how to balance the constitutional rights
of the individual soldiers with the legitimate needs of the government.   In
case you weren't aware, soldiers already have little to say about what they
eat, how they dress, et cetera.  That's because they're soldiers, and to me
that is acceptable as long as they are volunteer soldiers (and knew what
they were getting into).
<BR>
My own opinion is that Don't Ask/Don't Tell is a compromise that I hope
won't last.   Gay people clearly have the constitutional right to join the
military, and have done so with great honor over the years.   Forcing them
to keep it a secret is the kind of bizarre thing that people 30 years from
now will look back on as we now look back on segregated drinking fountains
from the 1950's: an embarrassing policy based on bigotry and widespread
ignorance.   <BR>

On balance, I think that some judge will finally have the cojones to say the
obvious: that people's rights shouldn't be compromised solely because (as
the government argues) other people are ignorant and bigoted.   When Chief
Justice Rehnquist (who always favors governmental interests over the
individual's) has retired, this will stick.   But this will probably not
happen for another five years, and by then enough people will have become
accustomed to the concept of gays in the military, that it will be basically
a non-issue, like women in the military.  Or blacks in the military.   Or
other things which opponents said would tear the country apart.<P>

<P>
<EM><STRONG>Submitted by Paul Isner</STRONG></EM><BR>
As a gay man, NO, I do not agree with President Clinton's stand of gays
in the military!  I am disappointed with his policy towards the gay and
lesbian community, but, I must admit that my disappointment with Clinton
is soon dissolved when I think of what might happen to the gay community
should Bob Dole be elected.  I hope that we elect a president, with some
guts and vision, sometime in my lifetime (I'm 37 years old) who will
revise the antiquated rules which govern our armed forces; and, I hope
that that President will acknowledge and bring to light the fact that
this nation (which I love tremendously) has been protected and defended
by gay men and women since the earliest days of its independence.
<P>

<EM><STRONG>Submitted by Souk Mixay 10/23/96</STRONG></EM><BR>
The real issue isn't really whether or not there are homosexuals in the 
military but what solution will give us an effective fighting force.  
The "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" policy is a compromise and both extremes 
will be offended by it. The issue behind the issue is national security 
and if the stigma and secrecy are removed from homosexuality the "gay" 
soldier can not be blackmailed or have his "life style" used against 
him.  Thus, removing a potential security risk which has been in place 
for some time now.  The removal of this security risk should put the 
arguments of one side to rest. The oppinion in the "gay community" is 
that the "significant other" should be considered as a spouse.  The 
issue of significant others is not addressed in this policy (and maybe 
now is not the time to address it).  Homosexual marriage may never be 
accepted by society as a whole since marriage by design is meant to 
perpetuate the human race.  And so;significant others (homosexual or 
heterosexual) may not have the same reverence as does heterosexual 
marriage in our society for some time to come.  Thus, putting the 
arguments of the other extreme to rest.  Yes, neither side got what they 
wanted but, each side got something they may not have been looking for; 
peace of mind.  Homosexuals are now allowed to serve (if they feel 
called to) and there is no "potential" security risk involved.

There is no place in the military for gay persons, male or female.  There is
too much chance for favborite treatment between them.  I spent 6 years
(mostly at sea) during WWII, a year in Korea aboard a small patrol frigate,
and 3 years during the cold war interdiction patrols aboard navy vessels, so
I know what I am talking about.  The sailors at sea think about sex, but
certainly don' t practice it, and therefore are able to keep their focus on
their job.<P>

For those of you who think that being gay is O.K..  We shall see come

I retired from the Navy in 87 after 23 years. I worked with guys I new 
were gay and they new I was straight and as far as I know we never had 
problems.  I guess I really don't understand the President's policy. I 
don't believe gays or any other group of people deserve any more or 
any less rights than anyone else have.  I would not leave my child in the 
hands of a gays person because I believe we all have bias's and mannerisms
that we pass onto others and I would not want my child to think that 
being gay was an exceptable way of life.  I have no animosity toward the 
person, I just will not except it has a way of life. It goes against 
everything I believe in.<P>

<STRONG><EM>Submitted by Carol Culp 10/25/96</EM></STRONG><BR>
President Clinton has a habit of fence sitting, when it comes to
controversial issues.  When you attempt to please everyone, you please
no one.  Staying in the middle may be a safe place to be, but does a
great disservice to those he claims to serve.
When it comes to leadership..this is a prime example of Clinton's
reluctance to do what he was elected to do.  
Those decisions he DOES make are done so illogically, such as the
decision to send troops overseas without checking first with the country
to see if they wanted help.
Clinton seems to have a problem with making bad decisions.
Although homosexuality is not an approved lifestyle for the majority of
us, nevertheless I have known some homosexuals both male and female, who
served
in the military and who I felt did a really good job.  As long as their
behavior at the job is satisfactory, I see no reason to ban them
altogether.  
However, I would not allow them to serve at a level where high security
is required in times of conflict, because of the vulnerability of their
being compromised.
<P>

<EM><STRONG>Submitted by John Sanders 10/25/96</STRONG></EM><BR>
What is so surpising? Everything Bill Clinton does is:  "Don't Ask, Don't 
Tell, (then cover it up)".

<STRONG><EM>Submitted by Mary Lopez 10/28/96</EM></STRONG><BR>
I absolutely do think the media had a hand in the "media conviction" of   
Mr Jewell.  When this whole affair happened I remember thinking, I sure   
hope they are sure about this before releasing information.  There was no   
iron clad case in this, and I beleive it was a public lynching.  It's time   
we do something to put some controls on reporting news without having the   
whole story.   <P>

<STRONG><EM>Submitted by Harry Beasor 10/29/96</EM></STRONG><BR> 
Yes!  They had him tried and convicted long before a shred of evidence was
found.  So what if he fit the profile of a bomber.  There are many people
in this world who are loners, etc.  The media has tarnished the Richard
Jewell name forever.<P>


<STRONG><EM>Submitted by Page Stambaugh 10/30/96</EM></STRONG><BR>
I think perhaps to menton any suspects name is wrong.  I do belive the 
media is getting a little to free in statments made about people.  I wish 
they would see us as PEOPLE who if wrongly accused have LIVES that will 
be harmed by a mistake in judgment by publicity.  What was the point in 
publicizing the suspects name?  Was the concern to notify the public in 
his immediate area, so they could be causious??  I'm sure rummor mills 
take care of that as well as the police.  Tthere was no reason, that I 
can see, that I should be imformed here in CA about a man in GA who is 
ONLY A SUSPECT in any case even a major one.  What is the point?  So that 
I could sit home and make my own judments?  I do think after pondering 
that the media tends to overdue for sensationalism.  I have never been in 
this type of sistuation but after hearing so many stories like this on TV 
(news?) being wrong I turn a deaf ear now and what a pity ~~ not to even 
care about news any more ~~ I find myself more and more suspect of ANY 
STORY that comes out that has to do with people ~~ even on my favorite 
channel ten.  Sorry.<P>

Yes, the man was tried and convicted by the news media, before the FBI,
really got started in their investigation.  But the FBI, had a lot to do
with the so called leak to the media, if the FBI wanted this to be kept
quiet it would have been, even Richard Jewell would not have known that
he was a suspect!<P>

<STRONG><EM>Submitted by Vincent Hiep 10/31/96</EM></STRONG><BR>
No, I don't think the media convicted Richard Jewell.  The media did
what I expected it to do.  That is to do research and dig as deep as it
can into any hint of improprieties.  That is it sole job in society; to
inform us with information; to keep an eye on our government.  If anyone
is at fault at convicting Richard Jewell, it is the government. 
Particular the person who leeked the news that Richard Jewell was the
main suspect.
In this country we have three branches of government:  The Executive,
the Legislative, and the Judicial branch, and if you asked me, we also
have the "Media branch".  They keep the eyes on everybody.  Of course,
like our government, their researches and dirt digging will sometimes
render nothing but 'dirt'.  But then, they are only doing their job-and
I expect them to continue doing it that way.

<STRONG><EM>Submitted by Clifford Daggett 11/4/96</EM></STRONG><BR>
No, I'm not in favor of Doctor assisted suicide. I think it opens 
the door to too many variables. Who decides when it's ok for the 
Dr. to assist and when it's not. If the patient has a life 
threatening disease, or debilitating disease, who decides whether or 
not they are stable enough to make that kind of decision for them 
selves ? My mother lives with us , she is suffering from 
Alzheimer's disease, and even though it is a great burden on our 
family, we could never make this kind of decision. The only Dr. who 
has the right to decide who should live or die is the Great 
Physician!!<P>


<STRONG><EM>Submitted by Juliane Van Houten 11/4/96</EM></STRONG><BR>
I am in favor of physician assisted suicide.  As a RN I see people
suffering every day.  <P>

<STRONG><EM>Submitted by Judy Terry 11/4/96</EM></STRONG><BR>
I am not in favor of physician assisted suicide.  I base my opinion on a 
personal experience.  My mother was very ill in 1973.  Everyone 
including many doctors gave up on her.  They put her in a nursing home 
to die.  My dad would not give up on her & brought her home.  She 
recovered from all her health problems & lived happily till 1984. I am 
glad my mother did not have the opportunity to end her life early & was 
able to go on to enjoy eleven more years.<P>

<STRONG><EM>Submitted by Terry Apple 11/4/96</EM></STRONG><BR>
Physician-assisted suicide is one of the choices I would want to have.
 Anyone afraid of "who will make that decision?" is paranoid, unrealistic,
naive and/or shortsighted.  Why else would one choose to die with pain,
suffocation, and/or disintegration?   I shudder to think that such a person
could be making choices for me one day.<P>

<STRONG><EM>Submitted by Andy H. Ix 11/4/96</EM></STRONG><BR>
My brother is a first year medical student at the University if Chicago
Medical school this year and he and I have often discussed this subject.
Clearly, there are no obvious answers for a physician who has dedicated the
better part of their young life to studying the art of healing people.
However, my brother did make one observation that stuck. The point to a
physician's career is to promote health and alleviate suffering through
compassion and the application of their learned trade. I would argue that it
is the responsibility of a doctor to alleviate the suffering of a patient who
is in excruciating pain from a medical condition unlikely to improve
(cancer, AIDS, etc.). Yet, a doctor's ultimate aim is to promote life.
Therefore, it would be so difficult for my brother or any physician to
justify the ending of a patient's life through "assisted suicide." My belief
is still that as responsible persons we ought to establish a living will to
help our family, our next of kin, and our  physician's know what we would
want should we be beyond consciousness. That is what I intend to do to
resolve this dilemma.
<P>
<STRONG><EM>Submitted by Guy Halac 11/5/96</EM></STRONG><BR>
I read with some amusement a remark on your web site from a viewer who
thinks that fearing who would make that decision is "parnaoid, naive,
and shortsighted. Thats quiestionable. One has to only look back at the
Thrid Reich and the acceptance of euthanasia in that society as an
example of how the naivete of some lead to even more pain and suffering. 
Think about it! We have cases where nurse in hospitals have made the
call on patients because they determined it was the "right thing to
do!". We must also realize that each case where a physician suicide may
be warranted will not always present itself with consent of the patient
receiving the treatment. What then? Make the decision yourself and
fillout a living will!<P>


<STRONG><EM>Submitted by Julie I. Fichtner 11/5/96</EM></STRONG><BR>
As a Christian, I cdannot support the idea of Doctor Assisted Suicide.  Since 
we are made in the image of God, we do not have the right to take away another 
persons life.  Only God has the right to do this.  To force the Doctors to 
make this decision would be turning them into instruments of death rather than 
for saving lives.  It not only pervert the medical profession, but also the 
Hypocratic Oath.  However, if a person takes his own life without assistance, 
it is a personal decision he has made between himself and God.  
<P>

<EM><STRONG>Submitted by Michael Anderson 11/5/96</STRONG></EM><BR>
I am in favor of it, as my life belongs to ME, not the government, not
the hospitals, or to the public at large.  I think that it is absolutely
ridiculous to force people who live in misery to exist. That is mere
existance, not life.  I have heard many people ask who has the right to
decide which cases qualify.  I say that it is the PATIENT'S right. 
There should be some form of counselling to ensure it is not a snap
decision, but it should be allowed.  Why force people to make their last
act a criminal one?<P>

<STRONG><EM>Submitted by Hope Jensen 11/5/96</EM></STRONG><BR>

This is a difficult question to answer because it involves individual
people with individual beliefs and values that make them the people they
are.  How can a court system or anyone else, especially someone who is not
even involved in the person's life or situation, take it upon themselves to
make such a choice for EVERYONE.  I believe that a person morally and
ethically has the right to decide the answer to this question themselves. 
My view is, if it's not right for you, then that is your right and that is
who you are, but please don't tell me that my beliefs and values have to be
the same as yours.  I value life and believe that everyone has the right to
live, but if someone is severely suffering from a life threatening or
terminal illness with the likelihood that they will spend the last days of
their life in constant pain and agony, this person has a right to make this
decision for his or herself.   <P>

<STRONG><EM>Submitted by Sally Anderson 11/5/96</EM></STRONG><BR>
The answer is NO! I am not in favor of Doctor assisted suicide, or any other kind.
Suicide of any kind is the same as murder. God is the "Great Physician", and is the
only one who should determine when your time on earth is over.  When we have loved ones
who are terminal, and maybe suffering, we don't know the reason the remain in that state
for the time they do, but it is part of His plan.  "All things work together for good, for
those who believe".  There is a time for everything; it is not our time, but HIS!<P>

<STRONG><EM>Submitted by Skip Curtis 11/6/96</EM></STRONG><BR>
Your question goes to the heart of our purpose of being or living in the
first place.  Those who accept that we are placed here to learn and grow and
experience this life before passing to another more lasting existence may be
more likely to reject the idea of taking oneself "out of the game."  On the
other hand, those who prefer to view life as ending at death are more likely
to make this existence as painless as possible.  In my view, we learn far
more through pain and suffering than we do in the ease of day-to-day living.
 In some cases, we learn suffering through serving those who seem to suffer
interminably.  Yet, there are some of us who personally suffer great physical
and emotional pain and anguish as we work through this mortality to an
immortal existence.  Once immortal, we are then able to view more clearly
view this brief life in the proper context.  Irrespective of our various
views in this life, the law will decide how to best handle this delicate and
personal situation.  Those who take advantage of euthanasia will leave a
little early from this life, yet in the end we are all "dead".  It's what
happens after that will really count.

<STRONG> QUESTION FOR THE WEEK OF 11/11/96:</STRONG><P>
<FONT color="#000080"><STRONG>Elizabeth Dole's name was mentioned as a possible Republican presidential candidate in the year 2000.  Do you think the United States is ready for a female president?  </STRONG></FONT>

<EM><STRONG>Submitted by Paul Hays 11/11/96</STRONG></EM><BR>
I think we are more than ready. As long as the woman hasn't abandoned
her femininity to become a caricature of a man, such as Kirkpatrick.
A better choice would be Barbara Bush.
<P>

<EM><STRONG>Submitted by Deborah Ferreday 11/12/96</STRONG></EM><BR>
I think we are more than ready for a women president.  Women have proven 
capable of outstanding leadership.  Look at Christine Todd Whitman of New 
Jersey and the other women governors, congresswomen, and senators.
<P>


<STRONG><EM>Submitted by Julie I. Fichtner 11/13/96</EM></STRONG><BR>
I strongly believe that Elizabeth Dole would make a GREAT PRESIDENT in the 
year 2000.  She has class, integrity, intelligence, and grace that is vitally 
needed to serve in the White House.  I disagree with the other person's 
opinion because Barbara Bush has not been in the public eye, except during the 
time of her husband's term as President, and then only as the First Lady.<P>

<STRONG><EM>Submitted by Lee Phillips 11/14/96</EM></STRONG><BR>
It is unfortunate that we live in a country where the questions "Are we
ready for a woman President?" and "Are we ready for a black President?"
are still asked.  People are reluctant to change, and shun anything that
hasn't been done yet.  Yes, to both questions actually!!  The right
*PERSON* for any job is that person whose skills and talents are best
suited to the challeges faced.  Be they white, black, man, woman, short,
tall, young, old or even physically handicapped.<P>

<STRONG><EM>Submitted by David Curtis 11/14/96</EM></STRONG><BR>
The thought of having a female President of the United States
sounds a little scary.  The thought of Janet Reno or 
Hillary Clinton being the President of the United States
makes me quiver.  Both these two women I feel have
some demon inside them just waiting to be released.
On the other hand there are plenty of men that fit this
bill as well.  I don't know anything about Mrs. Bob
Dole, but I would consider her equal no matter what
her gender is.  


<EM><STRONG>Submitted by Carl Weaver 11/15/96</STRONG></EM><BR>
Absolutely, I think the United States can handle a woman for president. 
Historically, England, India, as well as other countries have or has had
successful women heads of governmnet, so why not the U.S!  In fact, if
you look at the voting statistics of the recent election, you would find
that more women voted than ever before, and a preponderence of them (48%
out of 53%) voted for Bill Clinton, so if people think that women in
this country couldn't influence a political vote,there mistaken!  I
often thought that if Elizabeth Dole ran for President of the US, she
would draw a lot of votes and win.  Although, the next major election
will probably be Al Gore vs. Jack Kemp, who knows it could be Hillary
Clinton vs. Elizabeth Dole, and wouldn't that be interesting!

<STRONG> QUESTION FOR THE WEEK OF 11/18/96:</STRONG><P>
<FONT color="#000080"><STRONG>Is the recent Texaco incident evidence that racism still exists in corporate America?</STRONG></FONT>
<P>

<FONT SIZE=2><STRONG>WHAT YOU SAID:</STRONG><P></FONT>
<FONT size=2>
<STRONG><EM>Submitted by Larry Peterson 11/18/96</EM></STRONG><BR>
Racism exist in the minds of all people, to one degree or another.<P>

<EM><STRONG>Submitted by David Curtis 11/19/96</STRONG></EM><BR>
It is funny if not deliberate that this incident came out shortly after the 
elections.  I'm sure there is racism out there and I'm not saying it
is good, it is not.  Quotas are not good either.  I once
seeked employment with a large police department in the 
early 80's and was told at the oral interview that I was 
not the right color.  I being a white male did 2 written exams, physical agility 
testing, polygraph and medical exams and passed them
all only to have the panel dismiss my chances because
of a quota system.  This was very aggravating to go through
all this process only to get the axe.  Racism in business is
not good but quotas are equally no good.<P>

<STRONG><EM>Submitted by Clovis M. Honore 11/23/96</EM></STRONG><BR>
In light of Denny's, Coors, Prop 209, Prop 187, O. J. Simpson, etc. ad
infinitum, the question is at best, naive; at least, condescending.  When the
Declaration of Independence was signed, by only white men, many of the
signatories were slaveholders.  When the Constitution was ratified, Africans
on this soil were counted as 3/5 persons.  When Dred Scott sued for freedom,
in a free state, he was told he was not a citizen, and had no standing.  Need
we review Plessy v. Ferguson, George Wallace, Bull Connor, red lining, Bakke,
Adarand...
<P>
From 1865 (13th Amendment), to be generous, to the present, it has taken
Constitutional Amendments, Boycotts, Federal troops and a Civil War to bring
about even a modicum of John Lockes "self evident" truths to Africans and
their decendents in America "the Beautiful."  The oft contentious effort to
hold and advance these basic human rights goes on in school textbooks,
meeting rooms, the marketplace, public discourse (like this), and homes every
day.
<P>
I think it's time we left off the platitudinous inquiry into the "if" and
begin to deal more definitively with the "what to do about it."  Obviously,
it isn't going to go away by any light coercion.  The hearts of men and women
are branded with a curse inherited from perilous times.  The
treatment--radical surgery.  The prognosis...

<STRONG> QUESTION FOR THE WEEK OF 11/25/96:</STRONG><P>
<FONT color="#000080"><STRONG>Do you think cameras should have been permitted in the courtroom during the O.J. Simpson civil trial?</STRONG></FONT>
<P>

<EM><STRONG>Submitted by Cameron Freie 11/25/96</STRONG></EM><BR>

<EM><STRONG>Submitted by Julie Fichtner 11/26/96</STRONG></EM><BR>
No, I do not think that cameras should be allowed in the court room of any 
trial.  I think that the cameras cause serious problems due to the fact that 
the laweyers are looking more at the cameras than at what they should be doing 
which is defending their clients.  I also think that many people who watch 
these trials do not have any true understanding of the justice system and how 
evidence is gathered for the cases to be tried.  The final reason is the fact 
that the cameras causees the cases to be sensationalized because it tends to 
make celeberties out of the lawyers who are trying the case.
<P>
<EM><STRONG>Submitted by Yvonne Ayers 11/26/96</STRONG></EM><BR>
No, Enough is Enough!! There is so much more going on in the world today. 
This trial has taken up enough time, not to mention money already.  Lets 
focus on agenda items that can make a difference, ie World hunger, finding 
homes for the homeless, unemployment, child/spousal abuse, underpriviledged 
families.  Not only the negative news but positive as well.  There is more 
going on in this world than O.J. Simpson.  Let's stop the circus and so much 
media attention focusing on this trial.<P>

<STRONG><EM>Submitted by Clyde Parsons  11/27/96</EM></STRONG><BR>
No, I don't think that cameras should be allowed in the court room of
trials.  I think that if people want to see what is happening with a
case then they should go to the courthouse themselves and sit through
the case.<P>

<STRONG><EM>Submitted by Don Andon 11/29/96</EM></STRONG><BR>
Since Television lives and dies by the camera, it's abunduntly clear
that what the people think is of little moment. Your question implies
that what the people feel might really influence the case of cameras in
the courtroom. Since that is patently untrue, the question is ludicrous.
  The TV pirhana mentality will always prevail.
  If this question is overwhelmingly answered in the negative, will KGTV
then black out feeds from any future OJ type trial? 
<P>

<STRONG><EM>Submitted by Patrick Allen 11/30/96</EM></STRONG><BR>
NO.   It's bad enough that he got away with killing his ex-wife and that
young.  Why should the public have to pay homeage to a killer that got
away with COLD BLOODED MURDER .
<P>

<STRONG><EM>Submitted by Teresa Elms 11/30/96</EM></STRONG><BR>
 No, absolutely not.  Give the poor guy a rest already; he's got
enough to deal with, whatever the outcome of the trial. <P>
    That doesn't mean I disapprove of TV cameras in court generally. 
Court TV, for example, is both discrete and educational.  I would
approve of anything that looked like C-SPAN ... i.e., dull & tedious,
but unedited, unsensationalized, and COMPLETE.  I'd also trust the PBS
NewsHour/Jim Lehrer people to do a decent 15 minute chunk of coverage. 
But commercial news broadcasts generally have one minute, maybe one and
a half, to get a STORY across and move on to the REAL news -- SPORTS! 
(Ugh!) Let in commercial news teams with their cameras, and what do you
get?  Photorealistic stories with a beginning, middle, and end --
possibly even a moral.  The video images convey credibility, as if the
viewer were witnessing the entire scene with his/her own eyes.  But in
fact, the images are edited.  And real life has no plot, no nice & neat
beginning/middle/end structure -- certainly not on a daily basis.  Real
issues are too complex to fit in the time slot commercial TV news
allows.  <P>
     Real journalism in this country is nearly dead.  Nobody reports
"just the facts, ma'am" -- digging HARD for those facts, verifying facts
with direct investigation and multiple sources, then leaving the
conclusions to the readers/viewers.  No; today both TV and print media
are guilty of selecting the facts that cohere to a story line (and any
event can be viewed through multiple story lines -- just pick one); then
the "story" is provided complete with prepackaged conclusion so the
reader/viewer need not think about the facts too closely. <P>
     To pick a more neutral example than the second Simpson trial,
consider economic news.  The headline is always, "G7 Meeting a
Success/Failure for Clinton," not "G7 Meeting Resolves Currency
Valuation Dispute." Or some such thing.  I'd prefer to get a reasonably
complete set of facts concerning whatever actually occurred, then decide
for myself what conclusions to draw -- if any can be drawn at all. <P>
     Nonjournalistic storytelling disguised as TV news turned the first
Simpson trial into a needlessly lengthy circus.  No judge should permit
a circus in his/her courtroom, and I think the judge for a particular
case should have full discretion to keep TV cameras out if anything
similar to the "OJ Simpson Greatest Show on Earth" threatens to
undermine sound thinking by plaintiffs, defendants, witnesses,
attorneys, jurors, family/friends/"groupies," or even judges. 
<P>     Sure, the public has a right to know.  But not necessarily TODAY.
<P>

<STRONG><EM>Submitted by Robert Harris 11/30/96</EM></STRONG><BR>
No, it created a circus atmosphere and justice was not served.<P>

<STRONG><EM>Submitted by Rich Famiglietti 11/30/96</EM></STRONG><BR>
Yea, I think they should have been allowed. First this Judge seems to 
favor the plaintiffs and I doubt if OJ will get a fair trial this time 
around. Secondly, I would have liked to hear OJ's testamony for myself 
instead of having to rely on the daily newspapers and tabloids that have 
a different slant on things than the normal person does.<P>

<STRONG><EM>Submitted by James Oliver 12/1/96</EM></STRONG><BR>
I think we should all just FORGET the damn OJ thing.
It's a waste of time, money, and our lives.
It's very sad, but FORGET OJ and get on with life.<P>

To answer the question, yes, cameras should be allowed in all
courtrooms. These are public proceedings.  The real question here,
however, should be "Does this civil trial constitute double jeopardy?" 
Mr. Simpson was tried and aquitted by a jury of his peers.  If we do not
particularly agree with that outcome should civil action be taken?  In
my opinion, no. We either have faith in our system of justice or we
don't.  Did Mr. Simpson "get away with murder"?  Probably, but the case
should have been laid to rest with the verdict.  It is time to move on.

<STRONG> QUESTION FOR THE WEEK OF 12/2/96:</STRONG><P>
<FONT color="#000080"><STRONG>With unemployment down nationally, do you think consumers will spend more money this season?  How will the economy impact you over the holidays?</STRONG></FONT>
<P>

<FONT SIZE=2><STRONG>WHAT YOU SAID:</STRONG><P></FONT>
<FONT size=2>
<STRONG><EM>Submitted by Julie Fichtner 12/3/96</EM></STRONG><BR>
If unemployment is down, then why is it that my husband cannot find work.  He 
has been trying to find a full time job for the past three years.  He had a 
part time job until recently.  Actually, unemployment is much higher than 
statistics shows since it does not include people who have given up trying to find jobs 
and also "bias-factor jobs" are included, jobs which the Labor Department 
thinks exists, but has no evidence to back it up.<P>

<STRONG><EM>Submitted by Teresa Elms 12/3/96</EM></STRONG><BR>
San Diego is lagging the national trend when it comes to unemployment,
although even here the numbers are improving. I just happen to be an
unemployed statistic, not an employed one.  <P>
     All the same, I got lucky and had some short-term consulting
projects to do for an old client.  As I result, I have enough money
to get by for a while.  I'm spending like crazy, but it isn't out of
optimism.  I'm protecting myself against the possibility of a long,
cold winter.  I've prepaid my rent months in advance, and prepaid
other "survival" bills too.  I've stocked up the pantry with canned
foods, medicines, & essential paper products -- among other things.
I'm buying clothes for the job hunt ... not to mention the job that 
presumably will follow one of these interviews.  I'm buying TONS of
clothes, in fact; LL Bean & Lands End should have a very good year,
if I'm any indication.<P>
     I've even socked away some savings & opened a Keogh account.
And I'm taking night & weekend classes at UCSD Extension to enrich &
update my employment skill set.<P>
     So my personal is spending is up, big-time, even though I AM
UNEMPLOYED.  To a certain extent, it's up BECAUSE I am unemployed,
but happen to have some resources to try to end that condition.<P>  
     It's all rooted in a combination of strategy and pessimism. 
I think the economy is in for a big fall.  Not soon; 1997 will 
probably be an okay year.  But as I see it, we've been in transition
to a deflationary economy for the past ten years.  High-tech is
driving the trend, having ALWAYS been a deflationary economic
environment (just compare the $2,000 computer of last year with the
$2,000 computer of the moment). But there's a countervailing force
coming from Baby Boomer spending, which is slowing the impact of
technology-driven deflation in sectors sensitive to the Boomer
cohort's age-related buying behavior.  (These folks are in their peak
earning years, remember, and they grew up with an inflationary 
mindset besides.)  The dynamics of these clashing forces play out
in unexpected ways, and many of the possible scenarios are ugly.<P>
     So, I am trying to adapt my spending to accomplish two things: 
(1) lure a suitable job into my spiderweb, and (2) stock up for a
long, cold winter.  Just in case things go very, very wrong.  Just in
case the jobs aren't there, or I don't have what it takes to beat the
very high caliber of employment competition in this town and can't
acquire it by upgrading my brain and my wardrobe.  Or perhaps the 
coming Year 2000 computer meltdown takes out most of the companies 
that employ people like me.  Whatever.  I aim to be ready.<P>
     I suppose the gun-toting extremist vigilante types in Montana
are thinking the same sorts of things I am.  I'm just stocking up on
food instead of ammunition.  And I'm staying in the city because 
I like it here and things might ... MAYBE ... go right after all.

<STRONG> QUESTION FOR THE WEEK OF 12/9/96:</STRONG><P>
<FONT color="#000080"><STRONG>Do you think O.J. Simpson should be awarded custody of his two children?</STRONG></FONT>
<P>

<FONT SIZE=2><STRONG>WHAT YOU SAID:</STRONG><P></FONT>
<FONT size=2>
<STRONG><EM>Submitted by Michael Street 12/9/96</EM></STRONG><BR>
I believe OJ SHOULD be awarded custody of his two children.
<P>
Whether or not we believe he commited the murders, he was found Not Guilty
by the same system that is deciding the question of the childrens custody.
If he IS innocent, which is all the judge should be allowed to consider,
not whether he THINKS OJ is guilty, then he should be entitled to bring up
his own children.
<P>
If he is NOT awarded custody, it could only be because the Judge does not
believe in the Jury system and has decided to punish OJ for murders that
the Judge believes OJ commited.
<P>
It's a sad solution, but rather a simple question.
<P>
<STRONG><EM>Submitted by Cheri Embree 12/10/96</EM></STRONG><BR>
I personally think those kids are going to be so messed up already. 
They have been with their grand parents for this whole time and I think
they should stay with them.  If OJ is such a good father then why were
the kids not with him when he was on trial?
<P>
<STRONG><EM>Submitted by Kathleen Marion 12/10/96</EM></STRONG><BR>
O.J.  said sometime during or after his trial that he would
spend the rest of his life trying to find the killer of his wife.
Since his acquittal we have seen him jetting off to play golf
all over the world and spending very little time with his
children.  I would think that a grieving husband would
spend as much time with his traumatized children as
possible.  I think the wisest thing he could have done when
the trial was over would have been to hide away with his kids
for six months to a year to help them get their lives back to
normal.  Mr. and Mrs. Brown have had a terrible job of
sheltering those children from the press and the public.  I
think O.J. would have them right in the middle of it.  He
seems to love the limelight.  Whether he was found guilty or
not guilty of the crime should not be a factor at all. The
factor should be his concern and ability to care for his
children without leaving them with a nanny or family while
he enjoys the jet set.   Should he get his kids?   No I don't think so!<P>

<STRONG><EM>Submitted by Andrew Callaci 12/13/96</EM></STRONG><BR>
I don't think he should get custody of his kids because even though he
was found not guilty, his blood was still found at the crime scene so if
he did kill Nicole, what would he do when his kids were with him??<P>

<STRONG><EM>Submitted by Robert Frey 12/14/96</EM></STRONG><BR>
OJ simpson is a MURDERER, my opinion, but opinions are like noses, everyone
has one and they usually smell. 
It is an imperfect system that found him Not Guilty but it is also the best
system ever devised for the mass distribution of societal justice.  As
concerned as I became at the verdict, I would become very concerned if not
scared the day that a mans children could be taken from him because of
someones opinion.<P>

<STRONG><EM>Submitted by Bill McGuigan 12/15/96</EM></STRONG><BR>
I think OJ has the right to have custody of his children.  Even though I
think OJ is guilty of the crime, I have to accept the fact that he was found
not guilty by the jurors.
I don't think he has ever harmed the children so I can't see why there is
even a question or a fight over custody.  I think the Brown family is just
trying to punish OJ for killing their daughter.  They have no right to have
custody of his children.  He has displayed no neglect of those kids.  Let the
man have his children for crying out loud.<P>

<STRONG><EM>Submitted by Don Ridley 12/15/96</EM></STRONG><BR>
or one person to ask a question, should a father get custody of his
kids, is ludicrous. In a time where individuals are abandoning there
kids O.J. Simpson was a person that provided a home for his kids. He
provided for both marriages, a good living, and the opportunity to get a
good education. I ask you this question what business is it of yours if
an individual wants his kids. When a person tries to do right and judged
by people who really dont care about the truth what does it matter.
KGTV, ask yourself this when your ratings rose because of the misery
O.J. Simpson is going through. Think of the millions you make when you
broadcast the misery this individual is going through. To have a job on
someone misfortune is something to be proud of. KGTV there is one
purpose you do serve. You show how individuals are imperfect and that
they must always search for the truth. To search for the truth using
lies, gossip, false information, and thoughts of what people think is no
way to find the right answer. What happen to the press when they were
protector of the truth and innocent. I guess those days are no more from
unbiased reporting. When the forerunners of the American press spoke of
freedom of the press I guess KGTV took it as freedom to make millions.
God made people all the same, in which all people have the desire to
search for the truth. We must except the truth whether we agree with it
or not knowing that one day God will judge individuals truthfully and
with justice.

I believe that the parents should have full control of what their children 
watch on the television.  They are the ones who know their own children and 
therefore can best decide what each child will be able to watch and to 
understand.
<P>
I believe that parents should also be a part of the panel that decides the 
ratings to be put on the various television programs rather just the media.  
The media are so biased and also many of the media do not have children of 
their own, or if they do, they seldom care about what they watch.  The rating 
system that has been proposed is inadequate and too vague in determlining the 
appropriateness of a particular program for children.

I believe that the most memorable event of 1996 are all of the various 
scandals that have been surrounding our President, such as Filegate, 
Whitewatergate, Travelgate, Indogate, etc.  The more I read of these various 
scandals the more I wonder why Clinton was ever re-elected by the people.  
<P>
It saddens me to realize that so many Americans do not realize the inportance 
of character in choosing a President to Govern us.  I hope that the truth will 
help the American People to realize that they have to be more informed on the 
issues before they ever enter the voting box to cast their vote.

Joe Gibbs would be an ideal candidate.  He and Beathard worked well in

is.

<STRONG> Question for the Week of 1/13/97:</STRONG><P>
<font color="#000080"><STRONG>Should Ebonics be accepted as a legitimate language?</STRONG></font>
<P>


<STRONG>What  You Said:</STRONG><P>
<b><i>Submitted by Debbie Carlson 1/13/97</i></b><br>
In my opinion, I do not think Ebonics should be recognized as an
official language.  You do not have to legitimize slang in order to
teach proper english.  I consider Ebonics to be more of a dialect issue,
not a language in and of itself.  Are we to then recognize all dialects
as individual languages?  This is a horrible precedent, one that could
open up a tremendous can of worms!    <P>


<b><i>Submitted by T. Ulrich 1/13/97</i></b><br>
No official status, but I might consider Piglatin....
<P>

<i><b>Submitted by Ron Workman 1/13/97</b></i><br>
No ebonics should not be recognized as a seperate language.  It is slang and
not that far removed from regular english.  Our education dollars could and
should be better spent elsewhere, and certainly no new taxes or bonds for
classes taught in ebonics.  Classroom size and more computers in classrooms
are much more compelling issues.  I think no matter what language or slang
students are using, it is thier responsibility to learn english and the
school's responsibility to teach it.  Are we going to start teaching in New
Yorkese, southern, arabic and countless other regional and ethnic dialects
that proliferate our country?<P>

<i><b>Submitted by Matt Lane 1/13/97</b></i><br>
Ebonics is not a language.  It is slang.  If we adopt the practice of teaching 
slang, where will it go?  As a teacher, I find it hard to accept ebonics as 
nothing more than just poor grammar.
<P>

<b><i>Submitted by John & Pat Omara 1/14/97</i></b><br>
No.  At this time I feel it should be considered a dialect.  I applaud any
school system so dedicated to teaching that they are open to try new
measures to reach their students so that they might learn more
successfully.  However, they are all living in the United States and the
main focus needs to be on communicating clearly in ONE language .
<P>
My forefathers came from Germany & Italy and took responsibility for their
own success by learning the language of their new country .  They did not
shift the responsibility to someonelse.  As an example,  they did not ask
that the voting ballots be printed in their language.  I think we have
catered to the black community enough.  How long can they keep on blaming
before they relies they have to take responsibility for themselves?  
<P>
The Asian community hasn't asked for all these special considerations. 
What could be more difficult than their language change?  They are
excelling!  Have teachers had to teach in Chinese to get these people to
learn?  No.  They have overcome the challenge of their language barrier by
taking responsibility for their own success.  
<P>
As children we formed our own language that was secret so that our parents
couldn't understand us.  It was a way of separation.  Learning a language
is inclusion.  Refusing to learn a language is a way of separating.  Why do
we continue to encourage the Black community to separate themselves after
all our efforts to break down the walls of segregation? 
<P>

<b><i>Submitted by Lauren Seals 1/14/97</i></b><br>
Ebonics should NOT be considered or taught as a legitimate language.  </font><P>


<b><i>Submitted by Judy Freeman 1/14/97</i></b><br>
Bad grammar will always be bad grammar.  Street English, AKA ebonics, is
a perfect example of this problem.  Street English is something I became
aware of only a few years ago.  In my youth I can't recall anyone
saying, "We be way good."  Just how long has this type of speech been in
use?  As far back as slave days as claimed by the Oakland school board
since they claim it is a direct descendent of African language?  Which
language, since countless numbers of languages and dialects were and
still are spoken in Africa?  The only hope anyone has to get ahead is to
speak, read and write English correctly.  Today's Union/Tribune cited
some dismal statistics regarding African/American students.  Perhaps
being required to use correct English will help these students to
improve those statistics.<P>

<i><b>Submitted by Lisa LaRosa 1/14/97</b></i><br>
I believe that Ebonics is going to promote more intollerable ignorance
in a society that is allready being overcome with ignorance.  In the
future the tables will turn with Ebonics and it will become another
reason not to improve oneself. Why not teach a language that people do
not allready know?
<P>

<i><b>Submitted by Edward Stetser 1/14/97</b></i><br>
Why not ????? Lets teach every one that uses poor grammar a new
slang--language Ebonics.  ( Pray tell what is the base of Ebonics ????---
Does it take its root from Eboney magazine ?   If so why not Coloredonics or
Poorwhiteonics ) ?<P>


<b><i>Submitted by Deric Prescott 1/14/97</i></b><br>
Like nearly all of the other respondants, I too agree that Ebonics
should not be recognized as a legitimate language.  To my knowledge, not
even the Oakland School Board was considering this.  They simply wanted
to be able to instruct those who only know this language as to how it
can be "translated" into proper English.  Nightline had a wonderful
discussion on this topic that I share with anyone who asks me about this
topic.  Mr. Koppel's guests explained how the best way to teach people
something is to immerse an individual into that language.  Whether this
is "slang" as some people call it or "black english" as others refer to
it, people are judged by how they communicate.  Mr. Jesse Jackson told
the story of how, upon becoming free, one of the first things Frederick
Douglas learned was how to read, write, and speak proper English (along
with 4 other languages)!  
<P>
What our students need today is not teachers talking down to them. 
Rather, as teachers have for hundreds of years, students must be
challenged.
<P>
It is a mistake to legitimize Ebonics.  While the Oakland School Board
is trying to "good," the erroneous instruction and teaching of Ebonics
cannot be legitimized simply through good intentions.
<P>

<b><i>Submitted by David Lowe 1/14/97</i></b><br>
   Ebonics is a language pattern based on slang. It is definitely not a 
legitimate language and to adopt this as a language is an insult to 
African-American students who are eloquent speakers and writers. African 
immigrants I have dealt with do not show any of this particular language 
pattern which gives me concern that the Oakland School District should 
consider adopting this as being "genetic."<P>
        As a teacher, I become increasingly troubled at mandates which clearly show 
more "dumbing down" in the curriculum. I hope San Diego City Schools is wise 
not to adopt Ebonics. I applaud President Clinton not to allocate funds for 
this foolishness.<P>


<i><b>Submitted by Lazarus Habit 1/15/97</b></i><br>
 Let's really examine this issue (sic) The idea behind "Ebonics" is that
it is a mixture of American (English) and African dialects. Being based on
American terminology and African sentence structure. Makes sense so far.
The only real problem I see here is one of, just how many people fluent in
"Ebonics" speak ANY form of an African dialect? At all? A good friend of
mine is an English teacher at Morse High School, and when asked this same
question, she replied less than 1% of her students speak any African
language at all.  Yet they all seem to have mastered "Ebonics." So, that
concept to the wind.<P>
The second argument is that "Ebonics" is more natural to African Americans.
Due to something or other in their genetic makeup, no doubt. Which makes
Africans a very unique group indeed, as no other race or creed of people
are born with any natural inclinations of communication. Language is a
learned art, and nothing more. Other than being born mentally handicapped,
their is no reason why any one person can not learn any one tongue. Or
several.<P>
The third point, and the last I will mention, though certainly not the last
that could be addressed... If "Ebonics" were in fact a real and different
language, we would assume there would be little, if any, cross-overs
between English and it. This is not the case. Where as someone speaking
"Ebonics" were to say, "He be at the store" I would have no problem what so
ever in understanding him. I might, however, not wish to hear what he is
saying, but I would surely understand it. And were I to say, "I'm sorry,
but I don't think you're right for this job." He would just as readily
understand me. 
<P>   
"Ebonics" is nothing more than a ploy. One more attempt to justify and
sanctify the "Black Experience." (Which is silly as hell, as there are many
whites and Hispanics that speak this way. But they aren't speaking
"Ebonics," I guess. They are just uneducated.) Its a attempt to make poor
education excusable. And poor personal development an asset, rather than a
deplorable fault. It will serve no one well, and damage many. By making
this an official language, we are just allowing people to claim they are
not speaking bad English, but good "Ebonics" and allow them to pass their
flaws off as nothing that requires repair.
<P>
   At some point, people are going to have to take personal responsibility
to for their own short comings. If, however, we do insist in teaching in
"Ebonics" and rectifying it as a language, may I suggest two good classes
to be the first so taught? "Applying For Welfare 101," and "The Finer
Points Of The Big Mac." As this is all that those who master "Ebonics" will
be suited to do. (You all may Ohhh and Ahhh, that I would say something so
un-P.C. but you know it is correct. Niether you nor I, nor anyone else in
the situation would hire some one who spoke in slang. Regardless of race or
creed.)<P>

No, slang should not be taught in any form, nor should it be given a
name intended to legitimize it's existence. Our country is falling
behind in terms of education due to the constant "leveling of the
playing field". Time after time we make concessions and allowances for
the failure of people to become a part of society, and rather than focus
on educating people, we make the deficiencies acceptable, and in this
case, proper.
<P>
Every person in this country has a responsibity to learn our culture,
our language, and our laws in order to become a useful part of society.
To constantly excuse the failure to do so, only weakens our nation, and
forever condemns the individual in question to mediocrity.

I feel that making Ebonics an official language and part of the school 
ciriculum is a thinly veiled attempt at segregating the black community 
from other Americans.  An individual of any race with poor English 
skills will have one more hurdle added to their personal race to 
success. <P>

<STRONG><EM>Submitted by G. Garbacz  1/16/97</EM></STRONG><br>
No one wants ebonics to be recognized. Not me, not the Oakland School Board,
not you.  Do not oversimplify the issue KGTV.  Educate your viewers.  The
board decision was about teaching teachers street talk so they could
communicate with their students and teach them STANDARD ENGLISH.  
<P>

<EM><STRONG>Submitted by Mr. & Mrs. Malcolm G. Brown 1/17/97</STRONG></EM><br>
The fact anyone seriously entertains the acceptance of 'Ebonics' as a
language is appalling! 'East-coasters' would never have this discussion
openly.  This is not an idea welcomed by the African-American community
in my area.  I've yet to meet a Caucasion capable of surpassing my
mastery of the national tongue.  I am particularly amused by the number
of respondents using this as an opportunity to insult all members of my
race.  John and Pat Omara should be competent spellers and know that
realize is not 'relies', this mistake was especially noticeable due to
the arrogant tone of their comment.  I originate from the South and your
counterparts here can likewise demonstrate a lack of fluency.  We should
all recognize communication is a skill or art form that varies per
individual and reflects localized expressions.  This is simply not a
matter of superior or inferior genetics but affective curriculum!<P>

<STRONG><EM>Submitted by David Curtis 1/17/97</EM></STRONG><br>
Why?  I can't wait till the year 2050 when
some people project the United States will
have no majority race.  I feel if there was no
majority race, we would not have all these
different minority races' bickering about 
something.<P>

<STRONG><EM>Submitted by Jenny Waters 1/17/97</EM></STRONG><br>
I do not think that Ebonics should be thought in schools as a 
language.  In my opinion, I thinks it's a bad idea because it's 
unproper speech.  If people want to be somebody and go somewhere, I 
don't think anybody will want them if they do not know how to speak 
properly.  Brining Ebonics in the schools will only make things eaiser 
for those who are lazy and those that have made it up the ladder will 
only go down.  I think it's time that we start training people the 
right way instead of feeding them leftovers.<P>

<STRONG><EM>Submitted by Nadine Scott 1/18/97</EM></STRONG><br>
Ebonics absolutely SHOULD NOT BE RECOGNIZED AS A LEGITIMATE LANGUAGE.  I
respect the fact that it can be considered a dialect, slang, and/or
vernacular usuage of the legitimate language of United States English.
However, to recognize it as an official language will give license to more
butchery of a beautifully complex and quite adequate and expressive
language.  Ebonics needs to be used as an example of improper usage of
English; double negatives and dropped syllables indicate a lack of education
to me and probably to everyone else who is a business person or
entrepreneur. It just don't matter to me none to hire nobody who can't speak
no proper English! <P>

<STRONG><EM>Submitted by Bob Hill 1/18/97</EM></STRONG><br>
I would love to have a ten second discussion with the person who actually
conceived of the name "Ebonics," because that is about all the time an
intelligent person would need to tell that person what an idiot he or she is
without having to suffer a full blown discussion about the subject. <P>

<STRONG><EM>Submitted by Mark Christensen 1/18/97</EM></STRONG><br>
Absolutley NOT. But thanks to our  over baring media in this country
and a society where no one wants to offend anyone...we have silly
situations like this come about. Why is it that everyone here that has
responded feels this way yet its still an issue? Why do the voters
majority want ot legalize Marijuana yet OUR(???) government still says
the laws will be enforced? Why do so many people agree that prisoners
rights have gone way over the top of rediculasness yet it continues on?
 This ebonics thing is just another example of how divided we really are
in this country...what a team. Go USA....

I think it would be a great I dea if the expansion would go through. It
could increase chances of more Super Bowl games and concerts. It would
increase seating for a lot of activities.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="#top"><IMG BORDER=0 WIDTH="12" HEIGHT="6" SRC="uparrow.gif"></A><P>

I agree with the idea of expanding Jack Murphy Stadium, however, it
should be done with voter approval. After all, we are the ones who have
to support the expansion with our tax dollars. Anyone who says we want
have to put out some big bucks must be very naive.

I certainly DON'T want to pay for it. If they can use private funding,
then by all means go ahead. But if they are going to use MY money to do
it, then I say: put it where it counts, such as helping the homeless and
poor! See what a multimillion dollar package will do for that!<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="#top"><IMG BORDER=0 WIDTH="12" HEIGHT="6" SRC="uparrow.gif"></A><P>        

<STRONG><EM>Submitted by Enrique O. Fernandez 1/22/97</EM></STRONG><br>
I don't support it simply because it is only for the benefit of the
        construction company and the stadium  management.  I don't agree with
something that it is going to raise the price of the tickets.
I don't think we have many full time fans in San Diego, not to many of us are
native San Diegans. If this is only to make a quick cash
On our next Super Bowl game in San Diego, I think it is better to show off
with a clean city, housing for homeless, and jobs for 
the homeless instead of showing with what we dont have.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="#top"><IMG BORDER=0 WIDTH="12" HEIGHT="6" SRC="uparrow.gif"></A>

<STRONG><EM>Submitted by Jason A. Maxwell 1/22/97</EM></STRONG><br>
I fully support the expansion of Jack Murphy stadium for two reasons.   
<P>
The first is that it will increase the revenues at football games, which
will in turn, increase the revenues generated in the city. 
<P>
Second, I am affiliated with the San Diego State University Marching
Aztecs, and I personally think that the expansion will lead to a greater
awareness of San Diego sporting events, particularly its football games. 
<P>
Thank you, and Go Chargers and Aztecs!

<STRONG><EM>Submitted by Claude Sweet 1/22/97</EM></STRONG><br>
I personally will not vote to approve a bond issue to expand the stadium as
long as it lines the pockets of the Charger owners. 
<P>
What is to stop the owners from increasing ticket prices to such a level
that selling 60,000 ticket per game is not a realistic possibility.  If the
stadium is not sold out, will this result in a television blackout of home
games?
<P>
Why are the supporters of the bond issue unwilling to put their check books
at risk to assume the risk in case the football team departs for another
city or doesn't field a team whose on field performance results in 60,000
fans filling the stadium for each preseason and regular season home game?
<P>
I understand that the "improvements" will result in the stadium not being
configured for baseball as previously was the case. This insures that the
Padre owners will want a baseball only stadium when their contract comes up
for renewal in 3 years. The city council will again attempt to force a new
stadium downtown where it will cause great traffic congestion with the
airport and commuters who work in the downtown area.
<P>
I would rather see the land where the stadium is located deeded to the
Padre and Charger owners provided they financed the construction of the new
baseball stadium and the modifications to the existing facility so it would
be a football only stadium. A deed restriction would prevent the facilities
from ever being used for any activities except football and baseball. The
land and the facilities would become taxable and create a revenue stream
without any risk of the teams ever leaving town since the owners would
still be liable for property taxes. An entertainment sporting event tax
could be added to every ticket sold, thus providing additional revenues. I
would recommend the retention of the parking land as city property so all
the revenue charged for parking would be income for the city. Swap meets
and other activities could be held on the parking lots , just as they
presently are. 
<P>
The construction of the baseball stadium on land next to the present
stadium would reduce the need to acquire land for parking and would
continue to take advantage of the rail transit presently under construction
to serve the existing stadium.

I totally agree with the expansion.  The Charger's, although they did
not make the playoffs this year, are becoming a formidable team to
reckon with.  I think with the proper leadership of our new coach, they
are going to be a major adversary in the NFL, and will fill the seats at
the Murph to capacity in the ensuing years by winning lots of games,
making the playoffs, and eventually going to the Super Bowl.  There is
still a fever in this city about the "Bolts."  Go for the expansion! 
Also, San Diego deserves to have a state of the art stadium to
accommodate all types of sporting events.

<EM><STRONG>Submitted by  Mrs. Brandilynn Stone 1/23/97</STRONG></EM><br>
I have been a San Diego native for 23 years, since birth. I remember my
parents taking me to Padre and Charger games. I can't wait until the day
I can make those same memories with children of my own. Yet if the
expansion of Jack Murphy doesn't take place, those memories may never be
made. If we don't expand, our teams are going to feel unsupported and go
find another home. What good is a great city like San Diego, and a
stadium at all, when there's no teams to represent them?
Expansion will bring money to our city, especially if we could receive
the pleasure of hosting a Super Bowl or World Series.

 Being a Sports fan, I support the expansion of Jack Murphy Stadium.  However,
I do believe the City Council should have put the issue before the voters,
that the council made a gross error in judgement.  This situation causes a big
embarrassment not only to San Diego's City Council, but to us as a city as well;
especially if the stadium isn't ready for next year's Super Bowl or if the NFL decides to
move the game to another location due to the city's blunder.

No! I don't support it. This situation has been seething for a while now
and its finally coming to a head. Why would the "City" agree to a 
$60,000,000.00 contract without putting it on the ballot for a vote!!??
That's an awful lot of money (my tax dollars & YOURS!) And what about 
this other $18,000,00.00? What happen to the Chargers' "Bean Counters"in 
the original proposal???? Did they forget to add it in??? Place the 
whole $78,000,000.00 up for vote.

No I do not the tax payer should have to pay for the expansion of Jack
Murphy Stadium. Let the football player help pay for it with all the
million they are making and the Charger owner should pay for it. If this
go to a vote and it is voted down. Then the people that give the OK to
start the work should be the one that had to pay for the work that is
all ready started. Why doesn't the city stop the work until this thing is
settled.

<STRONG><EM>Submitted by Michele Delehanty 1/23/97</EM></STRONG><br>
No. I think they should not go through with the addition.  It will commit the
City and the public to giving more support to the stadium over a long period
of time.  The level of support for both Baseball and Football has varied over
the years.  Recent support for the Chargers (following the winning season of
95-96) is not a sure thing for the future.  Fans do not fill the stands as it
is.  Enlarging it will only make it more difficult to have televised games
which stimulate overall support for the team.  Traffic is already a problem
around the stadium and additional seats will only increase traffic problems.

<STRONG><EM>Submitted by Cory Anser 1/23/97</EM></STRONG><br>
I disagree with Enrique's idea that the stadium expansion solely 
benefits the construction company and stadium management. Last time I 
visited San Diego (I am currently a college student in Vermont), I 
heard a news story somewhere that mentioned that some members of 
S.D's physically disabled populous were unhappy with the level of 
wheelchair access available to them. Such exclusion benefits no one. 
I have yet to go to the Murph in a wheelchair, so I don't know if I'd 
necessarily be as irritated by this. It is, however, proof that the 
aristocrats that Enrique mentioned in his comment are NOT the only 
ones that can benefit. We all can benefit from a little more room, 
disabled or not.

Stop the stadium deal. Loge seats will cost in excess of $100 each! Look
at the teardown of the stadium now underway. The loge seats are gone
already. Recall the council, Mayor Golding and let's fire Jack McGrory.
This is illegal!

I don't support the stadium expansion as it is proceeding now.  
Once again people who do not benefit from something are going to 
bear the risk.  It is time the city stop playing games with money 
that does not belong to them.  It is not right that the citizens 
were ignored to start with and I predict the city is going to 
have a major problem when we vote no on the 18 million dollar 
package which will inhibit the other 60 million dollar portion.  
I certainly am not going to forget this fiasco on the next 
election.  I faced a similar but smaller problem when I served as 
treasurer for the Miramar College Student Council where students 
voices were ignored and the President of the school wanted a 
building to advance his career which would have resulted in an 
increase of fees to students, well when the referendum came 
around we slaughtered the idea by two to one.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="#top"><IMG BORDER=0 WIDTH="12" HEIGHT="6" SRC="uparrow.gif"></A><P>

I believe that if the expansion does not go through, we will
chance losing the Chargers to another city.  It is extremely
unfortunate that city's and taxpayers have to go to such
great lengths to keep thier respective teams, but that is 
the state of professional sports these days (thank you Al
Davis). <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="#top"><IMG BORDER=0 WIDTH="12" HEIGHT="6" SRC="uparrow.gif"></A> <P>

From the time Baron Hilton brought the Chargers to San Diego, the local fans 
have consistently displayed their "fair weather" attitude.  Whether it's the 
Chargers or the Padres, the majority of the fans only support winners.  When 
them local teams are losing, the "fair weather" fans find other activities to 
support in our fine city.
<P>
We elected Ms. Golding et. Al. To represent us.  In that capacity, through 
exhaustive negotiations they entered into an agreement .  Now without the 
benefit of a complete understanding, we are being led to believe that the 
agreement is not in our best interest and therefore we should take back the 
authority we conveyed to our representatives and try to become a voice at a 
vacant negotiating table.  Does the phrase, "If I had walked in their shoes, I 
might have acted even more unwisely than I've judged them to have acted," mean 
anything to any of us?
<P>
Let our elected representative do their job.  If they're inadequate, we'll 
replace them at the next election.  To meddle now is most certainly going to 
be costly.  Both monetarily and possibly the loss of two sport's teams.  The 
Charger's made an agreement and should not be expected to renegotiate.
<P>
If the expansion goes through and the Chargers win games,  all will be fine 
for all.  However, if Bobby Bethard's actions do not produce a winner, the 
majority of already disgruntled Charger fan's will go surfing and the people 
of San Diego will not only pick up the tab, the elect new representative.  
Some gamble, eh Ms. Susan?

I support the stadium expansion because it will be good for San Diego. I
think San Diegans would be VERY unhappy if they lost the Chargers because of
a lack of better facilities. In addition, don't we elect our representatives
expecting them to make these kinds of decisions. After all, we don't insist
on a vote when our representatives in Washington make decisions to spend
taxpayers' money on expensive projects. If we don't like their decisions, we
vote them out of office in the next election.

I am opposed of the project.  Our city council thinks that this will be a 
big money maker. I tend to disagree.  The Superbowl would be held here 
maybe once every 4 years. So we don't tend to profit to much from that. 
If anything the city will lose money.  Proven records show that San 
Diegans will not pay high prices to see a game. There is plenty of other 
entertainment available for next to nothing. As for Charger/Padre games. 
It was hard enough to sell out the games so they could be televised. Now 
we can be assured we will not see Charger home games because they will be 
blacked out.  Whether we are opposed, or for it, is to late. The process 
has started and either way, we are losing in the long run.

I go along with the expansion of the stadium. If I'm correct, the 
intiial deal was done through the sale of private bonds(?). If that's 
correct, then what right did Henderson and his bunch have to throw a 
monkey wrench into this whole affair. Nothing but another black mark 
on the San Diego community in its ability to draw and keep good 
quality major league sports. If the city and courts really screw it 
up, then I don't blame the NFL, nor Mr. Spanos and the Chargers for 
pulling out. Since everyone is lawsuit happy around this town, if the 
Super Bowl doesn't come to San Diego, and/or the Chargers and/or 
Padres pull out of town; maybe the merchants and chamber of commerce 
should consider filing a counter suit against Henferson and his gang 
for ruining the local sports economy.

Yes indeed.  I totally support the expansion of the Murph.  I have been flying down to San Diego from up here in San Jose for the past  four years, especially for all Chargers games.  In fact, I am a season ticket holder.  Why do I fly down for every game...the beaches, the city, 10News, Charger girls and the Chargers.  I am counting on attending the Murph for Super Bowl 32.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="#top"><IMG BORDER=0 WIDTH="12" HEIGHT="6" SRC="uparrow.gif"></A><P>

We must look towards the future.  If the Chargers and the Padres leave then 
many, many people will loose their jobs.  Then there will be more people 
unemployed.  Plus it is a great tradition for San Diego to have these two 
teams winners or loosers.  I would be very sad to see them go.  I think there 
is many True Blue San Diegans that would feel the same way.  So I say go for 
it and fix the stadium and build the Padres their own ball park.  I just hope 
that the Chargers and the Padres feel the same way about San Diego.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="#top"><IMG BORDER=0 WIDTH="12" HEIGHT="6" SRC="uparrow.gif"></A>

I fully support the expansion of Jack Murphy Stadium.  I feel the opposition
has made their point and I doubt that future initiatives would be undertaken
without a vote.  However, this is underway and should be enabled to come to
fruition.  I feel many people are being short-sighted with regard to the
monetary issue.  Events such as the Superbowl bring untold income to our city
and tax dollars along with it.  Events, other than football, will have
increased capacity as well -- which will also lead to more money for all of
us.  I personally do NOT want to lose the Chargers... they are an important
part of our culture and would be a tremendous loss.

As a tax payer for many years in San Diego, I would expect to at

council had plenty of time to inform the public of its intension. I 
resent the way this has been handled thus far!!! 
I don't use the stadium, but if the city uses monies to pay the Chargers 
because of short attendance, and this money comes from other needed 
areas, I would vote NO! So we lose the Super bowl in 98  so what!!!

Absolutely!  The Chargers, as well as the Padres, are a huge asset to
the way of life in San Diego.  Possessing the capability and resources
to host next years, as well as future Super Bowls, is very important to
many facets of the San Diego community.

Where were all these "anti-expansion" people when the negotiations were
taking place?  I remember the tone of the City being very positive when
the contracts were completed and announced.  Now, through the efforts of
a few, the expansion issue has reached a critical point.  A shameful job
of reporting both sides of the issue combined with a serious lack of
information given to the public, has put our politicians and the future
of professional sports in San Diego on the hot seat. 
<P>
San Diego's reputation has been nationally tarnished. I agree with the
gentleman who cited the responsibilities of our elected officials.  I am
apalled at their actions since this anti-expansion movement began.  They
should be standing whole heartedly behind the agreement or they should
have never given their approval for it in the first place.  
<P>
San Diego owes alot to the Spanos family and the Charger organization. 
There are too many positives to list here that the owners, players, and
all those involved with the Chargers have brought to San Diego and it's
residents. How great was it to be a San Diegan when the Chargers beat
the Steelers in the AFC Championship game.  There were bolts everywhere.
Have we forgotten the way people rallied together at the Stadium and
lined the streets of San Diego in support?  If Mr. Spanos says the
Chargers are going to stay in San Diego we should have faith in him and
his word. Which is more than I can say for the City officials who are
now waffling.  The Spanos' have diligently worked towards building and
delivering to this city what it wants.......a winner!
<P>
There has never been a reason, that I know of, for the owners to want to
move the Chargers out of San Diego. Until now, that is.  San Diego needs
to take a good look at other cities like Cleveland, St. Louis, L.A.,
Baltimore, etc.  They better realize what we have here in the Chargers
and Jack Murphy Stadium, and what the alternatives would be.

If Mr. Spanos wants the taxpayers to foot the bill on the stadium
expansion, then he should be talking about including the taxpayers as
partners in the franchise to the tune of 20% or more.  If he's not
willing to talk of a partnership that is beneficial to the taxpayers,
then he should carry out his threat of moving the Chargers to another
city.
<P>
Also, he should be ashamed to have made such a threat regarding the
peoples right to vote on this or any other issue that may affect the
Chargers.  He should try to be as good a citizen as the thousands of San
Diegans who have supported the Chargers over the (loosing) years.
<P>
Most important of all is the fact that City Council would shove such a
thing down the voters throats.  With the exception of some, they should
all be re-called. The kind of money that is going into the hands of a
few contractors (who may or may not have cozy relationships with some
members of the City Council and other city officials, all of whom are
EMPLOYEES OF THE TAXPAYERS) could be better spent if it were made
available to entrepreneurs in areas of the city that need economic
uplifting.  The City Conuncil still doesn't get it, "It's the economy
Stupid."

<STRONG> Question for the Week of 1/27/97:</STRONG><P>
<font color="#000080"><STRONG>Are you in favor of San Diego building a stadium for the Padres?</STRONG></font>
<P>


<STRONG>What  You Said:</STRONG><P>

<STRONG><EM>Submitted by Corey Anser 1/27/97</EM></STRONG><br>
  No! San Diego does not need a brand-spanking-new stadium just to 
host one measley sports team!!! Neither the indoor (Sports Arena) nor 
the outdoor (Jack Murphy Stadium) facilities at the town's sports 
teams' disposal right now are not so inadequate that they should be 
replaced, or even just shunned by ONE team in favor of a newer 
facility. I sure haven't heard of the Gulls or the Sockers 
complaining about their joint right to the Sports Arena. That 
facility seems quite adequate to host both 
teams, though evidence of the other isn't totally hidden during 
either Sockers or Gulls games (I think I recall seing retired Sockers 
jerseys hanging during Gulls games). So I believe the same holds true 
for Jack Murphy Stadium and its tenants: the Chargers and the 
Padres. It is plenty roomy, and easily convertible from 
football to baseball format (or even soccer, should the town ever get 
an MLS team), even if a few remnants of the other sports team(s) that 
play there must stay up. If enough local citizens agree that the 
Murph (or for that matter, the Sports Arena) has unignorable 
problems, then the next step would be to (oh no, he's going to use 
the E word!!!) EXPAND the facility in order to suit those who use it.  
<P>

<STRONG><EM>Submitted by Tony Ferrell 1/27/97</EM></STRONG><br>
Yes, Yes, Yes....How about the old General Dynamics site...
<P>


<STRONG><EM>Submitted by Stan De Long 1/28/97</EM></STRONG><br>
I do not feel that a new stadium is warranted.  I have attended many
games at Jack Murphy and feel the stadium truly meets the needs.  It has
not reached capacity crowdlevels.
<P>

<STRONG><EM>Submitted by Ron Lee 1/28/97</EM></STRONG><br>
Absolutely not. It is not the duty of cities or municipalities to build
new stadiums for sports teams. I have nothing against the Padres
building their own stadium, but it is not up to the City, therefore the
citizens of San Diego, to build it, and of course, pay for it. 
<P>
Contrary to what even our own city council is saying, cities are not at
the mercy of sports franchises. If a team cannot make it in this market,
then it does not belong here. If sports teams want to move, let them,
but do not attempt to scare taxpayers into paying for new stadiums.
<P>

<STRONG><EM>Submitted by Frank Florio 1/28/97</EM></STRONG><br>
No!  Other projects need the money more.<P>

<STRONG><EM>Submitted by Lynn Thorton 1/29/97</EM></STRONG><br>
Yes, but it should be a joint venture between the City, County and the Padres. 
 It should also be built it mid county, so North and East County fans have 
closer access.  Are the Padres and the City of San Diego aware of the interest 
in the Padres outside of San Diego county?  Temecula, Riverside, and south 
Orange County are fans too.  The Dodgers are too far away and, well, they just 
aren't as good a team....!
<P>
We don't believe that the Padres, or their fans should be victimized by the 
Jack Murphy stadium expansion fiasco, which will probably be the case this 
year.  It seems as if the Chargers are calling all the shots and those voters 
outside of the City of San Diego won't get to vote, yet what happens affects 
us all.<P>

<STRONG><EM>Submitted by Tom Kersten 1/30/97</EM></STRONG><br>
YES!! Under the leadership of John Moores the Padres have proven that
they are a top flight baseball organization with a tremendous future -
winning the West in a short time was a great accomplishment and they
deserve their own park.  This will insure that they stay in San Diego
for years to come which will benefit the city economically - just
imagine what a World Series would bring to the city!  Secondly, the
current stadium is too large with too many remote seats for the average
fan to enjoy the games -- the stadium expansion designed for football
will make it even worse.  It would also preclude the kind of scheduling
conflicts experienced last year with the Aztec football team in the
fall.  The financing should be a joint effort between all parties which
will benefit the most - the Padres, Major League Baseball, local
business, and the city.  It should not be primarily financed through
city general funds since not all citizens will benefit equally. We have
a well established franchise under outstanding ownership with great
upside potential - ideal conditions for promoting a baseball only
stadium!
<P>

<STRONG><EM>Submitted by Linda Gonzales 1/30/97</EM></STRONG><br>
No!! I feel at home at the Murph! I love the Murph! I would definitely
feel out of place anywhere else other than the Murph.
I don't feel that the Padres need their own stadium. I feel that
the present situation is just fine, so I say a definite no! 
<P>

<STRONG><EM>Submitted by Michael McNally 1/30/97</EM></STRONG><br>
The way I understand it all teams in the NFL SHARE ticket revenue. So if
we but tickets for the Chargers we are actually giving money to all of
the other teams. I say play good and individuals will buy tickets for
the home team.

<STRONG> Question for the Week of 2/3/97:</STRONG><P>
<font color="#000080"><STRONG>Are city officials looking out for the best interest of all San Diegans or just sports fans?</STRONG></font>
<P>


<STRONG>What  You Said:</STRONG><P>


<STRONG><EM>Submitted by  Travis J. Maricich 2/4/97</EM></STRONG><br>
My opinion of the stadium expansion is that we should let the constuction
crew finish their job.  I personally would hate to loose the Chargers.  I
think that a pro football team brings in alot of money and alot of people.  I
would also hate to loose the Padres.  We San Diegans need a team to root for,
whether it ithe Padres or the Chargers we need these teams to stay here.  And
for the superbowl next year would be great to have in San Diego.  It would
bring in people which brings revenue for the city.  These people are going to
have to have a place to stay and a car to drive places and these people are
willing to spend that money.  I think having the superbowl here would pay off
the money it would cost to finish expanding the stadium.  The stadium is
already in ruins so I say finish it.
<P>
<STRONG><EM>Submitted by  John C. Sartor, Sr. 2/4/97</EM></STRONG><br>
I believe that the City Officials are looking out for the best of the
City.  San Diego needs tourist to make it.  The renovation of Jack Murphy
Stadium will bring the 1998 Super Bowl here and that means tourist and
$$$$$$$.  The City will be seen on national tv.....
     Yes, the fans will profit from the Stadium expansion.  It will make more
seating for more fans...  I see a plus for the Padres !  As a Bobby Ross fan,
I don't think anything will help the Chargers now.
<P>
<STRONG><EM>Submitted by Marilyn Myers Lieber 2/7/97</EM></STRONG><br>
I don't think that San Diego's success and reputation as a city are
dependent upon whether we have the next Super Bowl here or manage to
keep the Chargers' management happy.  There is a lot more to what we are
and what we have to offer than that.  I think that the mayor and city
council have lost their perspective judging from their public comments
on this issue.  They are the elected representatives of _all_ the people
in San Diego, not just the sports fans, and they should be listening to
all sides of this issue and giving everyone a fair hearing.  The way
they have been operating lately smacks of trying to railroad a decision
through, whether that was their intent or not.  Maybe the stadium
expansion is a good idea, but if it just appears as a fait accompli
without the proper discussion, then we will never know.<P>

<STRONG><EM>Submitted by Eric Lallana 2/8/97</EM></STRONG><br>
I fully believe that City Officials are looking out for the best
interests for the people of San Diego. I fully back the deal made for
the Stadium expansion. What upsets me so much is how former city
officials have the audacity to criticize current city officials over the
process on approval of Stadium expansion. Bruce Henderson, Maureen
O'Connor, and Roger Hedgecock have the gall to question whether such
deals concerning the city should be put up to a vote. I don't remember
voting on any referendum while Bruce, Maureen and Roger were in on the
City Council Board. Does Maureen have a short memory concerning her push
for the city to pay all expenses on the Russian Arts Festival? How about
the pension Bruce receives for serving on the council? And we all know
about Roger's scandal, how much city money went into Roger's defense
over his dealings with David Dominelli? Let's just call it a case of the
who's calling the tea kettle black.
<P>
<STRONG><EM>Submitted by  Eric Templin 2/9/97</EM></STRONG><br>
I suggest that idiots like Bruce Henderson get a life! It is obvious that he
is just interested in revenge against city officials....since he is not one
any longer. The city council is elected to take care of us...and they have
approved this expansion. Do I like the contract with the Chargers?? No. Do I
think it is necessary to keep them here? Yes. Therefore I am willing to go
along with it. Any less and the Chargers could leave. The expansion will cost
this city 75 million dollars....the Super Bowl will bring over 300 million to
this community. Easy math. San Diego had better take a good look. If the
Chargers play one game elsewhere this year, their contract with the city is
void. Mr.Spanos says he wouldn't move the team, but he hasn't had millions of
dollars stuck in his face.....(See Cleveland). This scenerio is highly
possible San Diego. If the construction stops, the Super Bowl is
gone...bottom line. Also..the Chargers are threatened...and maybe even our
Padres. All of this because people like Bruce Henderson are questioning our
city officials....people WE voted in. If Bruce had such a problem with this
over the last couple years, where was it on our ballot last November?
Really....if the construction goes on after we have a vote, Bruce Henderson
could cost the city an extra million dollars...the cost of the election. I
sure hope you're ready to have that taken our of your pocket Mr.Henderson.
Cause I hope the city comes for it. Bruce Henderson is a joke....he is an
ex-city councilman who is after revenge.....let's not let him get it San
Diego...and let's keep our teams where the belong....in the Murph not in the
courts.
<P>
<STRONG><EM>Submitted by Allen J. Boaz</EM></STRONG><br>
Just do it!!! Expand the stadium!!! Censure Bruce Henderson!!!!!!!!

<STRONG> Question for the Week of 2/10/97:</STRONG><P>

<STRONG>What You Said:</STRONG><P>
<STRONG><EM>Submitted by Judy Freeman 2/10/97</EM></STRONG><br>

Unfortunately, I do not believe that the end of the civil trial will
bring an end to the OJ saga.  Few things in recent memory have
illuminated the racial divisions in this country more clearly than the
reaction to both the criminal and civil jury verdicts regarding OJ
Simpson.  As long as there are people with strong opinions and feelings
on either side of the guilt/innocence issue, we will keep rehashing the
entire matter.  What a waste!  Time would be much better spent looking
for ways to heal the racial rift and learning to respect each other.                            
<P>
<STRONG><EM>Submitted by Art Salcido 2/13/97</EM></STRONG><br> 
I would like to think that we could go on with our lives and the only 
time that you would hear the initials O.J.is when you are sitting at 
Dennys Resturant and the waitress asked you if you wanted some orange 
juice.
<P>
I don't think the public is going to let this one die. He is going to 
face ridicule and harassment wherever he travels. I really think he 
should consider leaving the country. At least get out of the Los Angeles 
area. The Los Angeles police will always be looking over his shoulder. 
Child Protection Services will be on his front doorstep waiting for him 
to slip-up.
<P>
He will never be able to merge into normal life as we know it.
<P>
<STRONG><EM>Submitted by Dave Johnson 2/16/97</EM></STRONG><br>
This trial was one of the best things that could have been viewed
nationally on T.V. in my lifetime. Finally, the voters out there were
subjected to the realities of the atrocities that occur in the courts
every day. 
<P>
Plus, viewers out there were also exposed to the reality that a great
majority of citizens in the US base their decisions solely on race and
not evidence. Since O.J. happens to be black, a huge population within
the black community assumed the issue was racial rather than looking at
clear evidence. Sadly, if OJ was white and the victim happened to be
black, the opinions would have been reversed. This is a sad reality of
our jury system which shows that other options need to be presented.
<P>
Also, despite immense differences between civil and criminal trials
(which was clearly explained to whoever was interested in listening),
many people believed the criteria for conviction was the same - a
complete inaccuracy. If Americans cannot even understand obvious
distictions between civil and criminal court, how can we expect any jury
decisions to be fair and carefully thought through?
<P>
Perhaps now after seeing these harsh realities, some changes can be
made. 
<P>
Because, what we vote for is what we get.

10. To run to the nearest public place neighbor, or safe house if they feel they are being followed.<BR>

13. Never to tell anyone on the phone that a parent is not home.  Say, "My Mom can't come to the phone right now.  Can she call you back?"<BR>

<STRONG><FONT size=+1 color="#000080">"CAPTAIN" MIKE AMBROSE</FONT></STRONG>

<P>



     Over the past 23 years, thousands of needy San Diego kids have been given Christmas joy.  And it's all because of 10News weathercaster "Captain" Mike Ambrose.  His annual KGTV Christmas Toy Drive has become a San Diego tradition.  The toy drive has grown from helping 12 Indian children back in 1973, to the largest drive of its kind in San Diego's history.  He says it's been "the most meaningful event" in his television career.<P>



     From an early age, Mike knew he wanted a career in broadcasting.  He started working at the age of 16 at a local radio station in Cleburn, Texas.  While attending Arlington University of Texas, he was the highest rated D.J. in the Dallas-Fort Worth area.  And by the age of 21, Mike was a D.J. at the number one top-40 radio station in the nation -- KFWB, Hollywood!<P>



     Although Mike had reached the top in radio broadcasting, he had always wanted to break into television.  Looking for an opportunity, he relocated to San Diego in 1960.  He began working at KOGO-radio as an announcer, then transferred his talents to KOGO-TV -- now KGTV/San Diego's 10.<P>



     From 1973 on, Mike quickly became San Diego's favorite weathercaster.  His popularity and fame has since spread to the entire nation.  In 1987, ABC's Good Morning America invited Captain Mike to New York where he substituted for Spencer Christian!  But you can still see Mike every weeknight on 10 News at 5, 6:30 and 10News Nightcast.

<STRONG><FONT size+1 color="#000080">STEPHEN CLARK</FONT></STRONG>

<P>



Bringing you the news from behind a desk just isn't Stephen Clark's

style. He brings you to the news, taking San Diegans to the brink of

today's issues with his unique reporting style.

<P>

When Stephen went to Bosnia with a medical supply team he reported back

to San Diego with coverage on the war's bloodshed as well as the living

conditions of its innocent victims. For his coverage in The 10Signature

Series: "Faces of War" he won an Emmy and a Golden Mike Award. Although

covering international news stories keeps him busy, nothing is more

important to Stephen than looking out for San Diego's well-being.  With

help from the 10News team, Stephen exposed the illegal dumping of human

waste onto farmlands.  This 10News series earned first place for

investigative journalism in the nationwide competition for the

Investigative Reporters and Editors (I.R.E.) award. And when President

Clinton came to San Diego for a town meeting, Stephen served as a

moderator to assure the issues most important to San Diegans were

addressed.

<P>

Stephen's dedication to San Diego goes beyond reporting the news.  With

his 10News Perspectives, Stephen brings a bold and controversial

point-of-view to commentaries.  He keeps us on "The Cutting Edge" with

his reports on the latest in science, computers and technology.  In

addition, Stephen's "10 Most Wanted" series has directly led to the

capture of "The Shootist," who was wanted by the FBI for robbing the

most banks nationwide, among other dangerous criminals. It's these

kinds of 10News reports and on-going assignments that Stephen is most

proud to be a part of.	<P>

Stephen Clark brings a solid journalistic background with him to San

Diego's 10. He began his television career in 1979 at KRDO, in his

hometown of Colorado Springs, Colorado.  Then, from 1981 to 1984,

he worked as a field reporter at KSN-TV in Wichita, Kansas. Stephen was

an anchor/reporter for KCNC-TV in Denver, Colorado and he also headed

up the station's Washington, D.C. news bureau for one year. In 1988

Stephen joined San Diego's 10 and has reached a front line position,

co-anchoring 10News at 6:30 with Kimberly Hunt.

<P>



10News <A HREF="../troubleshooter/troubleshoot.html">Troubleshooter</A> Marti Emerald is one gutsy lady.  



She's not afraid to track down a con to get to the bottom of a story.  When Marti became KGTV's 10News Troubleshooter in 1988, she dug right in, fighting to resolve local consumer problems and issues that affect the heart, health, and pocketbooks of many San Diegans.  Since then she's helped countless viewers who've been ripped off and made a name for herself exposing corrupt businesses.  Marti has made it a KGTV committment to serve the community as an advocate and a watchdog. <P>



	In 1990, Marti again made headlines.  She became the first woman commentator in San Diego TV, adding her voice to the award-winning 10News "Perspective."  Her passionate approach has stirred up the community on issues ranging from abortion to the drought.<P>



	In addition to her twice-weekly Perspectives on 10News Nightcast at 11, and her Troubleshooter reports, seen weekdays on 10News at Five, Marti also works on special assignments.  For "Homeless Like Me," a 10Signature Series presentation, she spent 48 hours on the streets with San Diego's homeless, bringing viewers a close-up look at a tragic problem.  She also took a hard look at our local education system in the award-winning "Crisis in the Classroom."<P>



	Marti's tough brand of journalism has made its mark here in San Diego.  Most recently, she earned the 1996 Headlines Award from the San Diego Press Club.  She won first place in the 1991 National Press Club Consumer Journalism Awards for "The Pope of Long Beach," a report exposing a charity scam.  She's also received numerous awards including two of television's top honors, the Emmy Award and the Golden Mike.  Organizations such as the San Diego Press Club, the San Diego County Bar Association, Soroptomist's International, the San Diego Medical Society and the California School Boards Association have all recognized her excellence in journalism.  Additionally, in 1993 the U.S. Attorney General recognized Marti for her, "outstanding assistance to victims of crime."<P>



	A tireless volunteer, Marti works with several charities and organizations.  She's also a spokesperson for "Volunteer 10," a project of San Diego's 10 and the United Way.<P>



	In 1978, Marti began her broadcast career in Washington, D.C. as a freelance reporter for the Associated Press Radio Network.  After testing the waters of radio news in both Seattle and Portland, she moved on in 1981 to joined KLAC Radio in Los Angeles as a news anchor.  Later that year, she moved to San Diego, signing on with KSDO Radio as a news reporter.  In 1985, she joined KGTV/San Diego's 10 as a general assignment reporter.  And she's been delivering reports with real punch ever since.

 Being one of San Diego's best-known television personalities keeps Bill Griffith on the go. He's done it all- news anchor, sports director, talk show host, feature reporter-you name it. And today, he's the co-anchor of "Good Morning San Diego," and "10News Midday." 

<P>

 Bill joined San Diego's 10 in 1976 as sportscaster, then "TroubleShooter."  From 1984 to 1988, he co-anchored 10News Weekend and hosted KGTV's local magazine program, "Eye on San Diego."  In addition, he co-hosted "InSide San Diego," a live morning talk show, from 1988 to 1993.  He's also managed to win two Emmys and two Golden Mike Awards.<P>



     Bill's easy likeable style has been a success since his first broadcasting job in 1970, when he served as an announcer for "American Forces Radio" in Europe.  Two years later, he moved to Huntington Beach, California, where he hosted and produced public affairs and information programs for KOCE-TV, a PBS affiliate.<P>



	A graduate of Golden West College in Huntington Beach, Bill majored in English.  He grew up in Greenville, South Carolina, Buffalo, New York and Garden Grove, California.

     10News anchor Kimberly Hunt adds a personal touch to every story she does. During the Persian Gulf war, she anchored "Postcards from Home," the first program to broadcast personal messages from San Diego's military families directly to the troops overseas. This won her not only praise but also the prestigious Golden Mike Award.<P>



     Her reporting has earned her two Emmys as well, one for investigative reporting, the other for outstanding feature news story. "Maquiladoras: Economic Boon or Toxic Time Bomb?" examined the environmental health risks involving toxic waste along the Tijuana River. And Kimberly's feature on the Navy SEALS gave an inside look at this elite military division.<P>



     Her weekly Partners Against Crime reports won the State Attorney General's Crime Prevention Award.<P>



     Kimberly's knack for digging deep to get answers began with a stint in the research department for ABC News in New York. Her first on-air job was as anchor/reporter for KMST-TV in Monterey, California. In December 1987, Kimberly joined the 10News team.<P>



     The California native was born in Ventura and raised in Napa. She earned a degree in broadcast journalism from San Francisco State University.<P>



	Kimberly anchors 10News at 6:30 with Stephen Clark, then teams up with Carol LeBeau on 10News Nightcast at 11:00, to form Southern California's most successful female co-anchor team. She's also the spokesperson for 10Friends, an ongoing community affairs project that brings students and older persons together to share experiences, develop friendships, and learn about each other.

"I love my job! It's challenging and it changes everyday!"

 	Lee Ann Kim challenges herself everyday to bring you the news.  

In March 1996, she joined KGTV/San Diego's 10 as Weekend Anchor/General Assignment

Reporter.    <P>



	Lee Ann brings a solid journalistic background with her to San Diego's 10.

She began her broadcasting career as a state house reporter for Capitol News

Service in Annapolis, Maryland.  She was also a News Anchor at WCFT-TV, the

CBS affiliate in Tuscaloosa, Alabama.  Most recently, she anchored the

weekend news and was a General Assignment Reporter at KYTV-TV in

Springfield, Missouri.  <P>



	At KNWS-TV, the CNN affiliate in Houston, Texas, Lee Ann went beyond her

responsibilities as a Field Producer/ Reporter and took on one of the

biggest challenges of her career.  She was part of a collaborative effort

that founded the first free 24-hour news broadcast operation in the country.

She says, "It was an experience that had me wearing many different hats!"<P>

 

	Lee Ann's enthusiasm about her job goes beyond reporting the news.

"Community service is part of the reason we do what we do.  We should have

our hands on the community."  The American Red Cross, Children's Miracle

Network and Diversity Network of the Ozarks are just a few of the

philanthropic and community organizations she has been involved with in the

past.  She enjoys working with groups that deal with domestic violence and

women's issues.  <P>



As a Korean-American in a profession with a great deal of visibility, Lee

Ann also feels that she has an obligation to the Asian community, to help

break the stereotypes that exist.  "We're a growing population in America.

We are aggressive and educated, and we are Americans!"<P>



In her spare time, Lee Ann enjoys step aerobics, reading and writing

letters, which she says is a dying art form in this day and computer age.

She is engaged to Louis Song and looks forward to getting married in October

1997.

     Staying Healthy is more than a news assignment for 10News anchor Carol LeBeau. It's a way of life.<P>



     Not only does Carol exercise to stay fit, she works to keep her viewers healthy, too. Every weeknight on 10News at Five, she reports on medical breakthroughs, new technologies and surgical alternatives in the popular segment "Staying Healthy." And it's keeping her career in good shape too. She's earned the prestigious Golden Mike Award for Best Specialized Segment. Organizations such as the San Diego Medical Society and the San Diego Society of Psychiatric Physicians have honored her outstanding achievements in journalism.<P>



     When she's not keeping San Diego healthy, Carol co-anchors the news. You'll see her daily with Stephen Clark on 10News at Five. Then, at 11:00, she teams up with Kimberly Hunt on 10News Nightcast to form one of the country's top two-women news teams--and San Diego's number one late night news.<P>



     Carol was raised in Davenport, Iowa. She's a graduate of the University of Northern Iowa at Cedar Falls, and holds a B.A. in radio/television. From 1976 to 1978, she was a reporter, writer and talk show host at WOC-TV, the NBC affiliate in Davenport, Iowa. In June of 1978 she joined WMBD-TV in Peoria, Illinois. In addition to news anchoring, she hosted local segments of that station's Muscular Dystrophy Association Telethon.<P>



	When Carol joined 10News in March of 1981, she brought that dedication to community involvement with her. She serves as the spokesperson for Children's Line 10, an after-school phone line for latchkey kids, and Children's 10Mobile, a community service project that promotes health and the reduction of preventable injuries and illnesses among children. Carol also belongs to numerous organizations, from the YMCA to Media Fellowship International. She volunteers her time to speak to these groups and address their special needs. It's all a way of life for Carol LeBeau.

"Sports shouldn't be taken too seriously.  I like to keep it all in

perspective---it's a game and it should be fun!  Except when my Colgate Red

Raiders are playing---then, it's war!" 

<P>

David Lloyd has a lot of enthusiasm for sports, and it shows!  In January of

1996, he joined the news team at KGTV/San Diego's 10 as Weekend Sports Anchor.

<P>

David has covered sports since 1987.  After a one-year stint as a Sports

Reporter/Intern, he got his first Anchor/Reporter job at WCIV-TV in

Charleston, South Carolina where he covered college and pro sports.  In

1990, he moved to the West Coast and joined KTXL-TV in Sacramento as Weekend

Sports Anchor/Reporter.  In addition to sports reporting, David created and

produced "Dare Dave," a weekly segment highlighting viewer sports challenges

on the air.

<P>

With the same enthusiasm he has for sports, David is selflessly committed to

helping others.  He recalls the times he spent   feeding the homeless as

being "almost a selfish thing because it makes you feel really good to give

to others."

<P>

In his spare time, David enjoys playing hoops, reading and camping with his

new wife, Deirdre.<BR>

"After hearing about wars, disasters and 

floods, sports should be lighthearted, verging 

on goofy."



	10News Sports Anchor, Billy Ray 

Smith, brings an easy likable style to his sports segments. And after ten seasons 

with the San Diego Chargers, he knows how 

serious sports can be. Billy Ray believes 

watching sports, however, should be 

entertaining and fun. "After all, it's only a 

game." 

<P>

	Born in Fayetteville, Arkansas, Billy Ray 

attended the University of Arkansas and earned 

a degree in finance and banking. His media 

experience began during his years as a Charger 

with appearances on various television and 

radio shows.

<P>

	Billy Ray first appeared on San Diego's 

10 in 1987, providing commentary about the 

Chargers games. After retiring from football 

in 1992, Billy Ray later joined San Diego's 10 

in 1994, as the weekend sports anchor.  

<P>

	In addition to covering sports, Billy Ray 

is also active in many volunteer 

organizations. He was the co-founder of the 

Bates Street Community Resource Center, a 

recreation and counseling haven for youths in 

East San Diego. He is also involved in the 

United Cerebral Palsy Telethons, the Arthritis 

Foundation, and local "Hire-a-Youth" program.

<STRONG>Caminiti's Return Key for Padres</STRONG></A><P>
The countdown begins this weekend for Ken Caminiti.
<P>
   After surgeons repaired Caminiti's badly torn left rotator cuff on Oct. 9, the San Diego Padres said it could be July before the unanimous NL MVP was back in action.
<P>
   Guess again. Caminiti hates to sit, and he wants to be in the opening day lineup at home April 1 against the New York Mets.
<P><IMG ALIGN="left" SRC="cammy.jpg" WIDTH="179" HEIGHT="134"  VSPACE="5" HSPACE="10" ALT="Ken Caminiti"><P>
   "I think the chances are good that I can play opening day," Caminiti said this week from his home in Houston. "I'm going to try to get out there as fast as I can possibly get out there. Then again, I don't want to get too excited until I do the everyday things."
<P>
   Caminiti, who recently began swinging a bat, will report to the Padres' spring training complex in Peoria, Ariz., this weekend. Pitchers and catchers reported Friday, and position players are due Wednesday.
<P>
   One pitcher the Padres don't have in camp is Japanese star Hideki Irabu. The Padres believe they have exclusive negotiating rights with the hard-throwing right-hander. But Irabu, 27, wants to be a New York Yankee and claims he should be declared a free agent.
   A four-man committee is hearing arguments and will make a recommendation to the ruling executive council.
<P>
   "We feel like we've got a good chance to sign him," general manager Kevin Towers said. "I just think it will be a slow process."
   If the Padres get the Irabu, "We'll be a lot better," Towers said. "That's not a knock against the guys we already have, but having him in our rotation certainly will make us better."
<P><IMG ALIGN="right" SRC="pads.jpg" WIDTH="179" HEIGHT="134"  VSPACE="5" HSPACE="10" ALT="Padres Logo"><P>
   If he signs with the Padres, Irabu would join a rotation that includes Andy Ashby, Joey Hamilton, Sterling Hitchcock and Fernando Valenzuela. If he doesn't, Tim Worrell, Sean Bergman and minor-league lefty Heath Murray will compete for the No. 5 spot.
<p>
   Caminiti literally carried the Padres to their first NL West title in 12 seasons last year, but paid a heavy physical price. The third baseman won his second straight Gold Glove award and set club records with 40 homers and 130 RBIs despite rotator cuff, groin, hamstring and back injuries.
<P>
   "Ken's a different individual," Towers said. "There are very few guys who can come off a surgery like that; there's probably very few people who could have performed like he did last year, with the rotator cuff torn as badly as it was. I wouldn't put anything past him. I think we'll just wait to see how he progresses in spring training before we make that decision" about when he returns.
<P>
   Left fielder Greg Vaughn, who agreed Monday to a $15 million, three-year contract, has spoken with Caminiti nearly every day.
   "He said he'll be ready to play opening day," Vaughn said. "I didn't argue with him. If he's ready, he's ready, and we'll be a much better team."
<P>
   Caminiti said he had his ups and downs during rehab. "Overall, the big picture is real good," he said.
   Caminiti's personal trainer, Blake Blackwell, said Caminiti must still be reintroduced to jarring and impact.
   "He's going to have to be confident that he can take a fall on it and not hurt himself further," Blackwell said.
<P>
   The Padres don't have as many question marks as they did last spring, but there will be some action.
   By committing to Vaughn, the Padres will try to trade Rickey Henderson before the season starts rather than continuing the awkward four-man outfield rotation they used after acquiring Vaughn from Milwaukee on July 31.
<P>
   Newcomer Quilvio Veras is a candidate to replace Henderson as the leadoff batter, but he'll have to beat out incumbent Jody Reed at second base. Veras led the majors with 56 stolen bases as a Florida Marlins rookie in 1995, but hurt his left hamstring last year and was demoted.
<P>
   Besides Caminiti, other Padres coming off surgery are seven-time NL batting champ Tony Gwynn (foot) and Ashby (shoulder), who was on the disabled list three times last year. First baseman Wally Joyner struggled at the plate after his return from a broken thumb.
   Reliever Trevor Hoffman is a little behind after spraining his right wrist when he slipped on ice at Buffalo, N.Y., where he was visiting his in-laws.

<A NAME="one"><STRONG>Sheriff's Helicopter Crashes Near Santee Lakes</STRONG></A><BR>

   A San Diego County sheriff's helicopter crashed near the  Santee Recreation Lakes in Santee Sunday night, injuring the pilot and the observer aboard, a sheriff's spokesman said. 
<P>
   The crash occurred about 7:45 p.m. in a canyon area near the southernmost  lake, said the spokesman.

   A dispatcher for the Santee Fire Department said one crewmember was  airlifted to Sharp Memorial Hospital, the other to Mercy Hospital Medical  Center. 

   The victims' conditions were not immediately known.

<A NAME="two"><STRONG>Deadly Kidnap Attempt</STRONG></A><BR>
Kidnap Attempt

   An Orange County man, distraught when his married  girlfriend ended their affair, stabbed and tried to kidnap her, then killed  himself by lying down in front of an oncoming train, authorities said Sunday. 
   The dead man was identified as Bryon Watt Jennings, 31, of Laguna Hills,  said a San Diego County medical examiner. 
<P>   
San Diego County sheriff's deputies reportedly found a suicide note in the  car he allegedly stole from the woman. 
   "He was involved with a married woman whose husband was overseas," said  San Diego County sheriff's deputy Ed Augustine. "They had apparently been  involved in a secret romance for the past two years and were discovered by the  (woman's) brother." 
   It was at this time that the woman decided to end the affair, said  Augustine. That triggered a violent chain of events that began about 5:40 p.m.  Friday when Jennings allegedly tried to kidnap the woman from her work place  in the 200 block of North El Camino Real in Encinitas, Augustine said. 
<P>   
Jennings allegedly showed up at the optometry office where the woman worked  and tried to get in, but the woman, who was alone, locked the front door. 
   "(Jennings) started kicking at the glass doors and couldn't break them, so  he began hitting the door with his body and crashed through the window,  landing in a big pile of glass," said Augustine. 
   Jennings, who was armed with a knife, forced the woman into her car,  Augustine said. She managed to get away from Jennings, but not before he  stabbed her in the arm, said Augustine. 
A number of people saw the attack but did not intervene, he said, adding  the woman ran to a nearby restaurant and called for help.
   Jennings dropped the knife and drove away in the woman's 1996 Honda Accord,  said the sheriff's deputy. 
<P>
   At about 5:20 p.m. Saturday, witnesses saw him lie down in front of an  oncoming train in San Diego's University City area, said the medical  examiner's spokesman. He was hit by the train and killed instantly.
   In the suicide note, Jennings apologized for stabbing the woman and said he  had been in love with her since the first day they met, said Augustine. 
   The woman, who lives at Camp Pendleton, was treated and released from  Scripps Memorial Hospital in Encinitas. She apparently had obtained a  restraining order against Jennings on Friday, the day he stabbed her and tried  to kidnap her. 
   Augustine said the woman, whose name was not released, was uncooperative  with sheriff's investigators and initially said she cut her arm on a glass  door.

<A NAME="three"><STRONG>Westgate Hotel Fire</STRONG></A><BR>

   A fire on the 17th floor of the Westgate hotel in downtown San Diego forced the evacuation of some 200 guests and employees early Sunday.
   At first,  the San Diego Fire Department evacuated the only 17th, 18th and 19th floors. But, as the smoke thickened,  the decision was made to evacuate the entire facility.
<P>  
The fire apparently began in an air-conditioning unit.
  Fire fighters were able to put it out quickly, but it generated a lot of smoke.
  Three people were injured during the fire. Two employees suffered from smoke inhalation, and one firefighter injured his back while getting hoses to the 17th floor.

<A NAME="four"><STRONG>Senior Building Fire Caused By Smoking in Bed</STRONG></A><BR>

   Firefighters determined that smoking in bed caused the  fire at a downtown apartment building that sent an elderly woman to the  hospital with burns on her back, a fire dispatcher said Sunday. 
   The condition of the 94 year old woman, who is in the burn unit of the UCSD  Medical Center, was upgraded from critical to serious, said a nursing  supervisor. 
<P>   
The fire broke out about 1:30 p.m. Saturday at San Diego Square, a high-rise, senior citizens apartment building at 1055 Ninth Ave., said San Diego  fire dispatcher Dennis Cornelson. 
   The woman's mattress caught fire, he said.
   An apartment manager who tried to help the woman get out of the burning  apartment was overcome by smoke but was not seriously injured, said Cornelson. 
<P>   
Damage was estimated at $20,000  to $30,000 to the structure and $10,000 in  damage to furnishings and other property.

<A NAME="five"><STRONG>Paint Dumped at Mission Bay Park</STRONG></A><BR>

   Police are looking for whoever left dozens of containers of toxic paint in Mission Bay Park.
   When workers cleaned up the park Sunday morning,  they found nearly one hundred five-gallon containers, some of them full of paint, in several dumpsters in various parts of the park.
   The San Diego Fire Department's toxic waste experts say if the paint had spilled, it could have been harmful to people and wildlife.
<P>  
  It is a felony to dump toxic materials.  Contact San Diego police if you have any information on this case.

<H4><FONT color="#000080">Better Beepers - Part 2</H4></FONT>
<FONT size=2>
<EM>posted 8/22/96</EM><P>
Beeper sales are booming with prices ranging from 50 dollars to over 200 for some of the more sophisticated.  Consumer Reports just tested the latest models and has a list of features to look for when you buy.<P>

These days, beepers come in all colors.  And they no longer just beep, they come with a variety of sounds.  <P>

Consumer Reports just tested 10 beepers from the leading brands.  They all proved durable, but when it came to receiving a page some weren't as good as others.  One beeper from Swatch called The Beep cost $100 and was the worst.  One problem:  it uses a low frequency of 150 megahertz.  The better beepers work on a higher frequency of about 900 megahertz.  That's better for penetrating metal structures like steel buildings or cars.  You can check the frequency right on the beeper.  If you look at the back of the beeper, you'll see in tiny letters 931.8375 megaHertz.<P>

In the store, you'll find beepers come based on one of two technologies.  There's POCSAG, the older technology.  And FLEX can help save money.  Beepers need batteries and a FLEX beeper may get 4 or 5 months out of a battery where a POCSAG pager may get only a month or so.<P>

A final caution.  Even a good beeper may not work where you need it.  Any metal surface can deflect the signal.  Beams in the building, even your desk can interfere.  So, try out your beeper the way testers did.  Page yourself three times.  If you get the messages, your beeper is okay.  And, Consumer Reports says always try a beeper before you buy it.  Testers found some companies will give you a week to do that.<P>

Here's how to reach Swatch:  (201) 271-1400.

<STRONG>America Online and Keywords</STRONG><BR>
If you're one of the thousands of San Diegans visiting cyberspace  <BR>
everyday, you know how confusing it can be. 
Today's Computer Tips will explain how to navigate the online service America Online with ease.
<P><A HREF="welcome.wav">
<I>"<B>Welcome... you've got mail</B>".</I></A><BR>
America Online admits they're having some big problems, not the least of which is they have too many customers for too few phone lines.

Once you are able to sign on, you'll find that AOL has alot to offer... almost too much. It can be difficult to find your way around.	

Make it easy on yourself by using a feature called Keyword. This option allows you to move quickly from place to place. 
<P>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="keyword.gif"></CENTER>
<P>
To start, locate the Keyword button on the top right of your screen. Put the mouse pointer on it and click once. You'll see the Keyword box pop up. You can also push control-k for PC's, or command-k for Macs, and get the same result.

My suggestion is you start by typing in the word Keyword and click once on Go. You'll be wisked away to the information area. This is a good place to learn the ins and outs.


While you're there, be sure to check out the A to Z keyword list. There are over six thousand areas catalogued. Everything from the Oakland A's baseball team to zoos around the world. And the best thing is there's no floundering around. Just pick the keyword you want, type it in the box, and your beamed directly over.
<P>
And no keyword visit is complete until you type in these two words, San Diego. This is Digital City's San Diego HomePage. You'll find local news, weather, traffic, business, and yes, even TV personalities.

You may wish to download the entire Keyword list from AOL. You can either save it as a file or print it out. This will make it easier to reference once you get online. If you can get online.

Explore, learn, enjoy, and keep dialing!

	"It was either do something or die"

Rick Vass is definitely doing something. At an age when most people are thinking about retirement, he's just starting a new career... computer repair.

	"It's a rejuvenation because it takes the mind that I have and puts it back to work" , says Rick.

His mind works because he has a strong desire to learn.

	"I have found my life has changed because of a simple thing like going back to school" .	
<P>

	"Here among the candy sales, basketball games, prom nights, and other activities of high school, people like Rick Vass are learning new skills and and finding new hope".

School-age kids work side-by-side with adults of all ages at Madison High School. They share a common goal... to develop solid job skills. It's all part of the States' Regional Occupational Computer Repair Program.

	"It's good for the high schools to work with the "ole fogey's", they can learn alot and they can even teach the older people. It's a sharing. 
<P>

They work well together", says Mitch Reynolds, Rick's teacher.

Rebuilding a computer can be a very difficult task. The technology changes so quickly, if you miss a day of class, you miss alot. But...

	"Once they believe in themselves that yea, I can do this, it's like stand back, don't get in their way".
<P>
Now, nothing gets in Rick Vass' way. He has his future firmly under control.

	Says Rick, "The whole point is that it's given me a new confidence, a new ability to just face life and do the things that I want to do".

      <h1>The Arc's Discussion Board</h1>
    </center>
<p>Below is The Arc's Discussion Board.  The purpose of this Board is to allow consumers, 
family members, advocates, professionals and others to discuss various 
topics and issues related to mental retardation and other developmental 
disaiblities.  The Board is a good place to post questions to 
our web visitors, share information, debate issues and generally "converse" 
with others.  

<p>Just above the "Post A Message" form are a list of subjects where others have already posted a message.

<H1>Introduction to Mental Retardation</H1>

<P><B>What is mental retardation?</B>

<P>According to the new definition by the American Association on Mental Retardation (AAMR), an individual is considered to have mental retardation based on the following three criteria:  intellectual functioning level (IQ) is below 70-75; significant limitations exist in two or more adaptive skill areas; and the condition is present from childhood (defined as age 18 or less) (AAMR, 1992).

<P><B>What are the adaptive skills essential for daily functioning?</B>

<P>Adaptive skill areas are those daily living skills needed to live, work and play in the community.  The new definition includes ten adaptive skills:  communication, self-care, home living, social skills, leisure, health and safety, self-direction, functional academics, community use and work.
<P>Adaptive skills are assessed in the person's typical environment across all aspects of an individual's life.  A person with limits in intellectual functioning who does not have limits in adaptive skill areas may not be diagnosed as having mental retardation.

<P><B>How many people are affected by mental retardation?</B>

<P>Various studies have been conducted in local communities to determine the prevalence of mental retardation.  The Arc reviewed many of these prevalence studies in the early 1980s and concluded that 2.5 to 3 percent of the general population has mental retardation (The Arc, 1982).  A recent review of prevalence studies generally confirms this distribution (Fryers, 1993).

<P>Based on the 1990 census, an estimated 6.2 to 7.5 million people have mental retardation.  Mental retardation is 12 times more common than cerebral palsy and 30 times more prevalent than neural tube defects such as spina bifida.  It affects 100 times as many people as total blindness (Batshaw & Perret, 1992).

<P>Mental retardation cuts across the lines of racial, ethnic, educational, social and economic backgrounds.  It can occur in any family.  One out of ten American families is directly affected by mental retardation.

<P><B>How does mental retardation affect individuals?</B>

<P>The effects of mental retardation vary considerably among people, just as the range of abilities varies considerably among people who do not have mental retardation.  About 87 percent will be mildly affected and will be only a little slower than average in learning new information and skills.  As children, their mental retardation is not readily apparent and may not be identified until they enter school.  As adults, many will be able to lead independent lives in the community and will no longer be viewed as having mental retardation.

<P>The remaining 13 percent of people with mental retardation, those with IQs under 50, will have serious limitations in functioning.  However, with early intervention, a functional education and appropriate supports as an adult, all can lead satisfying lives in the community.

<P>AAMR's new definition no longer labels individuals according to the categories of mild, moderate, severe and profound mental retardation based on IQ level.  Instead, it looks at the intensity and pattern of changing supports needed by an individual over a lifetime.

<P><B>How is mental retardation diagnosed?</B>

<P>The AAMR process for diagnosing and classifying a person as having mental retardation contains three steps and describes the system of supports a person needs to overcome limits in adaptive skills.

<P>The first step in diagnosis is to have a qualified person give one or more standardized intelligence tests and a standardized adaptive skills test, on an individual basis.

<P>The second step is to describe the person's strengths and weaknesses across four dimensions.  The four dimensions are:

<OL>
<LI>Intellectual and adaptive behavior skills
<LI>Psychological/emotional considerations
<LI>Physical/health/etiological considerations
<LI>Environmental considerations
</OL>


<P>Strengths and weaknesses may be determined by formal testing, observations, interviewing key people in the individual's life, interviewing the individual, interacting with the person in his or her daily life or a combination of these approaches.

<P>The third step requires an interdisciplinary team to determine needed supports across the four dimensions.  Each support identified is assigned one of four levels of intensity - intermittent, limited, extensive, pervasive.

<P>Intermittent support refers to support on an "as needed basis."  An example would be support that is needed in order for a person to find a new job in the event of a job loss.  Intermittent support may be needed occasionally by an individual over the lifespan, but not on a continuous daily basis.

<P>Limited support may occur over a limited time span such as during transition from school to work or in time-limited job training.  This type of support has a limit on the time that is needed to provide appropriate support for an individual.

<P>Extensive support in a life area is assistance that an individual needs on a daily basis that is not limited by time.  This may involve support in the home and/or support in work.  Intermittent, limited and extensive supports may not be needed in all life areas for an individual.

<P>Pervasive support refers to constant support across environments and life areas and may include life-sustaining measures.  A person requiring pervasive support will need assistance on a daily basis across all life areas.

<P><B>What does the term "mental age" mean when used to describe the person's functioning?</b>

<P>The term mental age is used in intelligence testing.  It means that the individual received the same number of correct responses on a standardized IQ test as the average person of that age in the sample population.

<P>Saying that an older person with mental retardation is like a person of a younger age or has the "mind" or "understanding" of a younger person is incorrect usage of the term.  The mental age only refers to the intelligence test score.  It does not describe the level and nature of the person's experience and functioning in aspects of community life.

<P><B>What are the causes of mental retardation?</B>

<P>Mental retardation can be caused by any condition which impairs development of the brain before birth, during birth or in the childhood years.  Several hundred causes have been discovered, but in about one-third of the people affected, the cause remains unknown.  The three major known causes of mental retardation are Down syndrome, fetal alcohol syndrome and fragile X.  

<P>The causes can be categorized as follows:

<UL>
<LI>Genetic conditions - These result from abnormality of genes inherited from parents, errors when genes combine, or from other disorders of the genes caused during pregnancy by infections, overexposure to x-rays and other factors.  Inborn errors of metabolism which may produce mental retardation, such as PKU (phenylketonuria), fall in this category.  Chromosomal abnormalities have likewise been related to some forms of mental retardation, such as Down syndrome and fragile X syndrome.<br><br>
<LI>Problems during pregnancy - Use of alcohol or drugs by the pregnant mother can cause mental retardation.  Malnutrition, rubella, glandular disorders and diabetes, cytomegalovirus, and many other illnesses of the mother during pregnancy may result in a child being born with mental retardation.  Physical malformations of the brain and HIV infection originating in prenatal life may also result in mental retardation.<br><br>
<LI>Problems at birth - Although any birth condition of unusual stress may injure the infant's brain, prematurity and low birth weight predict serious problems more often than any other conditions.<br><br>
<LI>Problems after birth - Childhood diseases such as whooping cough, chicken pox, measles, and Hib disease which may lead to meningitis and encephalitis can damage the brain, as can accidents such as a blow to the head or near drowning. Substances such as lead and mercury can cause irreparable damage to the brain and nervous system.<br><br>
<LI>Poverty and cultural deprivation - Children in poor families may become mentally retarded because of malnutrition, disease-producing conditions, inadequate medical care and environmental health. hazards. Also, children in disadvantaged areas may be deprived of many common cultural and day-to-day experiences provided to other youngsters.  Research suggests that such under-stimulation can result in irreversible damage and can serve as a cause of mental retardation.<br><br>
</UL>


<P><B>Can mental retardation be prevented?</B>

<P>During the past 30 years, significant advances in research have prevented many cases of mental retardation.  For example, every year in the United States, we prevent:

<UL>
<LI>250 cases of mental retardation due to phenylketonuria (PKU) by newborn screening and dietary treatment;
<LI>1,000 cases of mental retardation due to congenital hypothyroidism thanks to newborn screening and thyroid hormone replacement therapy,
<LI>2,000 cases of mental retardation or deafness by use of Rhogam to prevent Rh disease and severe jaundice in newborn infants;
<LI>3,000 cases of mental retardation due to measles encephalitis thanks to measles vaccine; and
<LI>untold numbers of cases of mental retardation caused by rubella during pregnancy thanks to rubella vaccine (Alexander, 1991).
</UL>


<P>In addition, with the new vaccine against Hib disease, 3,000 to 4,000 cases of mental retardation can now be prevented.

<P>New attempts at treatment of a variety of causes are being developed.  There are now improved ways to manage head trauma, asphyxia (lack of oxygen) and infectious diseases to reduce their adverse effects on the brain.  Early intervention programs with high-risk infants and children have shown remarkable results in reducing the predicted incidence of subnormal intellectual functioning.

<P>Finally, early comprehensive prenatal care and preventive measures prior to and during pregnancy increase a woman's chances of preventing mental retardation.

<P><I>The Arc, a national organization on mental retardation, has a rich history of improving the lives of people with mental retardation and their families.  The Arc also has led the way in research and has educated millions regarding prevention of one-half of the known causes of mental retardation.  Leading to The Arc's strong leadership role in the field today are the following major events and accomplishments.</I><P>
<center><H2>1950</H2></center>
The first convention of the "National Association of Parents and Friends of Mentally Retarded Children" was held Sept. 28-Oct. 1 at the Radisson Hotel in Minneapolis, Minn.<P>
<center><H2>1952</H2></center>
The organization became the National Association for Retarded Children and produced a national newspaper, Children Limited.<P>
<center><H2>1954</H2></center>
The first National Headquarters opened in New York City.  President Dwight Eisenhower declared the first National Retarded Children's Week.<P>
<center><H2>1955</H2></center>
The association's first film, "Tuesday's Child," was produced.  Membership rose to 29,000 with 412 local chapters.<P>
<center><H2>1956</H2></center>
"Federal Program of Action for America's Retarded Children and Adults" was presented to Congress.  Testimony was provided on bills to expand teaching and research in the education of children with mental retardation.<P>
<center><H2>1957</H2></center>
The association supported Social Security coverage for adults disabled in childhood, funding for medical facilities for people with mental retardation through the Hill-Burton Act and increased appropriations for vocational rehabilitation programs.<P>
<center><H2>1958</H2></center>
Mental Subnormality, an important cornerstone in research literature in the field of mental retardation, reported findings of a three-year association survey.<P>
Concurrently, support began for research projects and policies formulated for comprehensive programming and institutions.<P>
<center><H2>1959</H2></center>
The Arc published a landmark report, Decade of Decision, describing the association's accomplishments and prospects for meeting service needs of people with mental retardation<P>
<center><H2>1960</H2></center>
Decade of Decision was presented to the White House Conference on Children and Youth.  Membership totaled 62,000.  The association was approved as one of 10 voluntary health organizations by the President's Committee on Fundraising in the Federal Service.<P>
<center><H2>1961</H2></center>
Under an association grant, a new screening test for phenylketonuria (PKU) was discovered by Robert Guthrie.<P>
<center><H2>1956-61</H2></center>
Federal support for mental retardation services and research increased from $14 million to $94 million.<P>
<center><H2>1962</H2></center>
The association received the Joseph P. Kennedy Foundation International Award.<P>
<center><H2>1963</H2></center>
The President's Panel on Mental Retardation recommended the Mental Retardation Construction Act, maternity and child care projects, expansion of the Vocational Rehabilitation Act and establishment of special education programs.<P>
<center><H2>1964</H2></center>
Membership totaled 100,000.  The first interorganization conference on mental retardation convened with representatives from 28 national organizations.<P>
<center><H2>1965</H2></center>
The association's On-the-Job Training Project was established.<P>
<center><H2>1968</H2></center>
The Arc stepped up insistence on immediate eradication of inhumane treatment and improvement of institutional care.<P>
<center><H2>1969</H2></center>
The Arc was a cosponsor of Project Star, a national demonstration of minority and poverty outreach approaches.  We initiated the annual holiday card fund-raising program.<P>
The Arc's Governmental Affairs office was opened in Washington, D.C., to increase visibility in the nation's capital and attempt to influence federal policy toward children and adults with mental retardation and their families.<P>
<center><H2>1970</H2></center>
The National Headquarters was moved from New  York to Arlington, Texas, a city more centrally located for the growing membership.<P>
The Arc supported expansion of Medicaid to allow the federal government to finance residential programs as Intermediate Care facilities for the Mentally Retarded (ICR/MR).  The Arc also joined with other organizations to sponsor a national standard-setting and accrediting body, now known as the Accreditation Council on Services for People with Developmental Disabilities (ACDD).<P>
<center><H2>1971-72</H2></center>
National and state offices of The Arc began to join court suits to defend the rights of citizens with mental retardation living in state institutions and to ensure their right to education.  Advocacy intensified to strengthen individuals' rights to be served by community-based residential services.  Other stepped-up efforts took on such diverse issues as immigration, benefits for dependents of service people, early childhood, fair labor standards as applied to workers with mental retardation, lead paint poisoning and immunization programs.<P>
<center><H2>1973-76</H2></center>
The Arc emphasized the complex issues surrounding the use of human subjects in research, both biomedical and behavioral.  We made one of the major presentations to the National Commission on research on Human Subjects.<P>
<center><H2>1974</H2></center>
Reflecting a growing service to adults as well as children, the Association for Retarded Children's name was changed to the National Association for Retarded Citizens.<P>
The association worked for two major programs which had a significant impact on the lives of people with mental retardation -- Supplemental Security Income and Title Twenty-Social Services.<P>
<center><H2>1975</H2></center>
Members' hard work securing the right to a public education for all children, regardless of their handicap, was rewarded by passage of Public Law 94-142, the Education of All Handicapped Children Act.<P>
<center><H2>1976</H2></center>
With the International League of Societies for Persons with Mental Handicap, The Arc was host to a "Symposium on Normalization and Integration:  Improving the Quality of Life," featuring international experts.<P>
<center><H2>1977</H2></center>
The Arc received two federal grants for the establishment of the federal program information and assistance project.  The project trained hundreds of advocates in the states about federal programs and developed three comprehensive federal resource guides.<P>
<center><H2>1978</H2></center>
First Lady Rosalyn Carter addressed The Arc's national convention in New Orleans. The Arc's activities were directed toward extending and strengthening two federal acts, Rehabilitation and Developmental Disabilities<P>
<center><H2>1979</H2></center>
The month of March became Mental Retardation Month, designed by The Arc and The Advertising council.  Also, The Arc addressed the issue of meeting the mental health needs of individuals wit mental retardation and focused attention on legislation to ensure funding for community housing.<P>
<center><H2>1980</H2></center>
The name of "NARC" was changed to Association for Retardation Citizens of the United States.  State and local chapters nationwide also adopted a uniform identify by becoming ARC of ...<P>
<center><H2>1981</H2></center>
The Arc's Media Campaign was launched with 150 participating chapters using a common strategy and set of broadcast and print advertising materials to build awareness of the association locally, statewide and nationally.<P>
<center><H2>1982-83</H2></center>
The death in Indiana of a baby born with Down syndrome sparked renewed efforts by The Arc toward protecting the lives of other so-called "Baby Does" born with mental retardation and other disabilities.<P>
Also, in 1982 the innovative Bioengineering Program was launched to utilize technology to meet the needs of people with disabilities.<P>
At the 1982 national convention, delegates approved a resolution declaring the right of all people to community-based services, regardless of the severity of their handicaps.<P>
<center><H2>1984</H2></center>
The Arc spearheaded meetings of national medical and disability groups leading to the signing of the "Principles of Treatment of Disabled Infants" and the passage of the "Baby Doe" Amendments to the Child Abuse Act protecting newborns with disabilities from the withdrawal of medical care.<P>
<center><H2>1985</H2></center>
The Arc's Bioengineering Program scored its first success when research was completed proving a computer system equipped with voice recognition and environmental control capabilities could be configured for use by people who have profound mental retardation and severely physical impairments.<P>
The Arc continued its work toward community integration through support of the Community and Family Living Amendments.<P>  
The association also celebrated its 35th anniversary with an open house at National Headquarters in Arlington, Texas.<P>
<center><H2>1986</H2></center>
It was a banner year for key legislative victories with n less than 11 major laws enacted by Congress and signed by President Reagan.  Among that total was the Education of the Handicapped Act Amendments of 1986 (P.L. 99-457).  The law mandated a new preschool program for three-to-five-year-olds and early intervention services to infants and toddlers from birth through age three.<P>
<center><H2>1987</H2></center>
The Arc teamed with Johnson & Johnson to begin a three-year awareness and fund-raising campaign that reached an estimated 75 million households annually through newspaper coupon inserts and other retail advertising.<P>
In an effort to ensure the availability of community health care for people who have mental retardation, The Arc joined in a collaborative effort with several other organizations to form the National Consortium of Community Health Services for Persons with Developmental Disabilities.<P>
The Arc's On-The-Job Training Project changed its name to National Employment and Training Program in order to reflect its greatly expanded scope.  In 1987 the NET Program encompassed such activities as supported employment, professional and volunteer training, job development and placement and more.<P>
<center><H2>1988</H2></center>
The Arc's State Prevention Information Network was begun to allow the National Headquarters and state affiliates to share current information on the prevention of mental retardation.<P>
"A Status report on Waiting Lists for Community Services" revealed more than 139,000 children and adults on waiting lists for community services across the country.<P>
A nonprofit foundation for the association was established to provide a permanent financial base for The Arc.<P>
The Arc played a major role in achieving congressional enactment of The Fair Housing Act Amendments of 1988, which prohibits housing discrimination based on disability.<P>
<center><H2>1989</H2></center>
The Arc's "We the People" project produced a curriculum to educate students with mental retardation about the U.S. Constitution.<P>
The 1980s growth of the self-advocacy movement, in which people with mental retardation actively speak out about their own needs and desires, could be partially measured through a new workshop manual showing 368 self-advocacy programs across the United States.<P>
The Arc launched its National Planned Giving Program with the dual purpose of providing a service to The Arc's donors and securing greater financial stability for the association.<P>
<center><H2>1990</H2></center>
The Arc began a year-long celebration of its 40th anniversary.<P>
The Association joined the battle against AIDS with a new, three-year project involving the education of people with mental retardation to prevent the spread of Human Immunodeficiency Virus.<P>
The Arc joined other disability organizations in celebrating passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act, which was signed into law by President George Bush July 26, 1990.<P>
<center><H2>1991</H2></center>
The organization's most recent name change, from "Association for Retarded Citizens of the United States" to "The Arc," was also its most significant.  For the first time, the work "retarded" was gone from the name because of increased sensitivities from self-advocates, young parents and others who object to the term.<P>
After many months of study and effort led by a broad-based committee of leaders, a long-range National Strategic Plan for The Arc was approved at The Arc's 42nd annual convention in Portland, Ore.  The plan calls for strong initiatives in the areas of increasing visibility and support for the association, prevention (particularly fetal alcohol syndrome), opportunities for choice and inclusion for children and adults, and improvements in the governance structure.<P>
<center><H2>1992</H2></center>
Thousands of phone calls from businesses and individuals poured into The Arc's "Access ADA," a project of helping people understand and comply with the public accommodations requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act.<P>
NETP celebrated its 25th year of matching employers with employees having mental retardation.  More than 45,000 placements have been the result of this successful employment program of The Arc.<P>
To assess both progress and need, The Arc prepared its first "Report to the Nation on Inclusion in Education of Students with Mental Retardation" for announcement and presentation at the 43rd annual national convention in Minneapolis, Minn.<P>
The Arc took a stand against the unfair, imbalanced treatment of criminal offenders with mental retardation by adopting an official position statement titled, "Access to Justice and Fair Treatment Under the Criminal Law for People with Mental Retardation.<P>
<center><H2>1993</H2></center>
The Arc stepped up its efforts to help the nation reduce the incidence of fetal alcohol syndrome by expanding the availability of information and public service advertising that advise pregnant women to abstain from alcohol.  A national summit on the prevention of FAS was held in Baltimore, Md.<P>
Using its 1992 position statement, The Arc raised questions about criminal justice in several notable death penalty cases.<P>
Following the lead of The Arc of the United States, 150 local and state chapters by July had changed their names from Association for Retarded Citizens to The Arc.<P>
The Arc issued its second annual "Report to the Nation on Inclusion," this one on employment.  Using data reported by stae mental retardation and developmental disability agencies, the report revealed that 82 percent of employees with mental retardation are in segregated employment situations.<P>
At The Arc's national convention in Providence, R.I., First Lady Hillary Clinton urged the association to support the president's health care reform plan.<P>
<center><H2>1994</H2></center>
The Arc began work on an FAS information clearinghouse at the headquarters.  National debate heated up over health care reform and inclusive education, with The Arc being vocal and visible on behalf of the interests of children and adults with mental retardation and their families.<P>

<html><head><title>WWWBoard Frequently Asked Questions</title></head>
<body><h1>WWWBoard Frequently Asked Questions and Answers</h1>
Here is a brief explanation of some of the questions you may have 
about WWWBoard.<hr>
<ul>
<li><a href="#links">Can I use html tags anywhere in my posts?</a>
<li><a href="#colons">Why are there colons in the message section when I 
try post a followup?</a>
<li><a href="#reload">Why didn't my post show up?</a>
<li><a href="#getit">Where can I get the scripts for this program?</a>
</ul><hr><p>
<a name="links">Can I put html tags anywhere in my posts?</a><p>
No.  You can not use HTML tags in any field except body of the message.  
The maintainer of the script has the option of allowing or 
disallowing any HTML in the Message part of your posting.  If 
they disallow it, the script will just throw out everything in 
&lt;&gt;'s.  If they allow it, your html markup will appear in 
the posting.  It can't hurt to try.<p><hr><p> 

<a name="colons">Why are there colons in the message when I try to post a 
followup?</a><p>
Colons appear in the message dialog box when you try to followup up on a 
message to indicate that those lines are quoting the previous document. 
The owner of the WWWBoard can decide whether they wish to enable or 
disable the quoting of previous messages.<p><hr><p>


<a name="reload">Why didn't my post show up?</a><p>
Your post most likely did not show up, because your browser did not reload the 
page, it simply pulled it out of cache.  Please reload your browser and it 
should then appear.<p><hr><p>
<a name="getit">Where can I get the scripts for this program?</a><p>
The scripts are written in Perl and created by <a 
href="http://alpha.pr1.k12.co.us/~mattw/home.html">Matt Wright</a>.  They are 
free to anyone who wishes to use them and you can get them as well as other 
scripts at: <a href="http://worldwidemart.com/scripts/">http://worldwidemart.com/scripts/</a>.  
Enjoy!<p><hr>

 I need  some advice on intervention techniques for a mosaic down syndrome child and a student with cri-du-chat syndrome.  Presently doing my CFY and need advice.  The mosaic student has extreme difficulties attending to task . She has bilateral hearing aids but is not consistent in wearing them (i.e. loosing, broken, etc.)  Nonverbal with some emerging v/c contrasts.  The cri-du-chat student does well with swith adapted objects but is not consistent.  Also has unrepaired cleft palate.  This is my concern.  What do you think?

To update previous letter:My daughter has the ability to create various speech sounds, but cannot form words.She has frequent inappropriate laughter and seldom cries with pain.She is extremely bright and has great problem solving skills, but because she cannot communicate she scores at a 6-8 month level on cognitive tests.She is very strong but has had problems either with supporting her wieght or with balance and continues to walk with a gait. She has a happy disposition and loves to be around other people but usually has little innterest in playing with them directly. She has problems with biting and scratching. She has been tested for genetic disorders and all tests were returned as normal. She has had an MRI scan and it also was said to be normal. Her enzymes were tested afterwards and they were also normal. The Vanderbilt Child Development Center has given up on finding the cause of her delays and referred her to a geneticist who woks with  Lebonner Childrens Hospital.Any ideas or possibile tests would be appreciated. <br>Thank You.

: To update previous letter:My daughter has the ability to create various speech sounds, but cannot form words.She has frequent inappropriate laughter and seldom cries with pain.She is extremely bright and has great problem solving skills, but because she cannot communicate she scores at a 6-8 month level on cognitive tests.She is very strong but has had problems either with supporting her wieght or with balance and continues to walk with a gait. She has a happy disposition and loves to be around other people but usually has little innterest in playing with them directly. She has problems with biting and scratching. She has been tested for genetic disorders and all tests were returned as normal. She has had an MRI scan and it also was said to be normal. Her enzymes were tested afterwards and they were also normal. The Vanderbilt Child Development Center has given up on finding the cause of her delays and referred her to a geneticist who woks with  Lebonner Childrens Hospital.Any ideas or possibile tests would be appreciated. <br>: Thank You.<br>****Sorry but the e-mail address on the other posting was incorrect.

I have been in contact with a family from Hornell, NY.  The mother is a single mother with two adolescent daughters.  One of the daughters has a developmental diability.  She had been enrolled in a BOCES program, which recently discontinued services to her.  As a result the 15 yr. is now placed in the local high school.  She has endured many traumatic experiences and now exhibits behavioral concerns.<p>I am searching for anyone involved in this field within the vicinity of this family that I may exchange information and consequently allow this family the services they so desperately need.<p>Currently, the daughter has not, nor has she ever, been involved in the OMRDD system.<p>Thank you.

Posted by <a href="mailto:sallyday@execpc.com">Sally Day</a> on February 14, 1997 at 10:26:10:<p>
I am an attorney in Milwaukee who is representing a mother.  State wants to terminate her rights so youngest children can be adopted, based on her inability to care for them.  Under WI law, state can terminate if mother cannot show she can provide adequate home after two years.  No exceptions for developmentally disabled.  Her evaluations over the years show consistent 60 IQ.  She can never cope with six kids without considerable help she cannot afford and is not available to her.  I am trying to carve out exception for her and other parents in her predicament, so that she can continue to have contact with the children.  She sees them often, they say they like to see her and want to see their other siblings at her house for birthdays, holidays, etc.  SHe has never abused them.  Isn't this a crime??<br>Does anyone have any experience or any ideas to help me represent her?<br>The trial is in three weeks.<br>Thanks a million.  Sally Day.

My name is Susan Bert and I am researching college programs for a high school senior interested in continuing her education. She will receive her high school diploma in June. She also has Down Syndrome. She has expressed an interest in going away to college and taking classes along with learning how to live more independently. She is interested in working with young children (possibly as a career path). Do you know of any good college programs that include students with disabilities who have been able to receive a high school diploma but need additional support in the areas of independent living, academic tutoring and career development? I am interested in learning about any programs that may have all or some of these characteristics. I am writing you from Oregon but opportunities from any region or country would be appreciated. Please send replies to me directly at: SMBERT95@aol.com. Thank you.

Arkansas residents:  We're taking applications for admission to residential school for severely handicapped and medically fragile children.  We are a pediatric facility, and admit young children only. Unfortunately, we do not take care of vent-dependent patients, but do take children with trachs and/or gastrostomies. E-mail me if you'd like an application.  Susan: swlms@ipa.net<br>

: Arkansas residents:  We're taking applications for admission to residential school for severely handicapped and medically fragile children.  We are a pediatric facility, and admit young children only. Unfortunately, we do not take care of vent-dependent patients, but do take children with trachs and/or gastrostomies. E-mail me if you'd like an application.  Susan: swlms@ipa.net

On Sept.11 ,1995 I lost my son at St. Joseph's Treatment Center in Dayton, Ohio. He was an Epileptic and severly ADHD. I thought I had finally found the place that would help him and when I placed him into someone else's hands they let him die from total negligence and not caring. I had no time for goodbyes. They have covered up his death and I did not even recieve a formal apology. How cruel!! I my son would have recieved the proper Medical attention that was his right to recieve, my son would be home today. My son fell between the cracks and no one cares. To them he is just a statistic, another number in their books. I have been trying desperatly to find someone who can help me bring this to National attention so I can expose what happened to my precious child. He did not deserve to die this way. He wanted to get the help he needed and just come home to live a normal and happy life, like every other normal child. All Shawn ever wanted was just to be normal, like all the other little children in this country. Only because I wasn't on Welfare or a Millionaire I could not afford 300.00 dollars aday that it would take to provide help for my son. And, finally, after three years of searching I finally thought I had found the place that would help him. But instead, he lost his life with them. I kept him safe and well. Why couldn't they do the same?<br>If I have only one more breath in this body left. I will never stop until I find out the truth about what happened to my son that night. Why didn't he recieve the help, why didn't they get him help, why, why, why?? Only God knows, Shawn, the nurse that was suspose to take care of him, and the counselor knows. Why can't they be human enough to tell the truth? Please, if there is anyone out there that can help me please in God's name let me know. The pain and greif will always be there until I find out something. I cannot come to closure until I find out how Shawn died and why. God Bless You!! Please answer my prayer.<br>                     <p>                                                                                                        Victoria Davis<br>                                                                                                        vdavis@fuse.net

I hope you find the answers you need - your story and the lives of people I have met living in institutions over here in Australia make me tatally convinced that congregate care settings are deadly places for vulnerable people to be.

Dear folks,<br>I am a grad student at Springfield College (MA) who is interested in designing virtual classroom programs as a flexible modality for the effective training of direct care staff.<p>Does anyone have any experience with this?  I would be interested in hearing from agency people who may be intrigued by the idea (or appauled).  I am also intested in your thoughts on the effeciency of having training on-line or available in CD-ROM.  Are you a staff person who never has an open schedule when the regional training center is offering a topic of interest to you?  What do you think of interactive computer training?  Does anyone know if anyone else is doing it?<p>I will be intested in any an all comments.<br>Thanks<br>Catherine

Hi Cheryl.  I too have dealt with this issue for<br> more than 12 years now.  My first question is <br>"What's wrong with checkers?"  As an administrator<br>/trainer, I encourage staff to assist the folks <br>they work with to broaden their horizons.  Often,<p> consumers choose Barney because it's all <br> they've been exposed to.  Assisting people with <br>disabilities however, means assisting them to make<br> choices.  Many choices made are not ones we<br> would agree with but they're not our choices.  <br>I try to limit age inappropriate activities in<br> the community (sitting on Santa's lap in the <br>mall) because of the stigma the folks already<br> face. But once we have offered "age appropriate<br> activities" and they want to watch cartoons in <br>their own home, that's fine.

 Does anyone have any suggestions for a very active little 6 year old boy other than the Ritilan route?  I am currently giving an herb called Calms Forte.  It helps some, but not enough.  I would like some natural products, not drugs.

: :  Does anyone have any suggestions for a very active little 6 year old boy other than the Ritilan route?  I am currently giving an herb called Calms Forte.  It helps some, but not enough.  I would like some natural products, not drugs.

I too have a duaghter with microcephally.  She is only 17 months old.  She has not learned how to crawl although in the last couple of days she has been very successful at doing a soldiers crawl across the room.  She can sit up and is very social.  She will begin her therapies next week so we are very excited.  What I would like to know is what other parents have experienced.  I know no two cases are alike but it is helpful to hear from others.  You are welcome to write me via e-mail.%0

<br>: : Seeking positive information into treatments in regards to said subject.

I use a variety of augmentative and alternative communication systems for children (with deafness and severe cognitive impairment). E-mail me at JoyceAZ@aol.com for comments about my experiences and opinions.  I use low-tech communication boards, photo and line-drawing schedule and choice books and sign language plus high-tech systems like Blackhawk.

: I use a variety of augmentative and alternative communication systems for children (with deafness and severe cognitive impairment). E-mail me at JoyceAZ@aol.com for comments about my experiences and opinions.  I use low-tech communication boards, photo and line-drawing schedule and choice books and sign language plus high-tech systems like Blackhawk.

I read a poem in a Dear Abby or Ann Landers column back in 1989 about having a child with Down's Syndrome. It likened it to planning a trip to France but accidently getting on the wrong plane and landing in Holland. I had just had a Special Needs child and this poem really helped me focus on the positive. I have since lost the poem, does anyone have it? If so, please post or send it directly to me. Thanks - Rebecca

: : I read a poem in a Dear Abby or Ann Landers column back in 1989 about having a child with Down's Syndrome. It likened it to planning a trip to France but accidently getting on the wrong plane and landing in Holland.  Thanks. Rebecca

: Rebecca,

: This story was passed along to me by another student, but the copy I have has a head on the top indicating the story came from COMMUNICATION METHODOLOGY TOPICS.  This is probably a magazine or journal.  It inidicates that it was written by Emily Perl Kingsley, 1987.  I've included all this in case you, or anyone else, wanted to research it further.

: On the copy I have, the author starts by saying, &quot;I am often asked to describe the experience of raising a child with a disability - to try to help people who have not shared that unique experience to understand it, to imagine how it would feel.  It's like this...&quot;

: WELCOME TO HOLLAND!

: When you're going to have a baby, it's like you're planning a fabulous vacation trip - to Italy.  You buy a bunch of guide books and make your wonderful plans.  The Coliseum.  The Michelangelo David.  The gondolas in Venice.  You may learn some handy phrases in Italian.  It's all very exciting.

: After months of eager anticipation, the day finally arrives.  You pack your bags and off you go.  Several hours later, the plane lands.  The flight attendant comes in and says, &quot;Welcome to Holland.&quot;

: &quot;Holland?!&quot; you say.  &quot;What do you mean, Holland??  I signed up for Italy!  I'm supposed to be in Italy.  All my life I've dreamed of going to Italy.&quot;

: But there's been a change in the flight plan.  They've landed in Holland and there you must stay.

: The important thing is that they haven't taken you to a horrible, disgusting, filthy place, full of pestilence, famine, and disease.  It's just a different place.

: So you must go out and buy new guide books.  And you must learn a whole new language.  And you will meet a whole new group of people you would never have met.

: It's just a &quot;different&quot; place.  It's slower paced than Italy, less flashy than Italy.  But after you've been there for a while and you catch your breath, you look around . . . and you begin to notice that Holland has windmills . . . and Holland has tulips.  Holland even has Rembrandts.

In the prison facility at which I work, I feel that many individuals are inaccurately identified as MR. Often, this diagnosis is applied based simply on the findings of the BETA or WIAS-R instruments. In addition, adaptibe behavior can only be assessed in terms of the individual's functioning within our system - which is more often than not antisocial, and antisocial behavior generally has a very adaptive quality. Hence, there is often confusion as to who is MR and who is not. We use an "adaptive behavior checklist" that does not seem very useful as an assessment tool.<br>I would like information on mental retardation and antisocial acts; mentally retarded individuals in the prison setting; and any instruments which are effective in addressing adaptive behavior.

My 2 1/2 year old daughter has been diagnosed with developmental delays from unknown origin. She has extreme global delays, can not talk, and walks with a gait. She has been tested by Vanderbilt University and her exact diagnosis remains unknown. Please respond if you have any possible diagnosis with similar symptoms.<br>Thank You.

I work at a residential school for children.  We have a young boy who has such a severe degree of spastic quadriplegia that we can't bend his arms and legs enough to dress him in regular clothing.  (He is under the care of several medical specialists, including orthopedists, as well as physical and occupational therapists.)  Does anyone know of a source for purchasing clothing in sizes 4T, 4R, or 5?  We have seen cataglogs with modified clothing for adults, but not for young children.  If anyone has any ideas, please e-mail me at swlms@ipa.net, or write to Brownwood Life Care Center, 2121 Towson, Fort Smith, AR  72901.  Thanks for the help!

The reason you have not found much on this population is because there is not much to be found!  The issue of people with mental retardation in the criminal justice system (whether adults or juveniles) receives little attention or priority.  There is an extreme need for research on programs for people with mental retardation.  Regarding juveniles, national figures for the number of disabled juveniles in adult prisons are unavailable,  which makes it difficult that such rehabilitation programs are needed.  But they are.  According to U.S. Office of Special Education Programs, a quarter of inmates in juvenile correctional facilities are disabled.  Learning disabilities and serious emotional disturbances are the most common problems.  However few state jails/prisons or probation/parole programs offer any specific services needed by juveniles with mental retardation.  You may be on the right track regarding social skills training.  According to an article by authors in Finland titled, "Juvenile Delinquency, Education, and Mental Disability," the social problems of families with juveniles with mental disabilities seemed to have a greater impact on the person getting involved with the criminal justice system than did the variable of having a mental disability. (Article is in Exceptional Children, (1994) Vol. 61, No.3, pp.230-241).  <p>There is a program for adults and juveniles with mental retardation that has a 10-year recidivism rate of 5%.  The Lancaster County Office of Special Offenders offers individual treatment and training for juveniles.  For more information you can contact Mr. Wayne Geltz at: (717) 299-8184.  <p>The Arc also has a national resource list of model programs and other materials relating to the issue of people with mental retardation in the criminal justice system.  It is available via our homepage... look under Research and Program Services, then click on "Access To Justice" project.  The Lancaster County program is also listed along with a brief description.<p><p><br>

Please feel free to e-mail me<br>: at Ibejavaman@prodigy.net. <p>I work at a residential school for children and young adults with severe handicaps.  I don't think you're at all "bad" to be thinking about a group home for your daughter.  Caring for children with severe health or behavior problems can be exhausting for even the most well-trained professional or loving parent.  I don't know what state you're from, but in Arkansas there are few resources, such as respite care, for parents to draw on.  At least those of us who are paid to work with children who are disabled get to go home after an 8-hour shift, and recharge before going back to work.  Start hunting for a placement you can live with NOW.  It often takes a long time before you find a place that suits both parent and child, and oftentimes, there's a long, long waiting list.  Good luck!<br>

: : : I have a 16 yr old daughter with MR. I would like to knos
: : : what is a good age to see about placing her in a group 
: : : home. I know its bad to be thinking about this, but her
: : : behaviours are getting so bad I don't know how much longer
: : : I can care for her.

: : Would you like to chat about this more? I am a special educator
: : for the mentally impaired and have taught this age
: : group for 5 years.  A group home is a natural progression in
: : caring for a mentaly challenged younster.  Please feel free to e-mail me
: : at Ibejavaman@prodigy.net. 

: I work at a residential school for children and young adults with severe handicaps.  I don't think you're at all &quot;bad&quot; to be thinking about a group home for your daughter.  Caring for children with severe health or behavior problems can be exhausting for even the most well-trained professional or loving parent.  I don't know what state you're from, but in Arkansas there are few resources, such as respite care, for parents to draw on.  At least those of us who are paid to work with children who are disabled get to go home after an 8-hour shift, and recharge before going back to work.  Start hunting for a placement you can live with NOW.  It often takes a long time before you find a place that suits both parent and child, and oftentimes, there's a long, long waiting list.  Good luck!

I need help from anyone who has known older children with "Kabuki makeup" syndrome: I'm trying to sort out the pattern of their language development. The only thing the papers tell me is that this group of children have an average IQ of 60! I'm more interested in how much these children can understand of everyday language, at what age do they learn to read, talk in sentences....do they find signing or other alternatives to speech useful?...any information would be very gratefully received.

I need help from anyone who has known older children with "Kabuki makeup" syndrome: I'm trying to sort out the pattern of their language development. The only thing the papers tell me is that this group of children have an average IQ of 60! I'm more interested in how much these children can understand of everyday language, at what age do they learn to read, talk in sentences....do they find signing or other alternatives to speech useful?...any information would be very gratefully received. With good wishes from (cold and damp) London..KtP

My daughter will enter 1st grade next year and we would like her to attend the same school that her sisters did which happens to be the same school where she has received integrated preschool-k services. We would have to "open" enroll her because it is not her home school. The prinipal tells me that it is policy that schools will not accept students with IEP's for open enrollment because they are a strain on the school. Guidence team is suggesting "centered" education, which means contained classroom with occaisional integration. I need to know if I stand a chance legally before I start this battle>

You have a strong argument in favor of having your children together at the same school.  You don't mention your daughter's diagnosis, however you should consider obtaining an objective evaluation -- not one done by your school system.  We've found that an outside, third party opinion (including an IEP) keeps both the school (and us) on the right track and the best interests of our daughter in the forefront.  Perhaps your child could be included by having a full-time aide.  Again, so much depends on what will work best for her, but don't hesitate to be creative.  Talk with other parents, too.  Good luck negotiating the least restrictive setting for her.
