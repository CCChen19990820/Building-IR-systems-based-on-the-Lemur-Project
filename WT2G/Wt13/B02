<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Natural Dying</H1>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER><I>by Paula Hendrick</I></H4>

<P><BR>
</P>

<P>Death. In death, as in birth, we touch the mystery of life. Where do
we come from - and where do we go? And who and what are we, really, while
we're here?</P>

<P>When we look ahead to our death, our thoughts reflect back to us, in
living color, Life. The universe, through eons of evolution, has brought
into being this world, these creatures, this particular person, for an allotment
of one lifetime.</P>

<P>Considering the magnificence of life, that allotment may seem all too
short. We may, with Dylan Thomas, &quot;rage against the dying of the light.&quot;
Yet, at the same time, nothing is more natural than death. As Ernest Morgan
reminds us in his gentle book, <I>Dealing Creatively with Death</I>:</P>

<P>Humankind is part of the ongoing community of nature, on a world scale,
subject to the same cycle of birth and death which governs all other creatures
and, like them, totally dependent on other life. Sometimes, in our high-rise
apartments, our manicured suburbs and our chromium-plated institutions we
tend to forget this.</P>

<P>Our need is not to reject nature but to live in harmony with it. This
does not mean rejecting our technology, but it does mean controlling our
numbers, quieting our egos, and simplifying lifestyles.</P>

<P>In the world of nature, death provides a service because it makes room
in an ecological niche for a young one. People are part of nature, too,
and when people die, they make room for more people. In a time of population
explosion, it would be useful to be able to die without making too much
of a fuss about it. But we humans, particularly in the affluent cultures
of the first world, face the final journey of life with a load of weighty
baggage. We avoid talk of death, and we dread the realities of the aging
process.</P>

<P>We as individuals don't necessarily create and lug around this excess
baggage on our own. Something pervasive in our society molds our collective
choices. Michael Ignatieff, writing in <I>The New Republic</I>, offers this
explanation: &quot;Cultures that live by the values of self-realization
and self-mastery are not especially good at dying, at submitting to those
experiences where freedom ends and biological fate begins. Why should they
be? Their strong side is Promethean ambition: the defiance and transcendence
of fate, the material and social limit. Their weak side is submitting to
the inevitable.&quot;</P>

<P>This ambition of ours has borne fruit. Life expectancy has indeed increased.
We can expect to live almost twice as long now as in the mid-1800s. Researchers
now claim to be moving rapidly toward more extreme life extension - and
even reversal of the aging process - through the use of human growth hormone.
In tests conducted at Veterans Administration hospitals, elderly recipients
of the experimental drugs have indeed become, by self-report and physical
tests, many years &quot;younger.&quot; What kind of sense does this &quot;progress&quot;
make, considering the impact of population on a finite planet? Fear seems
to be the primary motivator. One prominent researcher in the field admits,
&quot;I'm 65 and trying to save my ass.&quot;</P>

<P>In addition to the experimental leading edge of life extension, the ordinary,
every day custom of keeping more people alive longer, through ever more
costly medical interventions, persists. As medical ethicist Daniel Callahan
writes about life, &quot;The more we get, the more we want.&quot; The result
is that more and more, old age is about illness, about surviving on a practical
level with multiple disabilities, about living with a sense of vulnerability.</P>

<P>We have become victims of the health care system that our cultural values
have created. The dying process has been transformed into a series of wrenching
choices. A 94-year-old man who still &quot;has his faculties&quot; goes
into heart failure. He has lived a long life, a good life. Perhaps with
a trip to the hospital he can have a couple more good years. He just isn't
ready to die. So to the hospital he goes and, a few days later, into the
nursing home. Three weeks after the first episode, he's back into the hospital;
the next day he's dead. The cost? A miserable, prolonged dying for him,
distress for his niece and nephew, bills adding up to tens of thousands
of dollars. A woman, getting along pretty well after a stroke at age 80
- some confusion, but lots of independence and zest for life - develops
increasing heart problems. She has no family support, just a few friends
who do the best they can. The doctor recommends a pacemaker. She says no
but he persuades her. There are complications during surgery. Now she's
totally disoriented and can barely walk even with assistance. Her pacemaker
keeps her going.</P>

<P>Out of the apparently needless suffering of countless people has grown
a strong movement toward patients' rights and natural death - that is, death
with a minimum of medical intervention. Advances are continually - albeit
slowly - being made in legislation and public education. The Patient Self-Determination
Act, which went into effect in December, 1991, requires health care facilities
to inform patients of their rights to refuse treatment and to formulate
advance directives such as a living will or health care proxy. Difficult
moral dilemmas are also being debated on the topic of &quot;aid-in-dying,&quot;
or physician-assisted suicide. The goals of the broader &quot;natural death
movement&quot; are to guarantee choice for individuals and to bring about
a large-scale cultural shift. An article in <I>The Economist </I>of London
describes such a large scale shift this way: &quot;To civilize death, to
bring it home and make it no longer a source of dread, is one of the great
challenges of the age . . . Gradually, dying may come to hold again the
place it used to occupy in the midst of life: not a terror but a mystery
so deep that man would no more wish to cheat himself of it than to cheat
himself of life.&quot;</P>

<P>People of other cultures have a lot to teach those of us who live in
the industrialized North. Elizabeth Beverly writes in <I>Commonweal </I>about
her experiences of death among Mandinka villagers in Senegal. She watched,
and helped as best she could, as fathers and mothers, husbands and wives
sat with the dying - young and old - bathing faces, giving drink.</P>

<P>In Mandinkakangho I can find no word for <I>death</I>, no big sturdy
noun to embody both an instant and a permanent condition. Death slides into
conversation as a verb: someone is dying, someone has died. In this way
the fact of death seems to concern the act of dying. Death is not something
you meet, dying is something you do. Each individual is the literal agent
of his or her demise. That act is always a mystery for those of us who have
not yet &quot;done&quot; it. Always a mystery for the living.</P>

<P>One must try to heal, but one must also hold; over the years, this is
what I have learned about dying. . . . The last Mandinka child I held unto
death was probably dying of meningitis; Vie wanted me to cradle his head
in my lap. As I supported him so, and rubbed his silky back, I thought of
my mother and the story she had told me of her mother's long illness. How
my mother filed her dying mother's fingernails, trimmed the cuticles just
so, buffed the nails to a high sheen. How her mother smiled at her pleasure,
and in pain.</P>

<P>My grandmother was dying, and my mother was helping her. They both were
using this &quot;dying time&quot; the best way they could.</P>

<P>Death happens to us, but dying is something we do. Death is a biological
event, a moment in time, almost always painless. Dying most often extends
through time, encompassing sensation, emotion, and process - and sometimes
great pain. But dying is an opportunity unlike any other which life provides.
Ken Wilbur's story of his wife Treya's dying time and his participation
in that process, told in his book<I> Grace and Grit</I>,<I> </I>is a magnificent
testament to the opportunity hidden within death.</P>

<P>At dying time we take a deeper look at what death represents to us. According
to Robert J. Lifton, humans have a basic need to feel a sense of continuity
and connection with the future - and that need is challenged in this time
of uncertainty about the outcome of the human experiment on the planet.
Will we indeed live on through our children - our own, or others to whom
we offer guidance and love? Will our contributions to the greater good survive?
Do we have, through either faith or experience, a belief in the existence
of a life beyond the body?</P>

<P>For many, near-death experiences offer hope for the existence of life
after death and for reconciliation with deceased loved ones. Timothy Ferris,
writing in<I> The New York Times Magazine</I>, acknowledges that near-death
experiences are often times of illumination and ecstasy. While these experiences
may well reveal something about life after death - or about a life happening
concurrently with physical life that we are only dimly aware of - Ferris
believes that the teaching they offer is that the physical act of dying
itself is a positive experience. And nature may have set it up that way.
Death is painless - in fact, possibly downright pleasant - because it serves
the species. Ferris quotes Lewis Thomas, who wrote in his book <I>The Medusa
and the Snail</I>, &quot;If I had to design an ecosystem in which creatures
had to live off each other and in which dying was an indispensable part
of living, I could not think of a better way to manage.&quot;</P>

<P>Ferris takes his thesis a step further. He suggests that our sense of
resonance with the larger whole at the time of death may be a sign of our
resonance with the cosmos, possibly revealing our place in the web of life
that stretches back to the beginning of the universe.</P>

<P>Considering the discoveries of modern physics, Ferris may be right. But
can we, in our own small lives, accept the naturalness of death? Can we
look forward to our own dying - that moment when we make room in our ecological
niche for a young one - with a sense of rightness and peace? It helps to
know two things. First, that we have lived life fully, no matter how long
or short our life has been. Second, that when we go, we are passing something
on to others.</P>

<P>In <I>Grace and Grit</I>, during Treya's dying, she kept asking her husband
Ken, &quot;You'll find me?&quot; He promised that he would. After her death,
he reflects,</P>

<P>I don't think any of us will ever meet Treya again. I don't think it
works that way. That's much too concrete and literal. Rather, it is my own
deepest feeling that every time you and I - and any who knew her - that
every time we act from a position of integrity, and honesty, and strength,
and compassion: every time we do that, now and forever, we unmistakenly
meet again the mind and soul of Treya.</P>

<P>So my promise to Treya - the only promise that she made me repeat over
and over - my promise that I would find her again really meant that I had
promised to find my own enlightened Heart.</P>

<P>Death is simple. Dying may or may not be. Being with someone during their
&quot;dying time&quot; deepens our sense of the miracle of living. Out of
the encounter with death, we are pushed to choose life.</P>

Beyond the Merely Meatless</H3>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Seven Steps Toward Ecological Eating</H1>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER><I>by Don Matesz</I></H4>

<P><BR>
</P>

<P><I>The environmental ravages of factory farming and meat-based diets
have had increasing exposure. John Robbins' 1987 book on the subject, </I>Diet
for a New America, <I>was a best-seller. Then Alan Durning accorded the
same facts the full authority of Worldwatch Institute (</I>World*Watch,<I>
May/June 1991).</I></P>

<P><I>The fact of livestock's resource gluttony has led many to eschew animal
foods. But it's not that simple. Strictly from the point of view of resource
costs, it may be more environmentally sound to raise, and eat, chickens
than to drink orange juice or eat fried hash browns.</I></P>

<P><I>The subject of diet could hardly be more personal. Many who choose
not to eat foods directly derived from animals cite sympathy for the critters
involved, and perhaps their own spiritual well-being, as often as they do
long-term sustainability. Furthermore, what's true for a North American
may not apply to a Trobriand Islander nor an Inuit. In addition, not everyone
agrees on precisely what foods, or what combination of foods, promotes optimal
health. Neither is there clear consensus about which ones are actually terrible
for you!</I></P>

<P><I>Despite all this uncertainty, a lot is said about food choices, and
most of it fails to address the complexity of the issues involved. We were
glad to learn IC</I> <I>reader Don Matesz has grappled with the question
of sustainable diet and come up with the following provocative set of answers.
He'll send more information to readers who mail an SASE to Center for a
Sustainable Diet, 4422 Thackeray Place NE, Seattle, WA 98105. </I></P>

<P>We each consume roughly half a ton of our environment in the course of
a year. At this rate, it's easy to see why no other single activity in which
we regularly engage has as much ecological importance as our way of eating.</P>

<P>A diet that's sustainable for people and planet must consider not only
one's individual health, but agriculture (the well-being of the land), energy
(minimizing waste and pollution), and the health of other people - those
in one's own community and those inhabiting Earth's many other bioregions.
The following seven points provide an introduction to the essentials:<B></B></P>

<P><B>1. Choose whole - unground, uncracked, unprocessed - cereal grains
as your staple food, forming 50-60% (by volume) of your diet.</B> Whole
grains are the most nutritionally balanced and easily digested single food,
containing plenty of complex carbohydrates, and sufficient and high quality
protein and fat. They provide the most useable calories per acre of land
of any food: two adults can be fed for a year on 1/8 to 1/4 of an acre devoted
to cereal grain production. Grains, though they require cooking, don't require
energy-intensive preservation technologies like refrigeration. Ideally,
they need only be dried in the fields. Once dried, they succumb minimally
to pests or spoilage, and store in relatively small spaces. <B></B></P>

<P><B>2. Choose fresh, locally grown, seasonal vegetables as your secondary
food - about 25-30% of your diet. </B>A sustainable diet shouldn't include
large volumes of out-of-season, imported and/or artificially preserved vegetables.
Canning, freezing, and long-term refrigeration - even done on a small scale,
at home - are all energy-intensive and fossil-fuel dependent, in contrast
to root cellaring, salt-pickling (as with sauerkraut), and drying. These
latter methods preserve or even increase (as in the case of salt-pickling)
the nutritional value of foods, whereas the others result in significant
nutrient losses.</P>

<P>Buying local produce not only assures you of fresh, nutritious vegetables,
it supports strong local agriculture - a key to bioregional stability and
sustainable culture. Commercial food production in the US depends on a transportation
system which is, in itself, unsustainable, and in an emergency could leave
many northern and eastern regions with very significant shortages of food.</P>

<P>Perhaps the best alternative is growing your own vegetables. A surprising
quantity and variety can be produced in a very small space, and unused vegetable
parts cycle back into your food system as compost. <B></B></P>

<P><B>3. Supplement your grain and vegetable diet with beans and sea vegetables
(at 5% of diet, each), and fish and free range poultry products (about 5%
of diet). </B>Used in small volumes, beans (which are good soil conditioners)
and dried sea vegetables (carefully harvested, from clean waters) enhance
both enjoyment and nutritional benefits of a grain-based diet.</P>

<P>The wisdom of traditional cultures worldwide supports some inclusion
of animal products in the diet. If left to range freely, poultry can be
an eminently ecological aspect of sustainable, small-scale, grain-and-vegetable
agriculture: they provide pest control and manure, and their meat and eggs
can be nutritionally valuable in small portions. Fish and other aquatic
creatures, when harvested from clean waters in small quantities (for minimal
ecological impact), or raised in ponds, can also be nutritionally beneficial,
and their inedible portions are valuable fertilizers for your garden. <B></B></P>

<P><B>4. Keep nut, fruit, and fruit juice consumption - especially consumption
of imported tropical nuts, fruits and juices - to a minimum. </B>Fruits
and nuts are very fragile crops and usually require artificial irrigation
and pesticides when grown commercially. They spoil easily, so losses are
large, even with the support of energy-intensive preservation methods.</P>

<P>When imported from the tropics, fruits and nuts are very expensive in
terms of energy costs. And we do a serious disservice to peoples in the
tropics when we encourage them to supply these foods (and coffee and other
stimulants) for our extravagant dietary habits. The result is that they,
too, must import expensive, less-than-fresh foods.</P>

<P>As for juices, they are a wasteful food: it takes 6-8 apples to make
one 10-ounce glass of apple juice. Even if you compost the pulp, drinking
large amounts of juice is, from an ecological standpoint, not that different
from feeding cattle 5 to 10 times more calories in grain than is converted
to edible flesh.</P>

<P>On the other hand, if you have a peach tree and it's bearing fruit, the
sustainable thing to do is eat the peaches, and be sure to share them with
friends! Of course your home-grown fruits may be sun-dried to extend the
length of their &quot;season,&quot; and bruised fruits can be juiced. <B></B></P>

<P><B>5. Eliminate or limit consumption of refined foods, including vegetable
oils. </B>Refining of foods (brown rice into white rice, seeds into oil,
carrots into juice) is wasteful and generally requires fossil-fuel intensive
technologies. It takes nearly one and one half pounds of whole kernel wheat
to produce one pound of refined white wheat flour. It takes 30 feet of sugarcane
(and <I>lots </I>of water) for one tablespoon of white sugar.</P>

<P>Production of vegetable oils is extremely land-intensive and energy-costly.
It is very easy to consume in one meal the amount of corn oil extracted
from ten ears. Aside from the tremendous energy requirements of oil processing,
if you don't relish the thought of most of the rest of the corn or other
seed going to commercial animal feed, you should go easy on the oil.</P>

<P>Unrefined foods simply have greater nutritional value, and thus do more
with less - a basic tenet of sustainablity. <B></B></P>

<P><B>6. Buy foods in bulk, not in small packages. </B>Boxes, cans, jars
and bags are, without exception, environmentally costly, even if we recycle
them. The choice to shift one's diet primarily to whole grains makes it
easy to very significantly reduce the cardboard, metal, glass and plastic
you haul around. <B></B></P>

<P><B>7. Cook your food over an alcohol or natural gas stove, not on an
electric stove. </B>At best, electrical appliances add to demand for centralized
energy distribution, i.e., energy- and materials-costly power plants. At
worst, this extra demand helps justify investment in nuclear plants.</P>

<P>And cook your food so that it tastes good! There are many fresh and dried
herbs and seeds, and other natural condiments, that make this easy. Sustainability
is not about deprivation; it's about humane solutions that are liveable
now and into the future.</P>

<P>The journey to a sustainable culture may look long, but these seven steps
will help set us well on the way. Continuing as we are, &quot;against the
grain,&quot; we're likely to end up where we're headed - hungry! On the
other hand, if we go &quot;with the grain,&quot; we'll benefit our own health,
our Earth, and our fellow beings, human and animal alike.</P>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Growing Your Own</H1>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER><I>by Carla Cole</I></H4>

<P><BR>
</P>

<P>A new book on gardening, <I>Greening the Garden, A Guide to Sustainable
Growing</I>, lives up to the promise of its publishers, Christopher and
Judith Plant: &quot;It transforms gardening into an act of personal, political
significance.&quot;</P>

<P>Dan Jason, its author, is inspirational about returning agricul-ture
to the graceful and harmonious activity it can be. He makes a staunch defense
of (certain) weeds, makes it clear that efforts (virtually <I>any </I>efforts)
at composting will succeed, lets you know about nutritious and medicinal
plants that require almost no further help from you at all, once introduced,
and generally evokes faith in our ability to regain control over our lives.</P>

<P>&quot;If, in our daily actions, each of us takes the environment fully
into account, sustainability can become a reality. What this requires is
a new way of thinking about our relationship to nature. To be truly nourished
by our gardens' abundance requires circular, rather than linear, movement:
an attitude of taking and giving inspired by the delicate balance in which
all the planet's systems and lifeforms coexist... In such a context, one

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Subscription Squash,<BR>
And Celery, And Spinach, Etc.</H1>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER><I>by Preston Stern</I></H4>

<P><BR>
</P>

<P>Community Supported Agriculture projects ensure income for farmers and
a healthy supply of fresh, robust, locally grown food - at reasonable cost
- for their members. These subscription garden projects are a growing international
movement that is recovering a lost tradition of relationship between those
who work the land and the rest of us who depend on the products of their
skill. This arrangement fosters respect and caring for agriculture and agricultural
land, and provides participants a new sense of connectedness to the land
that nourishes them and their families.</P>

<P>The principle behind CSA is simple - share the risks as well as the bounty.
In a CSA garden, shareholders pay for their portion of the harvest before
most of the seeds are even planted, and the farmer is able to count on a
salary.</P>

<P>This is how it works: project organizers draw up a garden budget. Probable
yield for the site is estimated; the costs for seed, supplies, and other
expenses, including a fair living wage for the farmer, are figured. Then
the number of shares to be sold, at a price to meet the budget needs, is
calculated.</P>

<P>Shares are marketed by prospectus, to inform potential members of the
crops planned and the expected time of harvest for each. Local variations
are significant, of course, but a typical garden may distribute fresh organically
grown produce to its supporters once a week from May to October, and root
crops once a month November to March. For an average project, one share
can provide about half the weekly food requirements for a family of four,
eating a basically vegetarian diet, at a cost of about $350.</P>

<P>The CSA movement was born in Europe and Japan about twenty-five years
ago. Original organizers were mothers responsible for feeding families.
It was they who first sought out growers committed to ecologically sound
practices and proposed a plan that became Community Supported Agriculture.</P>

<P>The movement got going in the United States when Robyn Van En, an organic
market gardener in the Berkshire Region of Massachusetts met Jan Vander
Tuin, an American farmer who had spent three years in Europe studying CSA.
They began the first CSA project in America at Robyn's Indian Line Farm
in 1986. They modeled it after Topinambur, a project Jan had helped found
in Zurich, Switzerland, that produces vegetables for about 400 people and
milk and eggs for about 600.</P>

<P>Now, six years later, Van En has organized Community Supported Agriculture
of North America (CSANA), which is an educational non-profit clearinghouse
to help support the exploding interest in CSA. There are now over 200 projects
in the US and hundreds more around the world. They come in a range of sizes:
from the largest, in Japan, which employs four farmers and feeds a thousand
families; to the smallest, in Pennsylvania, managed by one person and a
rototiller, providing for twelve families on a half-acre plot.</P>

<P>Though there are bound to be challenges when starting up a new project,
marketing the shares has generally been easy. Sometimes organic markets,
food co-ops and restaurants buy shares. Local businesses or Chambers of
Commerce may support a project by purchasing shares for a local food bank.
For many CSA projects, expansion beyond their own garden comes naturally.
Often other local farmers are drawn into the network to provide meat, poultry,
eggs, or dairy products.</P>

<P>Producers and consumers both have found that CSA provides the best of
both worlds - inexpensive, high quality food, locally grown, without unsustainable
social and environmental costs. The list of benefits seems endless. While
25% of food produced in America never makes it to a consumer, there is no
spoilage in CSA. Packaging is virtually eliminated, and distribution costs
are kept to a minimum. Growers are freed from monocrop farming. Perhaps
best of all, it is fun! Sharing common concerns for good food, sensible
land stewardship and social justice brings people together from all ages
and walks of life.</P>

<P>CSANA has produced a handbook, <I>Basic Formula to Create Community Supported
Agriculture</I>, with pointers to help fledgling projects get off the ground.
Taking examples and case stories from successful gardens, it offers tips
on planning, distribution, and marketing, and is available, for $10, from
CSANA, Indian Line Farm, RR 3, Box 85, Great Barrington, MA 01230. </P>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Eco-housing Resources</H1>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER><I>by Carla Cole</I></H4>

<P><I></I>&nbsp;</P>

<P><I>We found recent reports of low housing starts in the US rather more
promising than distressing. Given the state of our old-growth forests here
in North America, and given the many stories of people literally poisoned
by their own homes from building materials employed in the housing industry,
it seems like a good time for us all to take stock of just how we go about
making shelter.</I></P>

<P><I>Below are some information sources for the environmentally-conscientious
home builder or remodeler. We'd be glad to learn of any others you know
about, too:</I></P>

<P><B><I>Guide to Resource Efficient Building Elements</I></B> provides
useful background information on all aspects of building sustainable dwellings,
beginning with foundation systems and structural framing, through roofing,
windows, finish materials, landscape and decking, including recycling on
the job site. This guide is packed with detailed information, including
some comment on the particular products of every company mentioned in its
83 pages. It refers to other sources of information, is printed on recycled
paper, and generally gets a &quot;right on&quot; rating. At $20, this guide
is a bargain and is the best of what we've seen for a first foray into the
arena of eco-building. Contact: Center for Resourceful Building Technology,
Box 3413, Missoula, MT 59806, 406/549-7678.</P>

<P><B><I>Environmental Resource Guide</I></B> is a brand new subscription
project created and supported by the American Institute of Architects (AIA)
Committee on the Environment (COTE), partially funded by the US Environmental
Protection Agency. The guide is set up in a three-ring binder, to accommodate
quarterly augmentations and permit easy updates and revisions.</P>

<P>Intended to be useful to architects and others in the construction industry,
information in the AIA guide relates to the environmental costs of materials
that architects and builders specify, as well as the identification of available
alternatives. Also considered are site design and land use, energy, recy-cling,
and &quot;building ecology&quot; - i.e., healthfulness of the built environ-ment.</P>

<P>This is not a resource guide, per se, although a well-annotated bibliography
of books that list manu-facturers of particular building products will be
included. It <I>is </I>a place to go for clarity about the methodologies
being used to set standards in the field of eco-building. It's expensive:
$125/year for AIA members, $200/year for non-members. Contact: AIA/ERG Project,
1735 New York Ave. NW, Washington, DC 20006, 202/626-7518 or 800/365-ARCH.</P>

<P><B><I>Environmental Outfitters Guidebook</I></B> is in &quot;rough draft&quot;
form until summer of 1992. Like the AIA project, above, it will be available
in 3-ring binders to facilitate updating. This is an ambitious undertaking
by Environmental Outfitters, a mail-order service offering environmentally
responsible and healthy-to-humans building products. It will eventually
consist of 88 categories within 10 sections (from Site and Structure to
Appliances, and from Maintenance to Children's Building Products). Environmental
Outfitters was created by scholar, architect, and carpenter Paul Bierman-Lytle,
who serves on the AIA's COTE (see above), and who continues to discover
and produce products for builders that consider overall environmental impact,
toxicity and health, energy consumption, disposability, durability, performance,
and beauty. This one's really intended for the pros: total cost of the <I>Guidebook</I>,
including 34 binders of product samples, will be approximately $550. The
<I>Guidebook</I> without the sample binders will be available for approximately
$176. Contact: Environmental Outfitters at PO Box 514, New Canaan, CT 06840,
203/966-3541.</P>

<P><B><I>The Pacific Northwest Eco-Building Network Directory </I></B>is
both a regional directory listing dozens of businesses that serve the Northwestern
eco-builder, and a collection of essays on environmental issues associated
with housing. It tends to the &quot;new-agey&quot; (one article concerns
using astrology in siting a dwelling). Type size is miniscule; even so,
the resource listings are less detailed than in the other eco-building resources
reviewed here. Westerners may want to check it out, nonetheless: publisher
Jeff Learned is now forming a West Coast Eco-Building Group that has attracted
a lot of interest. The <I>Directory</I> is $8. Contact: Learned Integrated
Habitats, PO Box 6465, Kent, WA 98064, 206/850-7456.</P>

<P><B><I>1992 Safe Home Resource Guide</I> </B>is a companion to a bi-monthly
periodical, the <B><I>Safe Home Digest</I>.</B> The <I>Resource Guide</I>
offers products that may be good to know about, especially if you suspect
your own home or office of causing mischief: e.g., products include test
kits for lead, mercury, radon, mold and fungi, and volatile organic compounds.
The <I>1992 Guide</I> is $30, the <I>Digest</I> is $5 for a sample issue.
Contact: <I>Safe Home Digest</I>, 24 East Avenue, Suite 1300, New Canaan,

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>About This Issue</H1>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER><I>by Alan AtKisson</I></H4>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>&nbsp;</H4>

<P>There's no use denying it; we live in troubled times. These days the
word &quot;global&quot; is more often attached to a problem than to a piece
of good news: global recession, global poverty, global warming, global ecological
crisis. At the local level, American cities are sending up warning flares,
Eastern Europeans are realizing that freedom and affluence are not a package
deal, and the Earth's poorest people - whether they live in what we call
the &quot;third world,&quot; the &quot;South,&quot; or the &quot;ghetto&quot;
- are getting poorer while watching the very rich get still richer.</P>

<P>Concerned individuals everywhere - from grassroots leaders in Kenya to
middle-class Americans - are calling for change. They may not always know
or agree on what kind of change they want, but much of it is economic: they
sense that business-as-usual is as bankrupt as a scandal-ridden savings
and loan.</P>

<P>This is the backdrop for the growing interest in sustainability, and
in healing the awkward relationship between &quot;environment&quot; and
&quot;development.&quot; The words are in quotes because they have meant
so many things to so many different people that they, like dancers in a
grueling marathon, are nearly exhausted.</P>

<P>&quot;Environment&quot; is what we used to call <I>nature</I>, the great
ordered jumble of life on Earth. &quot;Development&quot; is <I>human progress</I>,
though even that term is now confused with the mere advancement of technology.
The two meet on the dance floor of <I>economics</I>, a dilapidated structure
badly in need of refurbishing.</P>

<P>Their <I>pas de deux</I> has been decidedly ungraceful. The dance floor
is full of holes, and &quot;environment&quot; is staggering. It has been
dragged around relentlessly by its insistent partner, &quot;development,&quot;
who clearly does not know how to dance. &quot;Environment&quot; may soon
collapse, pulling &quot;development&quot; down with it. It may cast off
this dangerous partner, heal its wounds, and go on. Or - and this is our
hope, as well as our task - the potentially graceful body of humanity may
learn in time the steps, rhythms, and playful nuances of this dance.</P>

<P>In this issue we discover that a wide variety of people - ranging from
community activists and environmental scientists to heads of state and Army
generals - are working to promote this more positive outcome. We also look
at the reality, as well as the wisdom, of the physical limits to our economic
growth. And we explore some of the features of <I>sustainable</I> development
- a development that knows the meaning of balance, knows when to lead and
when to follow, and knows how to dance divinely with its partner toward
a greener, and more graceful, future.</P>

<P><I>Special thanks to contributing editor David C. Korten, who served
as chief advisor to us on this issue.</I></P>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Beyond The Limits To Growth</H1>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER><I>by by Donella H. Meadows, Dennis L. Meadows, and J&oslash;rgen
Randers</I></H4>

<P><BR>
<I>&quot;Grow or die,&quot; goes the old economic maxim. But in 1972 a team
of systems scientists and computer modelers challenged conventional wisdom
with a ground-breaking study that warned that there were limits - especially
environmental limits - to how &quot;big&quot; human civilization and its
appetite for resources could get. Beyond a certain point, they said in effect,
the maxim could very well be &quot;grow </I>and <I>die.&quot;</I></P>

<P><I>That same team of researchers (minus one) has just released an historic
update to </I>The Limits to Growth.<I> The new book - </I>Beyond the Limits:
Confronting Global Collapse, Envisioning a Sustainable Future<I> - is instant
must-reading. The authors use updated computer models to present a comprehensive
overview of what's happening to the major systems on planet Earth and to
explore probable futures, from worst- to best-case scenarios. The book is
rigorously scientific, yet very engaging, and it is especially well-suited
to educational settings. We strongly recommend it to our readers, and present
the Preface here.</I></P>

<P><I>Donella H. Meadows is a systems scientist and journalist who teaches
at Dartmouth College, as well as an IN CONTEXT contributing editor. Dennis
L. Meadows is a Professor of Systems Management and directs the Institute
for Policy and Social Science Research at the University of New Hampshire.
J&oslash;rgen Randers, a policy analyst and President Emeritus of the Norwegian
School of Management, is Chairman of the Norwegian Bank for Industry, the
Norwegian Institute for Market Research, and &Aring;ke Larson, AS. The following
is reprinted with permission of Chelsea Green Press. The book can be ordered
from them for $19.95 plus $3 shipping, Route 113, PO Box 130, Post Mills,
VT 05058-0130, Tel. 802/333-9073.</I></P>

<P>Twenty years ago we wrote a book called <I>The Limits to Growth. </I>It
described the prospects for growth in the human population and the global
economy during the coming century. In it we raised questions such as: What
will happen if growth in the world's population continues unchecked? What
will be the environmental consequences if economic growth continues at its
current pace? What can be done to ensure a human economy that provides sufficiently
for all and that also fits within the physical limits of the Earth?</P>

<P>We had been commissioned to examine these questions by The Club of Rome,
an international group of distinguished businessmen, statesmen, and scientists.
They asked us to undertake a two-year study at the Massachusetts Institute
of Technology to investigate the long-term causes and consequences of growth
in population, industrial capital, food production, resource consumption,
and pollution. To keep track of these interacting entities and to project
their possible paths into the future we created a computer model called
World3.</P>

<P>The results of our study were described for the general public in <I>The
Limits to Growth. </I>That book created a furor. The combination of the
computer, MIT, and The Club of Rome pronouncing upon humanity's future had
an irresistible dramatic appeal. Newspaper headlines announced:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>A COMPUTER LOOKS AHEAD AND SHUDDERS</P>
  <P>STUDY SEES DISASTER BY YEAR 2100</P>
  <P>SCIENTISTS WARN OF GLOBAL CATASTROPHE.</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Our book was debated by parliaments and scientific societies. One major
oil company sponsored a series of advertisements criticizing it; another
set up an annual prize for the best studies expanding upon it. <I>The Limits
to Growth </I>inspired some high praise, many thoughtful reviews, and a
flurry of attacks from the left, the right, and the middle of mainstream
economics.</P>

<P>The book was interpreted by many as a prediction of doom, but it was
not a prediction at all. It was not about a preordained future. It was about
a choice. It contained a warning, to be sure, but also a message of promise.
Here are the three summary conclusions we wrote in 1972. The second of them
is the promise, a very optimistic one, but our analysis justified it then
and still justifies it now. Perhaps we should have listed it first.</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>1. If the present growth trends in world population, industrialization,
  pollution, food production, and resource depletion continue unchanged,
  the limits to growth on this planet will be reached sometime within the
  next 100 years. The most probable result will be a sudden and uncontrollable
  decline in both population and industrial capacity.</P>
  <P>2. It is possible to alter these growth trends and to establish a condition
  of ecological and economic stability that is sustainable far into the future.
  The state of global equilibrium could be designed so that the basic material
  needs of each person on earth are satisfied and each person has an equal
  opportunity to realize his or her individual human potential.</P>
  <P>3. If the world's people decide to strive for this second outcome rather
  than the first, the sooner they begin working to attain it, the greater
  will be their chances of success. (Meadows et al., 1972)</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>To us those conclusions spelled out not doom but challenge - how to bring
about a society that is materially sufficient, socially equitable, and ecologically
sustainable, and one that is more satisfying in human terms than the growth-obsessed
society of today.</P>

<P>In one way and another, we've been working on that challenge ever since.
Millions of other people have been working on it too. They've been exploring
energy efficiency and new materials, nonviolent conflict resolution and
grassroots community development, pollution prevention in factories and
recycling in towns, ecological agriculture and international protocols to
protect the ozone layer. Much has happened in twenty years to bring about
technologies, concepts, and institutions that can create a sustainable future.
And much has happened to perpetuate the desperate poverty, the waste of
resources, the accumulation of toxins, and the destruction of nature that
are tearing down the support capacity of the earth.</P>

<P>When we began working on the present book, we simply intended to document
those countervailing trends in order to update <I>The Limits to Growth </I>for
its reissue on its twentieth anniversary. We soon discovered that we had
to do more than that. As we compiled the numbers, reran the computer model,
and reflected on what we had learned over two decades, we realized that
the passage of time and the continuation of many growth trends had brought
the human society to a new position relative to its limits.</P>

<P>In 1971 we concluded that the physical limits to human use of materials
and energy were somewhere decades ahead. In 1991, when we looked again at
the data, the computer model, and our own experience of the world, we realized
that in spite of the world's improved technologies, the greater awareness,
the stronger environment policies, many resource and pollution flows had
grown beyond their sustainable limits.</P>

<P>That conclusion came as a surprise to us, and yet not really a surprise.
In a way we had known it all along. We had seen for ourselves the leveled
forests, the gullies in the croplands, the rivers brown with silt. We knew
the chemistry of the ozone layer and the greenhouse effect. The media had
chronicled the statistics of global fisheries, groundwater drawdowns, and
the extinction of species. We discovered, as we began to talk to colleagues
about the world being &quot;beyond the limits,&quot; that they did not question
that conclusion. We found many places in the literature of the past twenty
years where authors had suggested that resource and pollution flows had
grown too far, some of which we have quoted in [our] book.</P>

<P>But until we started updating <I>The Limits to Growth </I>we had not
let our minds fully absorb the message. The human world is beyond its limits.
The present way of doing things is unsustainable. The future, to be viable
at all, must be one of drawing back, easing down, healing. Poverty cannot
be ended by indefinite material growth; it will have to be addressed while
the material human economy contracts. Like everyone else, we didn't really
want to come to these conclusions.</P>

<P>But the more we compiled the numbers, the more they gave us that message,
loud and clear. With some trepidation we turned to World3, the computer
model that had helped us twenty years before to integrate the global data
and to work through their long-term implications. We were afraid that we
would no longer be able to find in the model any possibility of a believable,
sufficient, sustainable future for all the world's people.</P>

<P>But, as it turned out, we could. World3 showed us that in twenty years
some options for sustainability have narrowed, but others have opened up.
Given some of the technologies and institutions invented over those twenty
years, there are real possibilities for reducing the streams of resources
consumed and pollutants generated by the human economy while increasing
the quality of human life. It is even possible, we concluded, to eliminate
poverty while accommodating the population growth already implicit in present
population age structures - but not if population growth goes on indefinitely,
not if it goes on for long, and not without rapid improvements in the efficiency
of material and energy use and in the equity of material and energy distribution.</P>

<P>As far as we can tell from the global data, from the World3 model, and
from all we have learned in the past twenty years, the three conclusions
we drew in <I>The Limits to Growth </I>are still valid, but they need to
be strengthened. Now we would write them this way:</P>

<P>1. Human use of many essential resources and generation of many kinds
of pollutants have already surpassed rates that are physically sustainable.
Without significant reductions in material and energy flows, there will
be in the coming decades an uncontrolled decline in per capita food output,
energy use, and industrial production.</P>

<P>2. This decline is not inevitable. To avoid it two changes are necessary.
The first is a comprehensive revision of policies and practices that perpetuate
growth in material consumption and in population. The second is a rapid,
drastic increase in the efficiency with which materials and energy are used.</P>

<P>3. A sustainable society is still technically and economically possible.
It could be much more desirable than a society that tries to solve its problems
by constant expansion. The transition to a sustainable society requires
a careful balance between long-term and short-term goals and an emphasis
on sufficiency, equity, and quality of life rather than on quantity of output.
It requires more than productivity and more than technology; it also requires
maturity, compassion, and wisdom.</P>

<P>These conclusions constitute a conditional warning, not a dire prediction.
They offer a living choice, not a death sentence. The choice isn't necessarily
a gloomy one. It does not mean that the poor must be frozen in their poverty
or that the rich must become poor. It could actually mean achieving at last
the goals that humanity has been pursuing in continuous attempts to maintain
physical growth.</P>

<P>We hope the world will make a choice for sustainability. That is why
we have written our book. But we do not minimize the gravity or the difficulty
of that choice. We think a transition to a sustainable world is technically
and economically possible, maybe even easy, but we also know it is psychologically
and politically daunting. So much hope, so many personal identities, so
much of modern industrial culture has been built upon the premise of perpetual
material growth.</P>

<P>A perceptive teacher, watching his students react to the idea that there
are limits, once wrote:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>When most of us are presented with the ultimata of potential disaster,
  when we hear that we &quot;must&quot; choose some form of planned stability,
  when we face the &quot;necessity&quot; of a designed sustainable state,
  we are being bereaved, whether or not we fully realize it. When cast upon
  our own resources in this way we feel, we intuit, a kind of cosmic loneliness
  that we could not have foreseen. We become orphans. We no longer see ourselves
  as children of a cosmic order or the beneficiaries of the historical process.
  Limits to growth denies all that. It tell us, perhaps for the first time
  in our experience, that the only plan must be our own. With one stroke
  it strips us of the assurance offered by past forms of Providence and progress,
  and with another it thrusts into our reluctant hands the responsibility
  for the future. (Vargish, 1980)</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>We went through that entire emotional sequence - grief, loneliness, reluctant
responsibility - when we worked on The Club of Rome project twenty years
ago. Many other people, through many other kinds of formative events, have
gone through a similar sequence. It can be survived. It can even open up
new horizons and suggest exciting futures. Those futures will never come
to be, however, until the world as a whole turns to face them. The ideas
of limits, sustainability, sufficiency, equity, and efficiency are not barriers,
not obstacles, not threats. They are guides to a new world. Sustainability,
not better weapons or struggles for power or material accumulation, is the
ultimate challenge to the energy and creativity of the human race.</P>

<P>We think the human race is up to the challenge. We think that a better
world is possible, and that the acceptance of physical limits is the first
step toward getting there. We see &quot;easing down&quot; from unsustainability
not as a sacrifice, but as an opportunity to stop battering against the
earth's limits and to start transcending self-imposed and unnecessary limits
in human institutions, mindsets, beliefs, and ethics. That is why we finally
decided not just to update and reissue <I>The Limits to Growth, </I>but
to rewrite it completely and to call it <I>Beyond the Limits. </I></P>

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER><A NAME="love&rev"></A>Love And The Revolution</H2>

<P><I>Unlike most scientific books about our relationship to the environment,
</I>Beyond the Limits<I> is willing to break several taboos. For one, it
is willing to be optimistic - to say that it </I>is <I>possible to overcome
the manifold obstacles between here and sustainability. For another, it
is willing to use words like &quot;love&quot; and &quot;revolution,&quot;
meaning by the latter not a violent uprising but an historical transformation,
not unlike that from agricultural to industrial civilization.</I></P>

<P><I>What are the elements of the sustainability revolution? They go beyond
good information, new technologies, democratic participation, and sound
policy. The authors close their book with a description of five &quot;tools&quot;
that are generally not mentioned in most supposedly &quot;serious&quot;
studies of what we must do: visioning, networking, truth-telling, learning,
and - as they explain in this excerpt - loving. </I></P>

<P>One is not allowed in the modern culture to speak about love, except
in the most romantic and trivial sense of the world. Anyone who calls upon
the capacity of people to practice brotherly and sisterly love is more likely
to be ridiculed than to be taken seriously. The deepest difference between
optimists and pessimists is their position in the debate about whether human
beings are able to operate collectively from a basis of love. In a society
that systematically develops in people their individualism, their competitiveness,
and their cynicism, the pessimists are the vast majority.</P>

<P>That pessimism is the single greatest problem of the current social system,
we think, and the deepest cause of unsustainability. A culture that cannot
believe in, discuss, and develop the best human qualities is one that suffers
from a tragic distortion of information. &quot;How good a society does human
nature permit?&quot; asked psychologist Abraham Maslow. &quot;How good a
human nature does society permit?&quot;</P>

<P>... It is difficult to speak of or to practice love, friendship, generosity,
understanding, or solidarity within a system whose rules, goals, and information
streams are geared for lesser human qualities. But we try, and we urge you
to try. Be patient with yourself and others as you and they confront the
difficulty of a changing world. Understand and empathize with inevitable
resistance; there is some resistance, some clinging to the ways of unsustainability,
within each of us. Include everyone in the new world. Everyone will be needed.
Seek out and trust in the best human instincts in yourself and in everyone.
Listen to the cynicism around you and pity those who believe it, but don't
believe it yourself.</P>

<I>At the end of 1991, IC executive editor Alan AtKisson sent out a brief
electronic mail message to several contributing editors. The message - about
a small news item mailed in by IC readers and computer conferencing pioneers
Peter and Trudy Johnson-Lenz (see IC #23, &quot;Humanizing Hyperspace&quot;)
- gave rise to a lengthy and impromptu computer-mediated &quot;multilogue&quot;

of </I>Getting to the 21st Century <I>(see p. 30); William Prescott, formerly

  <P>HOPE IS ALL SCIENTISTS HAVE TO OFFER IN CRISIS OVER OZONE</P>
  <P>SAN FRANCISCO - Scientists who have been looking for a way to reverse
  the damage humans have unleashed upon the Earth's atmosphere offered an
  extraordinary public opinion Monday: There probably is no solution other
  than to mend our ways and hope the planet heals.</P>
  <P>There is substantial evidence that the Earth is growing warmer, due
  chiefly to the burning of fossil fuels, and the layer of ozone that protects
  the planet from harmful solar radiation is thinning due to the use of refrigerants
  known as chlorofluorocarbons [CFCs]. Both changes in the atmosphere have
  resulted from human habitation of the planet, and both threaten life as
  we know it.</P>
  <P>Thus scientists are frequently asked what they can do to reverse the
  trend. Experts gathered from across the country this week to ponder that
  very question during the winter meeting of the American Geophysical Society.</P>
  <P>The collective answer? Not much.</P>
  <P>&quot;Nothing proposed yet is even remotely feasible,&quot; said F.
  Sherwood Rowland of the University of California, Irvine, the scientist
  who is now well known for foreseeing the ozone crisis. Further, he said,
  no engineering solution is likely to work.</P>

<P><B>From:</B> Donella H. Meadows (2 Jan 92)</P>

<P><B>Subject:</B> Hope</P>

<P>Interesting ozone article, especially that it was buried. As far as I
can tell, the scientific conclusion is accurate. We have agreed as a world
to stop producing CFCs according to a certain schedule; we are actually
ahead of schedule, but the results in the stratosphere are long-delayed.
We won't see any improvement for 15 years or so, and while we wait we can
only hope that the damage we have already done, as it unfolds, will be tolerable.
The ozone story is a great lesson in the effects of long environmental delays.</P>

<P>For real physical processes already in the pipeline, there is really
not much to do but hope. Beyond that, for processes that can actually be
affected by human action, especially political and economic processes, hope
gets you the booby prize. You don't sit around hoping, you get off your
butt and do something.</P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><HR WIDTH="30%"></P>

<P><B>From:</B> Duane H. Fickeisen (3 Jan 92)</P>

<P><B>Subject:</B> Hope/no hope</P>

<P>I think the conclusion that we will not be able to stop the warming already
in process is right. But I disagree that there is only hope left. The flip
side of no hope is taking responsibility and being proactive.</P>

<P>We <I>can</I> get off our collective butts and do something. Several
somethings, actually:</P>

<P>* Use this as an example to teach people about whole systems and about
our ability to create unplanned impacts that have long lasting effects.
(Why we didn't already get this from the pesticide story is beyond me, though.)</P>

<P>* Continue to monitor climate change and to refine predictive models,
attempt to predict the range of likely impacts at a regional scale, and
attempt to better predict consequent sea level change. The ranges of potential
effects can be used as a basis for setting policy.</P>

<P>* Stop, to the extent possible, continued release of greenhouse gases
and of ozone eaters. This won't stop what's already in progress, but it
will keep it from getting even worse than it already is going to be.</P>

<P>* Begin right away to plan and implement mitigative responses:</P>

<P>- develop crop tolerance</P>

<P>- examine effects of changes in storm patterns and precipitation and
snowpack on structures (e.g., Columbia River System dams, irrigation systems,
flood control reservoirs) and plan to make any required changes</P>

<P>- develop appropriate land use regulations (since built infrastructure
lasts 50-100+ years, should we prohibit development near shores that will
flood in the future? Should we base development on projected water supply
availability in 50 years based on predicted climate change, rather than
current projections that do not take climate change into account?)</P>

<P>* design our buildings and other structures for predicted storm severity
(rain, wind, temperature), e.g., increased roof loading, increased wind
loading, altered precipitation patterns</P>

<P>* develop better medical/wellness responses to skin cancer</P>

<P>* begin building responsive communities that will support each other
in the suffering that will be experienced, learn to care for each other</P>

<P>* and oh, so much more.</P>

<P><B>From:</B> David C. Korten (4 Jan 92)</P>

<P><B>Subject:</B> Hope &amp; ozone</P>

<P>Can't say the <I>Oregonian</I> blurb is very helpful - I suspect the
<I>Oregonian</I> is guilty of superficial reporting. Probably the problem
is that the scientists are looking only for a technical solution - which
they rightly note does not exist. The necessary actions are predominantly
social. If you assume that humans are incapable of intelligent social action
to control their self-destructive profligacy, then there is no feasible
solution. We are assuming that &quot;human intelligence&quot; is not an
oxymoron.</P>

<P><B>From:</B> Alan AtKisson (7 Jan 92)</P>

<P><B>To:</B> <I>IC </I>contributing editors</P>

<P><B>Subject:</B> Hope, etc.</P>

<P>Thanks for getting back to me on &quot;hope.&quot; What most interested
me was, indeed, how this story was being reported (buried in a blurb, no
context, etc.). Not too long before, I'd seen another article titled &quot;Scientists
say future bodes ill for humankind&quot; - buried on page 5, same paper
- and I've seen many similar treatments in other papers. I'm concerned that
such pronouncements may mark the upsurge of a popular, scientifically sanctioned
fatalism, which will make it more difficult for calls to proactive action
and creative response to be heard. Why <I>not</I> fiddle while Rome burns
if there's nothing you believe can be done about it?</P>

<P>Confronting such cultural lassitude should be an important subtheme for
the next issue (#32), and of course it should be central to the issue following
it on empowerment.</P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><HR WIDTH="30%"></P>

<P><B>From:</B> Donella H. Meadows (7 Jan 92)</P>

<P><B>Subject:</B> Faith, not hope</P>

<P>Alan - I think you're touching on what I think should be the theme of
issue #32. It is the place where I found myself in trying to find the proper
end to the new book [<I>Beyond the Limits</I>]. In the final version I say
that what really divides optimists from pessimists is not their assumptions
about technology, or the market, or earth science, but their assumptions
about THE POSSIBILITY OF HUMAN VIRTUE. I think one takes the message of
limits as negative only if one has absolutely no faith that people can be
good. If one has such faith, as I do, then one hears the message of limits
as just &quot;OK, let's roll up our sleeves and get to work.&quot;</P>

<P>Maybe the conversation you've started among us should be quoted directly
in the issue, to get your readers involved in the argument. The real, critical,
important, awful question raised by the realization of limits is: WHO ARE
WE? And who we are is largely dependent upon our own mental models of who
we are, so there's a great Catch-22 here.</P>

<P>For me the whole discussion was best summed up by Abraham Maslow: What
kind of society does human nature permit? And what kind of human nature
does society permit?</P>

<P>You could make an exciting issue out of that!</P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><HR WIDTH="30%"></P>

<P><B>From:</B> William Prescott (7 Jan 92)</P>

<P><B>Subject:</B> Hope</P>

<P>I believe Dana may be understating the situation. My understanding is
that most CFCs haven't even reached the stratosphere yet, and that their
chlorine will later be active for 80-120 years. The 5-8% loss above our
heads in the last decade does NOT include those CFCs (the majority) still
migrating upwards. At 5 to 8% per decade, 50 to 80% of the ozone layer would
be gone in a century. Probably making life unlivable on this planet. But
you won't have to wait: since most of the real danger hasn't even arrived
in the shooting zone, the process of deterioration will most likely be rapid
and non-linear - something like the non-linear breakdowns we've already
seen in some acid-rain-soaked forests, or in the bleaching of coral reefs,
or in many types of desertification. Or somewhat like what's expected with
climate change. These systems seemed like they might survive for awhile;
then they fell apart. Sudden breakdowns on the heels of continued stress.</P>

<P>Systems thinking is a double-edged sword. Along with appreciating interconnectedness
and <I>order </I>comes an appreciation for interconnectedness and <I>chaos</I>,
disequilibrium. I have concluded that ozone holes and their likely direction
are just one example of a global systems-wide eco-disequilibrium. Starting
from this assumption - that the stability of natural processes can no longer
be depended upon for planning our future - means that the building of a
humane, sustainable culture becomes a very different, and much less charted,
adventure. I even have trouble using the word &quot;sustainable&quot; these
days, and the last vestiges of deep ecology have been wiped from my mind.
Yeah, I hate it, too. But I feel strongly that any realistic vision of the
human future must now seek to transcend the current definitions of &quot;natural&quot;
and &quot;sustainable&quot; if they are to have any chance of success.</P>

<P>Hmm. Gloomy prognosis! Nothing I hadn't considered before, of course,
though it isn't the kind of thing I like to hold in my mind as a morning
meditation. I'll forward this to Dana - I'm interested to hear what she
has to say in response.</P>

<P>I'm interested in what Dana has to say as well. I would love to hear
I'm wrong from someone who's not in heavy denial ...</P>

<P>About hope ... inner strength should never have to depend on outer circumstances.
To me, hope is an attitude not to be justified by the frailty and undependability
of outer circumstances. I have seen brave people dying of AIDS with more
hope than a whole conference full of futurists ...</P>

<P><B>From:</B> Carla Cole (8 Jan 92)</P>

<P><B>Subject:</B> Hope, etc.</P>

<P>Having come rather recently out of formal education on third world development,
my deepest concern is that folks will soon be ripping down the last tree
for a place to grow a sweet potato. This spectre of whopping human food
deficits and creeping deserts potentially occurs in a time-frame that predates
the disruptions that may be expected to occur from the atmospheric maladies
we've been discussing. So I &quot;hope&quot; that acceptance of foods such
as spirulina and the like (things we can scarcely now imagine, perhaps -
stuff grown in huge vats in laboratories) and vastly improved agricultural
practices (maybe we need to be more willing to EAT the insects that compete
with us for food, instead of poisoning them!) will be a component of the
answer.</P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><HR WIDTH="30%"></P>

<P><B>From: </B>David C. Korten (8 Jan 92)</P>

<P><B>Subject:</B> Hope &amp; ozone</P>

<P>I was fascinated, and not exactly encouraged, by the exchange around
the ozone layer. Prescott's assessment is particularly unsettling.</P>

<P>On Dana's point regarding virtue as the key element, I'm not sure I agree.
In thinking about the point I realized that Prescott's position helps put
things in perspective on the extremes of the optimist and pessimist viewpoints.</P>

<P>The true optimists I know make no positive assumptions about human nature.
Their position is that with greed at full reign, a combination of technology
and the market will take care of whatever problems we face. No belief in
virtue among those optimists. Simple destiny. Out of man's hands. All things
work out for the best. Essentially it is the new religious faith. Trust
in money. It will guide us to salvation. More on this in a moment.</P>

<P>Now Prescott defines a related extreme on the pessimist side. Only here
the focus is on a complex of forces that lead to universal death, with no
possible corrective action in the cards even if one were to assume total
human virtue and enlightenment.</P>

<P>Here we have the two diametrically opposed positions with virtue not
at issue - the ultimate optimists and pessimists.</P>

<P>In between these two extremes there are those who believe that the technical
possibility remains for EITHER doom or salvation. Essentially we are moving
in a negative direction, but at least in this view we could correct our
course if we had the collective wit to do so. Even here I don't believe
that virtue is so central as some people suggest.</P>

<P>Actually I'm more taken with Dana's question about WHO ARE WE? than with
THE POSSIBILITY OF HUMAN VIRTUE question.</P>

<P>I think of <I>virtue</I> in terms of the individual who, convinced that
doom is inevitable, engages in frugality and conservation purely out of
a sense that it is the right thing to do - even while knowing the prospect
of it making any larger difference is nil. <I>Intelligence</I> is making
a choice for frugality and conservation as part of a conscious and self-aware
transformational strategy for individual and collective survival. Here one
is practicing intelligent pragmatism, not self-denial.</P>

<P>The &quot;intelligence versus virtue&quot; issue turns on what I consider
to be a basic reality. There is a high degree of certainty that the consequences
of the prospective social and ecological collapse will be extremely detrimental
to all human beings. We must ultimately anticipate a common fate in this
regard. Thus we all share a stake in assuring a positive outcome. In the
end there are no free riders. In the absence of overwhelming contrary evidence
that our future is already fixed beyond human intervention (both of the
fatalistic extremes are based on somewhat speculative and unsubstantiated
scenarios), the only intelligent individual or collective human choice therefore
is to assume that responsible choice can still make a difference and act
accordingly. The question becomes one of intelligence, not virtue.</P>

<P>The data on collective human intelligence are by no means conclusive.
But I think there is more reason for optimism based on a presumption of
intelligence than a presumption of virtue. The strategic implications are
also more straightforward: we go for awareness-building and agenda-setting.
If virtue is the necessary foundation of corrective action, I have much
less of an idea where to intervene.</P>

<P>That said, I think the question of WHO ARE WE does in the end become
important, but more on the spirituality than the virtue side. Every time
I start pushing myself to think about the frontiers of corrective action,
I come up against the idea that ultimately our sense of spiritual connection
with all life is crucial. I believe that connection is innately there, but
systematically suppressed by modern culture - even by orthodox institutional
Christianity, which insists on separating man and woman from God and placing
man above all other life.</P>

<P>The inverse side of rediscovering our spiritual roots and connections
is the growing power of the theology of money or mammon. I think we are
experiencing a phenomenon that is best described as our dominant religion
- with the World Bank/IMF as its Mother Church and the forces of transnational
capital as its evangelizing mission.</P>

<P>Even if ozone destruction isn't scheduled to kill us off until a hundred
years from now, it is likely to prove to be a secondary issue - one that
we may hardly notice when the time comes, given current trends. The basic
destruction of our food-producing habitats is likely to proceed at an accelerating
rate along with accelerating disintegration of the social fabric. The result
is likely to lead to near-complete social breakdown and a massive die-back
in the population long before the ozone layer becomes a truly significant
threat.</P>

<P>But this is a trajectory that intelligent human intervention could correct.
Then we come up against the question of whether we would only be gaining
ourselves another fifty years or so only to be finished off by the forces
of ozone depletion, against which we may be powerless. It is hard to end
this on an upbeat note.</P>

<P><B>From:</B> Alan AtKisson (8 Jan 92)</P>

<P><B>To:</B> Donella H. Meadows</P>

<P><B>Subject:</B> Hope</P>

<P>I think we're all in agreement about the nature and gravity of this predicament
and the need to inspire response, but we're a bit gloomy about the natural
(not the human) prospects. Do we have cause? I'm waiting to hear from you,
as I'm interested in taking this multilogue to some sort of conclusion.</P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><HR WIDTH="30%"></P>

<P><B>From:</B> Donella H. Meadows (14 Jan 92)</P>

<P><B>Subject:</B> Conclusion?</P>

<P>A conclusion for this multilogue? You're kidding! Why not let the readers
supply their own conclusions, each according to his or her own temperament
with regard to hope? Which is fundamentally, I think, a matter of temperament
- of the genes and glands and outlooks we were born with.</P>

<P>Having said that, I see an immediate need to contradict myself. There
IS something we all can and should do to uncomplicate this discussion. We
can make the basic distinction between scientific &quot;facts&quot; as best
we know them, and our feelings about them.</P>

<P>It is a &quot;fact&quot; that CFCs take 15 years to get to the stratosphere,
so there's 15 years worth of increasing damage in the pipeline, about which
we can do nothing. (I use &quot;fact&quot; in quotes, because even scientific
stuff can turn out to be wrong - but it also, and more often, turns out
to be right.) There are delays and momentum and probable chaotic mechanisms
in the greenhouse effect. There is the probable long, long lifetime of pesticides
in groundwater. There is the momentum in the growth of the human population,
and the undeniable irreversibility of species extinctions. These are &quot;facts&quot;
and they scare the you-know-what out of me, but the facts are one thing
and being scared is another.</P>

<P>(There are also &quot;good&quot; facts, if we have the temperament to
be willing to admit them, like the existence of the Montreal and London
agreements about CFC production, and the increasing number of protected
natural areas, and great technical possibilities for energy savings, and
dropping birth rates.)</P>

<P>Most of us leap immediately from the facts to the way we FEEL about them
- scared, or hopeless, or challenged, or threatened, or whatever - and we
inadvertently and uncontrollably communicate the facts all mixed up with
our particular emotions. The emotions (especially hopelessness, anger, contempt
for the human race) may turn people off so much that they can't hear the
facts.</P>

<P>I think we should communicate both the facts and our personal emotions,
but I think we should work hard to separate them and label them accordingly:
here's the fact, and here's how I feel about it. We can let the facts just
be facts, regard them soberly, hold the emotions at bay for a minute or
two. That might give other people a chance, before THEIR emotions crush
them, to absorb the facts, to see what these facts mean for their own behavior,
and to find their own personal reaction, before we overwhelm them with OUR
recommendation for their behavior and with OUR personal reactions.</P>

<P>I tried that once last summer - I gave a clear, straightforward, unemotional
talk about &quot;the state of the world,&quot; and then in the last ten
minutes I let fly with my real, personal, deep feelings about what I had
just said. I think it was the most effective way I've found yet to deliver
that information.</P>

<P>We have to remember that there is absolutely no &quot;external&quot;
or &quot;objective&quot; reason to be hopeful or hopeless - we make all
that up inside ourselves, and different people make it up differently. No
one person's inner reaction to the facts of the world are any more &quot;correct&quot;
than any other. We'd like to label denial &quot;wrong,&quot; but it's a
completely understandable psychological coping mechanism. In terms of utility,
it's no more paralyzing than hopelessness.</P>

<P>If we can make even the tiniest crack between the information and the
way we feel about it, we begin to get a bit of power over how we feel about
it. These days I CHOOSE how I'm going to feel about it. I don't choose denial,
and I don't choose hopelessness, and I don't choose to hate my fellow human
beings - those are legitimate and understandable emotional responses, but
they paralyze me. I try (some days it's hard) to choose what gets me to
work - a bit of fear, considerable grief, a lot of love for the planet and
for all creatures on it (even us), and a tremendous faith that the universe
did not evolve for four billion years to create the first form of life that
could celebrate the wonders of the Earth, in order for that form of life
to eliminate those wonders.</P>

<P>We have within us the ability to wonder, the intelligence to understand,
and the love to care about that which we wonder at. I try to play to those
abilities, within myself and within others, and in them I always find hope.</P>

<P><BR>
<I>The 1992 Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro and its massive set of nonbinding
agreements (the largest - some 500 to 800 pages long, depending on typeface
- is called &quot;Agenda 21&quot;) will inevitably stand as an historical
marker. &quot;There,&quot; future historians will say, &quot;we first made
our attempt to come together as a planet, confront the manifold global crises
we had previously been denying, and plan a course of action.</I></P>

<P><I>&quot;Of course,&quot; they will go on to say, &quot;we didn't do
a very good job of it. But we kept trying. We got better at it. And we learned
how to do it,&quot; we hope they will be able to add, &quot;just in time.&quot;</I></P>

<P><I>What follows is a collection of readings on moving beyond the Earth
Summit and cooperating for a sustainable future - locally, regionally, globally.
The writers range from heads of state to grassroots activists, but their
messages contain a common thread: we must seek each other out, learn from
each other, and join as partners in the work of integrating human activity
with our ecological base. This is the real &quot;Agenda 21,&quot; and the
challenge of the next century.</I></P>

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER><A NAME="French"></A>Governing The Global Commons</H2>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><I>Hillary F. French</I></P>

<P><I>The following is excerpted from Worldwatch Paper 107, </I>After the
Earth Summit: The Future of Environmental Governance<I>, published in March
1992 and available for $5 from Worldwatch Institute, 1776 Massachusetts
Ave. NW, Washington, DC 20036, Tel. 202/452-1999. Hillary French is a Worldwatch
senior researcher.</I></P>

<P>As we approach the twenty-first century, the once-simple concept of national
sovereignty has become increasingly fraught with complications - and contradictions.
On one level, nations are guarding their sovereignty more jealously than
ever. The former Soviet Union has broken up into 15 independent nations,
Yugoslavia has been wracked by gruesome civil warfare that could lead to
its disintegration into as many as six more nations, and ethnic and tribal
tensions are running rampant in many parts of the world.</P>

<P>At the same time, nations are finding that their interdependence is greater
than ever before, with both the economy and the environment increasingly
disrespectful of national borders. Thus, the European Community is becoming
a dominant force in setting all manner of policies, and other regional organizations,
such as the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, are beginning to follow
its lead. Individual countries or groups of countries are also turning to
the United Nations and the international economic institutions to regulate
conduct between them. Jean Monnet, a founder of the EC, wrote in the 1950s,
&quot;Like our provinces in the past, our nations today must live together
under common rules and institutions freely arrived at. The sovereign nations
of the past can no longer solve the problems of the present: They cannot
ensure their own progress or control their own future.&quot;</P>

<P>In the environmental arena, the progress nations have made toward the
common rules and institutions Monnet refers to offers some reason for optimism
that international cooperation will become, increasingly, the rule rather
than the exception. As a result of the world community's united effort to
combat ozone depletion, and the willingness of the developed countries to
provide financial and technical assistance, millions of lives will be saved.
While progress on the climate change negotiations seems slow compared to
the urgency of the problem, it has been rapid by historic standards of international
diplomacy - particularly considering that a mere five years ago, most people
around the world had never even heard of global warming.</P>

<P>Though the progress to date offers reason for hope, the magnitude of
the challenges facing the international community is still daunting. While
diplomats debate, primary forests continue to be felled, irreplaceable genes
disappear as species become extinct, and power plants and cars pump heat-trapping
carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. What is being lost is not only a natural
heritage, but the resources upon which future economic productivity depends.</P>

<P>Even in the best of circumstances, the slow pace of international diplomacy
and the urgent rate at which the problems themselves are growing worse are
difficult to reconcile. The best hope for speeding up the process of governing
the global commons lies with the global citizenry. When governments act,
it is generally in response to political pressure to do so. To some, the
idea of global governance might seem hopelessly idealistic or quixotic;
yet few would judge it any less conceivable than the astonishing events
of the past two years in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. These
events demonstrated how quickly even the most seemingly-intransigent governments
can be moved if their citizens feel passionate enough about their cause.
When the cause is the air they breathe, the water they drink, and the climate
that produces their food, the probability of an escalating pressure on their
governments to take expeditious action is very real indeed.</P>

<P>At the Earth Summit, the 20,000 concerned citizens and activists expected
to attend from around the world may outnumber the official representatives
by as much as two to one. As a next step, some have proposed the creation
of an &quot;Amnesty for the Earth&quot; organization modeled after Amnesty
International's path-breaking work in the human rights field, that would
investigate environmental violations and issue annual reports on states'
environmental records. As environmentalists from around the world learn
to work together for shared goals, the nongovernmental movement stands to
become as influential at the international level as it is within nations.</P>

<P>For this to happen, however, the international governing process will
need to be opened to public participation to a far greater extent than it
is today. Presently, at the international level, there are no provisions
for public review and comment, and no mechanisms for bringing citizen suits;
nor is there anything resembling an elected parliament in the United Nations
itself or any of its agencies. Most international organizations are closed
off to public participation, and even access to documents of critical interest
to the public is highly restricted. International laws and institutions
have traditionally functioned as compacts between nations; but if they are
to solve the problems of a rapidly deteriorating biosphere, they must also
evolve into compacts between people.</P>

<P>Global environmental governance may sound like a utopian concept. But
it is in fact well on the way to becoming a hard reality, as the worldwide
shutting down of CFC production, for example, is showing. Far from utopian,
such governance is proving to be a practical and unavoidable response to
otherwise-unmanageable threats. There can be little doubt that as the international
economy, the communications revolution, and the global environmental predicament
all continue to make the world more interdependent, nations will have to
adapt more rapidly to changing times.</P>

<P>To create an effective system of international environmental governance
will require wide departures from business as usual. But there is little
choice. The world faces a future of climbing global temperatures, depleted
fisheries, reduced agricultural yields, diminished biological diversity,
and growing human suffering, unless governments move quickly. Only by joining
forces in forms of environmental governance that are stronger than the sum
of their parts, will nations be able to secure their citizens' futures.</P>

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER><A NAME="Mitterand"></A>The Environment Has No Borders</H2>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><I>Fran&ccedil;ois Mitterand</I></P>

<P><I>The following is excerpted from a keynote address by French president
Fran&ccedil;ois Miterrand before &quot;Roots of the Future,&quot; a global
conference of nongovernmental organizations funded by France and held in
Paris in December, 1991. Reprinted from </I>Ecoforum<I>, published by the
Environmental Liaison Centre International, PO Box 72461, Nairobi, Kenya
(subscriptions US$30 per year). The text appears in the February 1992 issue.</I></P>

<P>There is no paradox between ecology and development, but there is a paradox
between under-development and democracy. Development is not the characteristic
or the privilege of one particular country or region; the whole planet is
affected. The planet has been misused by man. In some places it is worn
out from over-use even though it is still young. If I have understood the
scientists' opinions correctly, the Earth is still very young; it is still
very close to its beginnings. Indeed, I hope that it is nearer to its beginning
than to its end. But who can tell? One thing is certain though - it is sick.
It is sick from over-development; it is sick from under-development. It
is a pity that it is unable to strike a balance between the two tendencies.</P>

<P>Due to the desire to exploit nature unreservedly, man has forgotten nature's
rhythms and laws. Everyone who has lived as I have in direct contact with
nature knows this. I spent my youth in a house that was three kilometers
from the nearest little town, with no running water or electricity. We experienced
some inconveniences, but there were also great advantages, such as learning
how to appreciate the seasons and live according to their rhythms: days,
nights and hours, and the great natural changes that eventually become a
part of you.</P>

<P>The environment has no borders. That famous hole in the ozone layer which
can be seen in the southern polar regions will affect the whole Earth. Similarly,
atmospheric pollution produced by a given country affects the quality of
the air breathed by others. For instance, will the acid rains in the Black
Forest spare the Vosges [a French mountain chain near the German border]
when their effects have already reached Scandinavian forests? The sunsets
in France have been modified by the eruption of the Pinatubo Volcano in
the Philippines in June.</P>

<P>In May 1989, the Netherlands and Norway (which have now been joined by
40 other countries) met in France. We launched together what is called &quot;The
Call of the Hague.&quot; This was a proposal to the entire United Nations
to appoint a supranational authority. This proposal caused a scandal: a
supranational authority for environment could introduce restrictive rules
which would run against the interests of national leaders, or the pride
of a given country, or of the majority of countries. This supranational
authority would have to ensure that its decisions are respected; it would
be set up to protect the atmosphere. This, to me, is <I>not</I> a scandal.</P>

<P>In 1992, we will take action to see that this authority is indeed created.
We will speak about it everywhere, even in Rio. It should establish its
legitimacy by its competence and independence; it should caution world political
and economic leaders. Inaccuracy and lack of foresight are not found only
in politicians.</P>

<P>Nature has created invisible balances, and links between different species
and different regions of the world. These balances must be maintained. In
order to do this, they must be better understood. You must point them out.</P>

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER><A NAME="Muntemba"></A>Participation Is Central</H2>

<P><I>Also Excerpted from a keynote speech to the &quot;Roots of the Future&quot;
conference in Paris, France, 1991. The author directs the Environmental
Liaison Centre International in Nairobi, Kenya. </I></P>

<P>Participatory democracy is central to sustainability: how are all poor
rural women struggling for livelihoods to be heard? How will development
paradigms ensure the sustainability of their assets? What about indigenous
people in the Amazonia and North America; the Maoris in New Zealand; the
urban poor in our cities, the young, men and women, outside mainstream structures?
Many of us in the NGO world believe that these are central to the sustainability
of the life-support systems, of cultures and ultimately of entire societies.
Among the challenges of the 1990s to governments, business and NGOs is the
central one of bringing about and ensuring participatory democracy.</P>

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER><A NAME="Lauer"></A>National Green Plans:<BR>
Virtue Born Of Necessity</H2>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><I>Peggy Lauer</I></P>

<P><I>&quot;In the real world, the environment and economy are linked. It
is only in institutions that they are kept separate.&quot; - Jim MacNeill,
Secretary General, UN World Commission on Environment and Development</I></P>

<P>In March, 1992, the California-based <A HREF="http://www.rri.org/">Resource
Renewal Institute</A> held an international environmental workshop that
highlighted integrated environmental recovery strategies being developed
and implemented in Canada and Europe. These &quot;Green Plans&quot; are
big-picture political processes aimed at &quot;sustainability.&quot;</P>

<P>Huey Johnson, president of the Resource Renewal Institute, opened the
three-day workshop with a high note of optimism, saying that through these
Green Plans, &quot;We are finally approaching environmental problems on
a level where we can <I>solve </I>them.&quot;</P>

<P>Each speaker, from Canada, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Britain and
Austria, told the audience, that they were defining sustainability or sustainable
development by action, not in words. &quot;We consider [the word &quot;sustainability&quot;]
a useful phrase of constructive ambiguity,&quot; said Robert Slater, Assistant
Deputy Minister for Policy in Environment Canada.</P>

<P>According to Dr. Slater, population pressures make the process of developing
a Green Plan for sustainability &quot;inevitable and unavoidable.&quot;
He and the others saw this as positive: &quot;Making a virtue out of necessity
is a pleasant experience, and one we should all get underway,&quot; he remarked
to his mostly American audience.</P>

<P>What makes a national Green Plan distinct is its vision and cooperative
spirit. (There's nothing like the unhealthy and destructive effects of massive
pollution on one's air, water and soils to focus the national mind.) Although
there is a range of support within the governments of Green Plan countries,
by and large the various ministries and industry leaders are joining forces
with consumers to turn things around for themselves and future generations.</P>

<P>&quot;You must translate environmental concerns into business concerns,&quot;
says Dr. Paul deJongh, the Director General of the Environment in the Netherlands,
if you want any real improvement. Four Dutch ministries now work directly
with &quot;target groups&quot; of polluting industries and consumers to
reduce pollution going into their air, water and soil by 70 to 90 percent,
by the year 2010.</P>

<P>The Dutch Government sets the goals for reductions, then allows industries
to determine how they will get there. (Industry requested this arrangment
to avoid a changing regulatory environment.) The two sectors then sign voluntary
contracts. The Government provides incentives, such as subsidizing company
transportation plans, but it still wields a stick. By 1995, for example,
there must be a system to process 6 million tons of cow manure, or livestock
numbers will have to be reduced. The Dutch regulators also require that
the polluters pay for environmental damage caused by their failure to comply.</P>

<P>Norway's system is similar. All industry emission regulations are long-term
and applied across the board. The Norwegian government believes in economic
development, but not at the expense of the environment. Those who buck compliance
pay heavily. Dr. Paul Hofseth, Special Advisor to the Environment Ministry,
told of a potato chip factory caught dumping effluent into the water. The
factory owner faced a jail sentence, paid a severe fine, and had all his
profits confiscated dating from when the violations started.</P>

<P>In Norway, and throughout Europe, reducing pollution requires a lot of
international negotiating (nearly 90% of air pollution over Scandinavia
comes from elsewhere). Because of such cross-boundary concerns, many of
the nations' plans focus on whole ecosystems. This is also true in Canada,
where the government must consider the needs of indigenous people in the
Arctic and Northwest Territories as well as acidification in the Great Lakes,
which involves negotiations with the US. The government has also endowed
universities to help achieve centers of ecosystem research centers across
the country.</P>

<P>Bringing business into the Green Planning process requires new thinking
as well for environmental activists. Rick Findlay, who represented the Ontario
(Canada) Roundtable at the workshop (one of several similar provincial initiatives),
spoke to the audience about a need for all three sectors to transcend their
old institutional attitudes in favor of a sustainable society.</P>

<P>Like the Canadian provinces, some US states are taking their first steps.
With funding from the EPA, 19 states over the past two years have formed
government, business and public advisory panels to discuss the social and
economic risks of environmental degradation in their states and regions.
Panelists from Washington State, California, Minnesota, Vermont, New Jersey
and Louisiana talked about how the process is changing the way their governments
do business. Most of these programs have recently stalled due to political
inertia or lack of funds to take the next step. But, Dr. Slater said, in
quoting another Jim MacNeill maxim: &quot;If we change the way we make decisions,
we will change the decisions we make.&quot; Whatever the rate of progress,
the inevitable process has begun.</P>

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>THE DUTCH GREEN PLAN</H2>

<P><I>The Netherlands, one of the world's most densely populated and polluted
countries, is also a world leader in enacting law to require economic changes
that promote sustainability. The following is excerpted from the introduction
to the National Environmental Policy Plan (NEPP) of the Netherlands, a detailed
set of strategies and policies enacted in 1989 and expanded by an additional
document (NEPP Plus) in 1990. </I></P>

<P>1.1 This NEPP contains the strategy for environmental policy in the medium
term. The strategy has been developed against the background of the desire
to solve or gain control of environmental problems within the duration of
one generation....</P>

<P>1.2 The pursuit of sustainable development is the premise for environmental
management. The recommendations of the World Commission on Environment and
Development (Brundtland Commission) are being built upon. Sustainable development
is development that meets the needs of the present without compromising
the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. In addition,
the NEPP is built upon the set of ideas embodied in the indicative Multi-year
Programmes for Environment of the previous years. The recommendations of
the Brundtland Commission add the following elements to those ideas:</P>

<P>* attention for the long-term effects for future generations</P>

<P>* tackling of large-scale global environmental problems</P>

<P>* mutual dependence of environmental quality and socio-economic development.</P>

<P>[...]</P>

<P>3.7 Everyone is expected to know his responsibility for the environment
and to act accordingly. The large scale at which some environmental problems
occur does not reduce this responsibility.</P>

<P>In justifying individual activities, one should answer the question what
the effect would be on environmental quality if the same activity was to
be carried out by the number of people as determined by the physical and
market potential of that activity.</P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><HR WIDTH="30%"></P>

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER><A NAME="Durning"></A>A Sustainable Lifestyle:<BR>
Learning From The Global &quot;Middle Class&quot;</H2>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><I>Alan Thein Durning</I></P>

<P>Perhaps the greatest irony of the global environmental movement is that
its members - the millions of us in scores of countries who call ourselves
environmentalists - almost all practice the most ecologically destructive
lifestyle in human history. Our efforts to recycle and conserve notwithstanding,
we in the world's affluent fifth, the global consumer class, still cause
the lion's share of planetary ills, and most self-described environmentalists
are solidly in the consumer class.</P>

<P>Our cars and airplanes, our diet of meat, junk food, and soft drinks,
our suburbs and malls, and our excessive packaging, planned obsolescence,
and disposable goods are among the worst culprits in the global assault
on the Earth. Natural systems, we environmentalists have learned to say,
cannot support the burden of humanity's present activities. On closer scrutiny,
of course, most of those destructive activities are carried out by the consumer
class.</P>

<P>So the Earth cannot support the consumer lifestyle even for the 1.1 billion
of us who currently enjoy it, much less for the 5.5 billion humans living
today or the 8 to 14 billion expected within a century. Some alternative
is desperately needed. The place to look, it turns out, is not to science
fiction or the ancient past but to our neighbors in places like China and
Costa Rica - the middle of the world's economic spectrum.</P>

<P>Economically and ecologically speaking, it makes more sense to divide
humanity into three classes - consumers, middle-income, and poor - than
it does to speak of &quot;first world&quot; and &quot;third world&quot;
(see table). At the bottom of the economic ladder, the world's 1.1 billion
poor clearly consume too little for their own good. These people, most of
them rural Africans and Indians, eat meager portions of grains and root
crops, and drink mostly unclean water. They live in huts and shanties, travel
by foot, and most of their possessions are constructed of stone, wood, and
other substances available from the local environment. Not only are their
consumption patterns - their lifestyle, if you can call it that - too paltry
for a decent human existence, they often result in environmental harm. Driven
by desperation, the poor often abuse their natural resources, putting forests
to the torch and fragile drylands to the plow.</P>

<P>The 3.3 billion people of the world's middle-income class, who live mostly
in Latin America, the Middle East, China, and East Asia, are different.
Though they eat a diet based on grains and water like the poor, their food
supply is sufficient and nutritious - it's the kind of low-fat cuisine for
which yuppies now pay top dollar. They live in moderate buildings with electricity
for lights, radios, and, increasingly, refrigerators and clothes washers.
They travel by bus, railway, and bicycle; maintain a modest stock of durable
goods; and reuse and recycle meticulously.</P>

<P>At the top of the ladder is us: the consumer class of North America,
Western Europe, Japan, and the elites of other regions. We consumers dine
on meat and processed, packaged foods, and imbibe soft drinks and other
beverages from disposable containers. We spend most of our time in climate-controlled
buildings equipped with refrigerators, clothes washers and dryers, abundant
hot water, dishwashers, microwave ovens, and a plethora of other electric-powered
gadgets. We travel in private automobiles and airplanes, and surround ourselves
with a profusion of short-lived, throwaway goods.</P>

<P>For decades, our way of life - familiar to all the world's people because
we film ourselves and beam the images around the world to the screens of
800 million television sets - has been the dream of international development.
It has been the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow: attain development
and you will someday live like the Cosbys or the Brady Bunch. Unfortunately,
our growing understanding of this planet now tells us with ever greater
certainty that achieving that goal for all people would only hasten the
ruin of the planet.</P>

<P>We environmentalists have, however, been slow - <I>exceedingly</I> slow
- to come to terms with this conclusion. The reason for the delay, I expect,
is not logical but psychological. Whatever the cause of our reticence, we
cannot ignore the facts forever. If there is to be a future worth living
in, the ultimate aim of world development can no longer be to bring the
poor and middle-income classes up to the consumer plane. Instead, we might
aim to bring about a convergence of the three groups. Specifically, it appears
that we consumers must, without surrendering the quest for advanced, clean
technologies, climb several rungs down the consumption ladder. We can contribute
some sophisticated technologies to a sustainable way of life (lap-top computers,
fiber optics, super-efficient appliances, and solar designs are good candidates)
but most of its ingredients will come from the middle-income class.</P>

<P>Life on Earth hinges on whether we among the richest fifth of the world's
people, having fully met our material needs, can turn to nonmaterial sources
of fulfillment. Whether we - who have defined the tangible goals of world
development - can now craft a new way of life at once simpler and more satisfying.</P>

<P>Having invented the automobile and airplane, can we return to bicycles,
buses, and trains? Having pioneered sprawl and malls, can we recreate human-scale
settlements where commerce is an adjunct to civic life rather than its purpose?
Having introduced the high fat, junk-food diet, can we instead nourish ourselves
on wholesome fare that is locally produced and minimally wrapped? Having
devised disposable plastics, packaging without end, and instantaneous obsolescence,
can we design objects that endure and a materials economy that takes care
of things? The health of the biosphere depends on it.</P>

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER><A NAME="Cassady"></A>Tin Wis: An Experiment In Cooperation</H2>

<P>In 1988, an unusual coalition began to take shape on Canada's Vancouver
Island. As far as its members know, the Tin Wis Coalition - which took its
name from the site of its first meeting, near the British Columbia town
of Tofino - is the first working coalition of timber industry workers, Native
Americans, and environmentalists. The purpose of the coalition was to find
solutions to problems arising from competing claims on timberland, which
the members of the coalition tended to see variously as an economic resource,
an ancestral home and sacred refuge, and an irreplaceable wilderness.</P>

<P>The common ground for these three groups is the desire for sustainability,
which they define as &quot;that which endures.&quot; The timber workers
want enduring jobs and meaningful work. The First Nations want to preserve
their sovereignty and way of life, which has been imperiled by the advance
of the nonnative immigrants. And the environmentalists want to preserve
vulnerable ecosystems. What the Tin Wis participants have discovered is
that all of their problems can be traced to a common source: an economic
system run amuck. The dominant economic system, including both capitalism
and Eastern bloc-style socialism, is based on industrialization as the core
principle of development. The motive force is not the quality of the product,
or the well-being of the workers or the environment, but expansion. A failure
of the Gross National Product to grow is considered unquestionably bad news.</P>

<P>For owners, growth means increasing profits. This can be done by driving
workers to be more productive, or by cutting costs of production, which
often means eliminating workers or cutting their wages. Native cultures
don't fit well with this kind of world view, and often don't want to, so
those in control simply eliminate the bothersome cultures or change them
to fit their needs. And of course, the environment is seen as simply the
source of needed materials and places to dump wastes, there for the taking.</P>

<P>Tin Wis has forged some remarkable agreements, especially when you consider
the diversity of its constituents. Their founding document is the Tin Wis
Accord, which was signed by all participants in February, 1989:</P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER>THE TIN WIS ACCORD</P>

<P>1. We commit ourselves to active support for the recognition, by all
non-Native governments, of aboriginal title and rights; and for the immediate
commencement of governmental and community processes to negotiate treaties
between Native nations and non-Native governments. We recognize that these
rights have not been and cannot be extinguished.</P>

<P>2. We further commit ourselves to develop and implement a process of
learning and sharing within and between Native and non-Native communities
and organizations, with a goal of developing trust and a shared vision about
how we can justly and sustainably share in this Earth. This includes a process
of learning about the full meaning of terms like democracy, community, local
control and ownership.</P>

<P>3. In accordance with the above, we further commit ourselves to develop
and implement the mechanisms for Native people, trade unionists, environmentalists,
women, youth and others to work together on a regional basis to resolve
resource development and environmental issues and conflicts and to further
the process of developing a &quot;people's&quot; alternative to the policies
of the present government.</P>

<P>At a second conference, in October 1990, the participants agreed on a
number of other points:</P>

<P>* The role of the coalition would be that of facilitating, at the community
level, a process of social consensus building towards democratic control
in our communities and regions, within the context of developing ecological
sustainability;</P>

<P>* Achieving solidarity particularly among native, labor, environmentalists,
and social justice activists is essential for building democratic, sustainable
communities;</P>

<P>* Undertaking a program of education within community groups around such
concerns as the effects of corporate control, privatization, deregulation,
and similar threats, as well as the nature of the global environmental crisis
and the fragility of local bio-systems;</P>

<P>* Encouraging the development of long term sustainability plans for our
communities and regions; and</P>

<P>* Promoting constitutional and legislative change by forming working
groups to look at such things as proposed changes to the municipal act and
the forestry act, as well as the entrenchment of aboriginal title in the
Constitution.</P>

<P>The working groups have been actively involved in a number of projects,
and have seen some success begin to build. Of particular note has been the
work of the forest practices group, which has produced a draft Forest Stewardship
Act to govern the use of forest resources. This draft is now being circulated
for commentary and revision.</P>

<P>The Tin Wis Coalition is proving that traditional &quot;enemies&quot;
can work together effectively, and that their interests are not so disparate
as they once imagined.</P>

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER><A NAME="Tedesko"></A>Field Report:<BR>
Community Development In El Salvador</H2>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><I>Suzanne Tedesko</I></P>

<P>Leaving behind the glitter and hype of a North American Christmas, in
December, 1991 our delegation of eight women from Northern California and
Seattle traveled to meet with women's groups in El Salvador (and elsewhere
in Central America) to hear their stories and offer support. Each of us
carried financial donations and extra suitcases filled with supplies and
materials - wooden puzzles, Legos, and art supplies to stock the fledgling
day-care centers and schools we would visit. Bags brimmed with contraceptives
of every variety, complete with Spanish instructions. Still other crates
contained medical supplies, directions for making and using solar cookers,
and miscellaneous items we thought might be useful.</P>

<P>We arrived in San Salvador at an auspicious time. After twelve years
of civil war, the country was at last poised for peace, and thousands of
Salvadoran refugees living in the US had returned for the holidays to visit
their families and deliver savings to their loved ones. Negotiators for
the government and FMLN &quot;guerrillas&quot; were meeting at UN headquarters
in New York to sign an historic accord.</P>

<P>My personal agenda for the trip included learning as much as I could
about family planning [at the request of <I>IC</I>, for issue #31]. We had
a chance to discuss family planning openly with members of CONAMUS, a powerful
women's organization that operates a gynecological clinic and has recently
opened El Salvador's first shelter for abused women and children. Their
work is hindered (as is family planning in many Central American countries)
by conservative religious attitudes that consider family planning a sin,
as well as by <I>machismo</I>. For example, many women must ask their husband's
permission to use birth control. And in two clinics for male sterilization
opened by the Salvadoran government, business was exceeding slow - only
one man in a month - so the clinics were soon forced to close.</P>

<P>Many of the women we met had lost children, husbands, or companions in
the war. I soon realized that in a country where 75,000 civilians had been
killed in the past twelve years, questions about birth control were frequently
tasteless or inappropriate.</P>

<P>Instead, I was irresistibly drawn to the broader issue of planning truly
democratic, humane communities. I learned that the Salvadorans were managing
to build, from the ground up, many new communities infused with energy and
vision. How could a people bloodied by war transform their brutal experiences
into something so positive and life-giving? This question seemed to hold
an important lesson for our times.</P>

<P>Despite the brain drain implicit in the loss of 75,000 lives, vigorous
new Salvadoran leaders have continued to emerge from within the popular
movement. Many of these leaders are women. There is a popular saying in
El Salvador: &quot;We don't bury our martyrs, we imitate them.&quot; Each
new martyr of the past decade has rekindled the popular spirit. This spirit
is rooted, not in malice, but in love for the country, belief in the Salvadoran
people and in the principle of social justice. Mediated through faith, it
has a &quot;can-do&quot; practicality which can move mountains.</P>

<P>In the capital city of San Salvador, thousands of people live in shacks
called &quot;champas&quot; made of cardboard or tin, framed with wire or
mattress springs from the city dump. A few lucky ones live in cinderblock
houses. These so-called &quot;marginal communities&quot; bear names like
&quot;Exodus of the 29th of October&quot; to immortalize the day that the
land was taken. Usually the communities begin on cliff-sides, on land nobody
wanted.</P>

<P>The Association of Marginalized Women (AMMA in Spanish) works with 22
marginal communities in an advocacy role and supports these communities
in their land take-overs. Most occupy unused land put aside by former president
Duarte for a land reform program that was never implemented. If the people
don't hold official title, they won't be given services like water or power.
Land take-overs are also occurring in Nicaragua, where one Managua community
- &quot;The Promised Land&quot; - accommodates 400 families.</P>

<P>We visited several marginal communities and watched their industrious
residents work with pick and shovel to move earth, dig trenches, and tap
into water and power lines. What little financial support they receive comes
from international nongovernmental agencies. Men and women work side by
side. Together, they took a moment to pose for our photographs, proud as
suburban gardeners showing off their prize roses.</P>

<P>Like the marginalized communities in San Salvador, rural areas of the
country are witnessing a similar phenomenon. In the past few years, Salvadoran
refugees who were living in refugee camps in Honduras, Panama and Nicaragua
have returned to take over land and build new agricultural communities from
the ground up. The largest and best known, Segundo Montes, was named in
honor of the Jesuit University professor of sociology who was assassinated
along with five other priests in 1989. Just three months before his death,
Dr. Montes visited this refugee community and confided, &quot;I thought
there was no future for El Salvador, but upon seeing your model of organization
and development, I've changed my mind.&quot;</P>

<P>Our delegation, too, found the repatriation communities we visited inspiring.
In less than nine months, the 250 residents of Nueva Esperanza have cleared
mosquito-infested land, created a water supply system, planted corn and
sorghum, built houses, and established an educational system. Their assembly
and working committees, which handle everything from building roads to protecting
human rights, represent participatory democracy at its finest.</P>

<P>These scattered victims of war had escaped El Salvador in 1982 to a refugee
camp in Nicaragua. From there they were sent to work alongside local farmers
in agricultural cooperatives newly created under the Sandinistas. In Nicaragua,
they learned their lessons well. After eight years acquiring community development
skills, they decided to return to El Salvador as a group. They had already
picked the name for their settlement - &quot;New Hope.&quot; Despite poverty,
deprivation and the continual harassment by soldiers from a military base
down the road, the community is thriving, fueled by community spirit and
the vast inner resources of its members.</P>

<P>I watched the next generation of Nueva Esperanza draw pictures for a
Seattle sister school, happy that these children in their &quot;classroom&quot;
under the spreading tree would be connected to my town. I listened as community
leaders shared their plans and dreams, moving their story along seamlessly
from one person to the next. No egos nudged or elbowed for position. This
was a fellowship of mind and heart. Painfully aware of the excesses of my
own, overly individualistic culture, I hoped I would be able to remember
everything I saw there.</P>

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER><A NAME="Schweitzer"></A>Just Another Fund-Raising Letter
- Not!</H2>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><I>Peter Schweitzer</I></P>

<P><I>The following was sent as a letter to people on the mailing list of
PLENTY, a non-governmental relief and development organization affiliated
with The Farm in Tennessee. PLENTY works with disadvantaged populations
in the areas of health care, sustainable agriculture, cottage industries,
indigenous culture and protection of the environment, with a special focus
on native people. Contact PLENTY at PO Box 2306, Davis CA 95617. </I></P>

<P>Dear PLENTY Friends,</P>

<P>It is with the deepest gratitude and appreciation that we greet you once
again. Gratitude for your ever so generous, heart-warming support, and appreciation
that you would entrust us with an investment in PLENTY's work. We will try
our best to nurture your investment into efficient and worthwhile action
on behalf of those who have asked for our assistance.</P>

<P>Every now and then I feel the need to make this formal pledge, because
I would never want you to think we take your support for granted. Furthermore,
some of the current news would tend to make any fair-minded person a little
skeptical about charities in general and development work in particular.
When we hear about executives of big charities getting salaries that are
15 times PLENTY's total payroll for four people, we scratch our heads, but
we're not surprised.</P>

<P>Then we catch wind of another mega-conference that we should attend.
The &quot;Earth Summit&quot; on global development and the environment coming
up in June in Rio De Janeiro will attract 6,000 delegates from 150 countries
including 100 &quot;heads of state.&quot; Adjacent to the Summit, a parallel
citizen's conference will be attended by 20,000 to 30,000 representatives
of the &quot;NGO&quot; [nongovernmental organization] Community. Let's say
30,000 people actually show up. At a cost in airfare and hotel expenses
conservatively figured at $1,500 each, that adds up to $45 million. Here's
another idea for spending $45,000,000: at an average installation cost of
about $10,000 for a village of 500 people, that's the price tag for bringing
potable water via a gravity-fed water system to 4,500 villages with two
and a quarter million people.</P>

<P>Ironically, it now appears that the people who attend the conference
may be exposed to the cholera epidemic ravaging South America, a disease
that is spreading at an alarming rate primarily due to the lack of potable,
running water. More than 26 million people in Brazil live without accessible
potable water.</P>

<P>Under &quot;Headlines We'd Like To See&quot; how about:</P>

<P>EARTH SUMMIT DELEGATES AGREE TO SPEND TRANSPORTATION AND HOTEL CONFERENCE
COSTS TO INSTALL POTABLE RUNNING WATER FOR 4,500 RURAL VILLAGES IN BRAZIL.</P>

<P>I don't want to pick on the Earth Summit. Heaven knows we need one, but
if individuals don't radically alter the way they consume and act and think
and treat each other, what can we expect from self-interested governments
and faceless bureaucratic agencies, or conferences and cocktail receptions?
PLENTY's contribution to this heralded gathering will be to submit <I>Climate
in Crisis </I>[by Albert Bates; see <I>IC</I> #29] as our statement for
the record.</P>

<P>Spring is here and it's time to hit the road again. Program Director
Chuck Haren is headed for Liberia in West Africa, where he'll be meeting
with small farmers and conducting soybean processing demonstrations and
generally looking for ways PLENTY can be of service to that struggling African
nation. His visit will be hosted by Imani House.</P>

<P>I'm going to Dominica with a computer and fax machine to be set up at
the new Carib Council Building our volunteers helped to construct. Then
on to St. Vincent, another Caribbean island with large Carib community,
and then to Guyana in our continuing quest to assist the Arawaks with their
economic and cultural development plans. I'll be videotaping the indigenous
people I meet as I go, and I'm going to be asking them to speak their minds
in answering the question, &quot;If you had a microphone wired up to broadcast
to the world, what would you say?&quot; Not a bad question for all of us
to consider.</P>

<P>Take care. We love you.</P>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Development, Heresy, And The Ecological Revolution</H1>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER><I>by David C. Korten</I></H4>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><I>David C. Korten, a contributing editor to IN CONTEXT and chief advisor
to us on this issue, has emerged as one of the world's most articulate spokesmen
on the issues of environment, development, and economics. He is a highly
credentialed and experienced consultant to international development agencies,
with a background that includes a doctorate in business management from
Stanford, a faculty position at Harvard's Graduate School of Business, a
staff position with the Ford Foundation and a consultancy with USAID. He
is founder and president of the People-Centered Development Forum - based
in Manila, but moving to New York City this year - and the author of </I>Getting
to the 21st Century: Voluntary Action and the Global Agenda<I>. (See </I>IC
<I>#28 for a lengthy interview, &quot;Beyond Bureaucracy.&quot;)</I></P>

<P><I>A different version of this &quot;open letter&quot; appeared first
as an article in </I>Development<I>, the journal of the Society for International
Development.</I></P>

<P>Five hundred years ago, when Columbus landed in the Western hemisphere,
the prevailing system of European thought maintained that our Earth was
flat and that the sun, stars, and planets revolved around it. Then in 1543,
the year of his death, Nicolas Copernicus published <I>Revolution of the
Celestial Spheres</I>, setting forth the thesis that the Earth is only one
among the planets that revolve around the sun - itself one of countless
such stars of the cosmos.</P>

<P>Copernicus spoke a humbling truth regarding the insignificance of humanity's
physical position among the stars - considered a heresy in its day and a
threat to many cherished institutions. His act and the resulting change
in perspective regarding man's place in the cosmos, deflating as it was
of a long-standing human arrogance, liberated Western society from a number
of debilitating intellectual and institutional constraints, ushered in the
age of science, and led to human accomplishments that have exceeded even
the most fanciful imaginings of the greatest thinkers of his day.</P>

<P>This was not, unfortunately, the end of our society's propensity toward
a debilitating - and, in our present case, potentially fatal - arrogance.
The highly evolved intelligence that produced the scientific revolution
and made possible the industrial age has given our species a decided competitive
advantage over other forms of life in the competition for ecological space
on this planet. This success has been of such magnitude as to lead us once
again into a trap of blinding arrogance - a belief that our technology makes
us the masters of nature and places us beyond the reach of natural law.</P>

<P>We now face the need for a new revolution in our self-perception and
institutions, an <I>ecological</I> revolution, with implications for human
behavior and institutions that may be more profound than those that followed
from the insights of Copernicus. While such a revolution will be certain
to bring its own trauma, there is substantial prospect that it may also
release a new era of progress as far beyond the current human imagination
as the accomplishments of the modern era would be to those who lived in
the Middle Ages. In the absence of such a revolution we will almost certainly
remain locked onto our present course of social and ecological disintegration
- the outcome of which may well make life in the Middle Ages look advanced.</P>

<P>Yet the countries likely to play the most influential roles in making
the choices we currently face - the industrialized countries of the North
- have committed the full weight of their political and economic resources
to policies that seriously threaten the future of our planet and its people.
These policies are built on three assumptions:</P>

<P>* Sustained <I>economic growth</I> is the key to human progress.</P>

<P>* <I>Integration and globalization of the world econom</I>y is a key
to growth and beneficial to all but a few narrow &quot;special interests.&quot;</P>

<P>* <I>International assistance and investment </I>work to build strong
economies in less fortunate nations and are important to the progress of
their people, especially the poor.</P>

<P>Unfortunately, these assumptions turn reality on its head; they are the
economic equivalent of maintaining that the sun revolves around the Earth,
when all the contemporary evidence points to the contrary. Policies based
on these assumptions are actively exacerbating poverty, environmental destruction,
and the disintegration of the social fabric in nearly every country of the
world. They are the antithesis of the policies required to support truly
sustainable development.</P>

<H4>ORTHODOXY AND HERESY</H4>

<P>These three assumptions, which also comprise the orthodoxy of the international
development community, have become so deeply embedded in the collective
belief system of most development institutions that to challenge them is
to set oneself apart - to commit heresy against the faith and its moral
foundations. Three heresies against mainstream development thought define
the foundational beliefs of the ecological revolution as it applies to the
development enterprise:</P>

<P><B>Growth is not the solution</B> * Sustained <I>economic growth</I>
is not possible, because human economic activity already fills the available
ecological space. Furthermore, economic growth is not the key to human progress.
Human well-being depends more on <I>how</I> available physical resources
are used than on increasing the rates of their extraction and consumption.</P>

<P><B>Economic integration is part of the problem</B> * Integration of the
global economy will not result in growth in a world whose ecological space
is filled. It will erode institutional capacities to deal appropriately
with ecological limits. It will also encourage unsustainable ecological
exploitation and widen the gap between rich and poor.</P>

<P><B>Foreign assistance and investment are making things worse</B> * Increased
financial flows from North to South stifle sustainable development in the
South. The key to Southern progress is to <I>reduce</I> the outflow of ecological
resources from the South that feed the North's overconsumption and <I>increase</I>
the South's access to and control over beneficial technologies.</P>

<P>Few discussions of sustainable development seriously raise such issues
- consequently revealing how far we remain from dealing in realistic terms
with the environmental and social crisis that currently grips our world.
Let's examine each heresy in more detail.</P>

<H4>THE WORLD IS FULL, NOT &quot;EMPTY&quot;</H4>

<P>What may be the ecological revolution's most important intellectual treatise
to date recently emerged from an unlikely source: the World Bank, contemporary
mother church of orthodox development theology. Edited by Robert Goodland,
Herman Daly, and Salah El Serafy (1991) and issued as a working paper in
July 1991 by the Environment Department of the World Bank, <I>Environmentally
Sustainable Economic Development: Building on Brundtland</I> challenges
the most fundamental premises of that theology, as set forward in the Bank's
<I>World Development Report 1991</I>.</P>

<P>The centerpiece of the Goodland, Daly, El Serafy heresy is the observation
that current economic theory and policy are based on an assumption of an
&quot;empty world,&quot; i.e., a world in which the scale of human economic
activity is sufficiently small relative to the scale of the Earth's ecological
system that its impact is inconsequential. The contributors to this unusual
collection (who include two Nobel laureates in economics) document the increasingly
evident reality that this assumption no longer holds. We now live in a <I>full</I>
world, one in which our aggregate economic activity fills the available
ecological space.</P>

<P>Much of what we measure as economic growth depends on increasing the
flow of physical materials - such as petroleum, minerals, biomass and water
- through our economic system. We depend on Nature to supply these materials
and absorb the resulting wastes. Nature's capacity in this regard has proven
to be enormous, but not unlimited. We have now reached Nature's limit -
and systems of economic thought and management based on the absence of such
limits must be replaced. To assume that economic growth, as we currently
define it, can continue without limit is to believe the impossible.</P>

<P>Arguments that our technology frees us from these limits assume that
what man produces serves as an adequate substitute for what nature produces.
While this is true to an extent - we have made considerable progress in
reducing the amount of scarce physical materials required to serve specific
human needs - such possibilities also face natural limits. In most instances
natural and man-made capital are complementary, <I>not </I>substitutes.
In the end, the sawmill has no function without a forest. The fishing boat,
no matter how advanced, has no function without fish (Daly, 1990).</P>

<P>Is it the rich or the poor who bear the primary responsibility for the
environmental crisis? The debate is readily resolved: according to Worldwatch
Institute, each American, on average, accounts for the consumption of 52
kilos of physical materials each day (Durning, 1991, pp. 160-61). This contrasts
starkly with the estimated average consumption of 11/2 kilos of locally-collected
biomass by the one billion inhabitants of our planet who live in absolute
poverty.</P>

<P>Viewed from this perspective, the argument that poverty is a primary
cause of environmental destruction - and that economic growth is the key
to increased environmental responsibility - is clearly perverse. We are
no longer talking about an expanding pie of resource consumption. Rather,
we are talking about the allocation of a finite flow of physical resources
through our economic system to meet the needs of the more than 5 billion
inhabitants of our planet - destined to grow to 12.5 billion before stabilizing
in the next century.</P>

<P>Our systems of economic management, currently geared to <I>increasing
system throughput</I> (growth), must now be transformed to concentrate on
<I>reallocating the use and benefits of existing levels of throughput to
optimize human well-being</I> (development) at equitable, and relatively
modest, per capita levels of physical consumption.</P>

<P>In other words, there is enough for all of Earth's people to live well,
though not extravagantly, at current levels of resource use - but only if
we share what we currently have with each other <I>and</I> if population
growth is brought under control with all due speed.</P>

<P>Much of the change can be accomplished simply by reducing <I>unnecessary</I>
consumption, which simultaneously reduces income needs, potentially freeing
time for those activities that bring <I>real</I> happiness, including family,
friends, and voluntary community service. &quot;Modern&quot; society has
tended to sacrifice these satisfactions to a compulsive drive for financial
success. The result is a sense of social, psychological, and spiritual emptiness
that multitudes of advertisers assure us will be satisfied by the purchase
of their particular gadget or status symbol. The greater the emptiness,
the greater the drive for more income to purchase the goods expected to
fill it - an endless, futile, and self-destructive quest.</P>

<P>This is not to suggest that the changes in lifestyle and economic organization
required will be easy for us. The barriers posed by existing social values
and institutions are enormous. The end result, however, need not involve
significant deprivation. The changes are, in fact, more likely to be <I>liberating</I>
- particularly to the extent that they result in freedom from economic slavery,
restore a sense of community and the beauty of our environment, and encourage
our further spiritual, intellectual, and social development.</P>

<H4>ECONOMIC INTEGRATION: A DESTRUCTIVE ACCELERATOR</H4>

<P>The catechism of contemporary development theology is nowhere more clearly
articulated than in the World Bank's <I>World Development Report 1991</I>.
Here the Bank presents its assessment of the lessons of forty years of development
experience and concludes that the market is the key to economic growth.
Thus it calls on governments to complete the integration of their national
economies into the <I>global</I> economy by removing all existing barriers
to the free flow of trade and capital across borders; focus their efforts
on investing in social and physical infrastructure; eliminate &quot;labor
market rigidities&quot; (read unions and minimum wage legislation); and
allow international market forces to play themselves out locally without
government interference. That economic growth is both good and feasible
is taken in the Bank's report to be self-evident.</P>

<P>Whether such measures would produce socially beneficial growth in an
empty world is, however, no more than a hypothetical issue, of interest
primarily to theoreticians and historians. Our present concern is with the
consequences of such policies in a <I>full</I> world, for that is our present
and future reality.</P>

<P>In a full world, growth-centered policies that presume to expand the
economic pie serve primarily to intensify competition for the finite pool
of available ecological resources. In an unregulated market, such competition
has two consequences: control of resources becomes increasingly concentrated
in the hands of those with economic power, and the gap between rich and
poor grows at an accelerating rate. The sustainable limits of resource use
will be exceeded, the regenerative capacities of the ecosystem will be systematically
degraded, and the total real wealth of the society, as defined by its future
productive potential, will contract. This is exactly what is now happening,
and the continued movement toward unregulated global economic integration
can only accelerate these trends.</P>

<P>In an integrated global economy, goods and capital flow to the locality
offering the most immediate prospects for short-term profits. Governments
lose their ability to regulate and manage their own economies in the public
interest and, in fact, become pitted in competition among themselves to
attract investors. The &quot;winning&quot; country is the one that offers
the cheapest and most compliant labor; the weakest environmental, health
and safety standards; the lowest taxes; the most fully developed infrastructure;
and the least restricted access to natural resources. Labor loses its bargaining
power, resources are extracted at well below their true value, and the costs
of pollution and toxic dumping are passed onto the community with impunity.
Again, these are the forces we see at work throughout the world in Northern,
as well as Southern, countries.</P>

<H4>FOREIGN ASSISTANCE: AN UNSUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT</H4>

<P>Almost as sacred as the belief in growth and free trade is the belief
that increased financial flows from North to South are crucial to address
the South's social and environmental needs. In the name of development,
money has been flowing into the South to build dams, tree plantations, export-oriented
agricultural estates, and mining projects. A few benefit. The many suffer.
And at the moment, the <I>net</I> capital flow is actually from South to
North - at the rate of some $50 to $60 billion per year.</P>

<P>But financial flows, whatever their direction, mask more fundamental
underlying realities. These include the fact that many projects funded with
foreign assistance have been overly expensive, have not worked at all or
worked badly; and many - even those labeled &quot;environmental&quot; projects
- have had detrimental social and environmental consequences.</P>

<P>More important, however, is the fact that most development assistance
agencies are actively promoting a development model that in the current
context serves mainly the interests of transnational capital and its allies
among the elites of the South. It is the very antithesis of sustainable,
people-centered development.</P>

<P>Finally, the loans made in the name of international aid add to the indebtedness
that allows international agencies to dictate the economic policies of borrowing
countries in line with their view of the world and their interests.</P>

<P>Foreign investment is no better. Attracting free-floating international
capital may provide a temporary economic spurt, but this is not to be confused
with <I>development</I> - which is a process by which a community or country
develops the capacity to manage its <I>own</I> resources in a sustainable
way to meet the needs of its own people. The development success of Japan,
Taiwan, and South Korea was based on strong, protected domestic markets,
gaining control over technology, and building a domestic capital base and
entrepreneurial capability. They at no time demonstrated an interest in
turning their domestic economies over to footloose international capital.</P>

<P>Prevailing aid and investment policies both mask the reality that the
poverty of the South is not a consequence of inadequate financial flows
from the North. It is a consequence of an unbalanced system of international
economic relationships that allows the North to extract a substantial portion
of the South's share of the world's ecological resources to support its
wasteful lifestyles.</P>

<H4>SUSTAINABILITY AGENDAS, SOUTH AND NORTH</H4>

<P>An appropriate agenda for sustainable development in Southern countries
- as growing numbers of grassroots organizations are coming to realize -
is to concentrate on regaining control of their remaining ecological resources
to meet domestic needs, beginning with food, clothing, shelter, and basic
social services. With few exceptions, this is within their means - if their
resources are properly organized and used.</P>

<P>However, they will need to:</P>

<UL>
  <LI>reduce dependency on conventional forms of aid;
  <LI>eliminate long-term international borrowing;
  <LI>reduce export dependence, military spending, and arms imports;
  <LI>demand the freest possible access to beneficial technologies controlled
  by the North;
  <LI>repudiate odious debts that involved fraud and the misuse of public
  funds for private gain, or shift the repayment of obligations to the individuals
  who benefited (see Adams, 1991);
  <LI>negotiate a significant reduction or cancellation of remaining long-term
  debt;
  <LI>bring population growth under control; and
  <LI>radically restructure the allocation of available resources and assets.
</UL>

<P>We in the North have an obligation, as well as a survival need, to facilitate
these adjustments. First and foremost, we must <I>drastically</I> reduce
our dependence on the South's ecological resources and learn to live within
our own means. This will include working to restructure the international
trade and financial system to return to Southern countries control over
their own economies, and to price environmental resources at full cost levels
in international markets. The North cannot return to the South the wealth
it has already consumed. It can make partial restitution, however, by giving
the South the rights, knowledge and skills required to make full use of
the North's store of beneficial technologies.</P>

<P>North and South must work together to create a fair and balanced international
trading system, facilitate the widest possible sharing and access to beneficial
technologies, encourage broadly distributed local control of capital, and
establish an interlinked system of self-managing, locally controlled, democratically
governed, and ecologically self-reliant local economies that provide for
the fullest human development - but not the wasteful consumption - of their
members. There must also be cooperative action toward the collective regulation
of transnational corporations to enforce anti-trust measures, to assure
adherence to local and international social and environmental standards,
and to enforce the collection of taxes by appropriate authorities.</P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><HR WIDTH="30%"></P>

<P>These will not be easy or simple changes. Willis Harman has written that
&quot;... the Copernican revolution amounted to a successful challenge to
the entire system of ancient authority ...&quot; (Harman, 1988, p. 7). The
ecological revolution presents a similar challenge to many of the most powerful
of contemporary institutions, which remain resolutely committed to the system
of belief underlying their authority. In the end, however, they cannot survive
the destruction of the society on which they depend, any more than society
can survive the destruction of the ecosystem on which it depends.</P>

<P>The heresies of the ecological revolution have not found their way onto
the agenda of the so-called Earth Summit in Brazil. Indeed there are powerful
interests, including the US delegation, who have been intent on assuring
that they do not. Consequently, while the Summit may produce some important
agreements, it will almost certainly fall far short of confronting the real
issues of sustainable development and the profound changes that our global
economic system must undergo if we are to reverse our current course. And
of course, these issues will not go away after June 1992.</P>

<P>It is imperative that those of us in citizens groups engaged with environment
and development - and, indeed, all concerned members of the human family
- strive to bring attention to these more fundamental - yet ignored - issues,
project them into the broad public debate, and take action to facilitate
this necessary ecological revolution. If we meld the lessons of our experience,
and do not shrink from embracing the truth of heresy, we can work together
to create a more just and sustainable global partnership.</P>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Barnstorming For Balance</H1>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER><I>by Alan AtKisson</I></H4>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><I>Al Gore has a well-earned reputation for being the most outspoken
proponent of sustainability on the Senate floor. His credentials include
staunch support for the Earth Summit (he will lead the Senate delegation
to Rio) and international diplomatic initiatives (Gore helped found an international
association of lawmakers concerned with the environment), as well as a failed
bid to run for president in 1988 on what began as an environmental platform.</I></P>

<P><I>His voice in the Senate has become a bit more lonely since Colorado
Senator Tim Wirth, another outspoken voice for environmental sanity, announced
his decision not to run for re-election. But lately Gore has been attempting
to speak not just more loudly, but more deeply, on the issues that matter
most to him - and to all the rest of us concerned with a sustainable way
of life.</I></P>

<P><I>IC executive editor Alan AtKisson tagged along briefly with Gore during
his whirlwind book tour to promote </I>Earth in the Balance: Ecology and
the Human Spirit,<I> published by Houghton Mifflin in Spring 1992. <BR>
</I></P>

<P>I walk up to the front door at KIRO News in Seattle, where I'm to meet
Senator Al Gore and travel with him between radio stations for a brief,
in-transit interview about his new book, <I>Earth in the Balance: Ecology
and the Human Spirit</I>. I'm nervous; I've never interviewed a senator
before. I've also just finished the book only an hour ago, and it was so
surprisingly profound, self-revealing, and courageous in tone that it caused
me to leap out of my chair and say &quot;Yes!&quot; out loud. So I'm also
politically in love, and wondering whether the man will measure up to the
image I've recently constructed of him.</P>

<P>The door is locked; Gore himself, chatting with someone just inside,
opens it for me. I introduce myself, shake his hand - it's a big, beefy,
very presidential hand. JoAnn, Gore's Seattle publicity person, comes up
and points him toward a camera for a quick TV interview, then invites me
to follow them back to the radio newsroom.</P>

<P>In the KIRO newsroom, Gore's interview has been delayed. CNN is about
to broadcast the verdict in the Jeffrey Dahmer trial, and we're all in front
of the monitors, watching CNN while KIRO broadcasts the soundtrack. Dahmer,
who committed a series of grotesque murders, is pronounced sane, which means
he'll get life in prison instead of life in an insane asylum. Somehow, most
people take this to be more &quot;just.&quot; I note with irony that a comedian
I'd heard recently was telling Jeffrey Dahmer jokes. Gore grimaces, and
remarks that it's probably a way of dealing with the sadness and fear around
such a horror story.</P>

<P>The interview with the two radio hosts - which I tape off the monitor
in the studio next door - goes quickly. Gore is informal, yet polished;
he's trying to communicate in a fairly genuine fashion, but he's clearly
in command of his public persona. Here's how Gore sums up his basic message
for the AM radio audience:</P>

<P>&quot;I decided not to run for president this time, not for political
reasons, but for personal reasons. Almost three years ago my family and
I had a shattering experience when my son was almost killed [after being
struck by a car]. And the process of healing that he, and we, have been
going through since then is just inconsistent with me ripping myself out
of their lives to run for president full time.</P>

<P>&quot;I actually started writing down ideas for this book in his hospital
room, and after his accident I began to question a lot of things in my own
life and set some new priorities. After visiting the front lines of the
ecological crisis all over the world - and as I write in the book, I went
to the North Pole to talk with scientists about the thinning of the ice
there, the South Pole, the Amazon, the Aral Sea - I began to look inward.
I began to see the patterns in my own life that contribute to this crisis.
A lot of us take three thousand pounds of metal with us everywhere we go.
All of the oil well fires put together in Kuwait on the worst day represented
one percent of the pollution we put into the Earth's atmosphere every single
day. We've got to make some changes. I see this book as a declaration of
all-out commitment to do what's needed....</P>

<P>&quot;I argue that we've got to make the saving of the Earth's environment
the central organizing principle for the post-Cold War world. In the last
half-century, the central organizing principle in the western democracies
was the defeat of communism: the interstate highway bill was the <I>Defense</I>
Interstate Highway Bill, federal aid to education came in response to the
launching of Sputnik, and the like. Now, if we look at this new turning
point in world history, it seems obvious to me that saving the Earth's environment
has to be the new common purpose that brings the world together.&quot;</P>

<P>The interviewers ask him how that message can play in a political system
increasingly seen as broken, and Gore bemoans the fact that the average
&quot;sound-bite&quot; on TV and radio these days is 6.9 seconds: &quot;I
can't even say 'global ecological crisis' in 6.9 seconds.&quot; He says
the American people are hungry for &quot;real dialogue,&quot; and he notes
that &quot;writing this book has been ... a liberating experience for me.
It has allowed me to address these issues in a lot more depth, and what
I'm finding in response is an overwhelming reaction.&quot; (Later I will
hear him say that it's also liberating because &quot;I've put such personal
things into this book, and they've now printed so many copies, I can't take
'em back.&quot;) After ten minutes, it's time for a commercial break; the
KIRO interviewers get their books autographed.</P>

<P>We whisk off to KUOW, a local NPR affiliate and university station. This
car ride was the time slotted for my interview with Gore, but first JoAnn
breaks the news to him that there's no time in the schedule for lunch, or
dinner. It's interviews straight through to 10 p.m. &quot;Want an apple?&quot;
she asks. &quot;Nah,&quot; says Gore, and grabs a small box of chocolates
out of her snack bag. He inhales one, then offers me the box with a distinctly
impish grin. Of course I take one, though I worry that in so doing I've
breached some journalistic code of ethics. The drive to the University of
Washington gives me time for very few questions:</P>

<P><B>Alan:</B> <I>What's your current assessment of the prospects for the
Earth Summit?</I></P>

<P><B>Al:</B> Well, I've just been named the chairman of the US Senate delegation
to the Earth Summit. And I think that President Bush will, in the next few
months, be shamed into going. He will belatedly discover that the California
primary occurs right in the middle of the Earth Summit, and that every other
major leader in the world - and all the television networks in the world
- are going to be there, and that his absence will be an enormous political
liability. He will be dragged kicking and screaming by circumstances, as
he normally is whenever the global environment is at stake. It will be too
late for him to adopt any meaningful substantive position, which he doesn't
want to do anyway. Then, either the Earth Summit will blow up as a failure,
or, more likely, it will muddle through toward a meaningless place-holding
document that squanders the enormous opportunity that the Summit represents.</P>

<P><B>Alan:</B> <I>In that case, what do you see as the next national/international
political steps toward realizing something like the global plan to rescue
the environment that you describe in your book?</I></P>

<P><B>Al:</B> Well, there's still a chance that the Earth Summit will prove
to be successful somehow. The outcomes I mentioned are the ones that are
the most likely. But if we don't get a meaningful treaty signed, then we'll
have to continue the negotiations and set a new deadline of some sort to
try to force action.</P>

<P><B>Alan:</B> <I>In the book you hit on something that you probably don't
get to talk about much on the Senate floor - the idea of civilization being
basically &quot;dysfunctional,&quot; like an addictive personality. How
has that message been received?</I></P>

<P><B>Al:</B> I find that people who are familiar with that way of thinking
respond quite enthusiastically to that section of the book. But those who
are not conversant with that way of thinking - and there are many, particularly
among the older generations - read through it, find it interesting, but
aren't really sure what it's about. A lot of people in older generations
still don't think there's such a thing as the unconscious.</P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><HR WIDTH="30%"></P>

<P>We arrive at the next radio station, and the conversation drifts into
musings about why Seattleites read so many books, and how the mountain ranges
and Puget Sound determine the character of the place. Gore, in a rolling,
orator's baritone, quotes the poet William Blake: &quot;There are two voices
here. One is the mountains, one the sea. Each, a mighty voice.&quot;</P>

<P>This second interview is a half-hour taping for a show called &quot;Seattle
Afternoon.&quot; The interviewer wants Gore to explain his &quot;Global
Marshall Plan.&quot; &quot;I can ask you questions if you want,&quot; he
adds, but Gore says, &quot;No, I'll just start,&quot; and plunges into his
rap, sounding like an <I>IN CONTEXT </I>contributing editor - talking about
developing and sharing ecologically friendly technology, reducing our consumption,
changing the &quot;economic rules of the road,&quot; empowering women in
the third world, doing global environmental education, getting over our
&quot;strange way of thinking that we're separate from nature.&quot; Would
Gore continue to talk like this if he were elected president? Would the
country - and the world - listen?</P>

<P>After the interview, I hitch a ride downtown with Gore and the publicist.
Like every other interviewer I've observed today, I turn the tape recorder
off so I can ask some questions off the record. Gore with his guard a little
down is even more forthright, witty, engaging. We talk about various Democratic
convention scenarios and simmering political scandals - no surprises, but
Gore confirms my sense that there's a wide gap between public and private
conversation on politically hot topics. Then he's back to studying his grueling
book-tour schedule, which Gore calls &quot;a cakewalk&quot; compared to
presidential campaigning.</P>

<P>I see my name on his neatly typed schedule cards, which tell him exactly
what he'll be doing when, with whom, all day long. This is a lifestyle beyond
Day-Runner. My &quot;short interview&quot; has stretched to a couple of
hours of tag-along. We're stuck in Saturday traffic, inching toward his
hotel, and Gore decides to hoof it. After gracious thank-you's and another
muscular hand-shake (some politicians have hands like Arnold Schwarzenegger's
body), I watch him weave through traffic. I find myself wondering if this
person - intelligent, polished, caring, self-questioning, but still very
ambitious and highly political - will ever be president. Al Gore wants to
be president some day, and most people who want to be president give me
the willies. But if given the chance, would I have voted for him in 1992?
Absolutely.</P>

<H2><HR ALIGN=LEFT></H2>

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER><A NAME="talk"></A>The Tectonic Process Of Change</H2>

<P><I>The following is excerpted from a talk given by Senator Al Gore at
Elliott Bay Books in Seattle, WA, February 1992.</I></P>

<P>The final third of my book [outlining Gore's five-point plan to rescue
the global environment] is focused on what can be done to solve [our environmental]
problem. It is within the boundary of political pragmatism. I admit it's
on the <I>outer edges</I> of that boundary, but the definition of what is
politically possible is expanding, because our ways of thinking are changing.</P>

<P>I have a model of change based on the metaphor of tectonic plates: two
plates will press against one another, and the pressure builds up without
any apparent change on the surface, until the friction locking the edges
together eases just a bit. Suddenly one plate moves over the other, submerges
it, and the shock waves knock over buildings.</P>

<P>Ideas can move through history in the same way. In Europe, the idea of
communism came under enormous pressure from the idea of freedom, and that
pressure built up along a fault line running right through Berlin. Not much
of the change was visible on the surface until the idea of freedom reached
a critical mass, and then suddenly and decisively it moved over communism,
submerging it, and the shock waves knocked over the Berlin Wall - and all
the political structures of Eastern Europe.</P>

<P>Now the idea that we are <I>separate</I> - from each other, from the
future, and from the Earth - is under enormous pressure from an opposing
idea: that we are connected to the web of life. That we have obligations
to each other, and to those who come after us. That the future is not to
be discounted, but to be believed in. That we are entitled to have faith.
That there <I>will be</I> a future. People who believe in this idea are
tempted to succumb to frustration when they don't see change. But part of
having faith is believing that as more people accept this idea, and as it
reaches a critical mass, it will reach the point where it suddenly and decisively
submerges that older way of thinking.</P>

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER><A NAME="review"></A>Searching Our Political Soul</H2>

<P>&quot;Every culture is like a huge extended family,&quot; writes Al Gore
in <I>Earth in the Balance</I>, &quot;and perhaps nothing more determines
a culture's distinct character than [its] rules and assumptions about life.&quot;</P>

<P>This important new book is easily the most comprehensive and enlightening
statement on the environment ever to issue from a sitting US senator and
presidential contender. Gore attempts to articulate - with a rare combination
of sensitivity, courage, and realpolitik -some of the most dysfunctional
of those rules and assumptions in our own culture, and to map a political
path forward. In fact, the book amounts to a public act of soul-searching
that stretches the boundaries of mainstream political discourse.</P>

<P>Part I, &quot;Balance at Risk,&quot; synthesizes the best current science
in several key areas of ecological concern: climate change, toxic waste,
threats to biodiversity, and other technical topics are described in very
readable and engaging - if harrowing - terms. Gore is a former newspaper
reporter and a gifted storyteller, and he skillfully mixes scientific data
with anecdotes from his travels to global hot-spots and research stations.
These chapters should convince anyone of the seriousness of our predicament.</P>

<P>Part II, &quot;The Search for Balance,&quot; digs into the cultural,
psychological, and even spiritual issues that undergird our physical plunder
of the planet. Gore considers the obstacles to progress inherent in our
economic and political systems, our relationship to technology, and our
consumption-driven lifestyle. He surveys the messages of stewardship present
in most of the world's major religions, including his own Christianity,
and shares something of his personal theology: &quot;It is my own belief
that the image of God can be seen in every corner of creation, even in us,
but only faintly. By gathering in the mind's eye all of creation, one can
perceive the image of the Creator vividly.&quot;</P>

<P>Finally in Part III, &quot;Striking the Balance,&quot; Gore maps out
his plan for making the gargantuan changes in human civilization that are
required to return to harmony with the planet. He outlines five &quot;strategic
goals&quot;:</P>

<P>* &quot;stabilizing world population&quot; (by making birth control technologies
universally available, lowering infant mortality, and empowering and educating
women);</P>

<P>* &quot;the rapid creation and development of environmentally appropriate
technologies&quot; (to be shared freely with developing nations);</P>

<P>* &quot;a comprehensive and ubiquitous change in the 'economic rules
of the road' by which we measure the impact of our decisions on the environment&quot;;</P>

<P>* &quot;the negotiation and approval of a new generation of international
agreements&quot; (regulatory frameworks, specific prohibitions, enforcement
mechanisms, and incentives that are sensitive to differences in developing
and developed nations); and</P>

<P>* &quot;establishment of a cooperative plan for educating the world's
citizens about our global environment&quot; (includes research as well as
dissemination, with the ultimate goal of changing the relationship of civilization
to the environment).</P>

<P>The discussion and specific actions Gore delineates under each goal carry
a surprising amount of the thinking represented at the front lines of the
sustainability movement - reorganizing economics &agrave; la Herman Daly,
for example, or pushing energy efficiency &agrave; la Amory Lovins. The
bibliography is full of such familiar faces.</P>

<P>Still, I have some quarrels with him: Gore stresses the role of government
overmuch and neglects the pivotal role of voluntary action and nongovernmental
citizens groups. He nick-names his five-point strategy a &quot;Global Marshall
Plan,&quot; an unhappy reference to the massive industrial investments that
helped create our problems. But better that we quarrel about <I>how </I>to
&quot;rescue the global environment&quot; (as we do it) than about <I>whether</I>
it must be done. Read this book, give it to your friends, and pray that
many more political leaders have the courage to choose real hope by confronting
the hard truth, instead of perpetuating a dysfunctional fantasy.</P>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER><I>an Interview with Lt. General Henry J. Hatch, by Alan
AtKisson</I></H4>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><I>Lt. General Henry J. Hatch commands the US Army Corps of Engineers,
a job that also includes serving as the Army's Staff Engineer and, as of
a few years ago, its Staff Environmentalist. In the past few years he has
led the Corps of Engineers through a significant change in direction that
has involved embracing the concept of &quot;sustainable development&quot;
and, in some cases, actually working to undo the environmental damage caused
by the Corps in an earlier era. He has said that the Corps must begin to
think of itself as the Corps of </I>Environmental<I> Engineers - which would
give a whole new meaning to the green of Army uniforms.</I></P>

<P><I>The Corps - and of course the Army as a whole - is not the first organization
that comes to mind when dreaming about regreening the Earth. And even the
Corps' current work to mitigate environmental damage often comes under fire
from critics. But within our large public institutions, change of the sort
being promoted by Hank Hatch is absolutely vital. It deserves our appreciation
and merits close attention (as well as continuing constructive criticism).</I></P>

<P><I>General Hatch's views on sustainable development differ from others'
in this issue, but within the context of the US Army, they are nothing less
than transformational. I spoke with him by telephone from Seattle - a conversation
that was made possible, in part, by electricity generated by Corps-run dams
on the Columbia River.</I></P>

<P><B>Alan:</B> <I>How did the Corps come to recraft its mission in the
direction of sustainable development? </I></P>

<P><B>Hank:</B> Well, first, the Corps is not an independent entity and
is not really in a position to craft its mission. But it is certainly a
responsible public service agency. It has the obligation to do what it can,
in concert with higher authorities, to redirect its efforts to be more responsive
to the needs of our society.</P>

<P>Throughout its history as a public organization, the Corps' duty has
been to respond to the needs of those it serves. In the last century, it
was exploring, mapping, and chronicling the wonders of the West; in the
earlier half of this one, it was constructing massive flood control devices
and structures in response to perceived needs for channelization, dredging,
and development of navigable waterways and deep-water ports. Rather than
acting independently, the Corps was responding to the direction set by Administrations
and Congresses.</P>

<P>It occurred to us a few years ago that if we didn't project ourselves
out far in advance, we would always be lagging behind, years or even decades,
in our response to what our nation and the world needs. We started a strategic
thinking process, something that is perhaps not terribly common among public
sector agencies. We recognized that the environment was a clearly emerging
area of need, and that what we had been doing before wasn't going to be
sufficient. We had been working to comply with<B> </B>environmental requirements
as we pursued our traditional business, then adding environmental values
to a project, in some cases late in the game.<B> </B>So we decided to approach
the environment from a different angle altogether:<B> </B>to recognize that
our nation and the world face, and will continue to face, an environmental
challenge, and to include directly addressing environmental issues in the
mission of the Corps.</P>

<P>If environmentally sustainable development is going to be a need of our
society, then we need engineers to participate. As the largest public-sector
engineering agency in the free world, the Corps of Engineers ought to be
a piece of that. Without engineers, environmental challenges and problems
will not be solved.</P>

<P><B>Alan:</B> <I>Despite your acknowledgement that you are responsive
to your superiors, it seems the Corps' position, as you have articulated
it, is very forward-thinking compared to other large agencies in the government
sector. Is that the case, and if so, how does that sit with your superiors
in the Army and the Administration?</I></P>

<P><B>Hank:</B> We have perhaps been more proactive than some other agencies
in extending our vision and planning horizon beyond the next five-year program
or the next Presidential term. We try to recognize that our institution
will probably be in existence for the next two hundred years, as it has
been for the last two hundred. And so, yes, we've pushed the limits somewhat.
We've continued to stretch the envelope of the past vision of what the Corps
of Engineers is, and what its purposes are. We have been both supported
and directed by our higher authorities in this regard. Do we always agree?
No. Do we generally?<B> </B>I would say yes. And I would say we've been
responsive to the direction I get from our current Commander-in-Chief. I
do read his lips.</P>

<P><B>Alan:</B> <I>You've said in previous interviews that there is a direct
connection between sustainable development and national security. Could
you explain that connection?</I></P>

<P><B>Hank:</B> One of the easiest ways to do that would be to reference
the August, 1991 version of a document entitled &quot;The National Security
Strategy of the United States.&quot; It is a little blue pamphlet, not very
thick, that represents a fascinating and challenging departure from its
predecessors. In this document, the environment is highlighted among other
facets of national security. The President moves definitely away from the
national security strategy hinged on containment of Communism and deterring
war against the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact nations, and focuses on
the broader aspects of national security to include - beyond the military
- economic, environmental, and other elements that would contribute to the
promotion of peace and stability in the world. Promoting the development
of democratic institutions and market economies also figures in.</P>

<P>If we can accept that the environment is no longer just an issue &quot;in
my back yard&quot; - that it is in fact a <I>global</I> issue - we can see
easily that the environment, along with economic, social, and political
issues, is a component of our national security. I can clearly anchor my
concerns for environmentally sustainable development into this broader concept
of national security. It all ties together, in my mind, very nicely.</P>

<P><B>Alan:</B> <I>There seems to be broad divergence of opinion about what
&quot;sustainable development&quot; means, ranging on a spectrum from &quot;continuous
economic growth&quot; to &quot;environmental protection.&quot; How do you
define &quot;environmentally sustainable development,&quot; and articulate
that guiding ethic within the Corps?</I></P>

<P><B>Hank:</B> From the Brundtland Commission on, people have picked up
the expression &quot;sustainable development&quot; and have applied it across
that rather broad continuum of definitions. On a scale of one to ten, with
one meaning &quot;strictly development, with modest modifications,&quot;
and ten meaning &quot;strictly environmental protection,&quot; I'm probably
about a three. That is, our goal is clearly development, but it is heavily
modified by the expression &quot;environmentally sustainable.&quot;</P>

<P>I remind people that &quot;environmentally sustainable development&quot;
is a three-word expression. It has one adverb and one adjective, but only
one noun. The noun is &quot;development&quot; because development is absolutely
essential if we're going to be able to sustain and support whatever rate
of growth our populations are going to have on Earth, and if we're going
to achieve the level of economic interdependence in this world that represents,
in my view, the cornerstone of peace in the future.<B> </B>I view environmentally
sustainable development as continued growth and development, but tempered
in such a way as to ensure that we do not foreclose the natural resource-base
alternatives for future generations.</P>

<P><B>Alan:</B> <I>Herman Daly, an economist at the World Bank, warns that
economic growth to the levels that the Brundtland Commission says are required
to achieve a basic living standard for all Earth's people is actually greater
than the Earth's photosynthetic processes can support. What is your view
of such analyses?</I></P>

<P><B>Hank:</B> I don't necessarily believe population projections. We tend
to reach limits much more asymptotically than people realize, and those
that are given to extrapolationism sometimes take us off on tangents.<B>
</B>There are systems that tend to be self-adjusting - sometimes very humanely
but sometimes brutally - in terms of their ability to support humanity.<B>
</B>Daly's comment may well be true, and if so, he has just identified a
system that will not allow population to grow to the extent projected.</P>

<P><B>Alan:</B> <I>To what extent is the ethic you've been describing shared
by others in the Army, and other branches of the military? </I></P>

<P><B>Hank:</B> As the Army's Staff Environmentalist, I am responsible for
the Army's military environmental program, as well as for integrating the
Army's environmental efforts with those of the Department of Defense.<B>
</B>Within the Department, there is a fast-growing environmental ethic.<B>
</B>It is a very honest and, I believe, productive effort to integrate environmental
ethics with the military's other professional ethics.</P>

<P>The Army is spending over a billion dollars this current fiscal year
on a variety of environmental programs. The Defense Environmental Restoration
Program [DERP] is probably the only growing program in the Defense budget,
as directed by the hand of the President, the Administration, and the Secretary
of Defense, as well as through the appropriations and authorizations process
by the Congress. Although the total size of the military is in the process
of declining by plus-or-minus 31% from a few years ago, the DERP and other
environmental programs are growing. So even though budgets are the tightest
they've been for decades, the Army, as well as the rest of the Defense Department,
is putting an increasing level of resources into the environment.</P>

<P>There are four pillars in the Army's environmental program: first, complying
with environmental laws and regulations; second, restoration, and the cleanup
of hazardous toxic waste; third, preventing future environmental damage
throughout the life cycle of systems that we design and procure, and the
operations that we conduct on our military installations; and fourth, conservation.
Conservation includes training area management, with the protection of the
environment in those training areas as the dominant purpose. We're being
very thoroughly supported by tactical commanders in that regard, because
they recognize that we're not only protecting the environment, we're also
enhancing training. By providing a physically better environment, we provide
a more realistic training ground to promote the readiness of the armed forces.
I think the Department is seriously moving in a positive direction.</P>

<P><B>Alan:</B> <I>Is there a recycling program in the military? Is energy
conservation practiced?</I></P>

<P><B>Hank:</B> Recycling is picking up on military installations; energy
conservation has been a major program, stimulated primarily for economic
reasons over the last couple of decades, and now also for environmental
reasons. And there are a number of programs to enhance the overall energy
efficiency of military systems and installations.</P>

<P><B>Alan:</B> <I>I grew up in Florida, and I vividly remember taking our
sailboat down what we called the Government Cut, a straight line channel
through once meandering waterways that was built by the Corps of Engineers.
Now the Corps is planning to unstraighten some of those waterways, including
one section of the Kissimmee River. Why is that?</I></P>

<P><B>Hank:</B> I think the Kissimmee project is a terrific case study.<B>
</B>The Corps of Engineers effort there began as a response to local and
state desires to provide navigation and flood control. Admittedly, there
was little recognition of the environmental value that might be sacrificed
in attaining those purposes.</P>

<P>Over the past decades there has been a growing recognition of those environmental
values, and a desire to change this publicly-funded project so that it is
more responsive to the changing values of the American people. We now value
the environment, the wetlands, the fish and wildlife that suffered because
of navigation and flood control projects. We can not totally undo the projects,
but in concert with state and local authorities, we can significantly modify
them so that some of those fish and wildlife values can be restored.</P>

<P><B>Alan:</B> <I>How far along is the Kissimmee project?</I></P>

<P><B>Hank:</B> We've been nibbling at it. Just within the last few weeks,
I approved a Chief of Engineers Report that will go through the Assistant
Secretary of the Army for Civil Works and eventually to the Congress for
possible inclusion in the next Water Resource Development Act, to be authorized
as a project.</P>

<P><B>Alan:</B> <I>That's quite a window on the bureaucracy you work within.</I></P>

<P><B>Hank:</B> Oh, it takes a little time. But that bureaucracy saves us
all from some pork-barrel politics that might go on if we didn't have it.</P>

<P><B>Alan:</B> <I>Another specific I'm curious about is the salmon recovery
project in the Columbia River Basin. There's a great deal of controversy
about current plans to periodically halt generators and draw down our reservoirs
to speed salmon fingerlings - which get trapped behind dams or chewed up
by turbines - toward the sea. Is this also an example of the legacy of patently
unsustainable development in years past? And is this damage we can successfully
mitigate, in your view?</I></P>

<P><B>Hank:</B> In this case, it's not as easy as the Kissimmee. There was
a massive investment of taxpayers' money in hydropower and associated navigation
facilities on the Columbia River, at a time when we were responding to that
perceived need of the public. To go back now and obtain a balance that reflects
1990s priorities among navigation, flood control, and fish and wildlife
values is much more difficult, physically, because we have these massive
structures.</P>

<P>We already recognize there will be a sacrifice, at least in part, of
the two initial purposes of those structures, hydropower and navigation.<B>
</B>We've already tried fish-ladders, turbine screens, and trucking fingerlings
around the dams, and now we're entering into another phase of exploring
what mitigation means. Hopefully the decisions will be based on the best
data available; they will be <I>political</I> decisions, because the full
array of the political processes will apply to them. A lot of compromise
will be associated with that.</P>

<P><B>Alan:</B> <I>Do you think we'll go so far as to spend the several
hundred million dollars some people project it would take to completely
rebuild the dam system?</I></P>

<P><B>Hank:</B> I find it difficult to forecast that level of expenditure.<B>
</B>If we were to look at national priorities, I think it would be difficult
to justify. Something less, maybe, but that's just my personal opinion.<B>
</B></P>

<P><B>Alan:</B> <I>Let's turn to engineering in general. In a recent speech
to the Engineering Partnership for Sustainable Development, you said &quot;Before
engineers can assume their facilitative role [in sustainable development],
deficiencies in their education must be remedied.&quot;<B> </B>What are
some of those deficiencies, and how must they be remedied?</I></P>

<P><B>Hank:</B> The deficiency is primarily the narrowness of the education,
which is focused excessively on science and technology at the expense of
social issues and subjects. We are training technically competent individuals
at the expense of developing more broadly and liberally educated citizens
and contributors to society - competent members of teams and organizations.
At times there seems to be a kind of technical arrogance at the expense
of the broader sense of social involvement, engagement, and responsibility.</P>

<P>Much of what I've just said coincides with corporate America's criticism
of engineering education, particularly the aspects of multidisciplinary
understanding, the ability to work in teams, and the ability to engage in
public debate associated with projects and works. There's a developing groundswell
of concern in corporate America, the employers of our graduate engineers,
that the whole gamut of engineering education warrants a review and an adjustment.
Part of that adjustment will include the environment.</P>

<P><B>Alan:</B> <I>The architecture community has been shifting strongly
toward sustainability, both in colleges with design programs and in professional
associations. Are the architects out in front of the engineers?</I></P>

<P><B>Hank:</B> The architects are the right-brains of the crowd, and the
engineers, as scientists, tend to be left-brained. I would expect the artistic
among us - the architects, who have always been concerned with the environment
even if only in terms of aesthetics - to have a leg up.<B> </B>They are
generally the more creative members of our combined architect-engineer professional
team, and I would expect them to be the leaders in this way of thinking.</P>

<P>But I would say that the engineering profession at large is moving. The
World Engineering Partnership for Sustainable Development is a small group
that is just beginning. Both the US and international organizations of consulting
engineers now have clearly stated positions on environmental sustainability.</P>

<P>A few professional engineering associations are holding back. They feel
that the engineer's or consultant's job is solely to respond to the will
of the client. I respectfully reject that notion. What I say to engineers
is that we will have arrived, in terms of environmentally sustainable development,
when we would no more recommend an <I>environmentally</I> unsound alternative,
solution, or design to a client than we would a <I>structurally</I> unsound
solution. When I word it that way, it stimulates a certain level of serious
thought. I am suggesting that we incorporate the notion of environmental
sustainability into our professional ethics.</P>

<P>A given building must in itself be structurally sound. An individual
project cannot always, in and of itself, be environmentally sustainable,
though you can do a lot of things with it. But a <I>collection</I> of projects,
or development on the scale of a region or section of a city, can and should
be.</P>

<P><B>Alan:</B> <I>The Corps, as you mentioned earlier, responds to public
needs, and sometimes suffers in its public image when those perceived needs
change. Some environmentalists are very skeptical about the Corps' engagement
in environmental issues. How do you respond to such skepticism and criticism
of the Corps's environmental record?</I></P>

<P><B>Hank:</B> Well, we have a 200-year record laid out in steel and concrete
for everyone's retro-inspection. And I would simply ask those environmentalists,
where were you in the 1930s, 40s, and 70s when we needed a stronger environmental
ethic in the United States, when we were responding to navigation and later
flood control needs? Our nation didn't have an environmental ethic then.
We had people like John Muir, but the environment was not an active consideration
in our political processes the way it is today.</P>

<P>I'm very careful not to be critical of my predecessors. Things will be
happening in this next century that will make what we're doing today, and
what you and I are discussing now, look foolish or too narrow. I'm careful
in dealing with hindsight. What I ask is that people not throw anecdotal
evidence up as a barrier to our being partners in solving this Earth's problems.<B>
</B>We won't always agree. Sure, be skeptical, keep tongue in cheek, see
if we put our money where our mouth is - that's fine. But let's maintain
a dialogue. As I and the Corps have become involved in this discourse, I've
been absolutely inspired by the willingness of many - I would hesitate to
say most - of those who consider themselves strictly environmentalists to
engage and say, &quot;Let's get on with solving these problems.&quot;</P>

<P>To environmentalists, I say that you will fail miserably in attaining
your objectives if you do not exploit the scientific and engineering capabilities
of our nation. To engineers, I say we will fail miserably if we do not meet
our broader obligations to society and the world, as well as simply taking
advantage of some of the economic opportunities in environmental engineering.
We've got to work as partners.</P>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Solving Third World Debt</H1>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER><I>by Carla Cole</I></H4>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Global international debt is now so large that it is described in terms
that are beyond comprehension. (If you pay lebenty-five dollars a minute
for the next bazillion years, your great-great-grandchildren will inherit
a debt with a somewhat reduced principal - <I>that </I>sort of thing.) The
story behind third world debt is particularly worth understanding.</P>

<P>It's not all that difficult. The oil producing nations formed a cartel
(OPEC) in the 1970s and quadrupled petroleum prices. Our failure to use
the prosperity of the postwar years to develop renewable energy sources
left us utterly vulnerable. We watched, helpless, as prices for virtually
everything rose. The extra dollars (pounds, deutschemarks, etc.), flowed
into the hands of the oil producers, who banked these huge trade surpluses
in the North, presumably for safe-keeping.</P>

<P>It was not only rich countries who had failed to free themselves from
petroleum dependency and thus were susceptible to this &quot;oil shock.&quot;
The poor countries of the South without oil supplies of their own also abruptly
found themselves with terrible deficits in their international balance of
payments.</P>

<P>Northern bankers virtually <I>pushed </I>huge loans - the very money
the OPEC countries had deposited with them - into the hands of Southern
governments. (Incidentally, they also aggressively lent these surplus funds
to thousands of North American farmers, who later lost their farms throughout
the 1980s.) Why did they lend to these poor countries? Because there was
little demand for loans in the industrialized countries, due to the recession
caused by the severe hike in the price of oil.</P>

<P>The poor countries struggled to achieve oil-based &quot;development&quot;
- not only in hopes of entering the exalted realm of &quot;first world,&quot;
but also simply to be in a position to repay their enormous debts. But any
product they could manufacture had (and still has) to compete on the world
market with products from industrialized countries with far more experience
and with infrastructure costs, for the most part, behind them. And their
own people were (and still are) having a hard time buying expensive petroleum
products for cooking and heat, much less new, locally manufactured goods.
Furthermore, their own elites did a certain amount (in some cases, a <I>lot</I>)
of skimming, sending more money back to Northern bankers who lent yet more
money back to their governments. What a mess.</P>

<P>A few things are worth underscoring about all this. First, note that
the debts were incurred in the 1970s. Not the 1870s. Not the 1570s. This
situation is <I>not </I>some ancient colonial legacy, but something arranged
by folks who are still here with us today.</P>

<P>Second, all this borrowing has kept interest rates high, not just for
third world governments, but for ordinary people - you and me. So when we
borrow, we have to pay high interest rates. The net effect is a transfer
of wealth to those who have capital, i.e., the rich. And most of us, noticing
we don't seem to be getting ahead, resist paying higher taxes, which has
led to our government doing more borrowing, which leads to higher interest
rates, which tends to transfer more wealth into the hands of, again, the
rich.</P>

<P>And lest you still think a favor was done the South in extending these
loans, it must be pointed out that since the 1970s, net capital flows have
been greatest from South to North, even when you throw in <I>every single
bit</I> of foreign aid. And all of this doesn't even speak of the terrible
environmental toll this has wrought on the countries involved. So what do
we do?</P>

<P>First, in those instances where the petrodollar loans resulted in viable
enterprises that are successfully repaying their debts, kudos and congratulations.
Second, just as those who perpetrated the current Savings and Loan disaster
should be made to pay - literally and personally - as much as possible of
the debts they are now causing others to pay, the poor countries' elites
who had their hands in the national tills should be held personally accountable.
Third, the banks that did the irresponsible lending, and the individual
bank officers involved, should be made to pay as much as possible.</P>

<P>If, after that, debt remains, we peoples of the North, who have benefitted
for two centuries and more from unequal relations between the many disparate
community-based cultures of the South and our own industrialized, militarized,
monetized, communications- and consumption-crazy culture, may have to find
the moral courage to pay the taxes - they should be highly progressive,
to be sure - to clean up the rest of this pitiful mess.</P>

<P>If this all seems too far from what we think of as achievable in the
&quot;real world,&quot; it may help to recall that there <I>is </I>cultural
precedent for periodic leveling of inequities. The biblical Year of Jubilee
(<I>Leviticus</I> <I>25</I>) provided that every 50 years all slaves were
freed and the land redistributed. Our lending institutions have brought
about enslavement, and justice demands that they - that we - let these people
go.</P>

<P>Beyond that, the solutions to poverty, North and South, lie neither in
&quot;structural adjustment&quot; nor in more aid nor welfare. The collective
willingness of people everywhere to embrace ways of living which the Earth
can afford, equally for all, will provide what all the Baker and Brady plans
in the world cannot ever do.</P>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>The Limits To Science</H1>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER><I>by Duane H. Fickeisen</I></H4>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Science has reached a strange crossroads. On the one hand, our media
is full of images of &quot;mad scientists,&quot; and &quot;Dr. Science&quot;
provides a daily dose of nonsense to a radio audience increasingly skeptical
of science's relevance. On the other, some people place too much trust in
science, and political leaders routinely cite individual scientists - who
may or may not be representative of majority opinion - for priestly explanations
that justify a particular policy decision.</P>

<P>Science, however, should neither be dismissed as irrelevant nor looked
to for absolute &quot;answers.&quot; A look at how science and policy-making
interact on the issue of global climate change illustrates both the limits
to science and how science can - and should - influence action.</P>

<P>But first, what is &quot;science&quot;? Many different things. It is
a <I>body of knowledge</I> - observations about the world. It is a <I>systematic
description of knowledge</I> - theories that attempt to organize information
into rules or laws. It is a <I>modeling tool</I> that helps us stretch time
to look into the future. Perhaps most important, science is a set of processes
that comprise <I>a paradigm for investigation of the world</I> - a method
of study.</P>

<P>Each of these aspects of science has only a piece of the whole truth,
and science is only one among many ways of studying the world. If we forget
that, and expect science to give us an absolute answer to a problem, we
invite misunderstanding and consequent policy errors. When we demand certainty
from science before setting policy or acting on problems, we ask too much
of science and expect too little from policy makers.</P>

<P>As a body of knowledge, science is limited by our ability to observe
and measure the world. It is also limited by the sheer volume of data available
to us, and the uneven quality of the information we do have. It is expensive
to collect, verify, process, and store information. The act of measurement
and presence of the observer change the thing being investigated, sometimes
destroying it. Consequently we are forced to make inferences about the whole
based on partial knowledge.</P>

<P>To explain our observations, we develop theories. Scientific theories
provide a framework for identifying critical uncertainties and focusing
our quest for new information. A proposed theory is rejected if it fails
to explain the facts at hand. Theoretical science thus advances by gathering
new information and testing the existing body of theory against it. When
a theory can no longer explain all the information, it is rejected in favor
of one that better explains the facts. In a sense, then, science proceeds
by <I>error and revision</I>, through a process of debate and argument.
Paul Tillich wrote, &quot;The truth of science is correctness,&quot; which
may be true about science as a body of knowledge. In theoretical science,
however, truth is not in correctness, but in the possibility for error.</P>

<P>The branch of science that gets the most attention of late is that branch
which make models of reality and predictions about the future. It is also
the most contentious, simply because it relies so heavily on subjective
judgments about what features of a highly complex system to include in a
model, how to interpret theories, and what data to consider. Because modeling
is subjective, it is subject to debate - which makes good press.</P>

<P>On complex issues like global climate change, what typically gets reported
is not the <I>consensus </I>among scientists about major underlying assumptions,
the main body of knowledge, the solid theories that seem to be robust, or
the best models. The <I>disputes </I>make better sound bites and more interesting
headlines. The resulting appearance of chaos is inaccurate. It is important
that we keep the differences in mind so that we don't fall into the trap
of wrongly believing that science has final, absolute answers - but we need
to also be aware that there is substantial agreement among scientists.</P>

<P>Simply put, science cannot provide the sort of truth that can help us
make error-free policy, nor should we expect it to. We certainly don't demand
that policies related to non-technical matters be error-free. We don't require
absolute certainty from economists before setting economic policy, nor from
educators before designing education policy.</P>

<P>When we design policies in the face of uncertainty - i.e., virtually
<I>all</I> policies - we should design them to permit <I>monitoring the
outcome</I>, so that we can learn from our actions; to be <I>reversible</I>,
in case we have missed a critical uncertainty; and to <I>reduce the consequences
of being wrong</I>. In environmental circles, this is called &quot;adaptive
management.&quot; (Other people have called it common sense.) Interestingly,
when we design actions that are consistent with the adaptive management
criteria, they often make the most sense <I>whether the underlying science
is right or wrong</I>.</P>

<H4>ACTING DESPITE UNCERTAINTY</H4>

<P>Turning to the specifics of the global climate example, we have good
data over a period of decades that demonstrates increasing concentrations
of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere at a Hawaiian mountain observatory.
But the information we have on the Earth's temperature is not as good, so
we cannot yet demonstrate with the same certainty that the climate is either
warming or cooling.</P>

<P>Scientific theory explains the observed increase in carbon dioxide and
other &quot;greenhouse&quot; gases in the atmosphere and their observed
effect on heat reflection and radiation. The theory says that the more greenhouse
gases we add to the atmosphere, the more incoming solar radiation will be
trapped, tending to raise the temperature of the Earth. The theory cannot
be considered &quot;absolutely correct.&quot; But it does explain most of
what we now know about atmospheric carbon dioxide and its effect on heat,
and no competing theory offers a better explanation at this time.</P>

<P>The best global climate models predict that the greenhouse gases already
in the atmosphere, and those we are likely to add to it over time, will
lead to an increase in the Earth's temperature and changes in precipitation
patterns. The models can't tell us much about regional changes in storm
patterns, or predict precisely how much or how soon the climate will warm
up - but they do point toward a significant warming over the next decades.
That's the limit of what <I>science</I> can tell us. Decisions we make based
on that science are <I>policy</I>.</P>

<P>It makes very good sense, as policy, to implement cost-effective energy
conservation measures to reduce carbon dioxide emissions and thus abate
global warming. This action is in line with &quot;adaptive management&quot;
principles: it is potentially reversible, we can monitor the results, and
it makes sense (because it would save money, improve air quality, and perhaps
even avert future wars over oil) even if the predicted climatic warming
is wrong. Therefore we should reduce our use of carbon fuels, while continuing
to monitor atmospheric carbon dioxide levels and the global temperature.
At the same time, we must prepare to mitigate the impacts of predicted climatic
changes.</P>

<P>The alternative is to study the situation further, gather more information
about the Earth's temperature, test our theories against new information,
and refine our models - while we continue to release more carbon into the
air. It is unlikely, however, that even several years of scientific study
will improve a policy we could develop today. A delay in taking appropriate
action is not reversible, and there would be severe consequences if the
predicted global warming is right.</P>

<P>Using vague notions of &quot;scientific uncertainty&quot; to avoid making
difficult public policy decisions reflects an inaccurate understanding of
science at best, and a dangerous foolishness at worst. Unless we take action
to limit the impacts of our unsustainable activities, and make restorations
where we can, we will only increase the damage created by our current policies.
We should look to the consensus and agreement that exists in our current
science, consider the risks as well as the costs and benefits of our proposed
policies - and then get on with doing the right thing.</P>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>The Wisdom Of Limits</H1>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER><I>by Charles M. Johnston</I></H4>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><I>In a recent essay, economist Herman Daly identified one of the core
symbols of the ruling American dream of unlimited growth: the Merrill Lynch
bull. Ranging freely through TV commercials, over a landscape empty of people
and other animals, the bull &quot;knows no boundaries.&quot; The image is,
however, a terrible distortion of reality; boundaries, limits, and relationships
are the major structural elements of our world. The dream of unlimited growth
- the &quot;Boundless Bull&quot; of Daly's essay - is an illusion; and as
Daly notes, the bull is actually operating in the &quot;china shop&quot;
of our planetary ecosystem, and must learn to tread more lightly.</I></P>

<P><I>Charles Johnston, MD, is a cultural psychiatrist and futurist who
directs the Institute for Creative Development, a think tank and leadership
training center in Seattle. He is author of two books: </I>The Creative
Imperative <I>(1986) and </I>Necessary Wisdom: Meeting the Challenge of
a New Cultural Maturity <I>(1991). </I></P>

<P>With growing frequency, we use the word crisis when defining our times.
We have an environmental crisis, a drug crisis, a crisis in education, crises
in love and the family. An unsettling characteristic links these various
crises: few appear solvable simply by working harder at what we have done
before. They ask new things of us - at the very least new perspectives,
and very frequently whole new ways of acting and being.</P>

<P>These myriad crises have common themes. One of the most important is
that they require us to relate to limits in new ways. For the new kinds
of limits that present themselves today, our old attitudes and approaches
not only will not work, they threaten to be our undoing.</P>

<P>How have we related to limits in the past? We've engaged them <I>heroically</I>.
Our cultural story told us that limits were obstacles to get beyond, adversaries
to defeat. This heroic call has defined much of our modern era. We conquered
the Wild West, defeated polio and other diseases, and transcended the bonds
of gravity and the limited vision of the past to venture into outer space.</P>

<P>Today we face new kinds of limits, ones for which this story, however
grand, will not suffice. We are only beginning to understand what will be
entailed in successfully meeting these new limits. But we can say with some
certainty that both our future fulfillment as individuals and our future
well-being as a species will depend intimately on our coming to understand
limits in new ways.</P>

<P>A recent conversation thrust me into grappling with this new challenge.
It could have been about most any of today's crises, but this conversation
was about the health care crisis - over lunch with a man who was instrumental
in the development of Canada's health care system.</P>

<P>Part way through the conversation he turned to me and said, &quot;Charley,
you in the United States look to our system as a possible model. But, you
know, we've barely scratched the surface. We've done well with the initial
task: making care available to everyone. But we've kept the hardest question
well at arm's length. Combine equal access with an increasing ability to
keep people alive almost indefinitely and you have a formula for national
bankruptcy. At some point, we have to acknowledge the fact of limits. However
uncomfortable it makes us, we must face the necessity of rationing care,
of deciding what we can afford and what we can't.&quot;</P>

<P>On first encounter, the challenge of an equitable health care system,
while certainly complex, seems largely technical. In fact, like most critical
challenges in our time, one can't grapple with it effectively without being
transformed by it. At its heart is this issue of limits: modern medicine's
great success has been born from a heroic story, the courageous task of
defeating death and disease - at almost any cost. Rationing care (which
we now do covertly, by not ensuring equal access) requires that we accept
the fact of economic limits. More than this, it requires a new relationship
with life's ultimate limit: death. Rationing care requires that death be
seen as more than just an evil adversary. It propels us into having to write
a new kind of health care story, one in which life and death are no longer
opposites, but collaborative voices in a larger conversation.</P>

<P>Confront the new limits in any domain and we are ultimately led to re-ask
the most fundamental of questions. This is certainly the case for health
care. Acknowledge economic limits and pretty soon we are asking questions
like &quot;Wouldn't it make sense to spend more of our resources on prevention?&quot;
And then, &quot;If prenatal care is valuable prevention, what about good
nutrition, and if good nutrition is important what about cleaning up toxic
chemicals in the environment, and if that is part of it too, what about
the effects of poverty, and lack of housing, and ....&quot; That list might
look pretty overwhelming and unsolvable. On the other hand, it might be
&quot;just what the doctor ordered&quot; - a fresh, systemic, &quot;big
picture&quot; look at health.</P>

<H4>FOUR NEW TYPES OF LIMITS</H4>

<P>The new limits are of several types. The most obvious are physical limits:
in resources, in space for the effluvium of civilization, in how many people
can be crammed onto the planet before our presence is our own undoing. New
inventions can help with some of this - more energy-efficient technologies,
renewable approaches to energy production, and the creation of products
that are more easily recycled. But ultimately these limits ask changes in
ourselves - in the choices we make and how we live our daily lives.</P>

<P>In addition to physical limits, we are challenged to acknowledge new
economic limits. Some of these - in health care, for example - reflect primarily
the costs of new technologies outstripping our ability to pay for them.
But many seem to be expressions of a more fundamental process.</P>

<P>In the Industrial Age, we came to expect economic growth as a given.
Progress meant ever-expanding production and consumption. But mounting evidence
suggests that such expectations may not be fulfilled in the future - and
that this may not be a bad thing.</P>

<P>Working with business groups, I often comment that the goal of &quot;keeping
America number one&quot; may not be achievable. Putting the present situation
in a developmental metaphor, I suggest that there are just too many places
in the world now with the youthful, single-minded determination needed for
maximum material productivity. Then I offer that while remaining number
one in the old sense may not be achievable, there is a sense in which <I>providing
economic leadership</I> is not only a definite possibility - the future
welfare of the planet may depend on it. This new economic leadership would
replace the &quot;onward and upward&quot; call of the Industrial Age with
an economics based on defining wealth and progress more maturely, in terms
of things such as quality, ecological sustainability, the health of communities,
and the vitality and creativity of the workplace.</P>

<P>A third kind of limit is easily the most unsettling. We are being confronted
by the fact that there may be real limits to what we as human beings can
know and do. Central to our times' heroic story has been the notion that
the potential of human knowledge is essentially boundless. The Industrial
Age reinforced this view in grand fashion. We saw life's mysteries brought
more and more into the light of reason, and nature's fearsome might succumbing
with amazing rapidity to the powers of human understanding.</P>

<P>Today, from myriad directions, we are having to face the possibility
that reality is greater than this. The fall of the Berlin wall and the Soviet
dis-union remind us how limited we are in our ability to predict even momentous
events. Bhopal, Chernobyl, and the <I>Challenger</I> disaster confront us
with the magnitude of risk present in any human endeavor. And more and more
the cutting edges of theoretical understanding - from Heisenberg in physics,
to G&ouml;del in mathematics, to Chaos Theory - challenge us that uncertainty
may not be just a function of incomplete knowledge. It may be inherent to
reality itself. Decisions that lie ahead for us as a species will increasingly
require that we humbly acknowledge how much in life we cannot predict or
control, however bright we may be and however good our intentions.</P>

<P>The challenge of managing technologies that have the power to do major
planetary harm offers a good example. This summer, the institute I direct
will be convening an international think tank on nuclear waste disposal.
As I prepare for it, I find myself reflecting frequently on not just how
little we know, but on how much of what we would <I>want</I> to know is
simply not knowable. A glimpse: nuclear waste includes many substances which
will remain deadly for at least a quarter of a million years. Most solutions
and safeguards assume some ability to keep an eye on the stuff, which in
turn assumes stable governments and stable economies. In modern times, the
best we humans have done at stable government is a couple of hundred years.
And modern civilization as a whole has been around but a few thousand. Given
this magnitude of uncertainty, it is highly unlikely that a solution can
be found that will provide a really satisfactory level of safety (and we
already have significant quantities of waste to deal with, whatever our
decisions about future production).</P>

<P>New limits to what we can know and be are essential not only in important
cultural decisions, but in every aspect of our daily lives. The challenge
of what it takes for love to work in our time provides a ready example.
Not too many years back, we had a pretty reliable formula for love: gender
roles. Learn the right gender behaviors and you could be pretty confident
of discovering someone who had learned the complementary set and living
in relative happiness. Love was like fitting together two halves of a puzzle.</P>

<P>Today love relationships are not so easy. Increasingly, love that works
is love that involves the coming together of two relatively whole people.
One of the hardest parts of whole-person love is accepting that there are
real limits to what we can be for each other. In the two-halves-make-a-whole
love, we are each other's answer, white knight and fair princess. Whole
people are just people, something that at first may seem a loss, but which
in time offers the potential of a profound new richness and maturity in
love.</P>

<P>A similar dynamic reshapes every kind of relationship in our time - parent
and child, teacher and student, friend and friend, doctor and patient. In
each we are being challenged to accept that there are major limits to what
one person can be for another. To the degree we can accept that challenge,
we discover whole new depths and richnesses to the meaning of relationship.</P>

<P>The fourth limit demanding our attention is life's ultimate limit: death.
It confronts us on several fronts. The most obvious concerns the magnitude
of the future decisions that will be required of us. In a way new for us
as a species, many decisions are questions of life and death, both for ourselves
and for other life forms that inhabit the planet with us. Although we have
always been capable of destruction, we have never before been capable of
anything remotely near the kind of global destruction possible today. If
we wish to make future choices with any responsibility, we must acknowledge
the potential mortality of species, our own and others.</P>

<P>Death confronts us in new ways more personally as well. We see this with
issues like rationing health care, abortion, and the right of the terminally
ill to die. Here we are being challenged to acknowledge not just that our
actions can result in death, but that in certain situations the most life-giving
choice may involve siding with death. We have sided with death before -
in wartime, for example, and with the execution of criminals. But always
before the person to die had been an &quot;other,&quot; someone already
cast out from humanity in our minds. Life is now presenting situations where
siding with death is something much more personal, where choosing death
may be the most loving option for ourselves or for another who matters deeply
to us.</P>

<H4>A NEXT CHAPTER IN THE HUMAN STORY</H4>

<P>How do we best understand these new limits and what they ask of us? It
is essential that we at least begin to answer this question. Today's new
limits are not conquerable in the old sense. Yet, our traditional heroic
story says that failing to conquer a limit is defeat. Without some larger
perspective, our options are two equally unhelpful responses: denial on
one hand, or depression and desperation on the other.</P>

<P>This discussion of limits points toward an analogy I've found particularly
useful in seeking out such a larger understanding. One of its powers is
that it offers a way to understand the limits we face in positive terms.
It is a developmental analogy, to a particular time in our individual lives:
the mid-life transition. Look closely and one finds striking parallels between
the challenges of the Industrial Age and those we encounter more personally
during young adulthood, that period when our fundamental developmental task
is to strike out and make our places in the world. In a similar sense, a
look at today's quite different questions reveals challenges very akin to
those we face as we enter the second half of our life.</P>

<P>At mid-life, the critical life-tasks shift from achievement to wisdom
and perspective. Each of the four new cultural limits outlined above ask
a similar shift and have direct parallels at mid-life.</P>

<P>Grappling with physical limits is certainly a part of mid-life: limits
to how young and beautiful we can look, limits to our physical strength
and abilities. Try to conquer these very real limits and our lives become
increasingly absurd caricatures of youth. The task is to find the wisdom
and courage to learn what these limits really mean. To the degree we are
successful, our fears of being &quot;over the hill&quot; fall away to reveal
a quite different landscape. In this new landscape, beauty and strength
come to have new, fuller meanings - more seasoned, deeper, more complete.</P>

<P>In a similar way, the new physical limits on the planet need not make
us less as a species. Meet them with open eyes and they can lead to a more
mature beauty and strength in who we are.</P>

<P>Mid-life confronts us as well with economic limits: at first with the
recognition that achievement may not continue its past onward and upward
trajectory, later with the fact that we likely wouldn't want it to if it
could. Mid-life is about mortality, and the simple fact that &quot;you can't
take it with you,&quot; whether the &quot;it&quot; is accomplishments, relationships,
beliefs, or possessions. Mid-life challenges us again and again to reexamine
our &quot;bottom line,&quot; to look closely at what most matters, and to
have the courage to live life as it most enriches us.</P>

<P>Similarly, today's cultural economic limits can serve us positively by
challenging us as a species to find fuller meanings for concepts like wealth
and progress.</P>

<P>The third kind of limit, the limit to what we can know, is also pivotal
in the mid-life story. Mid-life is the point in our development when we
finally, truly, let go of our parents. While physically we left them many
years before, now we must leave them symbolically as well. Life challenges
us to accept a new, more complete responsibility. With this it reveals that
existence is a much less sure and predictable thing than we had assumed
in the past. We remember back to our grandparents saying &quot;the older
you get the less you know,&quot; and with both trepidation and gratefulness
realize what they were trying to express.</P>

<P>In a similar way, our loss of cultural absolutes confronts us with life's
uncertainty. From the beginning of human time, culture has served as a parent
to us. Our individual lives have always involved uncertainty, but before
this loss, culture - whether defined in terms of omniscient deities, codes
of right and wrong, or the laws of science - has offered some final external
absolute. Today this is changing. Our times ask us not just to succeed in
love, but to take responsibility for shaping new, larger definitions of
love. They ask us not just to progress, but to redefine fundamentally what
it means to progress. Within the psyche of culture, our times ask us to
be &quot;parent&quot; and &quot;child&quot; simultaneously: in short, to
&quot;grow up&quot; as a species.</P>

<P>Mid-life also confronts us with that final limit, death. Adolescents
and young adults know the word for death, but they don't yet really believe
in it. In the second half of life, mortality becomes a constant presence.
As we anticipate death, it is hard to imagine that facing it might be a
positive thing. But in fact death is life's ultimate teacher. Life teaches
knowledge and experience, but it is death that teaches wisdom. Death challenges
us again and again with the final question of purpose: &quot;When I reach
the end of my life, what will I most want to be able to say about my brief
time on the planet?&quot;</P>

<P>It is frightening how directly life confronts us these days with images
of death - the nuclear mushroom cloud, the growing extinction of species,
AIDS, spiraling population with its attendant specters of famine and ever-increasing
environmental degradation. We can either be overwhelmed by these things
- i.e., as with mid-life - or we can see them as a call to a new responsibility
and maturity. At mid-life, facing the fact that death is real opens us to
the full wonder and complexity of life in a way not before possible. If
we can muster the courage, our times would seem to offer an opening just
as profound.</P>

<P>If I were asked for a single word to capture what our times demand, it
would be that word which most succinctly defines the fundamental task of
life's second half: wisdom. It is not a word we use easily or really trust.
But it is this the future most requires of us.</P>

<P>The new limits that confront us will be a primary arena for learning
about and testing our much-needed new wisdom. We can deny the new limits.
We can give up, let them defeat us. Or we can embrace a third, more challenging
option. We can use them to help us learn about the new maturity, courage,
and perspective on which our future depends.</P>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>New Priorities</H1>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER><I>by Peter Drucker</I></H4>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><I>Dr. Peter Drucker, the dean of management consultants, met this past
winter with members of the US Congress. His remarks are relevant and instructive
as we ponder the potential of government in this particularly unpromising
election year. We've excerpted them from </I>What's Next: A Newsletter of
Emerging Issues and Trends<I>, which is published by the Congressional Clearinghouse
on the Future. You can reach the Clearinghouse at 555 House Annex 2, Washington,
DC, 20515 Tel. 202/226-3434.</I></P>

<P>Every 200 or 300 years, there is a very short period when the world suddenly
changes - the way it does in a kaleidoscope. This is one of those periods
when the old solutions no longer work. One can clearly see new priorities.</P>

<P>Since the French Revolution, we have believed in what I call &quot;salvation
by society,&quot; the belief that government and society could basically
mold the human being. Communism was the extreme manifestation of this secular
religion. In this country, that belief peaked in the Kennedy years, and
by now, it is pretty much gone. It is gone in the rest of the world, too.
And so we have a world that has no ideologies. We can expect that within
20 or 30 years, we will have major new political alignments. In this country,
our parties have never been ideological. [...]</P>

<P>For 200 years, all the debates have been over what should be done. Since
1792, nobody has asked, what <I>can </I>government do? Now, for the first
time, we are asking the question. Government, like any other institution,
has core competencies. We have learned from other institutions what happens
when institutions try to do things that don't fit their competence - they
usually end up flat on their belly. Of all government [social] programs
of the last 40 years, not one has worked. Head Start is the only exception.
This is not an American phenomenon; it is worldwide. Japan is an exception,
[but] it is beginning to hit Japan. [...]</P>

<P>We started the Core Management Foundation one and one-half years ago
with the avowed aim of tripling the effectiveness of nonprofit institutions
and doubling their share of the GNP. Those are realistic, but not easy,
goals.</P>

<P>One of the great movements in my lifetime among educated people is the
need to commit themselves to action. Most people are not satisfied with
giving money; we also feel we need to work. That is why there is an enormous
surge in the number of unpaid staff, volunteers. The needs are not going
to go away. Business is not going to take up the slack, and government cannot.</P>

<P>I think we will depend on the nonprofits. The nonprofit sector is the
largest employer in the American economy.</P>

<P>Productivity [in manufacturing and agriculture] has increased 50-fold
in the last century ... and is growing as fast as ever. [Now] both sectors
together employ fewer than one-sixth of the labor force. [...]</P>

<P>Knowledge has become the central resource. [But] the productivity of
knowledge workers is incredibly low. Does anybody here believe that the
teacher of 1991 is more productive than the teacher of 1900? The productivity
of service workers is even lower.... Over three-fourths of our workforce
are service and knowledge workers. By the end of the century, 90 per cent
of total workers will be knowledge and service workers. Productivity of
knowledge work and dignity of service work are the two great priorities.</P>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Cooperative Trade</H1>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER><I>by Joanne Lucas</I></H4>

<P><BR>
In El Rodeo, Mexico, Estela Bernardino and Eva Santos are learning to weave
cloth, a lost art they believe was traditional in their area &quot;at the
time when the legends were formed.&quot; The women belong to a co-op whose
members have learned to weave simple garments for their families from donated
wool yarn. This spring they are learning to weave fabric appropriate for
a wider market. When the handwoven fabric is ready, Magdalena Feliciano
will help to fashion it into garments and items suitable for export. Magdalena,
a widow raising her own children as well as several orphans, is one of the
members of La Esperanza, a sewing cooperative in El Rodeo.</P>

<P>These industrious women are finding support for their efforts to better
their own lives from &quot;compa&ntilde;eros&quot; in the United States
- the Paraclete Society International of Portland, Oregon. Paraclete, a
non-profit alternative trade organization (ATO) with a mission to help impoverished
rural people start and manage their own worker-owned businesses, has channeled
donated equipment, supplies, technical expertise, and small cash advances
to the El Rodeo co-ops and will market their finished products in this country.</P>

<P>Meanwhile, in Xapuri, Brazil, members of the Rubber Tapper Cooperative
gather nuts in the Amazonian rainforest for processing in their own factory.
The Brazil nuts are brought to market by Cultural Survival, a non-profit
ATO based in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Cultural Survival pays the workers
three to ten times the going local rate for their products, returns 5% of
the retail price to rainforest projects, and donates 20% of net profits
to rainforest conservation. In addition, 20% of profits goes to environmental
groups and 10% to &quot;1% for Peace.&quot;</P>

<P>And in Surrey Hills, New South Wales, the World Development Tea Cooperative
Ltd. demonstrates the possibility of a trade system that benefits the producing
countries rather than the multi-national corporations which keep returns
to growers at the lowest possible level. The Tea Cooperative strategy is
to sell through church networks and community groups, while providing opportunities
for its Australian customers to learn more about the ways the current international
trade system works to the disadvantage of third world countries.</P>

<P>These ATOs are part of a growing international movement to provide alternatives
to exploitive trade practices, a movement emerging out of the realization
that financial aid programs are not a sufficient means to achieve self-reliance
in impoverished communities. The concept is not new. SERRV Self-Help Handcrafts,
a Mennonite organization in New Windsor, Maryland, has been selling handcrafts
from developing countries for fifty years.</P>

<P>ATO activity in the United States has remained minimal, however, until
the '70s. By 1991 ATO sales here accounted for an estimated $15 million
gross, only a tiny portion of the billions spent annually in the US on imported
food, clothing, crafts, and household goods. Catalog sales accounted for
30-35% of the volume, church sales, fairs, and storefronts for the rest.</P>

<P>ATOs are more common in Europe, where from humble beginnings in the '60s
alternative trade has grown to $100 million in sales in 1991, with about
forty outlet organizations, in addition to independent shops, cooperative
networks, and church organizations.</P>

<P>ATOs also exist in Japan and Australia. The International Federation
for Alternative Trade, which includes a few American members, uses its collective
voice to increase the flow of information, speak out against specific injustices,
improve market access, and facilitate international partnerships. Hundreds
of producer groups, most often small entrepreneurial cooperatives, are found
in Asia, Africa, Latin America, and among Native Americans in the US and
Canada. Contact with ATOs outside their regions reinforces such groups in
reducing the hold of local middlemen on distribution - and profits.</P>

<P>ATOs market everything from silk scarves and jewelry to honey and coffee,
but handcrafts and textiles are the most common items, corresponding most
closely to the needs and potentials of peasant communities by adding value
to the raw materials available to them.</P>

<P>In addition to training for third world peoples that respects their values
and their dignity and enhances their ability to direct their own lives,
many ATOs include educational components (often through their catalogs and
newsletters) for first-world consumers. In 1991, Paraclete offered an internship
to a representative from a Mexican village cooperative. He had the opportunity
not only to learn about cooperatives and product retailing, but to speak
to citizen groups in Oregon, Washington, and British Columbia.</P>

<P>Some ATOs, such as MarketPlace: Handiwork of India, offer employment
opportunities to women, disabled persons, and others ordinarily outside
the mainstream. Paraclete hopes eventually to put disabled and hard-to-employ
persons in the Portland area to work in processing their imports. And most
ATOs are concerned for safe and environmentally sound working conditions
and products as well as social and economic justice.</P>

<P>Paul Freundlich, founder of Co-op America, more recently started the
Fair Trade Foundation, which seeks to create and explore market opportunities
for third world communities. Freundlich points out that alternative trade
activities must expand greatly if they are to address the need. He believes
that growing public interest in &quot;green&quot; issues will bring the
expanding market that will be necessary if alternative trade organizations
are to have real impact on the towering poverty of the third world.</P>

<P>He worries about keeping the ethical component uppermost in alternative
trade organizations in the face of such expansion. &quot;It is difficult
to distinguish,&quot; he says, &quot;between those who are in it simply
to make money and those making money with viable products while protecting
the environment and the working conditions, as well as assuring fair wages
for producers.&quot;</P>

<P>ATOs offer socially and environmentally concerned consumers an alternative
to distribution systems which exclude and exploit the poor people of the
third world. They provide a chance to vote with dollars for organizations
that place people before profit.</P>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Light-footed Logging</H1>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER><I>by Carla Cole</I></H4>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>If smoking fields of stumps make you feel sure there has to be a better
way, and/or you have a few treed acres from which you'd like to harvest
lumber (yet leave a viable ecosystem behind), here is a valuable resource:
the Institute for Sustainable Forestry prepared a draft document this spring,
&quot;Forest Practice Guidelines for Certified Ecologically Produced Wood.&quot;
It's written by some of the most experienced environmentally concerned lumber
folks in Northern California. For information about this document and other
work the Institute is doing, contact: Institute for Sustainable Forestry,
PO Box 1580, Redway, CA 95560, 707/923-4719.</P>

<P>We learned about the Institute's work from a friend who also let us know
about a periodical, <I>The Steelhead Special</I>, that we found irresistible.
The <I>Special </I>reports on working-class culture (as well as alternative
employment opportunities) amidst some of the best poetry and most colorful
writing to grace a newsprint 'zine we've ever seen. The <I>Special</I>'s
editor, Crawdad Nelson, let us use this photo. You can reach him at PO Box
219, Bayside, CA 95524.</P>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Beyond Beefing</H1>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER><I>by Kirsten Hardenbrook</I></H4>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><I>Cultural critic Jeremy Rifkin has turned his attention recently to
the beef industry. He has written a book on the subject and created a full-blown
activist campaign. Both go by the same name:</I> Beyond Beef.</P>

<P><I>The campaign's goals - to trim US beef consumption by 50% and promote
organic and humane cattle-ranching in place of &quot;factory&quot; methods
- are laudable. But such campaigns spring from an urban perspective, and
often overlook the complexities of translating environmental do-goodism
into the realm of real human relationships.</I></P>

<P><I>Kirsten Hardenbrook is a visioneer, artist, songwriter, llama-packer,
and founder of the Fellowship for Ecology and the Arts (FEA). The Fellowship's
mission is to encourage awareness, respect, and compassion, and &quot;to
draw upon the Earth's many gifts&quot; to enhance creative expression. This
essay, which helps reveal more dimensions of Beyond Beef's task, is excerpted
from FEA's &quot;Awaiting Spring! 1992&quot; newsletter. The full essay
includes an inspiring spiritual and philosophical inquiry into our human
existence as animals - as eaters and eaten. For a copy of the newsletter,
send $3 to FEA, Route 11, Box 70, Silver City, NM 88061.</I></P>

<P>We began our first year of Fellowship for Ecology and the Arts (FEA)
programs with unbridled enthusiasm. Our small staff was dedicated to the
environmental/spiritual movement and we were filled with idealism. In our
beautiful wilderness setting, it looked as though the year would be smooth
and joyous sailing. The last thing I was expecting was deep hurt and disillusionment.
But that became a significant part of our experience.</P>

<P>Our education began in early spring, with the appearance of a roaming
cowboy. He came riding up the river trail with his pack horses, and stayed
to fix fences for a while. Before long, he was a well-loved member of FEA's
family. But his presence soon offered us a vantage point on our own prejudices,
and I became painfully aware of the depth of intolerance we unconsciously
exhibited. We would see the problem repeated through the year in different
contexts and through different catalysts: he represented an American sub-culture
that is on the other side of the fence, so to speak, from the views of many
of us in FEA. Being an ex-cattle rancher, sawmill operator, and truck driver,
his perspectives were very different from those of our staff and guests,
especially around the exceedingly volatile issues of cattle ranching and
meat eating. But often, when we heard him out, his perspectives made sense.</P>

<P>There, in the formative stages of FEA's development, we realized we had
a choice: to function as an insulated group of like-minded individuals (in
which case the cowboy would have to go), or to be open to including the
presence, should it occur, of those who might respect our mission but hold
some differing ideas and viewpoints. We chose the latter, knowing there
would be some conflict, but opting for the choice that seemed to offer the
greatest opportunity for growth all around. This decision was in line with
our mission statement - respect for all in a non-hierarchical manner.</P>

<P>Still, talking <I>about </I>a group such as ranchers or loggers is very
different from talking <I>with </I>a rancher or logger (or environmentalist,
for that matter). Through the ensuing months, our choice led us through
a labyrinth of related decisions, conflicts and quandaries - long after
our cowboy was gone. His archetype resurfaced in the faces of our neighbors
and new friends, our wrangler, and of course ourselves - as our roots grew
down and we came to bear more and more the color and imprint of the land.</P>

<P>Our choice exposed fallacies and weak points in our own ideology, for
- as illustrated in the philosophy of the Native American medicine wheel
- a thing (idea or person) looks different when viewed from a different
point in the wheel's circle. Especially now, when conflicts between environmentalists
and ranchers are being referred to as &quot;the new range wars,&quot; we
realize we have a huge chore before us in extending the circle of our conscious
respect to include not just animals, environment, and those who share our
ideology, but also those whose personal choices and life circumstances create
paths different from our own.</P>

<P>Our country-oriented friends and staff played an important role. They
helped shake up what would otherwise have been a &quot;nicey-nice&quot;
fix-the-planet retreat center, and threw in a dose of world-class reality.
Their role was often the role of the coyote - the trickster who teaches
simply by being himself and thereby showing others their inconsistencies:
&quot;That's how I am,&quot; one said firmly when disapproving vegetarians
watched him load up on potatoes and skip the greens at the dinner table.
&quot;I was growed up on meat and potatoes.&quot; Who are we to make another
person's choices?</P>

<P>And there was the fact that most city dwellers, no matter how environmentally
oriented they are, simply do not have many of the skills required to get
the necessary work done on the Lodge, the fences, or the vehicles, or even
to care for animals when they are sick or hurt. I myself have been frustrated
to tears over projects I didn't know how to deal with.</P>

<P>It is our country neighbors who never end a conversation without saying,
&quot;Give us a call if you need any help.&quot; And they know <I>how </I>to
help. They are <I>not </I>adversaries; they are strong, direct, and polite
people who know nature and animals. They understand boundaries, have a sense
of honor, and any favor done them is returned.</P>

<P>These people, whom we have often relied on, and who have an appreciation
for many of our own ideals, have been targets. Because their livelihood
is ranching, because they eat meat, because some are less &quot;educated,&quot;
even because of their music and dress, they were the objects of derisive
prejudice from some staff and guests, sometimes <I>even as they were helping
us</I>. The callousness and rudeness I have seen exhibited by &quot;spiritual&quot;
environmentalists toward these people - and toward myself and FEA for associating
with them - saddens me.</P>

<P>Can we not compromise? Most of us, raised in cities or suburbs, have
become children in the wilderness, afraid of darkness and strange sounds,
unable to navigate by the stars, unable even to survive without manufactured
food and gear. Those who know the Earth as closely as one knows a lover
- be they ranchers, small farmers, or even drifters - comprise an overlooked
commodity to us all. They still have a fingerhold on our increasingly distant
heritage through their direct knowledge of Nature. If they who work and
live on the land day by day are driven from it, we may gain a cattle- and
logging-free wilderness, but - as with Native Americans, third-world cultures,
and even American small farmers - we will lose one more of the narrow threads
that can play a role in leading us back into the arms of Nature.</P>

<P>Sharman Apt Russell, in her book <I>Songs of the Fluteplayer</I>, recounts
her thoughts after leaving a Forest Service meeting:</P>

<P>I am struck by how much ranchers and environmentalists have in common.
Both believe the other side is powerful, wealthy, ignorant and ruthless.
Both believe the government is their adversary. Both believe they need to
educate the public about range management. Both believe they are concerned
with the protection of natural resources.</P>

<P>No group of individuals can be honestly lumped into a stereotype. There
are good, bad and marginal ranchers just as there are good, bad and marginal
environmentalists. Can't we hold an ideal of compassion and respect in our
hearts and work together? I agree with Russell when she writes, &quot;In
the same way that we need Mexican spotted owls, we need ranchers ... we
need a width and breadth of human experience.&quot;</P>

<P>Each person alive is a co-creator of our collective future, helping to
imagine the future into being. We can do it in all sorts of ways - through
fear, struggle, and pain, bringing to bloom the same; or through hope, joy,
courage, honesty, and exuberant action.</P>

<P>In <I>The Solace of Open Spaces</I>, Gretel Ehrlich says that &quot;lovers,
farmers, and artists have one thing in common at least - a fear of dry spells.&quot;
By living all our lives as participants in a grand and inclusive work of
art - Creation - we can weather this dry spell and irrigate for all.</P>

<BR>
Many threads are coming together to suggest that the community scale will
be a major focus for cultural change in the coming decade:<BR>
<UL>
  <LI>There is a growing awareness that the root causes of most environmental
problems are over-consumption of resources and excessive production of waste
in the industrialized world. Much of that consumption occurs at a community
level, especially in the ways we house and transport ourselves. Significant
relief for the environment won't come until we transform our communities.<BR>
<BR>
  <LI>Large institutions - especially businesses and governments - are losing
touch with the grass roots. They are becoming less effective, less responsible,
and more self-absorbed. Because of this, more and more people are realizing
that it now makes better sense to look to community-scale organizations
for the support and security they used to expect from large institutions.<BR>
<BR>
  <LI>At the same time, many people are feeling an increasing hunger for
the warmth, support, and rich human experience that is found only in community.
We are being pulled as well as pushed to community.
</UL>
<BR>
For all these reasons, the wisdom and desirability of revitalizing and transforming
our community life seems clear. The challenge, however, is getting there,
for community transformation requires:<BR>
<UL>
  <LI>confronting and redirecting the enormous momentum (in our institutions
and in our daily habits) that has produced our over-consumptive and alienated
society, and<BR>
<BR>
  <LI>cooperating - in substantial ways and over the long haul - with a
wide spectrum of people, a skill which, for many of us, is a bit rusty.
</UL>
<BR>
Fortunately, there are many pioneers who have shown that it can be done,
indeed it can be done joyfully. In this issue, we visit some of these pioneers
and look at how to build on their accomplishments and experiences.<BR>
<BR>
This issue also marks a milestone in the life of our small &quot;community&quot;
here at Context Institute. Alan AtKisson, whose skillful editing during
the past four years made a major contribution to <I>IN CONTEXT's</I> development,
moved on to other interests in July. We wish Alan well as he continues to
work for a humane and sustainable future through his work with Sustainable
Seattle and in other venues.<BR>
<BR>
And we welcome Sarah van Gelder, who joined us in mid-August as <I>IN CONTEXT's
</I>new managing editor. We all feel she has done very well in quickly coming
up to speed with this challenging (some would say daunting) task.<BR>

<H1><CENTER>Community-Based Strategies<BR>
for Change</CENTER>
</H1>
<H4><CENTER><I>by Rob Young and Grant Power</I></CENTER>
</H4>
<BR>
<I>Rob Young is president of American Soils, Inc., a composting company
based in Freehold, New Jersey. Rob has a masters degree in city and regional
planning, with a minor in ecology and systematics from Cornell University.
He is a co-founder of the Council of Sustainable Industries of New York
and New Jersey.<BR>
<BR>
Grant Power is a community-based economic development consultant who works
with, among others, the Union Rescue Mission in Los Angeles. Grant has what
he describes as an MBA with a social purpose, from Eastern College, in Pennsylvania.
</I><BR>
<BR>
Community-based change is fast becoming the key to America's future. More
and more, local communities across the country are mobilizing their own
resources in sustainable and creative ways to meet the needs of their members.
From affordable housing and neighborhood enterprises to recreation and recycling,
communities are finding that the best way to seek change is to organize.<BR>
<BR>
These initially scattered efforts have grown into a nationwide movement
that is fundamentally reshaping American society. What we are seeing is
the early stage of a large-scale shift toward a society that is more authentically
democratic, ecologically sound, and economically just.<BR>
<BR>
The burgeoning preference in America for community-based approaches to change
stems partly from the public's disillusionment with the nation's central
institutions. There has also been a rediscovery of the virtues of a back-to-basics
lifestyle centered on creating healthful communities. <BR>
<BR>
This change in perspective is a clean departure from the American habit
of looking to public policy, social services, and the market system for
solutions to endemic problems like homelessness, unemployment, and pollution.
Citizens all over are realizing that <I>they</I> must take the lead in addressing
these problems instead of waiting for the country's leaders to take the
initiative. 
<H4><BR>
COMMUNITY-BASED SOLUTIONS</H4>
This discovery has come not as a disappointment, but as a pleasant surprise.
In mobilizing one community at a time, many people are astonished by the
many new, creative possibilities for change they missed when they confronted
large-scale institutions through, for example, shareholder resolutions or
citizen referenda. <BR>
<BR>
Some have struggled just to create a modest sense of community in transitory
urban neighborhoods. Others have carved out bold alternative economic structures,
such as worker-owned cooperatives and local barter systems. <BR>
<BR>
Some communities have responded to the ecology movement by collectively
abandoning the consumption sickness of advanced industrial society for a
modest, more sustainable lifestyle. Some have etched whole eco-villages
into large modern cities. <BR>
<BR>
Whatever their particular pursuits, community-based change strategies have
awakened many people to their own power to be self-supporting and self-managing.
In many cases, communities have been more effective in meeting their own
needs - at lower cost - than any government or private-sector service provider.
<H4><BR>
POPULIST ROOTS</H4>
A widespread movement for community-based change is not unique to the present.
Today's movement is similar to the populist uprisings of the 1890s, 1930s,
and 1960s and, in some respects, is simply the latest expression of a populist
impulse that has endured throughout American history. <BR>
<BR>
Populist movements reach their peaks whenever the nation's core institutions
(large corporations as well as federal government) consolidate vast powers,
but break down at their core due to corruption or collusion among policy
and business elites. Real issues that affect the American people are either
ignored or limply addressed through a series of political charades. Urgent,
far-reaching reforms are needed, and, in an atmosphere of crisis, local
communities find they must sprout their own solutions.<BR>
<BR>
After gaining momentum and influence, these movements historically were
co-opted through a mixture of legislated payoffs and empty reforms. In the
end, the concentration of economic assets and decision-making power remained
essentially unchanged. 
<H4><BR>
A CRISIS IN CONFIDENCE</H4>
Conditions in America today are not unlike those that spawned popular uprisings
in the past. We face a crisis of confidence in the nation's leadership and
in its ongoing capacity to provide just and credible governance or to respond
adequately to the problems of the present. The stirrings of a crisis are
also evident in the public's loss of faith in our core institutions. Increasingly,
the government is not enforcing laws, the medical establishment is not healing,
the economy is not providing enough jobs or income, and banks are not protecting
their depositors. <BR>
<BR>
In the face of this diagnosis, the typical reaction of most government and
business leaders to bold action programs is unyielding skepticism or feigned
agreement. Candidates for elected office label their proposals as &quot;bold&quot;
but have in mind only tinkering with the status quo. The public knows that
these leaders have the most to lose from genuine systemic change and cannot
be trusted to author or enforce such change. Our society has all the appearances
of a major crisis in the making.<BR>
<BR>
We do not know whether or when such a crisis will occur. If we are hit by
a national crisis, such as a 1930s-style depression, some argue that populist
elements will again be co-opted through a new round of federal and corporate
payoffs, and history will repeat itself. This argument assumes that the
present-day movement for community-based change is essentially the same
as its forebears. 
<H4><BR>
WHAT'S DIFFERENT NOW</H4>
That argument falls flat in view of today's facts. While quite similar in
its historical context to earlier populist movements, today's movement shows
signs of resilience and unbreakability that are unique in our history. <BR>
<BR>
First, the movement is broader, deeper, older, and more sophisticated. Sloganeering
and mass rallies have given way to complex strategizing and technical savvy.
Experimentation in social and ecological change, such as community land
trusts and loan funds, biointensive organic agriculture, communal forestry,
renewable energy, tenant and worker buyouts, community self-insurance, and
local exchange currencies, have been tested and proven across a range of
socioeconomic contexts.<BR>
<BR>
Second, movement leaders show greater maturity and ability to discern and
fend off co-optation. They cannot be bought off so easily. They have sacrificed
a great deal for their causes and are in the movement for the long haul.<BR>
<BR>
Third, an entire infrastructure has developed over the last 15 years to
support community-based change, such as community development corporations
and neighborhood anti-drug coalitions. These have given the movement the
capacity to carry forward its missions year after year. <BR>
<BR>
Neighborhood organizations have begun networking with community groups in
other locations, creating a larger and deeper layer of support and education.
In some cases, these networks - formed along sectoral lines, such as housing,
ecology, or demilitarization - have converged to form broader people's movements
with enough information, technology, and leadership to accomplish multiple
objectives across the country while resisting federal policies that undermine
community autonomy. <BR>
<BR>
This movement has ongoing contact with sister movements in other countries.
The collective experience of international movements is an important source
of instruction and inspiration to community activists in the US.<BR>
<BR>
Fourth, core institutions in the US do not just suffer from a poverty of
confidence, but from a shortage of resources that have traditionally been
used to co-opt social movements. Ironically, the growing deficits of federal
and state governments, the declining profits of large corporations, and
the shrinking ability of banks to lend money (over the last 50 years) have
actually served to protect the growth of grassroots alternatives.<BR>
<BR>
The growth and proliferation of self-directed communities signal that the
democratic impulse is still very much alive in America, even though most
citizens may have given up on democracy in Washington, DC. But in the 1990s,
the explosive growth of community-based change may shift the powers of governance
away from both state and federal governments. <BR>
<BR>
As a political force, this movement goes virtually unnoticed by business
and government elites and receives only fleeting and sporadic attention
from the media. But its behind-the-scenes character does not diminish its
potency on the American political landscape. Indeed, its invisibility is
its strength. Movements that become highly visible often are quickly squelched
or co-opted by an uneasy power elite. 
<H4><BR>
WHO YOU GONNA' CALL ...</H4>
We are convinced that community-based change strategies will proliferate
quietly while the corruption and breakdown at the core of American society
continue. <BR>
<BR>
Some parts of the financial and business community (as well as government
agencies) may form partnerships with community-based institutions and promote
the movement. Others will probably attempt to block its progress, and the
affected communities will have to call on their colleagues for assistance,
at times, to avoid being shut down. Some participants will aim for community
autonomy from the core and interdependence across the movement, while in
other cases, core institutions will be transformed, and become part of the
solution. Both types of change will be part of creating a new society for
the next century.<BR>
<BR>
We anticipate that, just as people of the former Soviet Union are experiencing
convulsive political change, one day we may reach the point of an economic
mega-crisis in which our core economic and political institutions collapse.
If this does happen, communities that have built strong community-based
organizations will stand out as leading examples of a hopeful alternative.
Even if no collapse occurs, the on-going example of these communities will
continue to provide a way out of the growing chaos and tribulation that
plague our society.<BR>

Municipal Muscles</CENTER>
</H1>
<H4><CENTER><I>by John Hart</I></CENTER>
</H4>
<BR>
<I>San Jose is one place where a city-wide effort to move toward sustainablility
succeeded at least in part because of the city's whole-system approach.
The lessons from San Jose and other cities is chronicled in a Resource Renewal
Institute book, </I>Saving Cities Saving Money: Environmental Strategies
that Work.<I> This book, which we adapted, is a valuable tool for those
working for city-wide transformation; it can be ordered from agAccess, PO
Box 2008, Davis, CA 95617. </I><BR>
<BR>
San Jose, California, population 782,000, used to have a hard-to-shake reputation
as an environmental despoiler: the megalopolis that out-competed its rivals
in paving over the agricultural Santa Clara Valley, &quot;valley of heart's
delight.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Recently, the city has emerged instead as a leader in the pursuit of environmental
efficiency. By the most conservative estimate, its environmental programs
now save the city government $6 million a year. When savings to the community
are included, the total reaches over $15 million. <BR>
<BR>
The transformation didn't occur all at once, of course. There were various
turning points. The city had officially repudiated the old policy of sprawl
by 1975. But it was at the very end of the 1970s that a positive new direction
was set. <BR>
<BR>
In 1978, a controlled-growth mayoral candidate achieved a stunning victory
over a traditional opponent. One of the architects of that victory, consultant
Dennis Church, wrote a report entitled &quot;Toward a Sustainable City:
A Report on Natural Resources and the City of San Jose.&quot; The paper
reviewed the pressing need for resource conservation and suggested that
environmental protection, economic growth, social welfare, and fiscal solvency
are interlocking, not competing, goals. <BR>
<BR>
While Church tapped away at his paper, two shocks hit the city. The steep
oil price rise of the late '70s and a major sewage spill: the city's overburdened
waste-water treatment plant discharged an appalling amount of untreated
effluent into the shallow, slowly circulating waters of southern San Francisco
Bay. The Regional Water Quality Control Board threatened a building ban.
<H4><BR>
FIRST STEPS </H4>
When, in the aftermath of these events, Church's paper appeared, it found
an audience wide awake and hungry for ideas. The initial step the city council
took along the recommended lines was to create an energy office. Church
was hired as its founding director. <BR>
<BR>
The first major assignment of the &quot;energy&quot; office was to help
out with the waste-water crisis. The city distributed free low-flow shower
heads and other water conservation devices throughout San Jose. The inflow
to the sewer plant declined, helping to buy time for needed improvements.
<BR>
<BR>
The energy program proper took its initial campaign literally to the streets.
At the beginning of the 1980s, the city replaced the mercury vapor lamps
in all its streetlights with low-pressure sodium fixtures that use half
the electricity. Result: a $1.5 million drop in San Jose's annual energy
bill - not once, but forever. 
<H4><BR>
THE GARBAGE COUP </H4>
A third early campaign cleared the way for recycling. For many years, a
single garbage company had owned the only landfill in San Jose and held
an effective monopoly on garbage collection and disposal. The cost to the
city kept rising. Moreover, the contractor was uninterested in recycling
and, faced with public resentment at high garbage bills, the city could
not launch a serious curbside recycling program for which it would have
had to charge. <BR>
<BR>
Councilwoman Shirley Lewis, assisted by Dennis Church, realized that the
garbage monopoly had to be broken - if possible, at the 1984 contract renewal.
First, the city hurried to open a second landfill: that is, it solicited
a private proposal and shepherded it through the multiple levels of approval
such a project requires. Second, the city separated the garbage contract
into two parts: one agreement for collection, the other for final landfill
disposal. <BR>
<BR>
When the contracts were bid, one of two major companies won the disposal
contract; the other won on garbage collection. The winning bids totaled
nearly $6 million less per year than the city had been paying. The city
used half the savings to fund recycling programs and returned the other
half to the public as a rate decrease. So San Jose found itself in the delightful
position of increasing service and reducing cost. <BR>
<BR>
San Jose's garbage maneuver changed the waste management world. The two
companies that competed for the city's business - Browning Ferris, Inc.
and Waste Management, Inc. - are also the two largest companies in the field.
Spurred by the San Jose experience, each entered the recycling business
in a big way. 
<H4><BR>
WIDENING THE ATTACK </H4>
&quot;When we try to pick out anything by itself,&quot; John Muir observed,
&quot;we find it hitched to everything else in the universe.&quot; So it
is with natural resources, Dennis Church says. To waste one is typically
to waste several; to conserve one may be to conserve them all. <BR>
<BR>
If less water is used, for instance, less energy is used to pump and heat
it. Recycling saves not only landfill capacity but also energy, water, forests,
and mineral wealth. (Recycling an aluminum can - contents, a cup and a half
- saves energy equivalent to three quarters of a cup of gasoline.) Improving
mass transit cuts air pollution, energy use, and greenhouse emissions while
reducing noise, congestion, and cut-through neighborhood traffic. To take
advantage of these overlaps, a broad view and a broad attack are required.
<BR>
<BR>
Recognizing this interconnectedness, San Jose in 1986 combined its energy,
water, and solid waste programs and created the Office of Environmental
Management (OEM). <BR>
<BR>
With support and prodding from Councilwoman Lewis and other members of the
council's environmental committee, OEM has carried out a long list of efficiency
and environmental protection measures. Sometimes these programs are distinctly
new; in other cases, what occurs is a subtle change of emphasis. 
<H4><BR>
TAKING ACTION </H4>
San Jose's actions toward sustainability took place in eight areas - some
have already been implemented, others are still in preparation. 
<DL>
  <DT><I>* Saving Heating, Cooling, and Lighting Energy <BR>
<BR>
</I>
  <DD>Energy audits of public buildings identified opportunities to save
energy used for heating, cooling, and lighting. A $2.2 million investment
in energy savings resulted in savings of $500,000 each year. A resource
center helps building designers and contractors meet requirements for energy
efficiency in new public and private buildings. The city plans to plant
1 million trees by the year 2000 to reduce air conditioning requirements.
</DL>
<I><BR>
* Saving Energy by Promoting Efficient Driving</I>
<DL>
  <DD>The city is buying fuel-efficient vehicles for its fleet and encourages
its major contractors to do likewise. Drivers of city vehicles are trained
to save fuel by making fewer trips and driving more efficiently. Efforts
to improve traffic flow include installing &quot;smart&quot; traffic signals,
maintaining streets and roads, and focusing traffic enforcement on trouble
spots.
</DL>
<I><BR>
* Saving Energy by Discouraging Solo Driving and Promoting Other Means of
Transportation</I>
<DL>
  <DD>A hub-and-spoke light rail system is being developed, and adjacent
counties are cooperating to develop a network of linked high-occupancy-vehicle
(HOV) lanes. Employers are encouraged to promote carpooling with the help
of a city-run Commuter Network.
</DL>
<I><BR>
* Conserving Water and Reducing Wastewater Flows</I>
<DL>
  <DD>The city distributed low-flow shower heads and toilet dams to every
household, and is planning an incentive program for installation of low-volume
toilets. The resulting savings to homeowners are estimated at $200 per year
in addition to saving the city some $68 million in wastewater treatment
facilities. Landscaping standards have been adopted that save irrigation
water and the city plans a demonstration garden to show what can be grown
with little watering. Recycled, treated wastewater is sold for outdoor use.
</DL>
<I><BR>
* Conserving Materials</I>
<DL>
  <DD>A preventive maintenance program is intended to extend the life of
streets and public facilities. New construction is required by code to use
durable materials and to be designed to withstand earthquakes. Older buildings
are being retrofitted to improve their seismic safety.
</DL>
<I><BR>
* Recycling Materials</I>
<DL>
  <DD>The city recycles its own solid wastes and purchases recycled products.
Over 175,000 homes participate in the curb-side recycling program, and a
yard-waste composting program is in place. 
</DL>
<I><BR>
* Controlling Several Specific Types of Pollution</I>
<DL>
  <DD>The city has programs to dispose of household toxins, to recycle CFCs
used in refrigeration, and to better manage storm water runoff .
</DL>
<I><BR>
* Setting Land Use and Transportation Policies That Maximize Efficiency</I>
<DL>
  <DD>The city is controlling urban sprawl by increasing densities downtown
and along a planned light-rail system. The city is also working to locate
jobs near housing to reduce commuting. Land use and transportation planning
is the most potent lever available to cities to improve resource efficiency.
</DL>
<P><CENTER><HR WIDTH="30%"></CENTER>
<H2><CENTER><A NAME="TakingHold"></A>WAYS OF TAKING HOLD</CENTER>
</H2>
Once you begin looking at government operations with an eye to extending
resources and saving money, opportunities turn up everywhere. It's natural
to divide the list by the resource conserved: here's what we can do to economize
on energy, on water, and so on. <BR>
<BR>
But running through this pattern is another: a series of widening circles
of action, beginning with measures a city can take quite simply, in-house,
and expanding ring by ring to measures, sometimes controversial, that profoundly
affect a whole community. A city has the following powers:<I><BR>
<BR>
The power to change its own internal operations and the behavior of its
employees</I>
<DL>
  <DD>City leaders can't very well push conservation on others if they don't
practice it in buildings and facilities under their direct control. Besides
their example value, such measures produce enormous real savings. These
initiatives are politically the cheapest: they can be adopted fairly quickly
and simply.
</DL>
<I><BR>
The power to promote efficiency through good management of the city's infrastructure,
including, notably, streets and roads</I>
<DL>
  <DD>Early and proper maintenance of city facilities is an enormous lever
of resource efficiency, easily grasped.
</DL>
<I><BR>
The power to promote efficiency through the products it buys and the contracts
it signs</I>
<DL>
  <DD>The city is a huge consumer of goods and services. By buying &quot;green&quot;
products, and by choosing contractors who represent quality practices, it
can get exactly what it wants and also work some very efficient economic
controls. San Jose, as we have seen, helped to convert two major solid waste
companies to the cause of recycling. Zurich, Switzerland, gave a significant
boost to the electric car industry.
</DL>
<I><BR>
The power to provide various environmental services and to levy charges
for them</I>
<DL>
  <DD>This method is especially easy in a city that controls some of its
own public utilities and already mails a regular bill.
</DL>
<I><BR>
The power to make sure that newly constructed buildings and facilities meet
high efficiency standards</I>
<DL>
  <DD>Every time a project is designed, built, or rebuilt, there is an opportunity
to build efficiency into it at relatively low cost.
</DL>
<I><BR>
The power to promote retrofitting</I>
<DL>
  <DD>Not less important is the adaptation of existing homes and other private
buildings to new environmental standards. Governments could theoretically
demand retrofitting through ordinances, but choose mainly to work this field
through advice and selective subsidies.
</DL>
<I><BR>
The power to plan efficient future land-use and transportation</I>
<DL>
  <DD>Although curtailed by the interdependence of each city with its neighbors,
this role is substantial.
</DL>
<I><BR>
The power to mandate, directly, changes in behavior by large businesses</I>
<DL>
  <DD>Because of the large amounts of resources they use and pollutants
they produce, large commercial and industrial firms are obvious targets
for regulation. 
</DL>
<I><BR>
The power to mandate changes in behavior by small businesses and by private
citizens</I>
<DL>
  <DD>Such regulation cannot be avoided, but there are right and wrong ways
of doing it to avoid undue burdens and backlash. It is vital to consult
before acting, to explain the need clearly, and, if at all possible, to
offer a service alongside the rule or restriction.

<H1><CENTER>Study Circles: Schools For Life</CENTER>
</H1>
<H4><CENTER><I>by Cecile Andrews</I></CENTER>
</H4>
<BR>
<I>Study Circles are blossoming. All over the US, people are rediscovering
what the Swedes borrowed from us a century ago - an engaging way to learn
while socializing. <BR>
<BR>
Cecile Andrews, director of continuing education for North Seattle Community
College, has built the program around the concepts of caring, creativity,
and community, and offers classes in personal growth, professional development,
and public involvement. <BR>
<BR>
Through the college, Cecile is pioneering new methods for getting study
circles started. Among them is a series on voluntary simplicity which she
organized in collaboration with </I>IN CONTEXT<I>. <BR>
<P><CENTER><B>It is time we had uncommon schools, <BR>
that we did not leave off our education<BR>
when we begin to be men and women.<BR>
<BR>
- Henry David Thoreau</B></I></CENTER>
<P>Imagine this: Sitting around a dining room table littered with cups and
the remains of banana bread are seven or eight people. A burst of laughter
dies down as a woman continues her story about trying to persuade her 16
year-old son to wear a helmet when he rides his bike. A man wipes tears
of laughter from his eyes and nods vigorously - &quot;Yes, I know just what
you mean. My son did that, too. But I read an article the other day that
said ....&quot;<BR>
<BR>
These people are engaged in one of the most fulfilling human pastimes -
conversation. But they're not at a dinner party. They're part of a study
circle - a way of learning that is springing up across the country, a method
of study that has been referred to as &quot;education by the people.&quot;
In our thrill-seeking, high-tech, hectic times, people are turning to a
relaxed, simple, low-tech form of fulfillment - educating themselves in
an informal, egalitarian setting. <BR>
<BR>
Members of community groups, churches, business groups, and unions have
used this small-group discussion format to seek understanding and common
ground when they faced difficult issues or hard choices. And formal adult
education offerings are starting to include study circles on a variety of
issues and topics.<BR>
<BR>
This growing interest in study circles is part of a larger movement. People
are discovering their own authority in education just as they are in medicine
and religion. This reflects a growing conviction that there is a collective
wisdom in groups, that education and understanding go hand in hand, and
that learning can truly be available for all. 
<H4><BR>
THE DIVERSITY OF TRUTH</H4>
When people take responsibility for their own education they are, in part,
saying that they want to come up with their own ideas - to examine their
experience and discover their own truths. In study circles, participants
learn to listen to each other's ideas, not as points to debate, but as different
experiences of reality. They may not agree, but they learn to accept that
- just like blind men feeling different parts of the elephant - each person
may be limited by his or her own perspective.<BR>
<BR>
In the study circle, each participant feels empowered to think for themselves.
Anxiety about appearing foolish is lost. Since there is no one &quot;right&quot;
answer, all are free to say what they think, to sit back and relax, and
enjoy learning and thinking. Participants are encouraged to speak their
minds freely and to engage in friendly disagreement. <BR>
<BR>
Often, written materials are used as a basis for discussion, and these are
sometimes chosen to reflect diversity of opinion. Study circle participants
have a special opportunity to investigate their own capacities to communicate
with and affect others, to improve their listening skills, and to use their
critical faculties.
<H4><BR>
EQUALITY</H4>
Unlike the traditional classroom - where inequality affects not only the
student/teacher relationship, but the relationships between students - in
a study circle, a person with a doctorate has no more status than a person
with a high school diploma. Value is placed not on having mastered someone
else's ideas, but on generating and communicating ideas of one's own.<BR>
<BR>
Most often, there is a facilitator whose job is not to have mastery over
the subject the group is discussing, but to keep the discussion going. Facilitators
need be &quot;expert&quot; only in managing the group so that all are heard
and the conversation stays lively and on topic. 
<H4><BR>
DEMOCRACY</H4>
By managing the process themselves, participants practice democracy. What
is democracy? It's a system of shared power, a system in which individuals
feel they can affect the outcome of political decisions. In the study circle
environment - where there is equality, respect for others, and excitement
about the exchange of ideas - people are engaged in the most fundamental
aspects of democracy. They will come to conclusions or make decisions through
talking, listening, and understanding. <BR>
<BR>
Study circles - the open exchange of ideas, the give and take of discussion
- could be (as they are in Sweden) at the heart of our democratic society.
In fact, study circles have been used very successfully here in the US to
focus on political issues. Many participants - having learned to go in and
out of leadership roles, to solve problems and to resolve conflicts - go
on to become active in more strictly political forums.
<H4><BR>
CONNECTION</H4>
In study circles, &quot;connection&quot; is central. Participants are not
required to separate feelings from thoughts concerning a topic. Their roles
- as teachers, students, leaders, and followers - fluctuate within and across
study circle sessions. <BR>
<BR>
Participants seldom take part just to learn objective facts. The importance
of what they learn lies in its connection to their lives, their own experiences,
and the real problems and issues they face. A study circle is &quot;education
for life.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
And, of course, the participants themselves are connected. When people talk
about their lives, share their feelings, and listen to each other with respect,
there is connection and a sense of community. When there is no need to compete
or wear a mask, people begin to discover and present their authentic selves.
<H4><BR>
EDUCATION AS TRANSFORMATION</H4>
Today, conventional education focuses more and more on careerism, seeing
education in the narrow role of helping people get jobs. Study circles focus
on self-realization and social transformation by encouraging participants
to blossom as individuals and to bring about change in society.<BR>
<BR>
Study circles bring people together to talk, to feel part of a community,
and to practice acceptance of diversity, equality, democracy, and connectedness.
Imagine what could happen if more and more people were engaged in these
&quot;uncommon schools.&quot; Perhaps it would become clear that Americans'
supposed apathy toward education and political participation is really a
disguise for a deep hunger to learn and become involved. <BR>

<H2><CENTER><A NAME="Guidelines"></A>GOOD ADVICE </CENTER>
</H2>
The following tips for successful study circles, excerpted from materials
supplied by the Study Circles Resource Center, show that the communications
skills used and honed in the study circle environment are pertinent in almost
any other situation. <BR>
<BR>
See <A HREF="#SCRC">below</A> for more on what the Resource Center has to
offer to assist those running their own study circles. <B><BR>
<BR>
* Maintain an open mind. </B>You don't score points by rigidly sticking
to your early statements. Feel free to explore ideas that you have rejected
or failed to consider in the past.<B><BR>
<BR>
* Strive to understand the position of those who disagree with you.</B>
Your own knowledge is not complete until you understand other participants'
points of view and why they feel the way they do. It's important to respect
people who disagree with you; they have reasons for their beliefs. You should
be able to make a good case for positions you disagree with. This level
of comprehension and empathy will make you a much better advocate for whatever
position you come to.<B><BR>
<BR>
* Value your own experience and opinions.</B> Everyone in the group, including
you, has unique knowledge and experience; this variety makes the discussion
an interesting learning experience for all. Don't feel pressured to speak,
but realize that failing to speak means robbing the group of your wisdom.<BR>

<H2><CENTER><A NAME="SCHistory"></A>STUDY CIRCLES: HISTORY &amp; RESOURCES</CENTER>
</H2>
Americans discovered study circles in Sweden, a country which has been characterized
as a &quot;study circle democracy.&quot; At any one time, one-third of Swedish
adults are engaged in some form of adult education - most often it is a
study circle. The government has subsidized this form of education since
1947, and uses it not only to educate people about government policies,
but to receive feedback from the public.<BR>
<BR>
Ironically, the Swedes imported the study circle idea from the US where
it was used in the early Chautauqua movement, an adult education system
of lectures and study groups popular in the late nineteenth century. The
Swedish people saw it as an answer to their problems of poverty and illiteracy
- to educate the broadest possible spectrum of society in the arts of democracy.<BR>
<BR>
Today, following a period of decreased awareness and a lack of involvement
in community affairs, many in the US are re-adopting study circles. Linked
to a broader educational movement called &quot;folk education&quot; - again
brought over from Scandinavia - study circles are designed to encourage
both personal growth and social responsibility. <BR>
<BR>
This emphasis on the responsibility to work for the common good fits well
with the growing realization that we cannot deal with the tremendous social
and environmental problems we face unless everyone is part of developing
the solutions. <BR>
<BR>
Good examples of how well this can work come from one of America's best
known folk education efforts - Highlander Center, founded by Myles Horton
in the thirties. In the depths of the Depression, Horton established a school
in Tennessee which brought people together to figure out how to solve their
problems themselves. In the early years he worked with labor unions, and
later, with the civil rights movement. <BR>
<BR>
Highlander's role affected all our lives. A few months before Rosa Parks
refused to give up her seat on the bus, she attended classes at Highlander.
So did Martin Luther King and Eleanor Roosevelt. As Myles Horton expressed
it, &quot;The fact is that people have within themselves the seeds of greatness,
if they're developed. It's not a matter of trying to fill up people, but
to fulfill people.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Study circles hold great promise for both personal and social transformation,
and several organizations are working enthusiastically to help people engage
in them. For more information, call or write the following: <BR>

<H1><CENTER>Voluntary Simplicity Study Circles</CENTER>
</H1>
<H4><CENTER><I>by Janet Luhrs</I></CENTER>
</H4>
<BR>
<I>In early spring of 1991, Cecile Andrews, director of 
continuing education at North Seattle Community College 
called </I>IN CONTEXT <I>to ask whether we would be interested 
in helping her form study circles to discuss issues 
of humane, sustainable culture. We said &quot;Yes,&quot; 
and the first study circle gathering, comprised mostly 
of our subscribers, chose </I>IC<I> #26, &quot;What Is Enough?,&quot; 
to study. Thus were born the Voluntary Simplicity Study 
Circles. <P>

In January 1992, Cecile offered a workshop on voluntary 
simplicity to the general public (through North Seattle 
Community College). Though she was expecting about 
20 people to enroll, 175 came. Over 200 came to the 
next workshop. At the end of each workshop, Cecile 
forms study circles: she organizes the participants 
into neighborhood groupings, gives each of them their 
copy of </I>IN CONTEXT <I>and they're off - meeting weekly 
in each other's homes. <P>

As this story by study circle aficionado Janet Luhrs 
shows, people become devoted to their circles. Cecile 
says the success of these groups seems to be a mixture 
of the times, the subject, and a yearning for community. 
She's tried study circles on other topics, but none 
has yet been as overwhelmingly successful as voluntary 
simplicity.</I><P>

I was on the run. My life was becoming a blur. The colors 
were all mixing. I kept thinking, &quot;There has to 
be a slower way,&quot; but I had forgotten how to unplug. 
In my rush to get somewhere and be something, I had 
become an official member of the rat race of America. 
<P>

We all know that there truly is an &quot;end&quot; somewhere, 
and when we find it we will be satisfied, at last. 
Everybody I knew was in a hurry to get to that same 
end. The newspapers, magazines, and city life all kept 
screeching at me to hurry up and get this and go there. 
I had no other role models.<P>

 The trouble was, something kept yelling at me with 
deafening interference that this wasn't true. Then 
I noticed an obscure little seminar offered at North 
Seattle Community College called &quot;Voluntary Simplicity, 
a way of life that has been described as outwardly 
simple, inwardly rich.&quot; I knew I had found something. 
<P>

I don't know when I have been more excited about going 
to a class. The seminar was only one evening, but many 
of us chose the option of forming neighborhood study 
groups to explore voluntary simplicity personally. 
<P>

 Five arrived at the first meeting at my house. I didn't 
know what to think. Was my house too mainstream for 
these people? Would they like me? All of us were different, 
but we all wanted to slow down and live another way. 
We shared our hurried lives with each other and agreed 
to meet weekly to explore our hazy notions of simplicity. 
<P>

 I knew that there was no going back for me. My first 
night in a study circle meant my last night of passively 
accepting the scurrying and darting of life. I had 
no specific agenda; I only knew that I had landed on 
a concept that I liked a lot. <P>

 The groups (and my own life) have been evolving in 
a wonderful way. At first, we struggled to organize 
ourselves. We shared our setbacks and encouraged each 
other to forge ahead anyway. We knew well that change 
is very difficult without help. In America, complicated 
living screams from every corner. We were no longer 
just a study group: we were a support group, too.  
<P>

 We shared books and articles we had read. We became 
amazingly adept at taking mental Polaroid shots of 
busy lives - ours and others' - and bringing the pictures 
to our weekly meetings to analyze and figure out ways 
to do it differently. We applied these new concepts 
to our lives. We did this weekly for about six months; 
then we merged with another group and enlarged our 
horizons. We talked about the ecology of simple living 
and the global aspects of cutting back. We taught each 
other and learned about ideas we didn't know existed.<P>

 We shared our small successes. One man, after many 
weeks of deliberation, finally left his car at home 
and took the bus to work one day a week. Then he got 
up his nerve and asked his boss if he could work four 
instead of five days a week. (His boss said &quot;yes.&quot;) 
I took a class called Small Appliance Repair so I could 
fix my broken appliances instead of dumping them.  
<P>

 Here and there, I am now able to miss a meeting, secure 
with the thought that simplification is in my blood. 
But because I don't want to stagnate, and because it 
feels so good to have a refuge for my beliefs, I continue 
to show up most of the time. I also just plain like 
the people.<P>

I suppose our group will continue to evolve, just like 
people do. I don't know where it will all end, but 
one thing I learned is that there is no place you reach, 
breathe a sigh of relief and say, &quot;Oh, finally 
I've arrived.&quot; It's more a matter of learning 
and growing - and helping each other to learn and grow 
too.<P>

<H1><CENTER>New Life For Inner Cities</CENTER>
</H1>
<H4><CENTER><I>by Patrick Barry</I></CENTER>
</H4>
<BR>
<I>Excerpted from </I>The Neighborhood Works,<I> August/September 1992;
&copy; Center for Neighborhood Technology, Chicago; subscriptions, $30.</I><BR>
<BR>
When news anchors and politicians toured south-central Los Angeles after
the riots, describing poverty and racial isolation as if they had just discovered
them, they failed to note two key facts: first, that the problems are not
confined to LA but are of epidemic proportions, and second, that some solutions
devised by city residents to turn the situation around are already in place.<BR>
<BR>
These efforts often depend on outside resources, but their essence is local:
neighborhood people making decisions, nurturing economic development, creating
hope. Hundreds of communities are creating businesses, building housing,
increasing job opportunities, and shaping public policy. Replication of
this success-from-within approach could help the nation reverse the decline
of its cities.<BR>
<BR>
Much of the groundwork is done. A recent survey by the National Congress
for Community Economic Development found that the nation's 2,000 locally
governed community development corporations (CDCs) have built 320,000 units
of mostly low-income housing nationwide, and in the past five years helped
create or retain 90,000 jobs. &quot;CDCs are not a panacea, but they have
a proven track record despite a direct absence of federal assistance,&quot;
says Robert Zdenek, president of the National Congress.
<H4><BR>
INCUBATING ENTREPRENEURSHIP</H4>
According to Zdenek, one fifth of all development corporations have become
involved in commercial and industrial development, and he expects more to
follow. The reason: business development creates wealth. The Linwood Shopping
Center developed by CDC-Kansas City supports 10 minority-owned businesses
and captures $35 million in sales from the neighborhood. A second center
will harbor 16 more minority-owned stores.<BR>
<BR>
On Chicago's West Side, 32 of 69 businesses in the Fulton-Carroll Center
incubator, which nurtures small business startups, are minority-owned. &quot;These
companies are very important because they provide role models and attract
back the middle class,&quot; says June Lavelle, the gruff and hard-driving
Fulton-Carroll president whose assistance has helped 71 firms &quot;graduate&quot;
since 1980. <BR>
<BR>
Two types of people are suited to the knock-down rigors of entrepreneurship,
according to Lavelle: those with graduate degrees and financial wherewithal,
like former Citibank vice president Ron Damper, whose tea-blending business
now employs 25; and those who replace schooling with experience and determination,
like Al Johnson, a printer who bought out his boss's struggling business
and, with technical assistance through the incubator, turned the company
around.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;People have to be willing to work the 14-hour days,&quot; Lavelle
says, &quot;but if we're looking at urban poverty, this makes a lot of sense,
because these companies hire out of the neighborhoods.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Incubators have been opening at the rate of one per month since 1986 and
now total 470 in North America, according to the National Business Incubation
Association. In the &quot;industry&quot; of business development, they represent
the middle-market. Above are the larger, well-capitalized companies that
use traditional banks for support; below are the bootstrap microenterprises
that are growing even faster than incubators.
<H4><BR>
THE MICROENTERPRISE BOOM</H4>
Modeled after programs started by the Grameen Bank in Bangladesh, microenterprise
programs provide loans as small as $100 to help individuals start or expand
businesses. In lieu of collateral, many programs organize lending circles
of five or more people; one or two take out a loan, and when they pay it
back, others in the circle borrow the money. <BR>
<BR>
An estimated 108 such programs are operating in the US, up from a handful
five years ago. Among the biggest is the Women's Self Employment Project
(WSEP) in Chicago, which to date has advanced 210 loans worth $300,000.
<BR>
<BR>
One woman, who WSEP executive director Connie Evans says &quot;could sell
anything,&quot; used a series of small loans and a lot of financial and
business advice to begin a shoe business, first from her home and now in
a storefront. Another woman had truckdriving training but couldn't crack
the male dominated industry; she borrowed enough to begin a shipping brokerage
firm, borrowed again, and now runs her own trucks.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;One of the greatest byproducts is the impact on the families of the
entrepreneurs,&quot; says Evans. &quot;The kids see their mother building
a business and they want to get involved; they start to understand that
there is more out there besides welfare or a dead-end job.&quot;
<H4><BR>
OPPORTUNITY IN KEY INDUSTRIES</H4>
As political and community leaders look for strategies to rebuild cities,
they will get more bang for the buck if they focus on businesses and industries
that create multiple benefits. Most cities need millions of dollars for
streets, schools, libraries, and public transit systems. Since minority-owned
firms already have a foothold in construction, the spending could boost
entrepreneurship while physically reconstructing the ghettoes. Likewise,
cities that invest in industrial parks could make a conscious effort to
attract and support minority-owned food processors, manufacturers, and technology
companies, all of which have shown growth among minority entrepreneurs.<BR>
<BR>
One of the most promising fields is the energy and environmental industry,
which could create jobs while making cities healthier and more energy efficient.
The recycling industry has created thousands of new jobs in the past five
years, most of them in urban areas. Johnnie Jones of Chicago is one of the
few minorities to build a business out of it. He employs 14 people rebuilding
wooden pallets for the shipping industry, and instead of spending $400 a
truckload to landfill unusable scraps, he grinds the wood into an absorbent
for use in factories, stables, and food stores.<BR>
<BR>
Growth of the recycling industry will be matched by that of energy and other
environmental firms. The Clean Air Act amendments tighten emission standards
for industry and require cities and employers to reduce automobile use.
Complying with the act will create opportunities to develop and maintain
pollution control equipment, provide transportation services, or recycle
coolants from refrigeration systems. <BR>
<BR>
Energy equipment and services, like lighting retrofits and construction
of cogeneration plants, will also grow because the payback period on efficiency
investments has shrunk dramatically. A recent study by Citizens Fund, the
research arm of Citizen Action, found that energy efficiency can create
four times as many jobs as finding and extracting new fuels.
<H4><BR>
BROADENING THE PROCESS</H4>
The successes of CDCs, incubators, microenterprise and other business development
strategies are real, but they can't do it alone. Other players will need
to be:<BR>
<BR>
<B>banks and other lenders</B>, because access to credit remains a barrier
to home ownership and business development;<BR>
<BR>
<B>enterprise developers</B>, whose assistance to entrepreneurs can create
a base of locally owned businesses;<BR>
<BR>
<B>homegrown leaders</B>, because city-oriented policies won't be implemented
until residents gain leadership roles in local and national institutions,
including schools, mayors' offices, and the US Senate.<BR>
<BR>
Unfortunately, with interest on the national debt draining off $206 billion
a year and the continued dominance of Congress and corporate America by
well-off, mostly white leadership, the inner-city agenda remains a low priority.
That status won't change until the needs of the cities can be linked to
the needs of business owners and the suburban middle class. And that will
require a conscious strategy to convince Americans not only that the cities
can be saved, but that they can become an economic resource as the nation
restructures its faltering economy.<BR>

<H3><CENTER>AN INCUBATOR/MICROENTERPRISE SCORECARD</CENTER>
</H3>
Historically, only four out of 10 small businesses survive their first five
years, but businesses started in incubators have an 80 percent survival
rate.<BR>
According to a 1991 Mott Foundation survey of 29 microenterprise programs
operating in the US, the funds pumped $5.5 million into 1,235 new and expanding
businesses. The loans, averaging $3,600 each, led to the creation of 1,688
jobs. Fifty-nine percent of the businesses receiving the loans were owned
by women, 42 percent were minority-owned, and nearly a third were run by
people receiving public assistance. And the default rate on the loans was
just 6.6 percent.<BR>

<H1><CENTER>Living Democracy</CENTER>
</H1>
<H4><CENTER><I>by Trena M. Cleland</I></CENTER>
</H4>
<BR>
<I>In many communities, citizens feel powerless to affect even the most
basic conditions of their lives, much less the direction of national or
world events.<BR>
<BR>
But some groups have found ways to use their collective strength, both to
win improvements in their communities and to foster a sense of dignity and
self-worth among their members.<BR>
<BR>
Working under the auspices of the Institute for the Arts of Democracy (see
</I>IC <I>#30), Trena Cleland has been researching grassroots organizing
efforts in California to find out what makes some of them so effective.
In the following article, she describes the key lessons she learned from
these groups. For a complete version of Trena's case studies, write to the
Institute for the Arts of Democracy, 36 Eucalyptus Lane, Suite 100, San
Rafael, CA 94901. </I><BR>
<BR>
Bernie Knox, a single welfare mother raising three children in Santa Rosa,
CA, had never been involved in public affairs. Then she attended a meeting
to show support for local people who were pressing the sheriff to deal with
street crime in their neighborhood. She was amazed at the assertive and
confident way that people like herself took the sheriff to task and succeeded
in holding him accountable to his promises. Intrigued, she found herself
drawn to subsequent meetings.<BR>
<BR>
Then, a subject of immediate concern to her family motivated Bernie to try
out some of that same assertiveness. Concerned about heavy traffic in front
of their children's school, she and another mother used some of the organizing
skills they had seen demonstrated, and mobilized a group to pressure school
and town officials until a new street light and crossing guard were in place.
The friends she had made at the crime meetings backed her up in her campaign.<BR>
<BR>
Bernie is thrilled to discover the power she has to effect change. &quot;There's
a lot of things we feel we can't do anything about, that we really can,&quot;
she says.<BR>
<BR>
Now Bernie is eager to take on bigger challenges, starting with the unsatisfactory
bus system in Santa Rosa. She tells others who are still unsure about their
own capacity to make a difference to, &quot;Go to meetings, follow an action,
and see what happens. Talk to the people who are leading it and find out
what they're like. And you'll find out they're just like you. You'll see
that you can do the same things.&quot; <BR>
<P><CENTER><HR WIDTH="30%"></CENTER>
<P>What makes successful grassroots organizing efforts work? I've recently
explored this question by researching 13 groups for the Institute for the
Arts of Democracy. The organizations I studied are part of a growing number
of citizen groups that use creative, heartfelt, and truly democratic techniques
to draw people into public life and tackle issues that affect them.<BR>
<BR>
The strategy of these groups is to empower a broad base of citizen leaders
by showing them how to achieve tangible goals that address their immediate
needs. The focus is on <I>organizing</I> rather than on <I>activism</I>.
It isn't enough to see a problem, schedule a demonstration, slap a poster
up, and expect to change things overnight. <BR>
<BR>
Organizing means working with people day to day on issues that affect them
where they live. People get involved when they care about an issue and see
it as related to their self-interest.<BR>
<BR>
At the foundation of this approach is the understanding that we Americans
have a deep longing for community and want to make a difference with our
lives, but are confused and unsure about how to negotiate an overwhelming
world of complex social problems. As a result, we often hide our desire
for connection behind a front of apathy, cynicism or being &quot;too busy.&quot;
<H4><BR>
DEVELOPING EFFECTIVE LEADERS</H4>
In response to this, good organizers focus not only on the political, but
on the personal. Political action, they say, is only as effective as the
individuals who are involved in it. To be effective, we must feel that involvement
is meeting our needs to enjoy ourselves, to add more skills to our personal
tool kits, to be valued for our contributions, to have &quot;kindred spirits&quot;
in our lives, and to be directly involved in tangible change.<BR>
<BR>
In the new model of citizen democracy, involvement in public affairs is
not considered a burdensome obligation. Rather, it holds out the possibility
of significant intellectual and emotional growth, heightened personal pride,
more friends, <I>and </I>the achievement of our political goals.<BR>
<BR>
Real power emerges when organizations put priority on inclusiveness, shared
leadership, the encouragement of disparate talents, and the development
of practical skills (creative conflict resolution, meeting facilitation,
active listening, and the like).<BR>
<BR>
Dorothy Kwiat of San Diego was invited to a meeting at her church to talk
with lay leaders about the city's skyrocketing social problems. The discussion
was led by people like herself - in other words, not by activists. <BR>
<BR>
She liked the fact that the organizers did not &quot;come in like a railroad
train&quot; with a flashy presentation and with their minds made up about
what the church should do. <BR>
<BR>
Instead, the organizers asked the group, &quot;What are you feeling? What
is it that you're really mad about? What do you want to do about it?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;They took us seriously, which I think most of us are not used to,&quot;
says Dorothy.<BR>
<BR>
The church joined nine other congregations as members of the San Diego Organizing
Project (SDOP). Dorothy and others conducted interviews with their friends
and neighbors to learn about their values and their dreams. <BR>
<BR>
Deep concern about the drug epidemic was the concern most often expressed
during the listening process, leading SDOP to take it on in a popular city-wide
organizing campaign. A great many of those whose opinions had been solicited
were eager to be of help because they felt invested in the group's work.
The organizers knew they had thousands of people on their side - and they
had the names and phone numbers of these individuals. When it came time
for a public meeting with the mayor, 1,000 committed citizens - all of whom
had had personal contact with SDOP - agreed to attend.<BR>
<BR>
The televised meeting was held in a church on SDOP's turf, and citizens,
not the mayor's staff, controlled the agenda. Several SDOP members, who
had been supported to speak and coached by others in the group beforehand,
took turns verbally holding the mayor accountable for the city's plight
and telling her the specific improvements and timeline SDOP expected. One
elderly woman told the mayor, &quot;I hired you to do a job, and you're
not doing it in a way that satisfies me. You're going to do this job better!&quot;<BR>
<BR>
This community initiative - which involved research, networking, role-playing,
strategy, public speaking, training, and more - eventually resulted in the
city allocating $28.5 million to drug education and prevention programs.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Democracy is what people are doing in their day-to-day contacts with
each other,&quot; says Rev. John Baumann, executive director of Pacific
Institute for Community Organizing (PICO). &quot;The radical part is building
relationships, talking to people.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Often, organizations want to skip those steps because it's much easier
to get that small committee and identify [a problem such as] 'drugs',&quot;
Baumann says. &quot;But if we talk about democracy, unless people are a
part of making the decisions, I don't see where we're going to change things
in our cities.&quot; 
<H4><BR>
&quot;WE'RE IN THIS TOGETHER!&quot;</H4>
The &quot;radical&quot; activity that is the foundation of PICO's many victories
is the time invested in the personal development of each individual in its
member organizations. Members treat each other with kindness and respect,
and focus as much on uncovering each person's best self as they do on particular
campaign objectives.<BR>
<BR>
One finds qualities there that therapists are paid to provide: the validation
of each other's feelings, focused listening when each person speaks, guidance
in overcoming obstacles, celebration of personal growth and successes, constructive
criticism, and honesty.<BR>
<BR>
Really knowing the members of an organization - where each person comes
from, who they are, what they yearn for - may seem like a time-consuming
indulgence when the fate of the world is hanging by a thread, but it is
necessary in order to establish the solidarity needed for deeply effective,
ongoing civic action. <BR>
<BR>
People who are not otherwise attracted to political life will stay with
a group if they experience it as a support and friendship network - in short,
as <I>community.</I> Speaking in a public hearing or in a legislator's office
is a lot easier with a &quot;safety net&quot; of friends and allies who
believe in us. Over and over, one hears words, spoken in relief and delight:
&quot;I'm not in this alone.&quot; &quot;We're in this together.&quot;
<H4><BR>
FINDING A NICHE</H4>
Those who are reluctant to join a group because they feel they don't know
how to do anything are gently coached and supported until they find their
niche (then, later, nudged to expand that &quot;comfort zone&quot;). Musicians
might perform at a rally or teach the group songs of struggle and celebration;
cooks might prepare refreshments for the group; gardeners can brighten the
meeting room with fresh flowers; artists can design a float for the local
parade or create colorful banners. Fund-raisers and computer operators are
always needed. <BR>
<BR>
Evelyn Stuart was brought to a meeting of the Oakland Union of the Homeless
by a friend she met when both were staying in a homeless shelter. She loved
the Union's sense of community but was feeling useless as a participant
until she was encouraged to sit in the Union's tiny office and answer phones.
She worked her way up to a direct service position and, in the process,
gained the confidence and self-esteem she needed to pick herself back up
again.<BR>
<BR>
Stuart particularly appreciates the frequent praise she receives from others
in the Union. &quot;They don't just pat you on the back for the big things
you accomplish; they pat you on the back for the little things too. That's
inspiring, that's encouraging,&quot; she says.
<H4><BR>
GOING PUBLIC</H4>
For many Americans, work life and private life are the only two familiar
modes of existence. The creation of a satisfying public life is something
new and strange; it takes practice. <BR>
<BR>
Once the range of empowering civic skills is developed, they can be applied
in other arenas: the workplace, the family, the school. When emphasis is
put on process as well as product, democracy in every sphere can come alive
as a fluid, humane, and ever-evolving dynamic - in short, as a <I>practice</I>.
<H4><BR>
&quot;WE'RE THE EXPERTS!&quot;</H4>
What all of these principles have in common is that they encourage a sense
of individual self-respect, an understanding that <I>we </I>are the experts.
We know more about our own experience than anyone else. We know what our
values are and which problems in our lives and our communities most<B> </B>need
attention. And we can each contribute to their solution. <BR>

<H1><CENTER>Saying Yes! To Environmental Sanity</CENTER>
</H1>
<H4><CENTER><I>an interview with Ryan Eliason, by <A HREF="../../PEOPLE/DAGBio.htm">Diane
Gilman</A></I></CENTER>
</H4>
<BR>
<I>At the age of 22, Ryan Eliason already has done a lot. He's worked on
desert restoration in India, founded a thriving environmental group, and
travelled around the US talking to young people about the environment. <BR>
<BR>
Ryan's drive for this kind of involvement was a dormant seed until 1988,
when he signed up for a Peace Trees program run by the Earthstewards Network.
Peace Trees is a prototype for a global environmental restoration corps,
which organizers envision as an alternative to military service for young
people. Ryan's team of 40 people from the US, the USSR, and India planted
2,000 trees in the southern Indian desert. <BR>
<BR>
Context Institute co-founder Diane Gilman first met the quiet, self-assured,
young organizer at an Earthstewards training session and was immediately
impressed by his list of accomplishments and thoughtful demeanor. Ryan's
focus on young people made sense to her; young people are disempowered,
disenfranchised, and they have the biggest stake of all. </I><B><BR>
<BR>
Diane: </B><I>How did you first get involved with Peace Trees, and what
drew you to it?</I><B><BR>
<BR>
Ryan: </B>I was kind of a closet activist for a long time through high school
and for about a year and a half afterward. I was looking at the world, seeing
so much that could be changed, and feeling the potential for healing and
transformation. I read a lot of books that really resonated with me around
those kinds of things. But I never did anything about it until Peace Trees
came along, which resonated with something deep inside me so strongly it
was like, yes! I have to do this! I was totally sure this was for me because
it combined traveling to a Third World country, and doing service to the
Earth, the environment, and to humans in a way that was promoting peace
on the planet. <B><BR>
<BR>
Diane: </B><I>What happened when you went on the two week Peace Trees trip
to southern India?</I><B><BR>
<BR>
Ryan: </B>I really felt alone a lot of my life, really different and alienated
from my peers. When I met these other people my age, I found out that I'm
not the only person who thinks the way I do, who cares about the world so
deeply and is concerned about these things. <B><BR>
<BR>
Diane: </B><I>It sounds like a key part of giving you hope was finding these
other people.</I><B><BR>
<BR>
Ryan: </B>Community, too; I don't have to do this alone. And if I don't
have to do it alone, maybe I can really enjoy it. And if I can really enjoy
it, then why not do it, why not become active?<B><BR>
<BR>
Diane: </B><I>What happened when you returned from India? </I><B><BR>
<BR>
Ryan: </B>I'd made some really good friends. My heart opened really big
and wide. I can remember riding home on the plane, writing in my journal
to each of the people that I'd connected with, with tears streaming down
my face. <BR>
<BR>
I took a lot of slides. I remember that people were very moved by my slide
show. I was able to share my experience so well that I surprised myself.
I had always been really shy in groups. I found out I can really communicate
with people, and that was a big shift for me.<B><BR>
<BR>
Diane: </B><I>Because you were sharing something from your heart.</I><B><BR>
<BR>
Ryan: </B>Yes. I got to talking about ecology, and about peace, and that
the Soviets are just like us. That's such a clich&eacute; among the peace
movement, but I really experienced that they're human beings - I got to
feel their love.<BR>
<BR>
The other thing was that in order to go on the trip I had to raise a bunch
of money. I raised it all myself, my parents didn't pay for any of it. I
wrote letters to lots and lots of my friends and family, and to my parents'
good friends, and asked for $25 or whatever they felt like giving. I told
them that I would share with the world what I got out of the experience,
so it would be not only a contribution to me, but to the planet. <BR>
<BR>
I got a lot of support by doing that, and then I did a massage-a-thon that
raised $500 and a benefit dinner. I'd never done any fund raising before,
but just getting ready for the trip with all this community support was
really empowering. <B><BR>
<BR>
Diane: </B><I>After you got back and shared your slides, what lead you to
do more and what were your next steps?</I><B><BR>
<BR>
Ryan: </B>I got involved with a group called Creating Our Future. It was
a group of adults - activists from the '60s with a lot of social change
experience - and young people. There were spiritual-minded people as well,
like Ram Dass, but it wasn't a religious organization. Its purpose was to
empower youth to do social action in a way that recognized that the means
are just as important as the ends, and that being involved in social change
is a spiritual path.<BR>
<BR>
I went to their summer camp, a totally incredible experience, similar to
Peace Trees in the way that I connected with other young people from the
States who shared similar values.<BR>
<BR>
Before and after Peace Trees, I can remember praying a lot to connect with
a group of young people whom I could share some deep friendships with, and
at the same time be of service to the planet. I remember visualizing this
- and it happened! I was blown away that it worked for something that was
so important to me that it really changed my life.<BR>
<BR>
Creating Our Future was focused on the environment too, especially on rain
forests and global warming. One of the things I got from that experience
was leadership skills: tangible training in how to facilitate a meeting,
how to lead in a way that includes everybody, how to communicate in groups,
how to keep relationships clear. <B><BR>
<BR>
Diane: </B><I>How long were you involved with Creating Our Future?</I><B><BR>
<BR>
Ryan: </B>About a year. Ocean Robbins and I really wanted to get involved,
so we both got onto the board of directors. We came up with the idea for
a speaking tour. We manifested this vision of a group of four kids touring
around the country, giving presentations for high schools and junior highs
about the environment. Three or four months later, Ocean and I, along with
Ivy and Rachel, were on the road.<B><BR>
<BR>
Diane: </B><I>What happened that caused you and Ocean to split off from
Creating Our Future ?</I><B><BR>
<BR>
Ryan: </B>Creating Our Future was supposed to be youth-run, but actually,
it was run by adults. It wasn't that there was something innately wrong
with adults helping to run the show, but Ocean and I really <I>wanted</I>
it to be youth-run. The Creating Our Future tour was four or five months
long, and it reached 30,000 people. We wanted to do a tour that was the
whole school year and would reach a lot more people, and have it be all
youth-run. <B><BR>
<BR>
Diane: </B><I>So you set up this new organization, Youth for Environmental
Sanity?</I><B><BR>
<BR>
Ryan: </B>Right. We thought we had to raise $30,000 the first year and it
ended up being $60,000. But even $30,000 seemed like a big scary number
to us since the most any of us had raised before was a few thousand. We
spent the summer raising money and finding local organizers, and gathered
together a small group of people who shared our vision. We seem to have
a knack for drawing incredible people to us. We totally surprised ourselves
the first year. <B><BR>
<BR>
Diane: </B><I>What was the primary vision for YES?</I><B><BR>
<BR>
Ryan: </B>Part of it was just wanting to bring like-minded youth together,
because magic happens. We brought kids from all over who never knew each
other before, and linked them up. And we learned from them and from each
other.<B><BR>
<BR>
Diane: </B><I>I understand that YES has received rave reviews. What follow-through
has happened for those kids/schools/communities that have hosted YES presentations?
</I><B><BR>
<BR>
Ryan: </B>We're working on improving our following up. It's like scattering
a whole lot of seeds and praying that they're going to sprout. <BR>
<BR>
We do have some feedback, like San Lorenzo Valley Junior High, in Felton,
California. It was actually with the Creating Our Future tour that we first
spoke there. A year later we went back with YES.<BR>
<BR>
In that year they had:
<UL>
  <LI>started a new environmental action club,<BR>
<BR>
  <LI>convinced their school cafeteria to have a vegetarian burger option,<BR>
<BR>
  <LI>persuaded the local Round Table Pizza and Straw Hat to switch from
styrofoam to paper take-out containers, <BR>
<BR>
  <LI>convinced Mead and Stewart Hall paper companies to stock local stores
with recycled paper products,<BR>
<BR>
  <LI>raised money and bought some rain forest,<BR>
<BR>
  <LI>set up their whole school to recycle just about everything, and had
recycled several tons of paper already, within that year.
</UL>
<B><BR>
Diane: </B><I>Well that's quite an accomplishment!</I><B><BR>
<BR>
Ryan: </B>Yes, this one little group of junior high kids! We also get tons
of letters all the time, like fan mail, saying, &quot;We love you, thanks
for coming through,&quot; and, &quot;You totally inspired us,&quot; &quot;I've
become a vegetarian.&quot;<B><BR>
<BR>
Diane: </B><I>What were some of the important learnings from being part
of YES?</I><B><BR>
<BR>
Ryan: </B>What happened to me through YES was partly that I learned a lot
about how planetary transformation is a direct result of personal transformation
- that those two things are so interconnected. And I feel like there are
a lot of people out there who really care and really want to make a difference.
People just need some basic skills on how to communicate, how to organize
projects, and to know that they are not alone. <BR>
<BR>
I've discovered that one of the main things that holds people back from
acting on their values is feeling like it won't be enough, it won't even
make a dent in how big the problems are. And if one takes an attitude of
&quot;I'm making a difference <I>all the time</I> no matter what I do, I
might as well do my best,&quot; then it's wonderful.<BR>

<H1><CENTER>Theater Of The Heart</CENTER>
</H1>
<H4><CENTER><I>by Lucia Effros and Matt Holland</I></CENTER>
</H4>
<BR>
<I>Creating a vision of a better world can be the first step in making change
happen. Creative Response (formerly Peace Child) is giving kids a chance
to act out a better vision by putting on plays in which they have final
say about scripts, musical scores, and themes. One participant, Katie Christie,
was so inspired, she now organizes Creative Response productions in her
multicultural hometown, Miami, FL.</I><BR>
<BR>
Katie Christie has committed her life to breaking down racial and ethnic
barriers. Born of mixed-race parentage and adopted as an infant by a Greek-Jewish
couple, Katie was confused about her racial identity and grew up with a
deep sensitivity about what it is to be &quot;different.&quot; She says
as a child &quot;there was this burning inside, and its still there. I still
feel it. But I've changed because I know what I can do with it now.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
And what she has been doing is impressive.<BR>
<BR>
In 1988 at age 16, Katie participated in her first Creative Response musical
exchange program in Latvia, then part of the USSR. The following year, she
toured again in the USSR, and later that year she brought Creative Response
to her hometown of Miami, as director and producer of her own show with
60 young people.<BR>
<BR>
Creative Response typically brings together 30 young people - half from
the US, half from another country. The youngsters create a musical production
together, addressing the social issues they decide are important, and then
tour one of their two countries, spreading their message.<BR>
<BR>
The group also has local chapters throughout the US that create and stage
their own productions. Most of the productions are called <I>City at Peace</I>,
but each is a unique creation of the cast.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I don't audition primarily for talent,&quot; Katie said. &quot;I audition
kids for personality, for how badly they want to do it and whether they
have good ideas. So I've been taking a lot of kids who aren't singers, dancers,
and actors, but who can become whatever they want to be.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
In response to her growing concern about Miami's racial tensions, Katie
directed 120 teens - African-American, Cuban, Central American and Angolan
- in a 1990 production of <I>City at Peace</I> . Since then she has produced
<I>Be a Family</I>, a play about the importance of families of all kinds
in grounding a person's development, and <I>Kids for Kids</I>, in which
youngsters with and without hearing impairments deal with the stigma of
being handicapped. She also did <I>City at Peace </I>a second time with
a different group of young people.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;When you bring in 120 kids, they'll sit down in groups that they're
comfortable with. What you need to do is mix that up a little bit so all
of a sudden, they become comfortable with someone they have something in
common with, instead of the person who is the same color.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Creative Response has no formal follow-up system to keep track of their
kids. &quot;Alumni go to college and then we lose track of them,&quot; Katie
says. But for 1993 she's planning a series of shows that will let her see
the results of her work first hand. The productions will focus on building
home environments that foster love and self-esteem, and each show will lead
into a community project.<BR>
<BR>
Katie's latest project was a performance in South Africa that brought together
American teens - African-American, Hispanic, and white - with black, colored,
Indian, and Afrikaner teens from the host country. The show was the first
of its kind in South Africa and an inspiration for Katie. She says she was
impressed by the way South Africans have taken up the struggle to make change,
compared to the passivity she feels in the US.<BR>
<BR>
Katie believes this country is on the edge of an opportunity to finally
deal with racial hatred, inequality, and oppression; her job is to help
young people lead the way.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;This is not in any way about a production,&quot; she says. &quot;It's
completely about kids coming together and learning about each other, and
that's how we are going to break down the hate.&quot;<I><BR>

<H1><CENTER>Making It Real</CENTER>
</H1>
<H4><CENTER><I>moderated by Duane H. Fickeisen and Carla Cole</I></CENTER>
</H4>
<BR>
<I>Cultural transformation requires the engagement of people who have a
strong sense of self, who are willing to seek solutions to the most difficult
problems we face, and who have the compassion, courage, and support to implement
real change in their own lives. <BR>
<BR>
IC associate editors Carla Cole and Duane Fickeisen convened a focus group
(see <A HREF="#Participants">Participants</A> below) in Seattle of leaders
of the human potential movement to look at the conditions that foster personal
transformation. The purpose of the discussion was to get fresh insights
on the development of the authentic self and its relationship to the community
engagement needed to bring about effective cultural change.<BR>
<BR>
The conversation was wide ranging; we've excerpted parts of the two-hour
session here.</I><B><BR>
<BR>
Editors:</B> <I>We are interested in the possibility of community change.
What role does community play in addressing key problems in our culture?</I><B><BR>
<BR>
Charles Johnston:</B> Very few of the critical questions of our time can
be addressed without a remembering of community. You can't deal with the
crisis in education separately from the context of a healthy community,
nor the drug crisis, nor the environmental crisis, nor the other crises
we face.<BR>
<BR>
But we're not going back to a community based on blood ties and absolute
dogmas. We are instead going forward to communities of empowered whole people,
in the same sense that in our relationships we are learning to move beyond
gender roles. There are not many guideposts in this new territory. We are
taking baby steps together as we explore what it means to be whole people
in relationships. Similarly we are taking baby steps in terms of the notion
of what community is.<BR>
<BR>
Community works when people are <I>engaged</I> in things, rather than just
being together. It works best when it fosters diversity. I am struck by
the amazing degree to which we spend most of our lives talking with people
of one or two colors in the personality spectrum. I'm speaking in a metaphor
here. I want a group to have a very high <I>capacitance</I> to be able to
handle difficult questions, so I want the whole spectrum of personality
types in the room. We need all those voices, not just to answer the questions,
but to see what the questions are.<BR>
<BR>
In a sense we have defined community in the past by getting all the oranges
together, all the reds together, and all the blues together. But now the
problems we face require a larger picture. We need to recognize the very,
very different ways that the <I>truth</I> is experienced and manifested
out of different parts of the diverse whole.<B><BR>
<BR>
Editors:</B> <I>If effective community is dependent on a diversity of whole
people engaging each other through what matters to them, isn't a strong
sense of self, authenticity, and integrity of being its foundation? How
do we get to that sense of authenticity?</I><B><BR>
<BR>
Mary Ann Woodruff:</B> A lot of my own personal work has been about searching
for my authentic path, so that my actions are motivated by my own internal
compass. The actions I took while I was fighting to be on the &quot;good&quot;
path were guided by what all those others out there told me was the good
wife, the good mother, the good Presbyterian elder, the good whatever.<BR>
<BR>
But it's the authentic path that enables me to not feel lonely so much,
to prize solitude, <I>and</I> to bring me fully into relationship with community.
I no longer come to a group and merge with it by trying to be what others
think I ought to be. Now I pick and choose what I do as a professional in
the community, and it is much more creative and satisfying; it has more
quality and depth than crowding my calendar with a cheek-to-jowl schedule
defined by others.<B><BR>
<BR>
Donna Moore:</B> I think many people are missing the spiritual feeling that
there is something they are here to do. I don't know how to say it so it
doesn't sound sappy, but you can see people's eyes light up when you ask,
&quot;Do you realize that there is something you are here to do? You've
been given special skills. We're just waiting for you to discover it.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
And they respond saying, &quot;You mean I'm OK, I <I>really</I> am? I really
could do something? Wow! You bet! I better get on with it!&quot;<B><BR>
<BR>
Charles: </B>There is a way to do it that isn't drippy. It is simply asking
- really, really asking - &quot;What most matters to you?&quot; over and
over and over again. <BR>
<BR>
It's not the same as telling someone that there is <I>something </I>that
should matter to them. That's not the issue. The issue is that you only
exist to the <I>degree </I>something matters to you. The task of living
a meaningful life is to ask that question with every bit of courage you
can bring to it.<BR>
<BR>
When people ask what matters with courage, they often discover that what
matters to them is their participation in something larger than themselves.
It's not sappy; it's not a do-good kind of thing. If you really want to
be selfish, then have the courage to be involved in something larger than
yourself.<B><BR>
<BR>
Donna:</B> I frankly think of this as one of the most radical things that
could happen! Once we begin to understand that we are our own authorities
in our own lives, then we don't put up with people telling us what to do,
no matter whether it's a political figure or a religious figure or anybody
else. Rather, I've got to reach into myself and make sure that what I am
doing is spiritually and morally correct. <I>I've</I> got to be responsible.<B><BR>
<BR>
Charles:</B> Our times are asking us for a new kind of maturity in how we
engage in culture, and literally a new kind of maturity in culture itself.
<BR>
<BR>
One of the edges of the human potential movement engages around questions
of responsibility and maturity. At the same time, within it there is a significant
thread that says maybe we can still be children. Yet one of the things that
marks wise people is <I>remembering</I> the child, but not <I>becoming</I>
the child. <BR>
<BR>
A major part of this is the recognition that limits in life are not only
important, but indeed, they form the foundation for living and a foundation
for sustainability.<B><BR>
<BR>
Editors:</B> <I>What you are all saying seems to be that a sense of self
that includes both deep, authentic awareness of a calling and recognition
of limits is very, important as the foundation for doing effective work
in the community. But how do we discover what most matters to us, and how
do we ensure that our work in the world has the necessary grounding to be
effective? How do we get that balance?</I><B><BR>
<BR>
Dorothea Jewell:</B> Personal transformation for the sake of personal transformation
so that I can be the best that I can be, in and of itself, becomes navel
gazing and leads to despair. And going out to transform the community to
make the world a better place without the understanding of the importance
of the individual, without honoring that and helping people to be their
authentic selves, leads to the same thing - leads to despair and to burnout.<B><BR>
<BR>
Paula Hendrick: </B>Another way of saying the same thing is that I have
one process going on that's the creation and moving toward my vision of
myself. Then I have another process that's always going on that is the creation
and moving toward my vision for the world. As those two start to ...<B><BR>
<BR>
Dorothea:</B> ... dance and spark, and if the context is big enough, broad
enough, expansive enough, and deep enough at the same time to encompass
the whole thing, then transformation takes place.

<H4><CENTER><A NAME="Participants"></A>THE PARTICIPANTS</CENTER>
</H4>
<BR>
We gathered a group of people who have experience in the human potential
movement as practitioners, presenters, and participants <I>and</I> who have
an ongoing interest in community and transformation. Ten of us met in Seattle
for a conversation about the role of the human potential movement in community
transformation. This brief excerpt does not include all the participants.
Those we do hear from, in the order quoted, are:<B><BR>
<BR>
Charles M. Johnston: </B>Director of the Institute for Creative Development,
a think tank and center for leadership training in Seattle. He is also a
psychiatrist, author, and artist. As part of his work with the Institute,
he leads year-long intensive leadership training programs, which focus on
the large questions facing our culture and the skills and sensibilities
that leadership in the future will require. His work appeared in <I>IC </I>#19.<B><BR>
<BR>
Mary Ann Woodruff:</B> Organization development consultant and self-described
community builder. Most recently, her formal personal growth work has included
Jungian therapy and work with John and Joyce Weir's laboratory for self-differentiation.
She consults primarily with groups that want to clarify and achieve their
purpose and vision, using strategies that are connected at the heart.<B><BR>
<BR>
Donna Moore:</B> Consultant to federal agencies and career counselor. Donna
worked for 30 years for the federal government, doing training and personnel
management in the foreign service, among other things. Since retiring five
or six years ago, Donna has been taking the advice of her book, <I>Take
Charge of Your Own Career</I>. Writing the book piqued her interest in empowerment
issues. She studies shamanism and teaches Tai Chi.<B><BR>
<BR>
Dorothea Jewell:</B> Staff member of the Institute of Cultural Affairs and
member of Context Institute's board of trustees. Over the years, Dorothea's
work with ICA has shifted from doing community development projects, to
supporting others who are engaged in community development through group
facilitation and training. In her introduction to the group, Dorothea emphasized
the need to see the capacity, ability, and creativity present in a group
and to experience each member of a group at a deep level.<B><BR>
<BR>
Paula Hendrick:</B> Volunteer with the New Road Map Foundation. The Foundation
is a non-profit organization that promotes volunteerism and sustainable
lifestyle choices and markets the tape course <I>Transforming Your Relationship
with Money</I>, and the book, <I>Your Money or Your Life</I>. She helped
edit <I>IC</I> #31, in which some of her writing appeared. She has studied
meditation with the Sufi Order in the West for 18 years. Paula reads science
fiction to gain creative inspiration.<BR>

<H1><CENTER>Sharing The Wealth</CENTER>
</H1>
<H4><CENTER><I>by Edorah Frazer</I></CENTER>
</H4>
<BR>
<I>Edorah Frazer inherited half a million dollars - and gave it away to
groups working for social change. Since then, she has done fundraising for
activist groups, volunteered at </I>IN CONTEXT<I>, and taught high school.
She's seen the effect of her decision on social change efforts and has no
regrets about her decision.<BR>
<BR>
But this story is not just about those with large fortunes by American standards.
Most of us in the industrialized world have &quot;inherited&quot; a level
of consumption beyond the dreams of the vast majority living in the rest
of the world. We are the global wealthy, and until we can discover our own
willingness to share the wealth, the prospects for a humane and sustainable
world are dim.</I><BR>
<BR>
During a course I took in graduate school on controversial issues, the instructor
asked us to get into small groups and discuss the most powerfulpolitical
acts of our lives. Some people talked about demonstrations and rallies,
others talked about how they raised their children and the careers they
had chosen. <BR>
<BR>
It took me a few minutes to realize that the most powerful moment of my
life was on December 23rd, 1986, three months after I'd turned 25. That
was the day I gave away my half-million dollar inheritance.<BR>
<BR>
I grew up in Winnetka, Illinois, a community known for its affluence, the
quality of its schools, and its seamless conservative culture. My parents
ran a charitable household. They frequently took in stray animals and teenagers
who were on the outs with their parents. My mother gave modestly to charity
and volunteered in various civic organizations; my father gave extravagant
gifts to family and friends. Still, I was raised with a fundamental rule
of the wealthy: never touch the principal of your inheritance. Preserve
the wealth and make it grow for future generations - of your own family.<BR>
<BR>
When I was 16 my father died. As my grief abated, I found that I suddenly
had a great deal of control over my life, including my financial life. My
five older siblings had all established their own lives, and my mother was
putting together the pieces of her own. I was blessed with friends and teachers
who provided support and advice, but most importantly, they offered views
of the world and of justice that were vastly different than those I grew
up with. <BR>
<BR>
My high school American Studies teachers taught me about the origin of the
American Dream. They showed a film called &quot;What If the Dream Comes
True?&quot; critiquing the consumptive lifestyle of &quot;successful&quot;
Americans. I began to feel uncomfortable with the opulence of my affluent
surroundings coupled with what appeared to be intolerance for people who
looked or acted differently than we did. I wanted to break out of the shelter
of wealth and homogeneity that had separated me from the rest of the world.<BR>
<BR>
At that time Rita Wonders, an ex-nun who had just arrived in Winnetka from
rural Georgia, became the youth minister in the Catholic church down the
block. I wasn't Catholic, but I was welcomed into her youth group. Rita
took me to work in a soup kitchen in Chicago and to Appalachia to build
homes for the poor. There I learned that poor people are often sharply politically
astute, that deep friendships can be formed across class lines, and that
happiness has little connection with material wealth. The family I stayed
with in Appalachia opened their hearts to me in a way that sustains our
friendship to this day.<BR>
<BR>
When I graduated from college, I went to Israel to learn about Judaism and
community living on a kibbutz. During the six months I lived there, I had
a very deep experience of being valued for my work and neighborliness. I
worked six hours a day picking avocados (kibbutzniks work slightly more,
but workaholism is discouraged as it upsets the egalitarian balance of labor),
and for that I was given everything I needed to live happily, including
free education and health care. Money isn't used on the kibbutz, so for
that period I felt a very direct relationship between my work and my sustenance.<BR>
<BR>
When I got back from Israel, I was ready to handle my money in a new way.
I became a war tax resister, withholding the portion of my taxes that would
be allocated to the military and donating that money to peace and social
justice groups. <BR>
<BR>
I then set to work on learning about my inheritance. I went to the public
library in Dover, New Hampshire, where my mother was then living, and I
asked the reference librarian to help me find information about giving away
money. She had never been asked that question before, and she got excited
about it. The two of us spent several hours bumping into each other and
finding bits of information. During our search we came up with the name
of the Haymarket People's Fund, a social change fund in Boston that also
conducts conferences for progressive people with inherited wealth to talk
about money issues. <BR>
<BR>
Soon I was sitting in Haymarket's office, laughing and crying as I read
through a book called <I>Robin Hood Was Right.</I> I had found my niche!
Here I was among wealthy people who felt it was right to redistribute part
of their resources. <BR>
<BR>
I attended my first Haymarket conference, and I was eager to get on with
the task of giving away my money. When I introduced myself at my first workshop,
I shared my goal. Immediately the introductions stopped, and people started
sharing their opinions that giving away principal was irresponsible and
dangerous. I was shocked. I had thought we were there to discuss <I>how
</I>to give away money, not whether to do it. But one of the workshop leaders
approached me afterwards and let me know that her thinking was similar to
my own.<BR>
<BR>
At my next Haymarket conference, during an introductory game designed to
help us identify commonalities within the group, I stood up and asked whether
there were other people there who had considered giving their inheritances
away. To my surprise and relief, 10 people stood up with me. We arranged
to meet during our free time, and a few hours later four of us climbed to
the top of a grassy hill and stretched out to plan our money revolution.
We asked each other what we wanted out of life and discussed our respective
political strategies for changing the world. <BR>
<BR>
We delighted so much in each other's company that we arranged to meet as
an ongoing support group every month; our primary purpose was to discuss
the whys and wherefores of giving away our fortunes. We talked about how
we had each come to the conclusion that many of the world's problems were
connected to the vast inequities in the distribution of the world's resources.
Then we affectionately named ourselves the Class Suicide Support Group.<BR>
<BR>
Every month for two years, the four of us met to talk about our money. Our
wisdom and sense of security grew with each meeting. Somewhere along the
way the questions came up: &quot;Haven't other people given away their fortunes?
What happened to them? What would they recommend to us?&quot; We decided
to ask them ourselves. <BR>
<BR>
Christopher Mogil and I set up the first interviews and heard the first
stories. They were, without exception, passionate. Many of the interviews
were done on the phone, Christopher and I listening on separate extensions
in separate rooms. After we were finished, we would whoop and meet each
other in the hallway to share our wonder at the wisdom and power we had
just encountered in our interviewees. <BR>
<BR>
Here were people with courage, vision, and frequently humor, thinking about
the effects of their actions and making powerful moves toward justice. They
had various amounts of money, ranging from $150,000 to $80 million, and
gave away varying amounts, from 20 to 100 percent, but all of them had decided
that they had more than enough. Each one had carefully considered how their
money could make the most positive impact on the world, and their methods
and strategies for giving were creative and varied.<BR>
<BR>
Forty interviews later, Christopher and his partner, Anne, wrote a book
about the interviewees called <I>We Gave Away A Fortune.</I> They found
that not one of the forty people interviewed regretted giving away their
money. Most had come to the decision through a process that included traveling
to less affluent places, and most described their action as a powerful departure
from their training.<BR>
<BR>
One by one, several members of the Class Suicide Support Group gave parts
of their fortunes away. The group had been formed when I was 23, and I knew
that at age 25 I would gain full control over the principal of my inheritance.
I requested that the stocks be sent to me directly, and in mid-December
of 1986 I received a large package of colorful stock certificates in the
mail. I laid them out on the kitchen table and began to research the companies
that I had been earning interest from. They produced a number of things
that I objected to, including nuclear weapons, cigarettes, and toxic pesticides
that had been banned in the US but were still being sold to developing nations.
I made arrangements to give the stocks directly to the Funding Exchange,
a national fund based in New York that directs money to groups working toward
social change. <BR>
<BR>
On December 23rd it was raining in New Hampshire as I drove to the EF Hutton
office to transfer the stocks to the Funding Exchange. The staff was expecting
me, and we sat in the brightly lit office and ate Christmas candy as we
filled out the forms. At one point I had to get something notarized, and
the notary at the bank asked me to repeat a statement swearing that I was
taking this action of my own free will. I laughed and said, &quot;I swear!&quot;<BR>
<BR>
When the paperwork was complete and I stepped out onto the street, I felt
my heart beating against my chest. I started to cry and laugh in the cold
rain. I'd done it! I felt lonely and exhilarated and loving all at once.
I ran across the street to the Salvation Army bucket and looked at the men
ringing their bells in the downpour. I emptied my wallet into their bucket
and thanked them for their work, then I ran to a pay phone and called my
support group buddies to let them know I'd taken the plunge.<BR>
<BR>
Six years later I can see the power generated by my action. The money itself
has allowed environmentalists, youth, and people of color to do a wide range
of work that otherwise would have been delayed or impossible to accomplish.
I gained fundraising skills as a result of my research that I have been
able to contribute to additional social change efforts. From meeting with
my support group I have gained the knowledge of three other thoughtful people,
and together we have provided a model for other support groups and individuals
contemplating similar actions. <BR>
<BR>
I have learned that security comes more from the dedication of one's community
than from material prosperity. <BR>
<BR>
But more powerful than all of these is the knowledge that if I act clearly
and directly from my values, my life and the lives of those around me will
be enriched. <BR>

The accompanying article focuses on inheritors. But if you are &quot;decently
comfortable&quot; in the US, you are shockingly wealthy and privileged by
global standards. Anne Slepian and Christopher Mogil, who contributed these
thoughts, are founders of the <A HREF="Impact.htm">Impact Project </A>and
authors of </I>We Gave Away A Fortune,<I> stories of people who devoted
themselves and their wealth to peace, justice, and the environment.</I><BR>
<BR>
Many of us are taught to compare ourselves with those who have more. Can
we unflinchingly compare ourselves to those with less? <BR>
<BR>
We ask this not to invoke guilt. We distinguish guilt - a heavy judgment
of ourselves - from compassion, the pain we feel knowing other people's
suffering. When we have the courage to look truthfully at our place in the
terrible inequalities of the world, the power of compassion can serve as
a liberating fire, motivating us to join the growing world-wide community
working for justice and change.<BR>
<BR>
We offer you a few questions we hope you will mull over. We encourage you
to break through the taboo enshrouding money by talking with friends about
these questions.<BR>
<BR>
How much money is enough? How do you determine that? At what point are you
comfortably well off enough that you can think about sharing your resources
with others? <BR>
<BR>
How do you decide how much to give away, and to whom? How does this compare
with your friends' or family's giving? Is your giving satisfying to you?
How might it become more so? <BR>
<BR>
What would it be like to fully invest your resources - energy, imagination,
and money - toward building a better world? Have you ever told yourself,
&quot;I can't fulfill my dream because of money?&quot; What is really holding
you back? <I><BR>

How can those of us without large amounts of surplus wealth contribute money
to social change groups? <I>IN CONTEXT </I>reader Paul Law wrote to us with
his ideas for an &quot;empowerment decade,&quot; a method for both increasing
the amount of money we give away and adopting a simpler lifestyle.<BR>
<BR>
Paul started by having his employer withhold 2 percent more from his paycheck
then would be needed to pay his taxes. When his tax refund arrived, he gave
half the money to a social change group and invested the other half in a
socially responsible mutual fund. (An alternative would be to have the money
deposited directly into a designated savings account, and then to periodically
withdraw the money and interest for the same purposes.)<BR>
<BR>
Paul increased the amount withheld by 2 percent per year. He says this approach
is like a physical exercise program: he started out small, but by the end
of 10 years, he will have donated and invested 20 percent of his annual
pay and he'll be living 20 percent leaner and greener.<BR>
<BR>

<H4><CENTER><I>by Anne Slepian and Christopher Mogil</I></CENTER>
</H4>
<BR>
<I>Anne Slepian and Christopher Mogil direct the Impact Project, a non-profit
organization that helps people with financial surplus (whether huge or modest)
find fulfilling, effective ways to integrate their values and money.</I><BR>
<BR>
The Impact Project was established on the belief that many people with financial
surplus long to use their resources (money, time, love, and talents) to
help create a sustainable world.<BR>
<BR>
But many people feel stuck - deluged by direct mail appeals, depressed by
the daily news, anxious about personal security, and hopeless about doing
anything for the world of real significance. So they deny their surplus,
or feel immobilized by guilt, or make small gestures with their time and
money - none of which are particularly satisfying.<BR>
<BR>
The Impact Project helps people get unstuck. The staff provide compassionate,
step-by-step, practical and emotional help, guiding people through a process
of empowerment that involves:
<UL>
  <LI>Taking charge of one's money - how it's invested, controlled, and
spent; planning concretely for future financial needs and determining what
is surplus.<BR>
<BR>
  <LI>Working on emotions that get in the way of taking charge. Re-evaluating
old messages learned from one's family and society .<BR>
<BR>
  <LI>Building a sense of security in non-financial ways, such as developing
community, spiritual practice, satisfying work, and new practical skills.
Creating a satisfying lifestyle more congruent with one's values.<BR>
<BR>
  <LI>Developing a work niche that best uses one's talents and caring. Sorting
out which world problems one most cares about and getting involved.<BR>
<BR>
  <LI>Creating ongoing structures for support and action.
</UL>
<BR>
Through this process, we are excited to see people gain the clarity and
confidence they need to both realize their own dreams and to act more powerfully
for the world. <BR>
<BR>

<H1><CENTER>Transforming A Mega-utility I</CENTER>
</H1>
<H4><CENTER><I>an interview with Ralph Cavanagh, by Sarah van Gelder</I></CENTER>
</H4>
<BR>
<I>Over the last few years, some of the largest electric and gas utilities
in the US have taken a radically new approach to their business, one that
would be unrecognizable to utility executives of the early 1980s. These
utilities have dropped plans for large coal, nuclear, and hydroelectric
plants, and instead are relying on energy savings from existing and future
customers to supply new demands for energy. The tremendous financing and
organizational capabilities of these large corporations are making possible
some of the most ambitious energy efficiency efforts ever undertaken in
the US.<BR>
<BR>
How did this transformation occur? Much of the credit can go to organizations
like the Rocky Mountain Institute, which has demonstrated that it's cheaper
to save energy than to generate it. So, on one level, the economics just
make sense. <BR>
<BR>
But utilities have been lukewarm about this approach, principally because
the benefit of serving customers less expensively (and in a way that is
good for the environment) has frequently not benefited the utility shareholders.<BR>
<BR>
In 1989, Ralph Cavanagh, a senior attorney for the Natural Resources Defense
Council, proposed a &quot;collaborative process&quot; aimed at finding a
way to allow everyone to win by getting on the conservation bandwagon. Representatives
of California's huge gas and electric utilities, rate payers, regulators,
and environmentalists met outside the normal adversarial forums of the courts
and the public utilities commission's hearing rooms, making decisions by
consensus.<BR>
<BR>
The result was </I>An Energy Efficiency Blueprint for California,<I> one
of the most ambitious plans for saving energy ever undertaken. Another result
was an atmosphere of mutual trust and respect, which has spilled over into
other projects. </I><BR>
<BR>
IC<I> managing editor Sarah van Gelder interviewed Ralph Cavanagh, who is
widely credited with launching the California Collaborative. Ralph has been
with the Natural Resources Defense Council since 1979, working principally
on energy and water policy and responses to the threat of global warming.
</I><B><BR>
<BR>
Sarah: </B><I>Why did you choose to work cooperatively with Pacific Gas
&amp; Electric and other California utilities rather than using the courts
or regulators to compel them to focus more on energy efficiency work? </I><B><BR>
<BR>
Ralph: </B>Because the utilities in California had largely lost their commitment
to energy efficiency. There was no management enthusiasm. There were no
resources. The programs were being dismantled. Rebuilding these was going
to take the cooperation and support of management, and I didn't think it
would be likely that we could get that through an adversarial process even
assuming we won - and I thought we had a good chance of winning. <BR>
<BR>
I didn't simply want to hit people over the head with a two-by-four; I wanted
to create a sustained incentive to excel at these programs. What history
taught me was that simply going in and asking public utility commissions
to force utilities to do the right thing was not a formula that generated
sustained momentum for energy efficiency. Sometimes you'd get a temporary
victory; more often you had the regulators simply shrinking back from the
awesome task of micro-managing the design and deployment of very complex
programs. The objective, after all, is cost-effective energy savings, not
victories in court or victories before regulatory bodies.<BR>
<BR>
I also didn't see any fundamental reason why we shouldn't be able to reach
agreement. If they did well, they had reason to hope that the regulators
would reward them, which had not been there in the past. In the past, the
only thing that was operating was the fear of sanctions. And the opportunity
for reward is, in the final analysis for enterprises like this, a more productive
motivator than the fear of sanctions. <B><BR>
<BR>
Sarah: </B><I>So would you say, then, that this approach is particularly
effective when dealing with regulated industry? </I><B><BR>
<BR>
Ralph: </B>Sure. But all industries are regulated industries in this era.
And I think, Sarah, you can always find some way of rewarding people who
do well.<BR>
<BR>
If the environmental community in its overall strategy and tactics of the
last decade has a failing, it is in too seldom recognizing the importance
of rewarding people who do well and, perhaps, in putting too much emphasis
on penalizing and punishing people who do badly. <B><BR>
<BR>
Sarah: </B><I>Is this an approach that the Natural Resources Defense Council
is likely to stick with or do you anticipate ending up back in court?</I><B><BR>
<BR>
Ralph: </B>NRDC's principal focus is on building attractive models for sustainable
development. It's very hard to do that without the active cooperation of
the institutions that are involved in building that future. <BR>
<BR>
And so I'm always at some pains to try to find projects that the relevant
industrial community can be part of and can feel some ownership of, and
the same for the regulators and the same for the consumer groups. All those
constituencies working together is part of what it's going to take to make
some of these visions happen. <BR>
<BR>
The adversarial model is a great way of stopping things, but a lousy way
of building them. Right now, I'm more interested in building things. It's
worked well for energy efficiency; it's starting to work for renewables,
also. <BR>
<BR>
And yeah, absolutely, I think it's the way we're going to do things in the
future. <B><BR>
<BR>
Sarah: </B><I>How were you able to bring together people from so many different
backgrounds into a consensus-building process?</I><B><BR>
<BR>
Ralph: </B>I think it is a testament to the remarkable unifying power of
the energy efficiency concept. It is one in which a remarkable array of
constituencies can find common ground with a little creativity. It's not
the kind of divisive, zero-sum issue that prevents progress in other areas.
And so part of the credit goes to the very compelling nature of the subject
matter. Opportunities to save energy more cheaply than producing it can
attract a very wide constituency. <BR>
<BR>
I think it was also extremely important that all of the stakeholders recognized
that the regulators were anxious to see something done. So there was a cost
associated with inaction in the form of potentially unpleasant action by
the regulatory body, which we could all preempt by coming up with a settlement
ourselves. <B><BR>
<BR>
Sarah: </B><I>Did anything happen before you began this process that established
a level of trust that contributed to your success? </I><B><BR>
<BR>
Ralph: </B>No [laughing]. No, I think that happened during the process itself.
Before, the parties were used to dealing with each other in adversarial
forums. It was probably helpful that NRDC and some of the other participants
were reasonably strongly and eloquently in favor of a collaborative effort.
And if you've got people coming to you and essentially urging an alternative
to an adversarial forum, it is sometimes hard to resist. <BR>
<BR>
I guess, Sarah, the utility people knew who I was, and had some fundamental
sense that I was someone whom they could trust and deal with on some sort
of basic level of mutual respect and mutually recognized integrity. But
it was the process itself that built the trust, not anything that happened
in advance of it. <B><BR>
<BR>
Sarah: </B><I>What factors have to be in place for these collaboratives
to work? </I><B><BR>
<BR>
Ralph: </B>First of all, again, there has to be the possibility of a mutually
beneficial outcome. That's very important. It is helpful to have credible
deadlines, so that the talking doesn't go on forever, and the parties feel
some pressure to reach closure. <BR>
<BR>
There has to be some minimum level of mutual trust, which I think can develop
in the process, but which ultimately have to be there. And, over time, there
has to be enough attractive models emerging from this kind of activity to
convince people it's worth doing. <BR>
<BR>
But there are some types of subject matter that lend themselves to collaborative
effort, or perhaps cooperative effort is a better word. (Collaboration still
has overtones of Vichy, France.) <BR>
<BR>
The point is that there is, within the realm of environmental problems,
a vast array of areas where it is clear that solutions will demand the cooperation
of everyone involved; where, in the final analysis, it's pretty clear that
if the industrial sector is brought in kicking and screaming, you're not
going to get as good a result as if they feel some ownership and some commitment
to the result. And that is understood by a lot of people at the moment.
<BR>
<BR>
So I think that there is less demonizing of industry by the environmental
communities than there used to be, and a greater willingness to praise and
support positive initiatives that help solve problems. <B><BR>
<BR>
Sarah: </B><I>I've noticed, Ralph, that when you speak at energy industry
conferences, you set up an atmosphere that seems to make everybody feel
like they're on the same side of an issue. It's a very different way of
framing an environmentalist's challenge to corporate leaders. </I><B><BR>
<BR>
Ralph: </B>You're trying to convey the notion that we have to do this together.
That, in some sense, we will all either succeed or fail together. It is
like with the shutdown of the Trojan nuclear plant near Portland, OR. (See
story on page 55.) The environmental community in the Northwest now understands
that it has a stake in the success of Portland General Electric in replacing
that facility with reliable and environmentally friendly resources. And
there is this sense of shared purpose that really has to be there. The job
of people like me is trying to create that. <B><BR>
<BR>
Sarah: </B><I>How do you make sure you get more than a high-minded document
out of this kind of a process? </I><B><BR>
<BR>
Ralph: </B>By relentless follow-up. Again, you have to be in this for the
long haul. I've been doing this for 13 years. You have to set up a process
that has regular reporting, some kind of continuous oversight. You have
to set up institutions that stay on top of the issue and pay attention to
it long after the agreement is inked. <BR>
<BR>
And if the agreement does not have that kind of sustained monitoring and
involvement, then you're right, there's reason to question its effectiveness.
And the California Collaborative was acutely aware of that. <B><BR>
<BR>
Sarah: </B><I>Do you think that same approach can be applied outside the
energy realm? </I><B><BR>
<BR>
Ralph: </B>The same approach can be applied, sure, wherever there is some
capacity to work together on a mutually beneficial outcome. That's the key.
This is not a good way of settling fundamental differences of principle.
It's a very good way of working together to solve environmental problems.
<BR>
<BR>
I hope that we will see some successful collaborative work on improving
vehicle fuel economy and creating market-based incentives for doing that,
although that hasn't happened yet. I think you're seeing in the recycling
arena a lot of cooperative activity going on. <BR>
<BR>
And we are seeing more collaborative models. For example, the Environmental
Defense Fund's work with McDonald's to reduce waste comes to mind. NRDC
has done a number of successful negotiations with industry on issues like
reformulating gasoline, promoting reduced emissions in fuels, and developing
strategies for reducing carbon dioxide emissions.<B><BR>
<BR>
Sarah: </B><I>Can you give me an example of successful efforts to reduce
carbon dioxide emissions? </I><B><BR>
<BR>
Ralph: </B>The NRDC worked with both Southern California Edison and the
Los Angeles Department of Water Power on their path-breaking commitment
to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 20 percent. We were able, along with
a number of other environmental groups, to convince some major industrial
leaders to write to the president in advance of the Earth Summit and urge
him to join in the international effort to set targets and timetables for
carbon dioxide emission reduction.<B><BR>
<BR>
Sarah: </B><I>What advice would you give to someone thinking of pursuing
this kind of approach? </I><B><BR>
<BR>
Ralph: </B>There has to be a sense that the group is in it for the long
haul, that it has the staying power to both negotiate an agreement and stay
with it as it emerges in the field. It's critical to have a detailed understanding
of the subject matter, or to be able to bring in someone who has it. These
are complex problems, they require a level of technical understanding and
expertise in order to develop sound solutions. If you don't have it, there
are ways of getting it. <BR>
<BR>
In New England, for example, a fund was established to bring in independent
experts the environmental groups trusted who could work with the utilities
to design and develop the efficiency programs and the solutions. <BR>
<BR>
And finally, people have to be acutely aware of the importance of human
relationships. Something that may be more important than anything else in
making these things work is precisely the quality of the relationships between
the individuals who, in the final analysis, have to make the decisions and
take responsibility for the thing succeeding. Part of what it means to be
successful at this is making a determined effort to know not just the institutions,
but the people.<BR>

<H3><CENTER>COLLABORATIVE PRINCIPLES OF PRACTICE</CENTER>
</H3>
<BR>
Participants agreed at the outset:<BR>
<UL>
  <LI>to make decisions by consensus<BR>
<BR>
  <LI>to see the process through<BR>
<BR>
  <LI>to adhere to a set meeting schedule<BR>
<BR>
  <LI>to speak with one voice<BR>
<BR>
  <LI>not to use the process as a lever in other proceedings to undercut
other participants' interests.
</UL>
<BR>
The participants developed a method for either agreeing or agreeing to disagree.
During the six-month period, they reached consensus on seven of eight policy
statements and 12 of 15 principles of energy conservation policy. When consensus
could not be reached, they formed alternative proposals to submit to regulators.<BR>

<H1><CENTER>Transforming A Mega-utility II</CENTER>
</H1>
<H4><CENTER><I>an interview with John Fox by Sarah van Gelder</I></CENTER>
</H4>
<BR>
<I>John Fox manages Pacific Gas &amp; Electric's energy efficiency programs.
He's been with the utility for 11 years and has degrees in engineering and
marketing. John spoke to us by phone from Washington, DC, where he is on
temporary assignment with the President's Commission on Environmental Affairs.</I><B><BR>
<BR>
Sarah: </B><I>What made PG&amp;E decide to participate in the California
Collaborative?</I><B><BR>
<BR>
John: </B>Ralph came in suggesting that what had been a fairly adversarial
relationship between us and the NRDC could be lessened or avoided if we
were all willing to sit down behind closed doors and see what we could do
to strike a deal. <BR>
<BR>
We were aware that increasing energy efficiency would be a good strategic
move for us. And after we thought about the litigation risks if we proceeded
with the traditional hearings route, we decided that this could give us
a potentially better outcome than we were likely to get through hearings.
<B><BR>
<BR>
Sarah: </B><I>Did you have an ongoing relationship with Ralph Cavanagh and
others that led you to believe a collaborative process was likely to be
successful?</I><B><BR>
<BR>
John: </B>No. We had not had a lot of one-on-one dealings with Ralph, and
what contact there had been was fairly adversarial - in the hearing room
or courtroom. So there wasn't really a background that suggested this was
the obvious way to go. <BR>
<BR>
Certainly as we got into it, personal relationships developed that have
served both parties, not just NRDC and PG&amp;E, but the other people who
participated in the collaborative. I think far more dialogue, discussion,
and negotiating goes on now between these people than beforehand.
<H4><BR>
. . . COMING TO TERMS WITH ADVERSARIES . . . </H4>
<B>Sarah: </B><I>I'm curious about what it was like to sit down at a table
with people you were used to seeing as adversaries. </I><B><BR>
<BR>
John: </B>It went through predictable cycles. There was a lot of suspicion
and posturing, and in the first couple of meetings everybody was kind of
feeling the ground under them. There was a lot of getting familiar with
other people's negotiating styles, for want of a better term. <BR>
<BR>
As we went on, there were more opportunities not only to explain our positions
more fully, but to hear other people explain their positions more fully,
and to understand why the other parties values things the way they do. It
turned out to be a fairly constructive negotiating process of putting together
agreements on policy issues that largely met everybody's needs.<B><BR>
<BR>
Sarah: </B><I>Why did you opt to use consensus to make decisions during
your meetings?</I><B><BR>
<BR>
John: </B>Well, if we didn't we wouldn't be avoiding any downstream litigation.
Setting consensus as a goal forces everybody to stick with it that much
more and maybe hang with it a little longer than you would if you really
expected that you would have to litigate later anyway.<B><BR>
<BR>
Sarah: </B><I>What do you think was the key to making this approach work?</I><B><BR>
<BR>
John: </B>Among other things, you need people who are flexible. It was really
interesting how we worked on 15 different policy areas, and how the various
groups would coalesce around different positions, and then an intermediary,
or several intermediaries, would emerge to try to bridge between positions.
And it wasn't always the same people. Different people worked on different
issues, and I think what that bespoke was the overall concern of the group
to get resolution.
<H4><BR>
. . .WHAT WAS ACCOMPLISHED</H4>
<B>Sarah: </B><I>You mentioned earlier that the relationship with the other
groups that participated in the collaborative has served you well since
then. Can you give me some examples of that? </I><B><BR>
<BR>
John: </B>We've undertaken a number of things with NRDC and with some others.
We've been involved with the California Compact - which the NRDC chairs
- which is an effort to increase the acceptance of compact fluorescent lights.
We started a project called ACT2 along with the NRDC, Amory Lovins [of the
Rocky Mountain Institute], and the Lawrence Berkeley Labs; it involves field
tests of how much energy can be saved in real-life situations. <BR>
<BR>
Then there's the &quot;golden carrot&quot; refrigerator program, which I
think David Goldstein at NRDC dreamed up and PG&amp;E took the lead on developing.
We've got 23 utilities and other groups putting up about $30 million for
manufacturers of super efficient refrigerators. And NRDC and PG&amp;E co-authored
comments on the national energy strategy, which I think was hitherto unheard
of - to have a large utility and a large environmental group saying the
same thing on national energy policy. <B><BR>
<BR>
Sarah: </B><I>How broadly do you think this kind of approach can be applied,
say, outside of the energy realm?</I><B><BR>
<BR>
John: </B>I think it has very broad applications. To the extent there are
process problems and policy problems, this is, in general, a much better
approach than litigating. <BR>
<BR>
The problem with litigating is that you go in and make a best case, and
it doesn't give you the latitude to take the other person's position or
strong points into consideration. You ultimately end up having a judge divide
the baby. I am always more comfortable being the author of my own compromises.
Everybody, I think, gets a better deal if they're involved in the decision.<B><BR>
<BR>
Sarah: </B><I>Now you're in Washington, DC, promoting energy conservation?</I><B><BR>
<BR>
John: </B>Well, I'm on loan to the President's Commission on Environmental
Quality, which is a private sector initiative working with various corporations
and organizations, encouraging them to undertake various energy efficiency
initiatives.<B><BR>
<BR>
Sarah: </B><I>Are there lessons from the California Collaborative that you're
applying in your role there?</I><B><BR>
<BR>
John: </B>There are some similarities. In the process of pulling together
the energy efficiency recommendations, we brought in a lot of people from
all sectors: renewables people, conservation people, utility industry people,
other energy suppliers to look at what's in the best interest of the country,
what projects would corporations be likely to respond to. <BR>
<BR>
We have a number of corporations now that have signed up to do various initiatives,
including upgrading their own facilities, educating their employees, reforming
the way they do commercial leasing, some regulatory reform support. And
I'm looking for substantial action in all those areas.<BR>

<H1><CENTER>Closing Trojan</CENTER>
</H1>
<H4><CENTER><I>by Mark Worth</I></CENTER>
</H4>
<BR>
<I>The collaborative model has been tried with success 
in other parts of the country  besides California. 
In Portland, OR, the participation of environmentalists 
and consumer advocates in a utility resource planning 
process led to a recent decision by Portland General 
Electric's board to close Oregon's only nuclear plant 
by 1996. Energy reporter and </I>IC <I>volunteer Mark Worth 
contributed this assessment.</I><P>

A picture of environmentalists and utility executives 
sitting down at the same table and talking to each 
other without voices raised is near the bottom of the 
list of images that come to mind when nuclear power 
is discussed. And there's no place where such a reality 
would be expected less than in Portland, OR, where 
the operator of a nuclear power plant and environmentalists 
have been bitter enemies for more than 15 years. <P>

Since opening the Trojan Nuclear Plant in 1976, majority 
owner Portland General Electric Co. has been the target 
of continuous salvos from anti-nuclear activists, who 
have been willing to accept nothing less than an immediate 
closure of the plant. Trojan, about an hour's drive 
northwest of Portland on the Oregon side of the Columbia 
River, has had its share of regulatory and public-image 
troubles - most significantly, cracking within the 
huge heat-exchangers that carry super-hot radioactive 
water from the plant's reactor core. <P>

Beyond the financial drain on PGE, Trojan's troubles 
have supplied a steady flow of ammunition to anti-nuclear 
power groups. Nonetheless, two statewide ballot initiatives 
seeking to close the plant, as well as a slew of petitions 
to federal and state regulators, all have been defended 
successfully by Portland General. (Two more citizen 
initiatives seeking to close Trojan immediately are 
on Oregon's November 3 statewide ballot.)<P>

Earlier this year, however, the two sides made a major 
move toward working together - instead of against each 
other. As Portland General was preparing its bi-annual 
resource strategy, the company agreed to sit down with 
environmental and consumer advocates in a cooperative 
search for the cheapest way for PGE to generate electricity 
for its 600,000 customers in northwest Oregon.<P>

Two advisory groups spent many summer days talking energy 
strategy with PGE managers. The result: Portland General 
agreed to put up $150,000 for the two groups to hire 
independent consultants to scrutinize, among other 
things, how PGE decided that running the Trojan plant 
for another 19 years was cheaper than shutting it down 
and finding power somewhere else.<P>

 In their studies, the independent consultants disputed 
PGE's contention that it could run Trojan more efficiently 
and for less money than it had in the past. The consultants 
also took a close look at the company's reasons for 
dismissing  alternatives to operating the plant, such 
as expanded conservation programs and more environmentally 
friendly power sources.<P>

Few people - including PGE officials - expected the 
company to seriously consider the consultants' findings. 
Portland General is a private company, its leaders 
said, and while it is subject to some federal and state 
oversight, some thought the consultants were poking 
their heads too far into the utility's business. <P>

At a mid-August meeting, however, PGE's board of directors 
decided unexpectedly that &quot;phasing out&quot; the 
Trojan plant over the next four years would be cheaper 
than trying to run the plant until its license expires 
in 2011. Activists called the decision a victory, not 
just for the anti-nuclear movement, but also for the 
collaborative process. <P>

The decision to close the plant is just the first step 
in the conversion of the utility to a more sustainable 
energy base. Now, environmentalists and utility officials 
are working to find replacement energy, and that may 
be the real test of their collaborative relationship.<P>

<H1><CENTER>Our Beloved Cars</CENTER>
</H1>
<H4><CENTER><I>by Joel Ohringer</I></CENTER>
</H4>
<BR>
Most of us are aware that automobiles have negative impacts: air pollution
from carbon monoxide, water degradation from oil spills, dependence on foreign
oil, etc. But are we <I>fully </I>aware of the costs of our reliance on
cars? <I><BR>
<BR>
The Going Rate: What it Really Costs to Drive, </I>just published by World
Resources Institute, reveals that if the hidden, subsidized costs of our
private-vehicle-dominated transportation system - at least $300 billion
a year - were instead passed on to the motoring public, it would raise the
price of gasoline by several dollars a gallon. <BR>
<BR>
According to <I>Going Rate</I> authors James MacKenzie, Roger Dower, and
Donald Chen:
<BLOCKQUOTE>Motorists today do not directly pay anything close to the full
costs of their driving decisions. However steep the bills for cars, insurance,
automobile maintenance, and gasoline may seem to drivers, federal and state
policies spare them many other costs. The net effect is to make driving
seem cheaper than it really is and to encourage the excessive use of automobiles
and trucks.</BLOCKQUOTE>
Why is public transit in the US so poor? Why do European cars get so much
better gas mileage? There are no controls, no incentives to limit the ever-increasing
rise in auto-mobile use precisely because the costs are not borne by the
user.<BR>
<BR>
Americans drive 2 trillion miles a year: double the distance of those in
other industrial countries. With less than 5 percent of world's population,
we consume a quarter of the world's oil, half of which is burned in motor
vehicles. We drive more and more: per capita motor vehicle use has tripled
since 1950. And one car is just not enough: in 1990, there were 23 million
more vehicles than licensed drivers. <BR>
<BR>
Some of the costs are conspicuous. Traffic congestion strangles our cities.
Los Angeles now has freeway speeds averaging less than 31 mph. It results
in lost time, lower worker productivity, more accidents, wasted fuel, and
increased auto maintenance.<BR>
<BR>
Constant highway construction and road improvement is another obvious cost.
But who pays for this? We spend $200 million<I> a day</I> building and rebuilding
the nation's roads. Gas taxes and other user fees covered only 60 percent
of the $33.3 billion spent on building, improving, and repairing roads in
1989. <BR>
<BR>
Also not covered by user fees is the $68 billion spent annually on services
such as highway patrols, traffic management, and traffic accident policework.
Truck owners pay only 32 percent of national highway disbursements, yet
it is estimated that a 50-ton, 4-axle truck can cause an estimated $6 per
mile worth of damage to a rural arterial highway. <BR>
<BR>
Other costs of our automotive obsession are associated with the 47,000 people
killed in motor vehicle accidents each year. These deaths, and 5 million
additional injuries annually, result in medical expenses, lost work time,
and other costs not directly covered by user insurance. <BR>
<BR>
Parking costs are a normal cost of operating a motor vehicle. Yet free parking,
e.g., at the mall, effectively subsidizes this expense. Shoppers who walk
or take public transportation pay for spaces they do not use, while drivers
are deprived of a reason to carpool. Ninety percent of all commuters park
at no cost and receive this fringe benefit tax-free. <BR>
<BR>
Other hidden costs are the secu-rity costs of importing oil. Motorists use
half of the imported oil, and arguably should pay half the $50 billion annual
cost of maintaining a US military presence in shipping lanes. (This figure
excludes the costs of the Persian Gulf War.) <BR>
<BR>
Due to our heavy reliance on petroleum and lack of alternative fuels, we
are vulnerable to fluctuations in oil prices and interruptions of supply.
The costs are inflation, unemployment, and declines in productivity. <BR>
<BR>
Another impact is land loss. In the US, more than 60,000 square miles have
been paved over - including wetlands, scenic areas, and historic areas,
not to mention farmland. Nearly half of our urban land is covered with asphalt.
<BR>
<BR>
In response to regulation, efforts have been made to lessen automobile emissions.
But any improvements have been offset by more miles and vehicles driven.
The costs are real: acid rain, chronic health problems, forest damage and
reduced agricultural revenues. <BR>
<BR>
Motor vehicles have a major role in global warming, climate change, and
ozone depletion. Unchecked, they will have incalculable, perhaps incomprehensible,
effects.<BR>
<BR>
How can we stabilize automobile use and reduce its effects? Shift the costs
of motor vehicle use to the drivers. Imposing user charges that reflect
the full costs of driving will almost certainly have direct and lasting
effects. <BR>
<BR>
One method is increasing existing state and federal fuel taxes. Fuel tax
revenues expand directly with fuel consumption. One proposal is a phased-in
tax on fossil fuels, reaching $60 per ton of carbon in the year 2020. It
would cut US carbon dioxide emissions to 80 percent of the 1990 level by
2005 and hold it at that level indefinitely. This would translate to a price
increase of 20 cents per gallon at the pump. Another idea is to raise charges
on trucks according to weight-per-axle and annual mileage. They would then
share the cost of road maintenance more equally. <BR>
<BR>
Pay-as-you-go is another concept. Levying road tolls based on time of day
helps reduce congestion. In Hong Kong, electronic number plates are scanned
by sensors at the toll site, and bills are sent out monthly to each driver.
Similar systems are in place in San Diego and Dallas. &quot;Congestion tolls&quot;
would range from 25 cents to $1.25 for a 10 mile urban trip. <BR>
<BR>
True medical costs could be incorporated into insurance premiums, or insurance
taxes paid at the pump could be placed in an insurance fund. <BR>
<BR>
And employer-paid parking can be reformed; companies could offer a tax-free
travel allowance instead of free parking.<BR>
<BR>
Significant public policy changes are also needed. Reforms in zoning and
land use planning should result in a balanced transportation system. Zoning
can be used to encourage densities suitable to public transit. <I>The Going
Rate</I>'s authors note:
<BLOCKQUOTE>European cities are living proof that a high standard of living
is compatible with a reduced need for cars and that the key is fairly high
residential densities combined with mixed zoning and integrated public transportation
planning.</BLOCKQUOTE>
A doubling of residential population density is associated with a 25 to
30 percent reduction in the number of miles people need to travel by car.
Densities of over seven housing units per acre are needed for cost effective
bus service; nine for light-rail service. Communities must design for bikes
and pedestrians. <BR>
<BR>
Fortunately, there is a growing awareness of the problem and a trend toward
finding solutions. The work of World Resources Institute is complemented
by the efforts of many others. <BR>
<BR>
Amory Lovins of the Rocky Mountain Institute suggests: 
<UL>
  <LI>perpetual transit passes instead of free parking spaces provided by
multi-unit housing projects <BR>
<BR>
  <LI>&quot;commuting efficient mortgages&quot; to allow a bigger mortgage
(reward with borrowing power) those buying homes close to work<BR>
<BR>
  <LI>a downtown peak-hour driving pass that can double as a free transit
pass<BR>
<BR>
  <LI>the abolition of tax-free status for company-owned employee cars.
</UL>
<BR>
David Morris of the Institute for Local Self-Reliance suggests promoting
telecommuting, the use of video conferences, and flextime to allow employees
to commute at varying times. <BR>
<BR>
Wolfgang Zuckerman, a researcher at EcoPlan International in Paris, offers
additional solutions in his book,<I> End of the Road: The World Car Crisis
and How We Can Solve It</I>: 
<UL>
  <LI>Close damaged roads and turn them over to nonmotorized transport.<BR>
<BR>
  <LI>Use &quot;cells&quot; and mazes to protect local areas from through
traffic. Ring roads would allow vehicles to enter separate zones, but not
traverse the urban central cell. Vienna, for example, treats its entire
historic center as a cell. <BR>
<BR>
  <LI>Impose total, partial, or temporary car bans in city centers. This
has proved successful in over 11 Italian cities including Bologna and Milan.
In Florence, pollution levels dropped by 20 to 30 percent after the municipality
applied restrictions. <BR>
<BR>
  <LI>Radically redesign the conventional car. <BR>
<BR>
  <LI>Place restrictions or a total ban on car advertising, since $5 billion
a year is spent on glorifying the car - and hiding its effects.<BR>
<BR>
  <LI>Utilize taxis more effectively: promote ride-sharing in taxis; use
radio linked computers to keep empty taxis positioned around town more efficiently;
reduce taxi &quot;cruising .&quot; 
</UL>
<BR>
As Zuckerman sees it, even hitchhiking deserves its rightful place in an
integrated solution to our transportation woes.<BR>
<BR>
The US <I>is </I>beginning to see a change in attitude toward the car. New
Jersey canceled $1.2 billion in new highway projects and will instead double
its investment in mass transit. Ford recently ran recruitment ads for its
&quot;revolutionary&quot; electric car project. <BR>
<BR>
The problems of automotive transportation will be resolved, however, only
when the real costs of our love affair with the automobile are uncovered
- and passed on to those of us who have been smitten.<BR>

<H1><CENTER>Architects Design For A Liveable Future</CENTER>
</H1>
<H4><CENTER><I>by Joel Ohringer</I></CENTER>
</H4>
<BR>
Architects plan our cities, design our homes, and construct our workplaces.
They interact with people who develop, build, supply materials for, and
ultimately occupy those spaces. They are in a key position to build strategic
alliances among groups that impact virtually everyone through the design,
preservation, and restoration of the built environment.<BR>
<BR>
Recognizing this, the American Institute of Architects (AIA) is promoting
the message that environmentally sustainable design is vital to our society
and the preservation of our planet. AIA's Committee on the Environment endor-ses
and encourages the development of environmentally sustainable architecture
through a variety of efforts. <BR>
<BR>
We previously reported (<I>IC </I>#31) on the AIA's <I>Environmental Resource
Guide</I>, a reference guide for design professionals. AIA is now developing
a <I>Building Owner's Guide Toward Environmentally Sustainable Architecture
</I>to make the case that environmentally conscious design leads to safer,
more productive and efficient interior environments. The booklet will help
design firms to present environmental issues - air quality, waste management,
energy, and economics - effectively to developers and other clients. <BR>
<BR>
Preparations are now under way for the AIA annual convention, which is being
held in June 1993 in conjunction with the Union of International Architects'
(UIA) World Congress. The theme of both events is sustainable communities,
opening up exciting possibilities for international dialogue on the subject.
According to the AIA's plans for the conference, &quot;Emphasis will be
placed on a methodology to prompt direct action for clean air and water,
healthy buildings and cities, preservation of na-tural resources, restoration
of degraded landscapes, and biodiversity.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Three related and inter-related AIA programs are:<B><BR>
<BR>
1) Video Teleconference Series: &quot;Designing a Sustainable Future&quot;
</B><BR>
<BR>
Three teleconferences to be held in early 1993 are intended to develop an
awareness among design professionals about sustainability issues, to allow
for networking within and outside the design and construction industry,
and to provide practical tools for architects to incorporate sustainabilty
into their work. Emphasizing successful case studies, an international faculty
will be presenting topics including energy, building ecology, and land use
and natural resources. The programs are designed to be highly interactive
and encourage ongoing discussion.<B><BR>
<BR>
2) &quot;Call for Sustainable Community Solutions&quot; </B><BR>
<BR>
This international &quot;ideas exploration&quot; is soliciting sustainable,
practical solutions to human settlement problems. Participants are encouraged
to work as interdisciplinary teams and submit, in response to a defined
issue or need, &quot;a comprehensive solution, grounded in science, technology,
economic viability, and cultural appropriateness.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Solutions should restore biodiversity, not cause damage during construction
or use, derive energy from renewable resources, minimize waste, and have
the potential to be recycled. An international panel of ten experts will
select outstanding submissions for awards (totalling $50,000). Competition
registration deadline is April 1, 1993.<B><BR>
<BR>
3) Strategic Partnership for a Sustainable Future </B><BR>
<BR>
According to the AIA's Project Summary: &quot;An interdisciplinary teamwork
approach to solving our society's problems is required ... No longer can
the individual disciplines work alone. No longer can a singular or compartmentalized
approach toward design be effective.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
To build these working partnerships, the AIA will convene &quot;... a broad-based
strategic alliance representing 1) the design and allied professions, 2)
the construction industry, 3) the business community, 4) civic and governmental
interests, and 5) members of the academic communities ...&quot; Using a
consensus process, the group will develop a &quot;Declaration of Interdependence,&quot;
a roadmap toward global ecological responsibility and professional ethics
and a &quot;collective statement of philosophy on environmentally responsible
human settlement issues ... which can serve as collective expression of
our desire to create a healthy planet for future generations.&quot; <BR>

<H1><CENTER>Rio's Success</CENTER>
</H1>
<H4><CENTER><I>by Donella Meadows</I></CENTER>
</H4>
<BR>
<I>Last issue, we promised a wrap-up on the long awaited 
&quot;Earth Summit&quot; - the UN's huge Conference 
on Environment and Development that was held this June 
in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.<P>

We liked this (excerpted) analysis by </I>IC <I>contributing 
editor Donella (Dana) Meadows. Her weekly column, &quot;The 
Global Citizen,&quot; is one of the most reliable places 
we know for holistic and humane commentary on world 
affairs. To get Dana's column onto your local newspaper's 
Op-Ed page, write her directly at PO Box 58, Daniels 
Road, Plainfield NH, 03781. </I><P>

Was it all a waste of time, the enormous, contentious 
Earth Summit? Knowing governments in general, there 
was no reason to expect the Rio meeting to produce 
brilliant policymaking or heart-warming international 
cooperation, and it didn't. But what governments do 
is not all that happens. Especially in environmental 
development matters, the future is primarily in the 
hands not of governments, but of people who have babies, 
drive cars, turn lights on and off, buy stuff, generate 
garbage. On the level of people, the Earth Summit was 
a success.<P>

Brazilian schoolchildren trooped in thousands through 
the environmental exhibits. NBC found it necessary 
to explain on the nightly news what biodiversity means. 
BBC World Service did special environmental shows for 
weeks. If the Earth Summit did nothing more than advance 
the ecological literacy of the world's reporters, that 
will pay long-term dividends. <P>

But it did more than that. In addition to the government 
summit there was a business summit, where corporations 
promoted new, green technologies. There was a spiritual 
summit, attended by the Dalai Lama, Shirley MacLaine, 
rainforest shamans, and earnest meditators who descended 
upon conference rooms two days in advance to fill them 
with vibrations of peace and compassion. <P>

The most significant summit, I think, was the peoples' 
summit, the one that brought together the NGOs (nongovernmental 
organizations), from the World Wildlife Fund to the 
Association of African Midwives. Cynics looked down 
on these gatherings as &quot;sandboxes for environmentalists.&quot; 
But don't underestimate the personal connections and 
creativity that can arise in a sandbox.<P>

At the NGO meetings Africans with practical experience 
in village-level solar energy exchanged ideas with 
Danes demonstrating hi-tech windmills. Women's groups 
found common ground. Indigenous peoples challenged 
the industrial world's condescension and pointed out 
that they know some things about co-existing with nature 
that everyone might need to understand. Coalitions 
formed. If you wanted to hear leading-edge ideas and 
watch them spread around the world, you had to be in 
the sandbox. <P>

The consciousness of the industrial age gives rise to 
steel girders and toxic wastes, desktop computers and 
ozone holes, mahogany furniture and burning rainforests. 
The new consciousness asks how to have steel, computers, 
and furniture, how <I>everyone </I>can have them, and how 
that can happen in a way that does not degrade the 
material and energy sources from which everything is 
made and from which all species live.<P>

There are answers to tough questions like that. The 
answers won't be found until the questions are asked. 
The Earth Summit directed the attention of the world's 
government, media, business, spiritual, and grassroots 
leaders to the important questions. That was no small 
achievement.<P>

<H4><CENTER><I>by Stuart B. Hill</I></CENTER>
</H4>
<BR>
<I>If we take the time to see the world from a mite's point of view, we
get a glimpse at how interdependent we are with so many of the Earth's creatures.
Stuart B. Hill is associate professor of entomology at McGill University
and director of the Macdonald College's Ecological Agriculture Projects
in Quebec. His research focuses on soil life (he's particularly fond of
mites) and safe methods of pest control, but his interests range from science
policy and ethics to human behavior and sustainable development. This article
first appeared in </I>Seasons<I>, a publication of the Federation of Ontario
Naturalists.</I><BR>
<BR>
In most parts of the world there is more life beneath the surface of the
soil than above it. In a few shovelfuls of forest soil there may be more
than 1,000 different types of organisms and as many as 100 different types
of mites. In a square meter there can be more than 10 million nematodes
and protozoa, 1 million mites and springtails, and thousands of other invertebrates,
including several hundred earthworms. Even in a teaspoon of soil there can
be as many as 10 million bacteria and two kilometers of fungal filaments.<BR>
<BR>
The soil is indeed a living, breathing firmament in which the primary action
taking place is the breakdown of organic matter and the release of plant
nutrients. <BR>
<BR>
The soil is the decomposer part of the natural cycle that flows from plant
and animal production, to consumption and use, to waste decomposition and
recycling, and then back to plant production again. If there were no organisms
in the soil we would soon be up to our ears in accumulated dead animals
and other forms of organic matter. <BR>
<BR>
Increasingly, however, these organisms are having a harder and harder time
getting their work done. Nearly everything that humans do to the soil kills
them - directly or indirectly. They are poisoned by pesticides and some
fertilizers, and injured or exposed to the damaging rays of the sun or to
predators by cultivation and bare-soil agricultural practices. <BR>
<BR>
They're starved of a balanced diet by our failure to return our wastes to
the soil and by our tendency to grow the same crop year after year, providing
the soil population with a monotonous diet. In addition, desiccation, flooding,
fire, compaction from heavy machinery, and contamination with a vast range
of pollutants add to the hazards of life in the soil.<BR>
<BR>
Yet it is upon these very organisms and this free decomposition service
that the productivity of our farms and forests, and ultimately, we ourselves
rely. 
<H4><BR>
IT'S A MITE'S WORLD</H4>
The key to working with (rather than against) our allies in the soil is
to try to see the world from their point of view. <BR>
<BR>
From the perspective of a soil organism, about half of the average soil
consists of solid material, mostly mineral particles, and half consists
of spaces between the particles. Half of these spaces are filled with water
that occurs as a film around the particles. <BR>
<BR>
This situation has resulted in the evolution of three primary strategies
for living in soil. Protozoa, nematodes, and some other small organisms
swim or creep around in the water film, feeding primarily on bacteria and
on one another.<BR>
<BR>
Mites, springtails, and other small arthropods wander around in the air
spaces (up to their knees in water) browsing on fungi, nematodes, and one
another.<BR>
<BR>
Earthworms, some insects and other larger arthropods, slugs, and snails
burrow through the soil, independent of the size of the air and water spaces,
feeding primarily on the dead organic matter and on the microorganisms that
colonize it.
<H4><BR>
VIBRANT SOIL HABITATS</H4>
The key soil management question is: what can we do to provide these organisms
with optimal food and space conditions so they can get on with their jobs?
<BR>
<BR>
Clearly, the key is to permit the return of a suitable mix of uncontaminated
organic wastes to the soil and to avoid stressing the system physically,
chemically, and biologically. <BR>
<BR>
In a stressed and starved soil, the earthworm population can fall to nearly
zero, whereas in a well-managed soil, their activity may result in the production
of large quantities of castes (their very fertile waste) in the soil's upper
layers. In addition, their burrows help to aerate the soil and provide channels
for root growth and water drainage.<BR>
<BR>
As well as these more obvious beneficial roles, most soil organisms have
many more subtle positive effects. For example, the breakdown of leaves
requires the action of a succession of different species of fungi. The problem
is that because fungi have limited dispersal powers they soon run out of
suitable substrate. They also pollute the environment around them with antibiotics,
making it difficult for other fungi to grow.<BR>
<BR>
The animals, especially the mites and springtails, provide part of the solution
to this problem. Most of the fungal-feeding mites prefer certain species
of fungi. The mites generally digest only the filaments, leaving the spores
to pass through their guts undamaged and get deposited in little packages
of their waste throughout the soil. Because this waste is fertile, like
potting soil, these spores will germinate and form new fungal colonies in
new locations. <BR>
<BR>
In this way the mites help the process of organic matter decomposition,
while at the same time essentially practicing a primitive form of farming.
Actually, it is not so primitive because their waste is deposited in a piece
of cast-off gut lining that can contain substances that prevent other fungi
from growing on their package of waste. Hence, mites practice a fairly sophisticated
method of &quot;weed&quot; control. Furthermore, the hairs on their bodies
may disperse the spores of the fungal species on which they prefer to feed.
It is humbling to think that this sort of farming has been going on in soil
for more than 400 million years. <BR>
<BR>
These kinds of relationships operate by means of very delicate balances.
Thus, if the mite population is decimated by, for example, the application
of a highly toxic pesticide, microbial activity may initially increase in
the absence of cropping and then slow down as antibiotics accumulate.<BR>
<BR>
It is this regulatory function carried out by these animals that is so important
for the maintenance of soil fertility. This has not been widely recognized
because the effects of these organisms are catalytic and indirect, and also
because of the belief that the regular use of chemical fertilizers can keep
the soil productive. In fact, as is the case with many analogous processes
in the human body, the artificial provision of a naturally produced substance
will inhibit its production and create dependence on repeated applications.<BR>
<BR>
It is important to understand that there are many functions performed by
the vast array of creatures in the soil, many more than we are fully aware
of. Whenever we eliminate one of these organisms we inherit its job - a
job at which it is an expert and we are, at best, novices.<BR>
<BR>
The message is clear: we must support our allies in the soil and help them
to support us and the other organisms with which we share this planet.<BR>

<H1><CENTER>Microbial Microcosm</CENTER>
</H1>
<H4><CENTER><I>based on the work of Lynn Margulis and Dorion Sagan</I></CENTER>
</H4>
<BR>
<I>Just how interconnected are we? The work of biologist Lynn Margulis and
writer Dorion Sagan indicates we're interconnected in ways few of us have
probably ever considered. In fact, instead of viewing ourselves as the pinnacle
of evolution, it may be more accurate to think of ourselves as a colony
of closely associated bacteria. <BR>
<BR>
Carla Cole based the following on the work of Lynn Margulis and Dorion Sagan,
including an article of theirs, </I>The Parts: Power to the Protoctists,
<I>which appeared in the September/October 1992 issue of </I>Earthwatch<I>.
(See the <A HREF="#Readings">sidebar</A> for more information on their work.)</I><BR>
<BR>
All life on Earth today derived from common ancestors. The first to evolve
- yet the last to be studied in detail - are bacteria. Scientists have now
discovered that bacteria not only are the building blocks of life, but also
occupy and are indispensable to every other living being on Earth. Without
them, life's essential processes would quickly grind to a halt, and Earth
would be as barren as Venus and Mars. <BR>
<BR>
Far from leaving microorganisms behind on an evolutionary ladder, we more
complex creatures are both surrounded by them and composed of them. New
knowledge of biology alters our view of evolution as a chronic, bloody competition
among individuals and species. Life did not take over the globe by combat,
but by networking. Life forms multiplied and grew more complex by co-opting
others, not just by killing them.<BR>
<BR>
In the first two billion years of life on Earth, bacteria - the only inhabitants
- continuously transformed the planet's surface and atmosphere and invented
all life's essential, miniaturized chemical systems. Their ancient biotechnology
led to fermentation, photosynthesis, oxygen breathing, and the fixation
of atmospheric nitrogen into proteins. It also led to worldwide crises of
bacterial population expansion, starvation, and pollution - long before
the dawn of larger forms of life.<BR>
<BR>
Bacteria survived these crises because of special abilities that other life
forms lack and that add whole new dimensions to the dynamics of evolution.
First, bacteria routinely transfer their genes to bacteria very different
from themselves. The receiving bacterium can use the visiting, accessory
DNA (the cell's genetic material) to perform functions that its own genes
cannot mandate. Bacteria can exchange genes quickly and reversibly. Unlike
other life forms, all the world's bacteria have access to a single gene
pool and hence to the chemical prowess of the entire bacterial kingdom.
<BR>
<BR>
This extreme genetic fluidity makes the very concept of <I>species </I>of
bacteria meaningless. The result is a planet made fertile and inhabitable
for larger life forms by a worldwide system of communicating, gene-exchanging
bacteria.<BR>
<BR>
Bacteria also have a remarkable capacity to combine their bodies with other
organisms, forming alliances that may become permanent. Fully 10 percent
of our own dry weight consists of bacteria, some of which - like those in
our intestines that produce vitamin B12 - we cannot live without. <BR>
<BR>
Mitochondria live inside our cells but reproduce at different times with
different methods from the rest of our bodies' cells. They are descendants
of ancient bacteria. Either engulfed as prey or invading as predators, these
bacteria took up residence inside foreign cells, forming an uneasy alliance
that provided waste disposal and oxygen-derived energy in return for food
and shelter. Without mitochondria, the nucleated plant or animal cell cannot
breathe and therefore dies.<BR>
<BR>
This symbiogenesis, the merging of organisms into new collectives, is a
major source of evolutionary change on Earth. The results of these first
mergers were protoctists, our most recent, most important - and most ignored
- microbial ancestors. Protoctists invented our kind of digestion, movement,
and our tactile and visual systems. They came up with speciation, cannibalism,
genes organized on chromosomes, and the ability to make hard parts (like
teeth and skeletons). These complex microscopic beings and their descendants
even developed the first genders and our kind of cell-fusing sexuality involving
penetration of an egg by a sperm.<BR>
<BR>
Discovering the microcosm within and about us changes - indeed, reverses
- the way we look at living things and picture their evolution on the planet.
For instance, since all life on Earth evolved from bacteria, it makes more
sense now to think of beetles, rose bushes, and baboons as communities of
former bacteria and protoctists than as higher animals or plants. <BR>
<BR>
The traditional belief in &quot;man, the highest animal&quot; endures because
the shift to a more egalitarian view of the world that respects and empowers
<I>all </I>life is an enormous step. <BR>
<BR>
Acknowledging that our ancestors are bacteria is humbling and has disturbing
implications. Besides impugning human sovereignty over the rest of nature,
it challenges our ideas of individuality, uniqueness, and independence.
It even violates our view of ourselves as discrete physical beings separated
from the rest of nature and - still more unsettling - it challenges the
alleged uniqueness of human intelligent consciousness.<BR>
<BR>
Those who speak only for the special interests of human beings fail to see
how interdependent life on Earth really is. Without the microbial life forms,
we would sink in feces and choke on the carbon dioxide we exhale. We cannot
view evolutionary history in a balanced manner if we think of it only as
a four-billion-year preparation for &quot;higher&quot; organisms, like humans.
Most of life's history has been microbial. We are recombinations of the
metabolic processes of bacteria that appeared before, during, and after
the accumulation of atmospheric oxygen some 2,000 million years ago. <BR>
<BR>
The ancient, vast, and fundamental nature of our interdependence with other
forms of life may be humbling, but it provides a basis for facing the future
free of crippling delusions. Despite all our conceits, we are as much exploited
as exploiters, as much consumed as consumers. The lesson of evolutionary
history is that it will be through conservation, interaction, and networking,
not domination, that we avert a premature end to our species.<BR>

<H2><A NAME="Readings"></A>READINGS ON BIOLOGICAL INTERCONNECTEDNESS</H2>
Lynn Margulis and Dorion Sagan, whose work inspired and informed this article,
have written extensively on biological interconnectedness. <I><BR>
<BR>
Microcosmos: Four Billion Years of Evolution From Our Microbial Ancestors,
</I>explores in delightful but scientifically rigorous prose the issues
raised in this article. The book is now available in paperback from Touchstone
Press.<BR>
<BR>
Lynn and Dorion also wrote <I>Mystery Dance: On the Evolution of Human Sexuality
</I>(Simon and Schuster, NY, 1991)<I>, The Garden of Microbial Delights
</I>(second edition, Kendall-Hunt, 1993)<I>, </I>and<I> The Microcosmos
Coloring Book</I>. Lynn authored<I> Symbiosis in Cell Evolution </I>(second
edition, WH Freeman, NY, 1993) and coauthored, with K.V. Schwartz,<I> Five
Kingdoms: An Illustrated Guide to the Phyla of Life on Earth </I>(second
edition, WH Freeman, NY, 1988).<BR>
<BR>
Lynn is distinguished university professor in the biology department at
the University of Massachusetts at Amherst. She was elected to the National
Academy of Sciences in 1983. <BR>
<BR>
She is best known for developing the theory, now widely accepted, that cells
with nuclei evolved from the merger of two or more different types of bacterial
cells. <BR>
<BR>
She also provided some of the biological underpinnings for the development
of James E. Lovelock's Gaia hypothesis. Lynn is now working on the controversial

<H1><CENTER>World As Lover;<BR>
World As Self</CENTER>
</H1>
<H4><CENTER><I>by Joanna Macy</I></CENTER>
</H4>
<BR>
<I>Spiritual traditions have tended to look at the world in four major ways:
as a battlefield, as a trap, as a lover, and as the self. The first two
- as a stage set for our moral battles or as a prison to escape - are probably
familiar, and have in many ways contributed to our lack of care for the
world. But what of the other two? Might they shed some useful light on life
in an interconnected world?<BR>
<BR>
This is the focus of Joanna Macy's wonderful book, </I>World As Lover; World
as Self<I>, published by Parallax Press, from which we have taken the following
excerpts. Joanna Macy is a scholar of Buddhism and general systems theory.
She is known in many countries for her trainings designed to empower creative,
sustained social action.</I><BR>
<BR>
The way we define and delimit the self is arbitrary. We can place it between
our ears and have it looking out from our eyes, or we can widen it to include
the air we breathe, or at other moments, we can cast its boundaries farther
to include the oxygen-giving trees and plankton, our external lungs, and
beyond them the web of life in which they are sustained.<BR>
<BR>
I used to think that I ended with my skin, that everything within the skin
was me and everything outside the skin was not. But now you've read these
words, and the concepts they represent are reaching your cortex, so &quot;the
process&quot; that is me now extends as far as you. <BR>
<BR>
And where, for that matter, did this process begin? I certainly can trace
it to my teachers, some of whom I never met, and to my husband and children,
who give me courage and support to do the work I do, and to the plant and
animal beings who sustain my body. <BR>
<BR>
What I am, as systems theorists have helped me see, is a &quot;flow-through.&quot;
I am a flow-through of matter, energy, and information, which is transformed
in turn by my own experiences and intentions. <BR>
<BR>
To experience the world as an extended self and its story as our own extended
story involves no surrender or eclipse of our individuality. The liver,
leg, and lung that are &quot;mine&quot; are highly distinct from each other,
thank goodness, and each has a distinctive role to play. The larger <I>selfness
</I>we discover today is not an undifferentiated unity. Our recognition
of this may be the third part of an unfolding of consciousness that began
a long time ago, like the third movement of a symphony.<BR>
<BR>
In the first movement, our infancy as a species, we felt no separation from
the natural world around us. Trees, rocks, and plants surrounded us with
a living presence as intimate and pulsing as our own bodies. In that primal
intimacy, which anthropologists call &quot;participation mystique,&quot;
we were as one with our world as a child in the mother's womb.<BR>
<BR>
Then self-consciousness arose and gave us distance on our world. We needed
that distance in order to make decisions and strategies, in order to measure,
judge, and to monitor our judgments. With the emergence of free-will, the
fall out of the Garden of Eden, the second movement began - the lonely and
heroic journey of the ego.<BR>
<BR>
Nowadays, yearning to reclaim a sense of wholeness, some of us tend to disparage
that movement of separation from nature, but it brought great gains for
which we can be grateful. The distanced and observing eye brought us tools
of science, and a priceless view of the vast, orderly intricacy of our world.
The recognition of our individuality brought us trial by jury and the Bill
of Rights.<BR>
<BR>
Now, harvesting these gains, we are ready to return. The third movement
begins. Having gained distance and sophistication of perception, we can
turn and recognize who we have been all along. Now it can dawn on us: we
are our world knowing itself. We can relinquish our separateness. We can
come home again - and participate in our world in a richer, more responsible
and poignantly beautiful way than before, in our infancy.
<H4><BR>
WORLD AS LOVER</H4>
It is my experience that the world itself has a role to play in our liberation.
Its very pressures, pains, and risks can wake us up - release us from the
bonds of ego and guide us home to our vast, true nature. For some of us,
our love for the world is so passionate that we cannot ask it to wait until
we are enlightened.<BR>
<BR>
To view the <I>world as lover </I>is to look at the world as a most intimate
and gratifying partner. We find some of the richest expressions of our erotic
relationship to the world in Hinduism, for example in Krishna worship, but
this erotic affirmation of the phenomenal world is not limited to Hinduism.
Ancient Goddess religions, now being explored (at last!) carry it too, as
do strains of Sufism and the Kabbalah, and Christianity has its tradition
of bridal mysticism. <BR>
<BR>
It also occurs outside the religious metaphor. A poet friend of mine went
through a period of such personal loss that she was catapulted into extreme
loneliness. Falling apart into a nervous breakdown, she went to New York
City and lived alone. She walked the streets for months until she found
her wholeness again. A phrase of hers echoes in my mind: &quot;I learned
to move in the world as if it were my lover.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Another Westerner who sees the world as lover is Italian storyteller Italo
Calvino. In his little book, <I>Cosmicomics, </I>he describes the evolution
of life from the perspective of an individual who experienced it from the
beginning, even before the Big Bang. The chapter I want to recount begins
with a sentence from science: &quot;Through the calculations begun by Edwin
P. Hubble on the galaxies' velocity of recession, we can establish the moment
when all the universe's matter was concentrated in a single point, before
it began to expand in space.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;We were all there, where else could we have been?&quot; says Calvino's
narrator, Qfwfq, as he describes his experience. &quot;We were all in that
one point - and, man, was it crowded!&quot; Given the conditions, irritations
were almost inevitable. See, in addition to all those people, &quot;you
have to add all the stuff we had to keep piled up in there: all the material
that was to serve afterwards to form the universe ... from the nebula of
Andromeda to the Vosges Mountains to beryllium isotopes. And on top of that
we were always bumping against the Z'zu family's household goods: camp beds,
mattresses, baskets. ...&quot;<BR>
<BR>
So there were, naturally enough, complaints and gossip, but none ever attached
to Mrs. Pavacini. (Since most names in the story have no vowels, I have
given her a name we can pronounce.) &quot;Mrs. Pavacini, her bosom, her
thighs, her orange dressing gown,&quot; the sheer memory of her fills our
narrator<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>&quot;with a blissful, generous emotion. ... The fact that she
went to bed with her friend Mr. DeXuaeauX, was well-known. But in a point,
if there's a bed, it takes up the whole point, so it isn't a question of
going to bed but of being there, because anybody in the point is also in
the bed. So consequently it was inevitable that she was in bed with each
of us. If she'd been another person, there's no telling all the things that
might have been said about her. ...&quot;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BR>
This state of affairs could have gone on indefinitely, but something extraordinary
happened. An idea occurred to Mrs. Pavacini<B>: </B>&quot;Oh boys, if only
I had some room, how I'd like to make some pasta for you!&quot; Here I quote
in part from my favorite longest sentence in literature, which closes this
particular chapter in Calvino's collection:<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>&quot;And in that moment we all thought of the space that her
round arms would occupy moving backward and forward over the great mound
of flour and eggs ... while her arms kneaded and kneaded, white and shiny
with oil up to the elbows, and we thought of the space the flour would occupy
and the wheat for the flour and the fields to raise the wheat and the mountains
from which the water would flow to irrigate the fields ... of the space
it would take for the Sun to arrive with its rays, to ripen the wheat; of
the space for the Sun to condense from the clouds of stellar gases and burn;
of the quantities of stars and galaxies and galactic masses in flight through
space which would be needed to hold suspended every galaxy, every nebula,
every sun, every planet, and at the same time we thought of it, this space
was inevitably being formed, at the same time that Mrs. Pavacini was uttering
those words: &quot;... ah, what pasta, boys!&quot; the point that contained
her and all of us was expanding in a halo of distance in light years and
light centuries and billions of light millennia and we were being hurled
to the four corners of the universe ... and she dissolved into I don't know
what kind of energy-light-heat, she, Mrs. Pavacini, she who in the midst
of our closed, petty world had been capable of a generous impulse, &quot;Boys,
the pasta I could make for you!&quot; a true outburst of general love, initiating
at the same time the concept of space and, properly speaking, space itself,
and time, and universal gravitation, and the gravitating universe, making
possible billions and billions of suns, and planets, and fields of wheat,
and Mrs. Pavacinis scattered through the continents of the planets, kneading
with floury, oil-shiny, generous arms and she lost at that very moment,
and we, mourning her loss.&quot;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BR>
But is she lost? Or is she equally present, in every moment, her act of
love embodied in every unfolding of this amazing world? <BR>
<BR>
Whether we see it as Krishna or as Mrs. Pavacini, that teasing, loving presence
is in the monsoon clouds and the peacock's cry that heralds the monsoon,
and in the plate of good pasta. <BR>
<BR>
For when you see the world as lover, every being, every phenomenon, can
become - if you have a clever, appreciative eye - an expression of that
ongoing, erotic impulse. It takes form right now in each one of us and in
everyone and everything we encounter - the bus driver, the clerk at the
checkout counter, the leaping squirrel. <BR>
<BR>
As we seek to discover the lover in each lifeform, you can find yourself
in the dance of <I>rasa-lila, </I>sweet play, where each of the milkmaids
who yearned for Krishna finds him magically at her side, her very own partner
in the dance. The one beloved has become many, and the world itself her
lover.<BR>

<H4><BR>
WE HAVE MET MANY TIMES ...</H4>
<I>The following stories grew out of Joanna Macy's experience living and
working with Tibetan refugees in the foothills of the Himalayan Mountains.</I><BR>
<BR>
One afternoon at his residence in Dharamsala, India, I told His Holiness
the Dalai Lama how Buddhist teachings have inspired my work to empower social
and environmental activists. I told him how they help us experience our
interexistence with all beings. In Northern California, for example, in
direct actions on behalf of the old-growth forests, they help us confront
the loggers and lumber company executives without fear or blame, because
we can remind ourselves now of our deep interconnections throughout our
former lives.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;How can Western people know this if they do not believe in rebirth?&quot;
His Holiness asked.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;For rebirth we substitute evolution,&quot; I said. And to illustrate
I took his hand and led him on a two-minute evolutionary remembering. &quot;Each
atom in each cell in this hand goes back to the beginning of time&quot;...
to the first explosion of light and energy, to the formation of the galaxies
and solar systems, to the fires and rains that bathed our planet, and the
life-forms that issued from its primordial seas. ... &quot;We have met and
been together many times.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Yes, of course,&quot; he said quietly. &quot;Very good.&quot;
<H4><BR>
DEEP COMPASSION</H4>
Another lesson that summer also occurred casually, in passing. In order
to help the Tibetans I wanted to tell their story to the world - a story
I was just beginning to discover. I had stunning photos of the Tibetans
in exile, of their faces and crafts, and the majestic lama dances of their
lineage. I envisaged an illustrated article for a popular periodical,<I>
</I>but to hook Western sympathies and enlist Western support, such an article,
I figured, should include the horrors from which these refugees had escaped.
Stories of appalling inhumanity and torture on the part of the Chinese occupation
had come to me only peripherally, in snatches, from laypeople and other
Westerners. The Rinpoches themselves were reluctant to describe or discuss
them.<BR>
<BR>
I presented my argument to Choegyal Rinpoche, the most accessible and confiding
of the tulkus. He had been a mature thirteen-year-old when the Chinese invaded
his monastery, and he had his own memories to tap.<BR>
<BR>
Only when I convinced Choegyal that sharing these memories with the Western
public would aid the plight of Tibetan refugees did he begin to disclose
some of the details of what he had seen and suffered at the hands of the
Chinese before his flight from Tibet. The stories came in snatches of conversations,
as we paused outside the new craft production center or walked over to the
monastery in its temporary, rented quarters.<BR>
<BR>
Many of these elements, the forms of intimidation, coercion, and torture
employed, have become by now, over a quarter of a century later, public
knowledge. Reports now available through agencies like Amnesty International
and the International Council of Jurists, may not have the poignant immediacy
of Choegyal's words, but they give the gist.<BR>
<BR>
The lesson I learned, however, and that will stay forever with me, is not
about the human capacity for cruelty. I was standing with Choegyal under
a rhododendron tree, the sunlight flickering on his face through the leaves
and the blossoms the color of his robes. He had just divulged what perhaps
was the most painful of his memories - what the Chinese military had done
to his monks in the great prayer hall, as his teachers hid him on the mountainside
above the monastery. I gasped with shock, and breathed hard to contain the
grief and anger that arose in me. Then I was stilled by the look he turned
on me, with eyes that shone with unshed tears.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Poor Chinese,&quot; he murmured.<BR>
<BR>
With a shudder of acknowledgment, I realized that the tears in his eyes
were not for himself or for his monks or for his once great monastery of
Dugu in the land of Kham in Eastern Tibet. Those tears were for the destroyers
themselves.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Poor Chinese,&quot; he said, &quot;they make such bad karma for themselves.
&quot;<BR>
<BR>
I cannot emulate that reach of compassion, but I have seen it. I have recognized
it. I know now that it is within our human capacity. And that changes for
me the face of life.
<H4><BR>
MY MOTHER, MY CHILD</H4>
One day, after my morning time with the children, I was walking down the
mountain to meet again with my Khampa friends. On the way I accompanied
my oldest, eleven-year-old son to a Dharma class for Westerners at a school
for young Tibetan lamas. The English-speaking nun in charge was teaching
and she said, &quot;So countless are all sentient beings, and so many their
births throughout time, that each at some point was your mother.&quot; She
then explained a practice for developing compassion: it consisted of viewing
each person as your mother in a former life.<BR>
<BR>
I played with the idea as I walked on down the mountain, following a narrow,
winding road between cedars and rhododendron trees. The astronomical number
of lifetimes that the nun's words evoked boggled my mind. What a pity, I
thought, that this was not a practice I could use, since reincarnation hardly
featured as part of my belief system. Then I paused on the path as the figure
of a coolie approached.<BR>
<BR>
Coolies, or load-bearing laborers, were a familiar sight on the roads of
Dalhousie, and the most heavily laden of all were those who struggled up
the mountain with mammoth logs on their backs. They were low-caste mountain
folk whose bent, gaunt forms were dwarfed by their burdens, many meters
long. I had become accustomed to the sight of them, and accustomed as well
to the sense of consternation that it triggered in me. I would usually look
away in discomfort, and pass by with internally muttered judgments about
the kind of social and economic system that so exploited its own population.<BR>
<BR>
This afternoon I stood stock still. I watched the slight, bandy-legged figure
move slowly uphill towards me, negotiating his burden, which looked like
the trunk of a cedar, around the bend. Backing up to prop the rear of the
log against the bank and ease the weight of it, the coolie paused to catch
his breath. &quot;<I>Namaste</I>,&quot; I said softly, and stepped hesitantly
toward him.<BR>
<BR>
I wanted to see his face. But he was still strapped under his log, and I
would have had to crouch down under it to look up at his features, which
I ached now to see. What face did she now wear, this dear one who had long
ago mothered me? My heart trembled with gladness and distress. I wanted
to touch that dark, half-glimpsed cheek, and meet those lidded eyes bent
to the ground. I wanted to undo and rearrange the straps that I might share
her burden up the mountain. <BR>
<BR>
Whether out of respect or embarrassment, I did not do that. I simply stood
five feet away and drank in every feature of that form - the grizzled chin,
the rag turban, the gnarled hands grasping the forward overhang of log.<BR>
<BR>
The customary comments of my internal social scientist evaporated. What
appeared now before me was not an oppressed class or an indictment of an
economic system, so much as a distinct, irreplaceable, and incomparably
precious being. My mother. My child. A thousand questions rose urgently
in my mind. Where was he headed? When would he reach home? Would there be
loved ones to greet him and a good meal to eat? Was there rest in store,
and songs, and embraces?<BR>
<BR>
When the coolie heaved the log off the bank to balance its weight on his
back again and proceed uphill, I headed on down the mountain path. I had
done nothing to change his life, or betray my discovery of our relationship.
But the Dalhousie mountainside shone in a different light; the furnishings
of my mind had been rearranged, my heart broken open. How odd, I thought,
that I did not need to believe in reincarnation for that to happen.<BR>
<P><CENTER><HR WIDTH="30%"></CENTER>
<H4><BR>
SHAMBHALA WARRIORS: A PROPHECY</H4>
There is a prophecy that arose in Tibetan Buddhism over 12 centuries ago.
I learned it from my Tibetan friends in India when, in 1980, I heard many
of them speaking of this ancient prophecy as coming true in our time. The
signs it foretold, they said, are recognizable now, in our generation. Since
this prophecy speaks of a time of great danger - of apocalypse - I was,
as you can imagine, very interested to find out about it.<BR>
<BR>
There are varying interpretations of this prophecy. Some portray the coming
of the kingdom of Shambhala as an internal event, a metaphor for one's inner
spiritual journey independent of the world around us. Others present it
as an entirely external event that will unfold in our world independent
of what we may choose to do or what our participation may be in the healing
of our world. A third version of the prophecy was given to me by my friend
and teacher Choegyal Rinpoche of the TashiJong community in northern India.<BR>
<BR>
There comes a time when all life on Earth is in danger. In this era, great
barbarian powers have arisen. One is in the Western Hemisphere and one in
the center of the Eurasian land mass. Although these two powers have spent
their wealth in preparations to annihilate each other, they have much in
common: weapons of unfathomable destructive power, and technologies that
lay waste our world. In this era, when the whole future of sentient life
seems to hang by the frailest of threads, the kingdom of Shambhala begins
to emerge.<BR>
<BR>
You can't go there, for it is not a place, it is not a geopolitical entity.
It exists in the hearts and minds of the Shambhala warriors - that is the
term Choegyal used, &quot;warriors.&quot; Nor can you recognize a Shambhala
warrior when you see her or him, for they wear no uniform, or insignia,
and they carry no banners. They have no barricades on which to climb to
threaten the enemy, or behind which they can hide to rest or regroup. They
do not even have any home turf. Always they must move on the terrain of
the barbarians themselves.<BR>
<BR>
Now the time comes when great courage - moral and physical - is required
of the Shambhala warriors, for they must go into the very heart of the barbarian
power, into the pits and pockets and citadels where the weapons are kept
to dismantle them. To dismantle weapons, in every sense of the word, they
must go into the corridors of power where decisions are made.<BR>
<BR>
The Shambhala warriors have the courage to do this because they know that
these weapons are <I>manomaya. </I>They are &quot;mind-made.&quot; Made
by the human mind, they can be unmade by the human mind. The Shambhala warriors
know the dangers that threaten life on Earth are not visited upon us by
any extraterrestrial powers, satanic deities, or preordained evil fate.
They arise from our own decisions, our own lifestyles, and our own relationships.<BR>
<BR>
So in this time, the Shambhala warriors go into training. When Choegyal
said this, I asked, &quot;How do they train?&quot; They train, he said,
in the use of two weapons. &quot;What weapons?&quot; I asked, and he held
up his hands in the way the lamas hold the ritual objects of bell and <I>dorje
</I>in the lama dance.<BR>
<BR>
The weapons are compassion and insight. Both are necessary, he said. You
have to have compassion because it gives you the juice, the power, the passion
to move. When you open to the pain of the world you move, you act. But that
weapon by itself is not enough. It can burn you out, so you need the other
- you need insight into the radical interdependence of all phenomena. With
that wisdom you know that it is not a battle between good guys and bad guys,
but that the line between good and evil runs through the landscape of every
human heart. With insight into our profound interrelatedness, you know that
actions undertaken with pure intent have repercussions throughout the web
of life, beyond what you can measure or discern. By itself, that insight
may appear too cool, too conceptual, to sustain you and keep you moving,
so you need the heat of the compassion. Together, within each Shambhala
warrior and among the warriors themselves, these two can sustain us as agents
of wholesome change. They are gifts for us to claim now in the healing of
our world.<BR>

<H1><CENTER>The Song</CENTER>
</H1>
<H3><CENTER></CENTER>

<H4><CENTER><I>by Sharif Abdullah</I></CENTER>
</H4>
<BR>
<I>Moments of clarity and joy can happen anywhere, without 
warning. The experience is not soon forgotten, and 
can sometimes transform a person's life.<P>

When a number of people share that moment, they become 
something greater than the sum of their ego-bound personalities. 
They become one, at least for a short while. Sharif 
Abdullah and a group of high school students experienced 
such a moment, and Sharif sent us this description.<P>

Sharif is director of The Forum for Community Transformation, 
PO Box 12541, Portland OR 97212 503/281-1813. [An interview 
with Sharif appeared in IN CONTEXT #33.]</I><P>

As part of the program of the Oregon Governor's School 
for Citizen Leadership, I, along with a staff of 20, 
took 50 high school students on a 10-mile hike up Whetstone 
Mountain, located in the Cascade Mountains of western 
Oregon. The students all had attended classes on wisdom 
and leadership, which I co-taught with Calvin Hecocta. 
Calvin, a counsellor at the Chinatown Indian School, 
is also an ancient forest activist and a man steeped 
in Native American spirituality.<P>

At dawn, we began the ascent up the mountain. Travel 
was difficult since many in the group had little or 
no hiking experience, and several were in poor physical 
condition.<P>

Many were also mentally unprepared; some of the students 
bickered and snapped at each other, and others grumbled 
under their breath. Several minor falls and scrapes 
occurred when hikers failed to warn each other of hidden 
roots and logs, or swinging branches. <P>

The group's pace was uneven with frequent shouts of 
&quot;slow down!&quot; or &quot;speed up!&quot; piercing 
the mountain air. We stopped frequently to patch up 
scrapes, eat, and rest. The ascent was frustrating 
for most of the group. Still, the arrival at the summit 
was rewarding, especially for those who did not know 
that they could accomplish such a goal. We didn't know 
it then, but another peak -  a spiritual one - would 
be attained on the way back down.<P>

During the descent, Calvin announced he planned to split 
off from the group to visit an ancient &quot;vision 
quest&quot; site located nearby. There was some controversy 
generated by this decision. Ten students wanted to 
go with Calvin (the trek was too dangerous for the 
entire group), but the director of the school decided 
that the students should stay together. Calvin, along 
with two of the staff, turned to hike to the vision 
quest site.<P>

At first I had every intention of accompanying Calvin. 
I also intended to override the director's orders and 
take the 10 students with me. However, a strange energy 
came over me, and I realized that I was, for some reason, 
not to leave the group. With head bent, I resumed my 
place with the rest of the hikers.<P>

I was very unhappy. It was hard for me to turn away 
from Calvin and continue down the trail with the larger 
group. But my intuition on this was strong, and I rarely 
ignore my intuition.<P>

For a quarter mile or so, I puzzled over my reasons 
for sticking with the group. Several times, students 
tried to engage me in conversation and I cut them off, 
lost in my thoughts.<P>

A short time later, from our vantage point on the trail, 
we were able to see the vision quest site: a bare, 
rocky bluff, a triangular point of rock floating above 
an emerald green forest. My heart did a flip-flop, 
and I felt the site drawing me like a magnet. After 
taking a picture, I reluctantly continued down the 
trail.<P>

After another 15 minutes of hiking, we again took one 
of our many breaks. The students were shouting at each 
other and otherwise creating a ruckus when I heard 
what at first sounded like someone crying for help. 
Instantly alert, I bellowed, &quot;Be quiet! I hear 
someone crying!&quot;<P>

In the quiet, I could hear Calvin singing a song from 
the vision quest site, now a half-mile away. The canyon 
was filled with his presence. Although the song was 
in the Paiute language, its message was readily understandable 
by the heart. It mourned the damage done by those who 
don't care and don't see, and it praised and welcomed 
the spirits that were present and protecting the area.<P>

The effect of Calvin's song on the group was astonishing. 
One of the students near me said in a hushed tone, 
&quot;It's Calvin.&quot; Everyone listened. I stood 
there, entranced by the powerful return of the Native 
American spirit to the land.<P>

The song went on for several minutes. No one moved. 
Even after Calvin stopped singing, no one moved or 
talked; everyone remained transfixed by the moment.<P>

After a few minutes, I gave a hand sign that we should 
move forward. Everyone immediately picked up their 
gear and walked in total silence down the mountain.<P>

For the next two miles, the group made its best time 
of the entire trek, and did so in total silence and 
with no injuries. Our pace was brisk; our thoughts 
were with Calvin, miles away. Spiritually, mentally, 
and physically, we were <I>one</I>.<P>

There was an amazing degree of cooperation between people 
who just before had been bickering. Even after the 
students began once again to talk and sing, their attitudes 
toward each other were changed, and for the better.<P>

In one moment, with one song, a group of individuals 
became a community, a tribe. And in that moment, I 
saw my role in that tribe; I saw the importance of 
being a spiritual receiver, an <I>interpreter </I>and a <I>witness</I>. 
Once again, my intuition had not lead me astray.<P>

<H1><CENTER>Remembering Our Purpose</CENTER>
</H1>
<H4><CENTER><I>an interview with Malidoma Som&eacute;, by Sarah van Gelder</I></CENTER>
</H4>
<BR>
<I>There was a time when all people were indigenous people</I> <I>on some
part of the Earth. But in the last half of the millennium, the migration
of people from region to region and from countryside to city broke many
of the ties we used to have to one another and to the land and water that
supported us.<BR>
<BR>
Those who didn't make that move, the indigenous peoples of the world, can
help us remember what it's like to be connected to the environment and to
each other in a community. This is valuable not because we would necessarily
want to return to the way we used to live, but because facets of that connectedness
can contribute greatly as we create a sustainable way of life.</I><BR>
<BR>
One person who is helping the people of the West better understand what
indigenous cultures have to offer is Malidoma Som&eacute; from the Dagara
tribe in the Burkina Faso region of West Africa. <BR>
<BR>
Malidoma, born in 1956, was taken from his family at the age of five by
missionaries and sent to a Jesuit boarding school. When at the age of 20
he returned to Dano, his village, he was unable to speak his native tongue,
unlearned in the ways of his people, and only his mother recognized him.
He was filled with contempt and anger toward the Jesuits for the treatment
he had received at their hands, and toward his village for handing him away.<BR>
<BR>
Determined to spiritually and emotionally reconnect with his tribe, Malidoma
urged the village elders to allow him to undergo the arduous process of
initiation, a rite of passage usually undertaken at a much earlier age.
<BR>
<BR>
After much consideration, they agreed.<BR>
<BR>
Malidoma passed the six-week long ordeal and was enthusiastically welcomed
back into the tribe. He later went on to the Sorbonne in Paris, where he
earned a doctorate in political science, and Brandeis University in Boston,
where he received a Ph.D. in literature. <BR>
<BR>
He now writes and speaks about the lessons of the indigenous world, and
leads workshops for men, and for men and women, on initiation, ritual, and
healing. <BR>
<BR>
Malidoma has two books coming out this year: <I>Ritual, Power, Healing,
and Community, </I>to be published by Swan-Raven books, and his autobiography,
which will be published by Jeremy Tarcher, Inc. this fall. Malidoma can
be reached at 2298 Cornell Street, Palo Alto CA 94306, 415/493-4073.

<P><B>Sarah:</B><I> From what I've heard of your life as a child, you've had some
very negative experiences at the hands of Europeans.<BR>
<BR>
</I><B>Malidoma: </B>Oh, absolutely...<B><BR>
<BR>
Sarah:</B><I> And yet you don't seem to hold any bitterness now.<BR>
<BR>
</I><B>Malidoma: </B>Well, it would be an exaggeration to say that I don't hold
any bitterness, but the process that my own culture allowed me to go through
released a lot of disastrous anger. <B><BR>
<BR>
Sarah:</B><I> What was it that helped you get over that anger and bitterness? <BR>
<BR>
</I><B>Malidoma: </B>The principal present my culture provided me was a much greater
sense of my own identity, an identity that was not defined, but rather remembered.
It provided me a much greater trust in myself, a greater hope for a future,
and a very grounded walk in my day-to-day life that does not have to wait
for outside affirmation. <BR>
<BR>
My name, Malidoma, means to seek friendship with strangers. My elders told
me, as long as I do what I am destined to do - that is, to be a kind of
linking agent between cultures - I don't have to worry about where to find
the words or where to find the meaning to convey to an audience. <B><BR>
<BR>
Sarah:</B><I> How do you go about being that linking agent?<BR>
<BR>
</I><B>Malidoma: </B>It's essentially connected with what the elders of the indigenous
world dream of: to see cultures from all over come to a point of mutual
understanding and respect so that the wounds created by their experiences
with each other can come to a healing place. <BR>
<BR>
What I'm doing is actually on behalf of those elders. It is inspired by
their spirituality, how they see themselves as humans in nature, how they
view their own social system. <BR>
<BR>
It entails a lot of things: speaking about community medicine, building
communities - starting with the individual's identity and community identity.
Much of my teaching is a simple validation of people's feelings, visions,
and experiences that they cannot find a context for because the context
in which those experiences and visions are happening is systematically post-modern.
For people in the West to see somebody who is from a still-existing indigenous
place, who can validate and explain the realities they've been experiencing
at that very personal level, makes all the difference. <B><BR>
<BR>
Sarah:</B><I> Can you tell me something about the way children are brought up in
your culture?<BR>
<BR>
</I><B>Malidoma: </B>First of all, children are looked upon as mature people who
are in a state of physical adjustment. <BR>
<BR>
Normally, six or 12 weeks into pregnancy there is a ritual that is lead
by a group of advisors who get together with the pregnant woman. The purpose
of the ritual is to inquire about the identity of the soul who is waiting
to be born. Those attending ask the baby: &quot;Who are you? What are you
coming here for? What can we do for you, as people who have already arrived?&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
Normally, the mother takes on a very shrill, thin voice, known as the spirit
voice, to respond to these questions. Based on the answers they get, they
design a name for the baby.<BR>
<BR>
At birth, the newborn's first cry is taken very seriously. It is not considered
a cry; it's looked at as a signal that the new soul has finally arrived
and is crying out to see if there are other souls. And for that reason,
those attending the birth bring in other children who are supposed to scream
back at the crying newborn.<BR>
<BR>
It's very common to find a mother at night who hasn't seen her 8-month-old
baby for the past day. She doesn't know where he is; she just knows he's
somewhere in one of the many houses and she knows he's safe. And, more often
than not, there's another child who stays with that mother while her own
child is gone somewhere. This is a very common practice in the villages;
it gives the child a very broad sense of belonging.<BR>
<BR>
So children grow up very, very aware of what a village is about; everybody
chips in to help raise the child. It's very rare that a child feels isolated
or develops psychological problems; everyone is very aware of where he or
she belongs.<B><BR>
<BR>
Sarah:</B><I> You mentioned earlier the initiation process. Why is this so important?<BR>
<BR>
</I><B>Malidoma: </B>Growth itself makes one forget about who one is. So initiation
is something that is designed to help one remember one's origin and the
very purpose of one's occurrence on this side of reality - that is to say,
why one was born. This is why initiation is especially magical.<BR>
<BR>
So a person who is not initiated is considered a child, no matter how old
that person is, because that person will not be able to recall his or her
purpose. Without initiation, the bridge between youth and adulthood can
never be crossed, and a person's heart is open to anything - to being shot
down by any kind of energy going around. In the village, to not be initiated
is to be a non-person. <B><BR>
<BR>
Sarah:</B><I> Can you say more about the sense of interconnectedness that exists
in your village?<BR>
<BR>
</I><B>Malidoma: </B>When you live as one family for a long time, you come to feel
that there is a kind of connection between individuals that is not just
physical or parental or relational, but is a connection at the level of
soul. <BR>
<BR>
When I go home, things get pointed out to me about myself that I thought
were totally hidden. But the elders, through their divinational process,
can point to things that I did that require me to go through a cleansing
ritual. And this tells me that when people are linked together at that level,
geography is no longer an issue. <BR>
<BR>
What's good about this is that the individual never feels isolated from
the rest of the community. And nobody is higher than anybody else, so there
is no class. <BR>
<BR>
There is something very interesting about a classless society; it's one
that allows itself to be lead by the spirit. There is a greater tendency
to assist those who are older and slower, and it prevents people from feeling
cut off or left out or off track. <BR>
<BR>
One of the things that I have been able to communicate to my elders that
has lead to a great deal of disgust on their part, is the fact that there
are homeless people in this country. To them it is impossible that somebody
could be homeless. They're surprised and appalled because they don't understand
what happens when the meaning of community is not carried out. <B><BR>
<BR>
Sarah:</B><I> What do you think the West can learn from the kind of community you've
been describing?<BR>
<BR>
</I><B>Malidoma: </B>In the West, what I've noticed is that what is called a community
is more a conglomeration of individuals who are so self-centered and isolated
that there is a kind of suspicion of the <I>other, </I>simply because there
isn't enough knowledge of the <I>other</I> to remove that suspicion. So
trust becomes the challenge to actual community.<BR>
<BR>
It is a very tricky thing, because I think that capitalism encourages this
kind of isolation as a good environment for consumerism. And there is a
relationship between a consumer society and these individuals who are defined
by isolation from one another, and private space and private ownership.
<BR>
<BR>
The community I am talking about is one in which respect for the person
is based upon that person's irreplaceable position in the world. To live
with the knowledge that an approved project was the reason for one's birth
commands respect for the sacred. In the absence of initiation as a remembering
and transforming experience, the modern world has created career counseling.
<BR>
<BR>
In the village, the houses are built with entrances that are doorless. That
is the first sign that the people have a very, very different sense of one
another. <BR>
<BR>
When I go home and I want to take a nap, there are some questions as to
what is wrong with me. And if I want to spend a little time by myself, everyone
wonders if something is the matter with me. In the village, everything is
at the same time private and public.<BR>
<BR>
I don't think that there is any need to create in the West the kind of community
that there is in the indigenous world. But there is certainly a need to
come closer together and to learn about each other sufficiently so as to
bridge the gap that separates us.<B><BR>
<BR>
Sarah:</B><I> What you're talking about goes to the very heart of Western culture.
Privacy and freedom are held very dear to many people.<BR>
<BR>
</I><B>Malidoma: </B>The sense of privacy people have in the West is a very lonely
privacy; it is a very frightening privacy. The freedom that goes along with
it is of pretty much the same nature; it is a freedom that is weighty, that
is a burden.<BR>
<BR>
Within the context of real community, privacy and freedom are not lost.
Community provides a greater sense of freedom - a freedom based on a deep
understanding of each individual's purpose. When people lose their soul's
essence, they have to borrow the vision of some ideologist crippled with
separatist visions of freedom.<B><BR>
<BR>
Sarah:</B><I> What do you think it would take to convince Westerners that it's
in their interest to give up some of that privacy and isolation?<BR>
<BR>
</I><B>Malidoma: </B>Progress as it has been unfolding is excruciatingly painful
to the individual; the individual can no longer afford to live by values
such as the systematic accumulation of material goods as the yardstick by
which to measure happiness. <BR>
<BR>
The spiritual thirst that is latent in everybody can never come to a place
of fulfillment unless people begin to think of each other as potential brothers
and sisters. Otherwise, they can never reach on the inside the same level
of wealth that they've reached outside. <BR>
<BR>
In this case, the dying indigenous cultures all over the world have something
to offer; not something that will help them survive, but something at least
that will survive <I>them</I>, because modernism has stabbed mortally every
indigenous culture. <B><BR>
<BR>
Sarah:</B><I> When you look to the future, what do you think are humanity's prospects?<BR>
<BR>
</I><B>Malidoma: </B>It's not good. Compulsive denial, arrogant paternalism, and
hollow pretense have become viral infections endangering the future. The
direction of the world, at least seen from an indigenous point of view,
is like something that is in a direct collision course with catastrophe,
and the more an indigenous person understands this culture, the more he
becomes baffled by the direction it's heading. <BR>
<BR>
But in the middle of that are people who are waking up slowly, people whom
I like to call the new shamans, the new healers, the new energy, the repair
people. <BR>
<BR>
So at a spiritual level, we're witnessing something extremely fascinating.
People are becoming more aware of the values of nature, are becoming more
respectful, more sensitive to the purity of the origin. These people are
those whom I call the modern indigenous persons. And these are the people
who are gradually forming what I've called the new tribal order - that is
to say a brand new unity, a brand new circle of people who are living by
the very values that modernity had to do away with in order to affirm itself.
<BR>
<BR>
As more people join, it's going to build up into an energy field, a force
field strong enough to act as an antibiotic, a force field capable of sustaining
a much brighter, healthier situation in the future. <BR>
<BR>
I think that this last decade of the Twentieth Century is very pivotal in
that sense. And I'm really fortunate, probably, to be in the midst of it.

<H2><CENTER><A NAME="Inititation"></A>INITIATION: REMEMBERING ONE'S PURPOSE</CENTER>
</H2>
<P><CENTER><I>By Malidoma Som&eacute;</I></CENTER>
<P><I></I>Initiation processes vary from culture to culture. For the Dagara,
initiation is intended to help young people on the verge of adulthood to
&quot;remember&quot; their purpose on Earth.<BR>
<BR>
Initiation is a six-week long journey into the magical world. It begins
when families walk their young ones to the outskirts of the village and
surrender them to the wilderness after stripping them of their clothes.
The young ones walk into the bush naked and scared, a condition necessary
for the ritual remembering. Throughout the ordeal there is no food except
that which can be found in the bush.<BR>
<BR>
I was told to sit in front of a tree and to gaze at it. The hot tropical
sun broiled me, ants bit me, and I was blinded by sweat. Every so often,
an elder would come and check on me. The experience was painful and boring,
but it all culminated in a vision in which the tree disappeared and I saw
a woman emerge from it. She was familiar as a mother or some sacred caretaker.
Whoever she was, the reunion was very emotional, and the experience ended
with me hugging that tree and weeping.<BR>
<BR>
I could invoke Western psychology to explain the whole experience away,
including the reaction of satisfaction of the elders, but I won't because
my respect for trees and nature began after this experience, the first of
a series of magical journeys.<BR>
<BR>
What is important is that exercises like this weakened my resistance to
the dream world and the supernatural to the point where I was able to consciously
journey into an underworld that is only acceptable in the West as a fairy
tale. But the experience itself registered in my own consciousness as a
disappearance to my own physicality. In other words, in the underworld one
has a shape, but that shape is no longer available to the physical sight.
By the time one gets back to the world, the body registers things unlike
before.<BR>
<BR>
The underworld is the place where one encounters one's own identity prior
to being born into a community of humans. It is the ideal place for remembering
one's energetic identity as well as one's life project. <BR>
<BR>
Also, one returns from the underworld with something which serves as the
first medicine, a kind of reference book that you return to whenever you
feel the need to refresh your memory of what you are doing here on Earth.
How it's made accessible to the initiate is part of a tribal secret held
tightly by elders. But a cave in a mountain can easily become a gateway.<BR>
<BR>
Coming out of the underworld alive ends the initiation process. You return
to where you had been stripped of your clothes six weeks earlier, and your
family and the whole village is there waiting for you. <BR>
<BR>
The return to the village is like returning to the human world. It's warm,
comforting, loving, and relaxing. Everybody knows that you <I>know</I>,
and so you dance your knowledge in front of the whole village and celebrate
with your loved ones the recovery of your memory.<BR>

<H1><CENTER>Sharing Strength</CENTER>
</H1>
<H4><CENTER><I>An interview with Linda Stout and George Friday by Sarah
van Gelder</I></CENTER>
</H4>
<BR>
<I>Interconnectedness strengthens both individuals and groups. Conversely,
when people are divided they often vent their frustration at those who share
their plight. In the South, poor blacks and poor whites have traditionally
distrusted and demeaned each other, and both groups have stayed poor and
disempowered. <BR>
<BR>
Linda Stout founded the Piedmont Peace Project in 1984, determined to do
what popular wisdom said couldn't be done: work with poor people of both
races in the same organization. George Friday joined the staff as an organizer
and fundraiser in 1990.<BR>
<BR>
Piedmont Peace Project now has a multi-racial staff of six - all of whom
come from low-income backgrounds - 500 regular members, and as many as 3,000
volunteers. The Piedmont Peace Project can be reached at 406 Jackson Park
Road, Kannapolis NC 28083, 704/938-5090.<BR>
<BR>
</I><B>Sarah: </B><I>What made you decide to work with both blacks and whites,
rather than organizing one group or the other?</I><B><BR>
<BR>
Linda: </B>We started from the very beginning with the idea of building
multi-racially because we felt we couldn't win unless we built a broad,
connected group of people to work on these issues. And it's made a huge
difference, both in breaking down stereotypes that we've grown up with about
each other, and in making us more effective.<B><BR>
<BR>
George: </B>And what's been gained is that folks who 10 or 15 years ago
would discount change as a movement that included them now see that they
can have power and really effect change. So we now have numbers of people
who are participating in creating policy at a local level, and a state and
national level.<BR>
<BR>
As these people gain momentum, they take on bigger risks and bigger campaigns
and work harder. And they not only include themselves in the picture, they
also include their children and grandchildren. <B><BR>
<BR>
Linda: </B>We've been taught to hate each other; we've been taught to think
this and that about each other, and as long as we believe that, someone
else has the power, not us. As soon as people come into the organization,
we start talking about not only race, but also issues of classism and sexism
and homophobia. That's often hard and scary, but you know I think a lot
of people are surprised at how few people have dropped out because of that.<B><BR>
<BR>
Sarah: </B><I>It sounds as though dealing with these issues would complicate
your organizing effort.</I><B><BR>
<BR>
George: </B>Often people ask, &quot;Isn't it really hard to do your work
and have to deal with so many issues that feel really hard or personal?&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
It does affect the ways we do our work, because it means that our organizing
efforts take longer. For example, it took four months for folks in Midway
to feel OK about going down and demanding garbage service <I>[see sidebar
on page 37]</I>. It took that long, not just because someone had to get
up the gumption to do it, but because they had to face years of hearing
that they're not good enough, not smart enough, or that they don't deserve
better treatment.<BR>
<BR>
When we do organizing in our communities, we have to face those demons to
get to the power that we need. So all our work has to have incorporated
looking at these hard emotional issues, and talking about them, and giving
each other support.<B><BR>
<BR>
Linda:</B> I often talk to people in the community about my own experience
of feeling like I'm not smart and feeling ashamed because I grew up poor.
Talking about that gives people permission to then begin to identify that
for themselves.<B><BR>
<BR>
George: </B>You're taught as a low-income person or a person of color that
you can get respect or you can accomplish something if you just change:
if you dress more white or sound more white and more middle class. <BR>
<BR>
For many people, turning themselves inside out to appear in a way that's
not true to their nature and true to their soul feels horrible.<B><BR>
<BR>
Sarah</B>: <I>What's it like for the two of you personally to work with
these issues?</I><B><BR>
<BR>
Linda: </B>It's given me a way of getting in touch with who I am and my
own power and strength. I've been able to deal in a positive way with a
lot of my own anger at having grown up in poverty and in difficult circumstances.
<BR>
<BR>
Plus, I have this whole group of people who totally know what it feels like
and what I'm struggling with, and I <I>do </I>think we are more connected
than a lot of regular staffs. I think we see each other very much as a family
that extends to the membership. <BR>
<BR>
Those connections are especially valuable because as a white person, taking
these kinds of stands in our kind of community often means you're ostracized
from your own family, or you can't go to your church. So this group has
given me a real family.<B><BR>
<BR>
George: </B>I just wanted to add how different it is for whites who are
involved than it is for blacks, because as a black person, if I stand up
for any kind of change, that's always seen as good. From when I was a little
girl, and I did political type stuff in grammar school, to growing up, I
always got kudos from my family or my church community or even from some
of the people in my school for trying to make change happen. <BR>
<BR>
You were never seen as a trouble-maker until you linked up with white folks
- then you have more of a chance of having an impact, more of a chance of
having power, so that's when the pressure comes on. <BR>
<BR>
My work with Piedmont Peace Project has felt good on a personal level because
I have permission to really be who I am, and all the skills that I bring
and all the knowledge that I have is welcome. Basically, who I bring here
is valued.<BR>
<BR>
And the strong message that people get when they see us act in the community
is that this woman is who she's always been, and she's consistently speaking
in her own voice from her own culture and community. <B><BR>
<BR>
Sarah:</B> <I>So far, we've been talking about the work you do with low-income
people. But you also work with peace and environmental groups that are not
rooted in low-income communities. Why is that?</I><B><BR>
<BR>
George: </B>Even though it's really empowering to work with other low-income
people, it's really clear that we can't win unless we also work with middle-class
people. Because of history, because of resources, sometimes because of technical
expertise, we know that we can't make the core changes we want to make on
our own. <B><BR>
<BR>
Linda:</B> And we feel the same way about the issues - that you can't win
on issues by just working on them locally, and you can't win just by working
on one nationally. It's all connected, and you've got to work on all of
them together. <BR>
<BR>
I think it's easier for low-income people to get those connections because
they're constantly affected. They've thought about the reasons why so many
people don't have housing or health care when there are clearly major resources
in this country. <B><BR>
<BR>
George: </B>Also, doing work that's more global helps folks to see that
what happens in this country is not isolated. Because of the way that poor
people are powerless and separated, they often feel that the problems they
face are just theirs.<BR>
<BR>
We talk to Bolivian workers and to women who work in <I>maquiladoras </I>in
Mexico, and we talk about the people in detention in South Africa - because
of all that, people know that what's going on in the South is also global.
<BR>
<BR>
We'll often talk about being the Third World in America and about being
connected with poor people in other parts of the world; our treatment and
oppression are very similar. And that helps people here, because they don't
feel isolated any more. <B><BR>
<BR>
Linda: </B>Why don't you give the example of Mona and the Mexicans.<B><BR>
<BR>
George: </B>Oh yeah! A year or so ago, the Procter-Silex plant near here
was shutting down, putting 800 workers - mostly women - on the street. One
of the stories that was going around was that Mexican workers were taking
these people's jobs, and there was a lot of anger about that.<BR>
<BR>
One woman, Mona, said she was so angry that when she saw a Mexican person
on the street, she wanted to run him down with her truck, because &quot;they're
taking our jobs.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
We talked to people about the reality: people working in a <I>maquiladora
</I>get 5 dollars a day, and they have no health and safety benefits. <BR>
<BR>
After working with the project, that same woman, Mona, said, &quot;These
people are just like us; they're trying to feed their kids just like I'm
trying to feed my kids. And what we have to do is join together as working
people so companies stop treating us like this.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
And that's part of what happens when you make those global connections.<BR>

<H1><CENTER>A Chance For Peace</CENTER>
</H1>
<H4><CENTER><I>by Ivanka Vana Jakic</I></CENTER>
</H4>
<BR>
<I>All over the world, wars are being fought between one religion's followers
and another's. That's nothing new, but vivid images of the atrocities carried
out in the name of religion now reach the rest of the world almost as they
happen. Many people are finding it increasingly difficult to stand by and
do nothing. <BR>
<BR>
The fact that much of the world's conflict is rooted in long-standing ethnic
or racial divisions makes it that much harder to find a solution. But the
religious roots of the conflicts also may provide an opening to peace.<BR>
<BR>
Ivanka Vana Jakic, a Yugoslavian-born peace activist, is working with UN
representatives, religious leaders, and government officials in an attempt
to designate some of the world's holiest sites as internationally recognized
zones of peace. The world's religious leaders should be heading up the search
for peaceful solutions to conflict, she says.<BR>
<BR>
Vana is half Serbian, half Croatian, and her brother-in-law is a Bosnian
Muslim. She studied Tibetan Buddhism for many years, and has worked to preserve
Tibetan culture. But she downplays her own ethnic and religious roots, saying
she is above all a humanitarian. <BR>
<BR>
More recently, Vana has broadened her peace effort, which began in former
Yugoslavia. Today, alongside religious and secular leaders, she is working
on designating sites in Seattle as zones of peace as a first step in resolving
ethnic and religious conflicts in that city.<BR>
<BR>
Vana invited us to her small room in a suburban home south of Seattle to
tell us her story.</I> <BR>
<BR>
My work as a peace missionary began in the spring of 1989, when after many
years of studying and working abroad, I returned to my family in Zagreb,
Croatia, for an extended stay. While there, I visited Medjugorje, a small
and remote pilgrimage site in the south of Bosnia and Herzegovina. <BR>
<BR>
I'd never gone to a Christian holy place before, and I was deeply moved
by thousands of people streaming in from neighboring countries and from
as far away as Australia, Japan, and China. Slowly climbing up the rocky
goats path towards one of the two main pilgrimage sites, I heard groups
of pilgrims saying their prayers in at least seven different languages.
As they did not have a common language, they communicated with each other
through love and kindness, with smiles. In the course of the past 12 years,
about 15 million people came there in search of peace. <BR>
<BR>
It was this experience in Medjugorje that inspired me to initiate the transnational
peace project that I now coordinate. 
<H4><BR>
PEACE FOR MEDJUGORJE</H4>
My initial concern in that spring of 1989 was only the protection of Medjugorje.
I returned to the US and gathered letters of support for the idea that Medjugorje
should be protected as a zone of peace. It was very clear to me that I would
need to seek support first from abroad before the authorities inside Bosnia
and Herzegovina would recognize the value of the idea. <BR>
<BR>
In the summer of 1990, I went to Sarajevo to ask the local religious leaders
to support the protection of Medjugorje. <BR>
<BR>
I'll never forget my encounter with Mr. Bristic, the former president of
the Islamic Community of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Fifteen minutes into our
conversation, he said: &quot;Please come to the window. Look at the mosque
in front of us. Next to it is a Serbian Orthodox church, to our left is
a synagogue, and behind us the Monastery of St. Anthony. You are nowhere
more welcome than in Sarajevo! We are a small United Nations, and we need
peace above all.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Standing by the door of the <I>Meshihat</I>, ready to leave, I said, &quot;Today,
Medjugorje, tomorrow, Mecca.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
The same morning, I had an appointment with the president of Bosnia and
Herzegovina's Jewish organization, Mr.<B> </B>I. Ceresnjes. During our talk,
he took out of his briefcase a yellow badge of the Star of David that his
grandmother was forced to wear during the Nazi occupation. He explained
that he is one of the few survivors of his large family - the others died
in Auschwitz. <BR>
<BR>
The Jews in Bosnia and Herzegovina, &quot;are a handful of people, anonymously
threatened with extinction,&quot; he said. They were anxious about the safety
of their monumental synagogue and their families. Despite all of this, or,
perhaps because of it, Mr. Ceresnjes agreed to support the designation of
Medjugorje as a national zone of peace.<BR>
<BR>
And again, as I was parting from him I said, &quot;Today, Medjugorje, tomorrow,
some of the Jewish holy sites in Jerusalem.&quot; 
<H4><BR>
PEACE FOR ALL </H4>
As I left, I was very much under the weight of this whole situation; Mr.
Ceresnjes' cry for help had become mine. I thought, &quot;why wait for tomorrow;
why not today? All holy places in the world should become zones of peace!&quot;<BR>
<BR>
The idea was simple and splendid, yet overwhelming and unrealistic. I decided
to seek verification of the expanded idea from those I trusted most - my
spiritual guides. This is how my journey back to India began. <BR>
<BR>
I was in India for three years in the early '70s. I met Mother Teresa of
Calcutta and been inspired and guided by the Dalai Lama while I was studying
and working with Tibetan refugees in the Himalayas. <BR>
<BR>
Beginning in November 1990, I covered 10,000 kilometers in four months,
and all along the way I talked about zones of peace with leaders of the
southern Buddhists, Hindus, Jains, Christians, and Muslims. The latter part
of the trip, I was accompanied by a fellow peace missionary from Zagreb,
Drago Smalcelj. We traveled in overcrowded second-class trains and on buses
with dismantled seats and broken windows. We slept in railway stations or
in muddy tourist camps and bought our food at hygienically suspicious food
stands. <BR>
<BR>
In December of 1990, His Holiness the Dalai Lama granted me a 45-minute
audience, during which time he gave the project his blessings and asked
me &quot;to give top priority to the peace project.&quot; He wrote a letter
of support that opened doors all over.<BR>
<BR>
Next, during a week in Calcutta, Mother Teresa became our inspiration, counselor,
and a loving and caring mother. She greeted us in our own language, &quot;Are
you hungry? Do you have a place to sleep? How about money for transportation?&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
She endorsed the spiritual aspect of the project, calling for &quot;centers
of prayers for peace.&quot; Her advice was, &quot;Begin small, with one
place. Be modest! Create peace in your own hearts, your families, your environment,
and then attempt to spread it elsewhere.&quot; She spoke of her own beginnings,
how at first she took care of just one leper. &quot;Now I have 120,000,&quot;
she said.<BR>
<BR>
The morning we left her Missionaries of Charity, we got a message that the
Gulf War had begun. Three-and-a-half million beggars, who are born, live
and die in the streets of Calcutta, were swept by a wave of fear; rumors
flew about unsheltered exposure to radioactive fall-out downwind of a possible
nuclear attack on Iraq. <BR>
<BR>
As we became immersed in the total chaos, I became acutely aware of the
tremendous energy required for these emotions of fear, anger, hatred and
aggression. I realized then that the energy created by war could eventually
be turned against war itself. <BR>
<BR>
Because of the outbreak of the Gulf War, our talks with followers of the
Indian Islamic orders proved to be especially thought-provoking. My question
was, &quot;If Mecca and other Muslim sacred sites were declared zones of
peace, and your religious rights and codes were protected and respected
internationally, would you still have holy wars?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Invariably, the answer was, &quot;One of the reasons we have holy wars is
to defend our sacred places.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
I invited the Muslims to join me in an alternative - a &quot;holy peace&quot;
and, in most instances, they offered whole-hearted support.<BR>
<BR>
In February, I attended the Second International Conference on Peace and
Non-Violent Action organized by ANUVIBHA, the Jains' Transnational Center
for Peace and Non-Violence, in Rajsamand, India. The 125 delegates, who
came from 21 countries, adopted a resolution we promoted calling for a petition
to be sent to UNESCO and the United Nations asking for a new international
convention through which every nation or country could declare as international
zones of peace their holy places and places of historic and cultural importance.
The resolution also called for an appeal asking religious leaders to convene
a world peace conference aimed at ending wars fought in the name of religion.<BR>
<BR>
I co-signed both the petitions called for in the resolution and delivered
them, on the 8th of March, 1991, to representatives of the UN and UNESCO
in New Delhi. <BR>
<BR>
I went on to the Vatican, where I had a brief but memorable audience with
Pope John Paul II, who understood my plea for protection of the world's
sacred heritage.
<H4><BR>
THE FIRST ZONES OF PEACE</H4>
When I returned to Zagreb, Slovenia and Serbia were at war; the political
climate in Croatia was traumatic. Back in Medjugorje, I was challenged again,
&quot;Why wait for an international convention? It may take years. Why not
turn the fear of the pre-war situation into an effort for peace by declaring
Medjugorje as a zone of peace, right now, on a national level?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
That inspiration to take immediate action changed my life. That is why I
believe that the transformative powers of love and compassion, transcendent
knowledge, and wisdom are always present in holy places and accessible to
open-hearted and open-minded individuals. Holy places cannot &quot;belong&quot;
to any one particular culture or time. They are our common sacred heritage.<BR>
<BR>
From Medjugorje, Drago and I went to Sarajevo, and we immediately met with
Mr. Alija Izetbegovic, the president of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
He said not only the sacred sites, but the whole of Bosnia and Herz-egovina
should become a zone of peace, and become to the Balkans what Switzerland
is for Europe.<BR>
<BR>
The real tragedy and a great loss for the world is that Bosnia and Herzegovina
could have served as a living example of how different ethnic and religious
groups can get along well on the same soil for hundreds of years. And that
is what President Izetbegovic conveyed in his letter of support:<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Creating zones of peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina would be of utmost
importance; for the rich cultural and spiritual heritage of this republic
reflects the religious and ethnic diversity of its population. I myself,
as many other peace-loving individuals, give full support to this noble
idea launched by these dedicated missionaries.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
And within four weeks, on the 17th of September, 1991, we were able to put
together in Sarajevo the first meeting ever of the top leaders of the Muslims,
the Catholics, the Serbian Orthodox Church, the Jews, and the government
of Bosnia and Herzegovina. It was during that meeting that we declared the
first eight sacred sites as national zones of peace - two from each of the
four religions; among them were Medjugorje and the synagogue and mosque
in Sarajevo. <BR>
<BR>
It was also agreed that teams of specialists in international, civil, and
holy laws would draft new legislation on the basis of which all sacred sites
could be declared zones of peace, and that the new law would attempt to
bring closer the law of God and the law of man. <BR>
<BR>
(In the American context, for example, if members of the Kuiu Thlingit nation
were to request that their sacred site in southeast Alaska be declared a
zone of peace, their holy law would have to be understood first, in order
to protect their constitutional right to free exercise of religion.)<BR>
<BR>
The socialist pre-war government and the major religious leaders of Bosnia
and Herzegovina agreed to do this! The tragic interference of civil war
in this process of democratization is a separate issue.<BR>
<BR>
In October 1991, we went to UNESCO in Paris at the invitation of Dr. Janusz
Symonides, UNESCO director of the Division for Human Rights and Peace. We
agreed that I would coordinate the drafting of the new international convention
on zones of peace and find a country that is a member of the UN willing
to present it in the near future to the UNESCO General Assembly.<B> </B><BR>
<BR>
I don't know yet which country will present the new convention; perhaps
India, where the idea first received wide-spread support, or maybe the United
States.<BR>
<BR>
What is exciting at this moment is that I have just received an invitation
from UNESCO asking me to speak at a seminar it is sponsoring on the role
of churches in the creation of a culture of peace. Specifically, they asked
me to talk both about zones of peace and about another important idea I've
been promoting: the establishment of national and international religious
round tables. 
<H4><BR>
A MISSED OPPORTUNITY FOR PEACE</H4>
I need to tell you what has happened in the meantime. Some of the eight
places in Bosnia and Herzegovina that were declared as national zones of
peace have been damaged, desecrated, or destroyed. <BR>
<BR>
If these eight sites had been <I>internationally </I>recognized zones of
peace, one might speculate that the United Nations peacekeeping forces would
have had a legitimate right to go there at the first sign of aggression
and use these zones as centers for humanitarian relief and peace negotiations.
<BR>
<BR>
That could have been done with the prior consent of the government and the
respective religious leaders; their presence would not have been considered
an interference in the internal affairs of another country, but rather,
an expected intervention based on an international convention ratified by
the country in question. <BR>
<BR>
But instead of building on the zones of peace concept, or using other methods
to draw on the non-violent power of public opinion, the authorities have
allowed the emergence of a new world disorder. <BR>
<BR>
As a result, Bosnia and Herzegovina will be a part of the conscience of
the entire world. If we fail to address the issue of &quot;ethnic cleansing&quot;
today, we will not be able to solve the conflicts in other countries tomorrow.
<BR>
<BR>
And that is a very serious matter. It shows how weak we are - how weak the
world is, despite all of the military and nuclear arsenals that have crippled
our abilities to seek and find peace within our own minds.<BR>
<BR>
There is a great concern that the conflict in Bosnia and Herzegovina may
inflame other countries in the Balkans. Hatred and war are contagious; they're
like a disease. It is a false belief that we can isolate ourselves and survive
as self-sufficient world systems. If we do not realize our fundamental oneness
as a big human family in one home, our planet, in no time, will become an
empty house. <BR>
<BR>
So this is not only an issue of declaring certain special areas as zones
of peace. This is also a process by which we, as humanity, can discover
our own inner power - the power of peace, the power to control our lives
from within our hearts, families, and communities, and the power to take
responsibility for what is happening to us. <BR>
<BR>
It is time to use our resources to heal ourselves and our abused environment,
and to create the beautiful world that is meant to be. We still have a moment
or so to make that choice.<BR>

<H1><CENTER>Planetary Networking For Kids</CENTER>
</H1>
<H4><CENTER><I>by Matt Holland</I></CENTER>
</H4>
<BR>
<I>Computer networks are one tangible form of interconnectedness. We are
only just beginning to tap into the potentials presented by a technology
that makes it easy for people to work together and share their thoughts
and experiences even when they are a great distance apart. I*EARN is one
network that is pushing the edges of this technology, not by adding new
bells and whistles, but by linking up high school students and teachers
in over 20 countries who want to work together to make the world a better
place.</I><BR>
<BR>
What if Israeli and Arab children went to school together, helped each other
with homework, shared first-date horror stories - wouldn't a peaceful Middle
East be easier to shape? <BR>
<BR>
And if American voters had shared assignments with Soviet classmates when
they were in high school, would they have been as ready to agree with Ronald
Reagan's &quot;Evil Empire&quot; label?<BR>
<BR>
Probably not, if Slava Vaynshteyn and Thandi Emdon are any guide. Both are
students at Brighton High School in Rochester, NY, but they're also pioneers
of a new kind of school - one whose campus reaches around the globe and
yet exists in no single place.<BR>
<BR>
When Slava and Thandi entered Russian language class at Brighton High in
1988, they also became part of the New York State/Moscow School Telecom
Project. For the next four years, they learned not just about the Russian
language, but about Russians, discussing life with students at Moscow School
#67 via electronic mail and video-telephone. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;It's difficult to remember that every time we make a (video-phone)
call or send a poetry translation across the e-mail we are communicating
with a country that was considered our enemy only five years ago,&quot;
Slava wrote after completing his Russian courses last year. &quot;So most
importantly, I am glad to be part of the new process of friendships.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
The project, conceived, created, and funded by American textile magnate
Peter Copen, was the first time anyone had joined US and Russian classrooms.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;It was when they were still the 'Evil Empire',&quot; says Ed Gragert,
program manager for the newly expanded network. &quot;A lot of nay-sayers
said it couldn't be done at that point.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
They took a shot at it anyway - and fired off a revolution. Meeting via
computer modem and electronic bulletin board, thousands of kids in 21 countries
are now working together to measure ozone depletion, fight deforestation,
and compare cultures. They're learning about the world and working to better
it at the same time.
<H4><BR>
A LEARNING NETWORK</H4>
The Copen Foundation expanded its New York/Moscow project in 1991, creating
the International Education and Resource Network, or I*EARN. Nearly 300
schools in 21 countries are linked, from Argentina to Australia, Nicaragua
to the Netherlands. Beyond trading languages and customs, the network is
a powerful tool for teaching science, history, and other subjects. For instance,
Thandi wrote that the New York/Moscow pilot project gave her a better grasp
of world politics:<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Another aspect of the electronic mail that I found to be extremely
interesting was that we have learned directly from you, our Soviet peers,
how the Soviet people felt during the many changes that have been occurring
in our world,&quot; she wrote. &quot;Above all, your first-hand accounts
of the coup and its aftermath gave us insight into the actions and feelings
of those who participated in the defense of their new and precious democracy.
The vivid descriptions you sent made the whole event real to us, more so
than the 15 minutes on the news!&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Maybe it's overly optimistic on our part,&quot; Ed says, &quot;but
we really feel that projects like this, that started shortly before the
change, had an impact on that change.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
The I*EARN network is all about fomenting change. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Looking at the global issues facing all of us,&quot; Ed says, &quot;whether
they be environmental, health, hunger, maldistribution of wealth, population
issues, or recognizing that our generation is leaving one hell of a mess
for the next generation to deal with, we were looking at ways to empower
that generation to start working on these problems.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
The goal of I*EARN is straightforward: &quot;to enable students to make
a meaningful contribution to the planet.&quot; Its tools are fairly simple;
any type of personal computer can access the network with the addition of
a $70 modem. For most K-12 schools in the United States, that means little
or no expense for hardware. The network offers training for teachers on
how to use the system and how to integrate it into the curriculum. <BR>
<BR>
Once logged on, students and teachers can choose from a variety of electronic
conferences: the various teachers' conferences are used to share new curriculum
ideas, while the &quot;youth&quot; teleconferences give students across
the world a chance to tell each other about their lives.<BR>
<BR>
The &quot;ideas&quot; teleconference lists suggestions for new cooperative
projects between schools. Participants explore history, social studies,
science, and more. A class in Finland compared wedding customs with a group
in the US; a Seattle high school with many Asian immigrant students is collaborating
with a school in Beijing, to find better English-teaching methods.
<H4><BR>
AN EMPOWERMENT NETWORK</H4>
Ed estimates that it only costs a school about $300 a year to use the network
to the fullest. That includes telephone bills for on-line time and for use
of the video-phones I*EARN makes available, and user fees for auxiliary
networks like PeaceNet and EcoNet.<BR>
<BR>
The investment buys real-world results: 
<UL>
  <LI>Schools in Moscow, Belgium, and New York State collaborated with the
New York State Bar Association and the Soviet Academy of Sciences to produce
an international treaty on global deforestation. Science lessons on the
environment are common nowadays, but few students travel to the Hague, Netherlands,
and present their class project to the World Court as these students did.<BR>
<BR>
  <LI>A team of Russian and American students researched and published a
guide for setting up joint business ventures in the former Soviet Union,
the first document of its kind. A group of international businesspeople
at New York's World Trade Center saw the booklet and asked for copies to
use in their work.<BR>
<BR>
  <LI>Led by an Australian school, a group of students is collecting data
on ultraviolet radiation levels, an indicator of the health of the ozone
layer. The readings will be compiled into a monthly newsletter on ozone
layer depletion.<BR>
<BR>
  <LI>Through the network, students spread word of a secret Cold-War nuclear
accident in the former USSR.<BR>
<BR>
  <LI>Students on the I*EARN Network raised money to buy simple rope-and-wheel
pumps for rural wells in Nicaragua, which make disease-spreading water buckets
unnecessary. The Nicaraguan Clean Water Project now includes schools across
the PLANET system <I>[see sidebar]</I>.
</UL>
<H4><BR>
LIVING EDUCATION</H4>
&quot;When a student works on a humanitarian, outcome-based project, the
otherwise mundane textbook exercises spring to life,&quot; reads a network
booklet. &quot;Instead of memorizing the fact that litmus paper turns red
in acidic fluid, and blue in a basic solution, a student can measure the
acid content in her local rain water. When told that her data will become
part of an international student study, her mastery of the techniques becomes
more urgent.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
And beyond making learning more exciting, the network transforms the education
process itself.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;It empowers people to become active learners,&quot; Ed says. &quot;So
the teacher is no longer the fount of all wisdom, because the students can
go directly to the source.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Because the network has grown faster than anticipated, I*EARN is not actively
seeking new US members. However, I*EARN would like to hear from schools
anywhere that have existing relationships with either schools or humanitarian
projects in another country.<BR>

<H1><CENTER>Hip-hoppers &amp; Do-gooders</CENTER>
</H1>
<H3><CENTER></CENTER>
</H3>
<H4><CENTER><I>by Upski Wimsatt</I></CENTER>
</H4>
<BR>
<I>Graffiti artist and student Upski Wimsatt moves easily 
between his own middle-class, white culture and the 
culture of the black urban ghetto. The following exercise 
in, as Upski puts it, &quot;stereo publication,&quot; 
provides some foundation for building inter-group understanding.</I><P>

I write this essay in two worlds. One world is <I>IN CONTEXT,</I> 
a magazine of humane sustainable culture, read mostly 
by - I use the term loosely - white do-gooders. The 
other world is <I>Fly Paper</I>, an underground hip-hop magazine 
read mostly by - again I'm speaking loosely - black 
rappers, graffiti writers, and their friends. These 
are my two worlds.<P>

I am like any other do-gooder at Oberlin College, my 
nice white college in Ohio, but since I am a hip-hopper, 
I have my hip-hop ways. Where my friends at college 
write articles in the school paper and on bathroom 
stalls in the library, I write mine with spray paint 
on real walls, in rap magazines, and in underground 
hip-hop papers. Where my friends distribute their publications 
to campuses and coffee houses, I distribute mine on 
busses and trains. Where my friends tutor &quot;economically 
and racially disadvantaged children,&quot; I chill 
with the shorties who live on my street. Where my friends 
deliver speeches at college rallies, I save mine for 
city-wide hip-hop meetings. Where my friends write 
position papers about the black ghetto, I go there 
as a matter of course. Living in two worlds gives me 
more options as a do-gooder.<P>

When I entered the world of black hip-hoppers, I didn't 
think I'd be doing anybody any good. I was 11 years 
old and liked to breakdance. My school was predominantly 
black so I became black too. In time, I too could dance, 
fight, argue, and &quot;talk&quot; to girls. I saw 
what was unpleasant about white people, and I began 
not to behave like one.<P>

I am like any other hip-hopper in Chicago, but since 
I am an educated white boy, I have my educated white 
boy ways. Where my homeys write their names in alleyways 
and bust rhymes at local hip-hop joints, I bust my 
pieces in national publications. Where my homeys purchase 
status symbols to prove they ain't poor, I pinch pennies. 
Where my homeys strive to get that degree, I study 
whatever fascinates me. Where my homeys talk abstractly 
about the white man, I live with the beast in its natural 
habitat. Where my homeys fall back on clich&eacute;s, 
I push forward into original shit. Living in two worlds 
gives me more options as a hip-hopper.<P>

When I got into reading, I didn't think I'd be boosting 
my hip-hop career. I was a curious 14-year-old. My 
parents were intellectual so I became intellectual 
too. In time, I, too, could analyze, research, argue, 
and &quot;talk&quot; to powerful men. I learned what 
was unpleasant about juvenile delinquents and I began 
not to behave like one.<P>

I live in two separate worlds with two separate sets 
of possibilities. My own peace of mind requires me 
to integrate them. I integrate white friends into the 
black world. I integrate black friends into the white.<P>

True, many black hip-hoppers already know more than 
I will ever know about whitebread culture, straight 
laced conformity and the American Dream. It's because 
they spend more time working, watching TV, and worrying 
about what whites think than I do. A few even excel 
academically! But they lack an ease with hard-core 
whiteness. They distrust our nerdy manner, and shun 
the treasures of Western civilization (the art, music, 
language, thought, and science), which whites have 
traditionally used to humiliate blacks, but which blacks 
can now use to get even (without acting white or kissing 
ass). It takes being around powerful whites to notice 
how truly unimpressive they are.<P>

And true, many white college do-gooders already know 
more than I will ever know about Third World history, 
literature, and the mechanics of oppression. It's because 
they spend more time in multi-cultural studies classes 
and community service programs than I do. A few can 
even dance! What they lack is a black social sense, 
which to me is the best part. They misread the confrontational 
manner, the sense of irony and playfulness, and don't 
grasp the subtle body language which puts black people 
at ease (just as certain blacks are able to put us 
at ease while others make us feel tense). It takes 
being around blacks who haven't hung around whites 
enough to know how to act.<P>

The hip-hoppers may be ingenious, but the world at large 
may never know it. They quibble and fight among themselves, 
but they can't seriously address the white power structure. 
What a waste of energy it is. They feel hip-hop is 
their only option in life. The ones who make it learn 
to do their hustlin' in corporate America.<P>

The do-gooders may be smart too, but they come a dime 
a dorm-full. They preach, bicker, and whine among themselves, 
but they can't seriously communicate with anyone outside 
of their own. What a waste of energy it is. They do 
not feel able to overcome their frustrating paralysis. 
The ones who make it unlearn what they learned in college.<P>

Living in more than one world isn't for everyone, but 
here are some hints for anyone who actually wants to 
do it.<P>

For white do-gooders, the challenge is to explore the 
black ghetto (which exists of course because of white 
flight). Most ghettos are a lot more pleasant and normal 
than they appear to be on television, and it is actually 
possible to live and raise a white family in a calm, 
working class section of the ghetto. If you have children, 
white do-gooder, give them some nice ghetto exposure, 
the earlier on in life the better. Start by sending 
them to some kind of class or day camp that happens 
to be in a ghetto. Friendships will develop, and from 
these, other commitments.<P>

Black hip-hopper, your challenge is to get inside the 
ivory tower of white civilization (which stems, of 
course, from black civilization). Make the library 
your second home. Read a wide range of challenging 
material, but make it fun for yourself. Read aloud 
to hear the music and cadence in the language. Consider 
the writer's insights and test them critically against 
your everyday experience.<P>

Read, black hip-hopper, until you can whip the white 
people at their own game. Earn a scholarship to college 
and graduate school. Find ways, now and then, to be 
the only black person in with a bunch of whites. Surround 
yourself with those who can support your dreams or 
teach you something valuable. Don't let the arrogant, 
patronizing motherfuckers intimidate you. They are 
human too after all, so just have fun with them.<P>

<H1><CENTER>Awakening The Ecological Unconscious</CENTER>
</H1>
<H4><CENTER><I>by Theodore Roszak</I></CENTER>
</H4>
<BR>
<I>Vice President Al Gore, in his book, </I>Earth in the Balance, <I>is
among those who compare our culture's inability to effectively grapple with
our ecological crisis to a dysfunctional family. In both cases one finds
symptoms of denial, failure to take responsibility for damage caused, and
a sense of inertia that interferes with meaningful change. But where can
a dysfunctional culture go for a cure? <BR>
<BR>
Theodore Roszak's call for a new synthesis of psychology, cosmology, and
ecology may be part of the answer. &quot;We need a new discipline that sees
the needs of the planet and the person as a continuum and that can help
us reconnect with the truth that lies in our communion with the rest of
creation,&quot; he writes in </I>The Voice of the Earth <I>(Simon and Schuster,
soon to be released as a Touchstone paperback).<BR>
<BR>
Theodore Roszak's book has sparked an interest among many in related fields
in the potential for a new discipline based on these principles. He has
dubbed this discipline &quot;ecopsychology,&quot; and he is asking those
interested in integrating the expertise of the environmentalist with the
sensibility of the therapist to write to him at the History Department,
California State University, Hayward CA 94542.</I><BR>
<BR>
With the lessening threat of thermonuclear war, the abuse of the planetary
environment by industrial society remains as the largest, most obvious form
of collective psychosis in the modern world. <BR>
<BR>
Are we to believe that this collusive madness plays no part in shaping the
individual psyche? Yet there is not a single diagnostic category in modern
psychotherapy that speaks to our need for healthy balance with the natural
habitat. <BR>
<BR>
It is, perhaps, the most revealing measure of our spiritual condition that
those who would heal the soul have no sense of the soul's place in nature.
And this is, of course, freakish, since all traditional societies take reciprocity
between the human and not-human to be the essence of sanity.<BR>
<BR>
The following is an excerpt from <I>The Voice of the Earth,</I> in which
I first describe ways that ecopsychology might be able to fill this vacuum.
<H4><BR>
HEALING OURSELVES;<BR>
HEALING THE EARTH</H4>
If ecopsychology has anything to add to the Socratic-Freudian project of
self-knowledge, it is to remind us of what our ancestors took to be common
knowledge: there is more to know about the self, or rather more <I>self
</I>to know, than our personal history reveals. <BR>
<BR>
Making a personality, the task that Jung called &quot;individuation,&quot;
may be the adventure of a lifetime. But the person is anchored within a
greater, universal identity. <BR>
<BR>
Salt remnants of ancient oceans flow through our veins, ashes of expired
stars rekindle in our genetic chemistry. The oldest of the atoms, hydrogen
- whose primacy among the elements should have gained it a more poetically
resonant name - is a cosmic theme; mysteriously elaborated billions-fold,
it has created from Nothing the Everything that includes us.<BR>
<BR>
When we look out into the night sky, the stars we see in the chill, receding
distance may seem crushingly vast in size and number. But the swelling emptiness
that contains them is, precisely by virtue of its magnitude, the physical
matrix that makes living intelligence possible. Those who believed we were
cradled in the hands of God have not been so very wrong.<BR>
<BR>
All this belongs to the principles of ecopsychology, but not in any doctrinaire
or purely clinical way. Psychiatry is best played by ear. It is after all
a matter of listening to the whole person, all that is submerged, unborn,
in hiding: the infant, the shadow, the savage.<BR>
<BR>
This list of principles is merely a guide, suggesting how deep that listening
must go to hear the Self that speaks through the self.
<OL>
  <LI>The core of the mind is the ecological unconscious. For ecopsychology,
repression of the ecological unconscious is the deepest root of collusive
madness in industrial society; open access to the ecological unconscious
is the path to sanity.<BR>
<BR>
  <LI>The contents of the ecological unconscious represent, in some degree,
at some level of mentality, the living record of cosmic evolution, tracing
back to distant initial conditions in the history of time. Contemporary
studies in the ordered complexity of nature tell us that life and mind emerge
from this evolutionary tale as culminating natural systems within the unfolding
sequence of physical, biological, mental, and cultural systems we know as
&quot;the universe.&quot;Ecopsychology draws upon these findings of the
new cosmology, striving to make them real to experience.<BR>
<BR>
  <LI>Just as it has been the goal of previous therapies to recover the
repressed contents of the unconscious, so the goal of ecopsychology is to
awaken the inherent sense of environmental reciprocity that lies within
the ecological unconscious. Other therapies seek to heal the alienation
between person and person, person and family, person and society. Ecopsychology
seeks to heal the more fundamental alienation between the person and the
natural environment.<BR>
<BR>
  <LI>For ecopsychology, as for other therapies, the crucial stage of development
is the life of the child. The ecological unconscious is regenerated, as
if it were a gift, in the newborn's enchanted sense of the world. Ecopsychology
seeks to recover the child's innately animistic quality of experience in
functionally &quot;sane&quot; adults. To do this, it turns to many sources,
among them the traditional healing techniques of primary people, nature
mysticism as expressed in religion and art, the experience of wilderness,
the insights of Deep Ecology. It adapts these to the goal of creating the
ecological ego.<BR>
<BR>
  <LI>The ecological ego matures toward a sense of ethical responsibility
with the planet that is as vividly experienced as our ethical responsibility
to other people. It seeks to weave that responsibility into the fabric of
social relations and political decisions.<BR>
<BR>
  <LI>Among the therapeutic projects most important to ecopsychology is
the re-evaluation of certain compulsively &quot;masculine&quot; character
traits that permeate our structures of political power and drive us to dominate
nature as if it were an alien and rightless realm. In this regard, ecopsychology
draws significantly on some (not all) of the insights of ecofeminism and
feminist spirituality with a view to demystifying the sexual stereotypes.<BR>
<BR>
  <LI>Whatever contributes to small-scale social forms and personal empowerment
nourishes the ecological ego. Whatever strives for large-scale domination
and the suppression of personhood undermines the ecological ego. Ecopsychology
therefore deeply questions the essential sanity of our gargantuan urban-industrial
culture, whether capitalistic or collectivistic in its organization. But
it does so without necessarily rejecting the technological genius of our
species or some life-enhancing measure of the industrial power we have assembled.
Ecopsychology is post-industrial, not anti-industrial, in its social orientation.<BR>
<BR>
  <LI>Ecopsychology holds that there is a synergistic interplay between
planetary and personal well-being. The term &quot;synergy&quot; is chosen
deliberately for its traditional theological connotation, which once taught
that the human and divine are cooperatively linked in the quest for salvation.
The contemporary ecological translation of the term might be: the needs
of the planet are the needs of the person, the rights of the person are
the rights of the planet. 
</OL>
<H4><BR>
ECOPYSCHOLOGY: A DISCIPLINE FOR THE 21st CENTURY</H4>
Since <I>The Voice of the Earth </I>came out, I have been delightfully surprised
to receive a steady influx of letters, papers, and lectures from psychotherapists
acquainting me with their concern about this very issue - and with what
they have been doing to meet the need. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Ecopsychology&quot; is the name most often used for this growing body
of theory and practice, but others have been suggested: psycho-ecology,
nature-based psychotherapy, eco-therapy, shamanic counseling, green therapy,
earth-centered therapy, re-earthing. Such neologisms never sound euphonious;
nor, for that matter, did &quot;psychoanalysis&quot; in its day. But by
whatever name, the orientation is the same. It begins with the assumption
that the context for defining sanity in our time has reached planetary magnitude.
<I>Ecology needs psychology, psychology needs ecology.</I><BR>
<BR>
There are a number of fascinating issues ecopsychology has brought into
strong, personal focus:<BR>
<OL>
  <LI>CONSUMPTION HABITS. What are the deep psychological roots of our &quot;materialistic
disorders&quot; (as the Cambridge therapist Sarah Conn terms it)?<BR>
<BR>
  <LI>GENDER STEREOTYPING in our relations with the natural environment.
Of special interest here: the compulsive masculinity of western science
and technology. Why the need to &quot;conquer&quot; Mother Nature in order
to feel secure?<BR>
<BR>
  <LI>CHILD PSYCHOLOGY and development. Kids are probably born closer to
the ecological unconscious than they will ever be again. What goes wrong
with them (us)?<BR>
<BR>
  <LI>DESIGN. What would environmentally intelligent homes, workplaces,
cities look and feel like? Why don't we have many such in our world today?
How do we manage to put up with the &quot;madness of cities&quot;?<BR>
<BR>
  <LI>SUPERSTITIONS OF MONEY. &quot;Gold drives the white man crazy,&quot;
the Indians used to say. Abstract millions continue to do the same in our
high-rolling world - and on an ever greater scale. Again: obvious psychosis.
But why?<BR>
<BR>
  <LI>THE PSYCHIC NEED FOR WILDNESS and wilderness. Can we make a case that
mental health requires access to authentic wilderness and our untamed fellow
species? If so, might that be our best strategy for preserving all the endangered
species?
</OL>
<BR>
It should be noted that none of this is meant to replace the good hard political
analysis and social action the environmental cause needs. It is meant to
supplement that effort and deepen our understanding of issues. It is also
intended to strengthen the psychology of the movement by giving it a broader
emotional and moral range.<BR>
<BR>
Some of us are looking forward to a newsletter and maybe a national conference
of some visibility. Its purpose: to launch a new profession that integrates
the expertise of the environmentalist with the sensibility of the therapist.
I would appreciate hearing from anyone interested in joining the network.<I>

<H1><CENTER>&quot;Poverty&quot; - In Need Of A Few Distinctions</CENTER>
</H1>
<H3><CENTER></CENTER>
</H3>
<H4><CENTER><I>by Wolfgang Sachs</I></CENTER>
</H4>
<BR>
<I>Many in the West misjudge our planet's diverse peoples 
by comparing them with northern European and North 
American cultures. The following excerpt from the October-December 
1992 issue of </I>Edges,<I> published by the Canadian Institute 
of Cultural Affairs, points to the often-overlooked 
quality of life in communities that have kept their 
distance from the commodity economy.</I><P>

I could have kicked myself afterwards. Yet my remark 
had seemed the most natural thing on Earth at the time. 
It was six months after Mexico City's catastrophic 
earthquake in 1985 and I had spent the whole day walking 
around<I> Tepito</I>, a dilapidated quarter inhabited by ordinary 
people but threatened by land speculators. I had expected 
ruins and resignation, decay and squalor, but the visit 
had made me think again: there was a proud neighborly 
spirit, vigorous building activity, and a flourishing 
shadow economy.<I> [For more on </I>Tepito<I>, see </I>IC<I> #30].</I><P>

But at the end of the day the remark slipped out: &quot;It's 
all very well but, when it comes down to it, these 
people are still terribly poor.&quot;<P>

Promptly, one of my companions stiffened: &quot;<I>No somos 
pobres, somos Tepitanos!</I>&quot; (We are not poor people, 
we are <I>Tepitans</I>). <P>

What a reprimand! I had to admit to myself in embarrassment 
that, quite involuntarily, the cliches of development 
philosophy had triggered my reaction.<P>

&quot;Poverty&quot; on a global scale was discovered 
after World War II. Whenever &quot;poverty&quot; was 
mentioned at all in the documents of the 1940s and 
1950s, it took the form of a measurement of per-capita 
income whose significance rested on the fact that it 
lay ridiculously far below the US standard. <P>

Once the scale of incomes had been established, such 
different worlds as those of the <I>Zapotec </I>people of 
Mexico, the <I>Tuareg </I>of North Africa, and the <I>Rajasthani 
</I>of India could be classed together; a comparison to 
the &quot;rich&quot; nations demanded relegating them 
to a position of almost immeasurable inferiority. In 
this way, &quot;poverty&quot; was used to define whole 
peoples, not according to what they are and want to 
be, but according to what they lack. <P>

This approach provided a justification for intervention; 
wherever low income is the problem the only answer 
would be &quot;economic development.&quot; There was 
no mention of the idea that poverty might also result 
from oppression and thus demand liberation. Or that 
a culture of sufficiency might be essential for long-term 
survival. Or even less that a culture might direct 
its energies toward spheres other than economic ones.<P>

Binary divisions, such as healthy/ill, normal/abnormal, 
or, more pertinently, rich/poor, are like steamrollers 
of the mind; they level a multiform world, flattening 
out that which does not fit. That approach also fails 
to distinguish between frugality, destitution, and 
scarcity.<I><P>

Frugality </I>is a mark of cultures free from the frenzy 
of accumulation. In these cultures, the necessities 
of everyday life are mostly gained through subsistence 
production. To our eyes, these people have rather meager 
possessions - maybe a hut and some pots and a special 
Sunday outfit - with money playing only a marginal 
role. <P>

Instead of cash wealth, everyone usually has access 
to fields, rivers, and woods, while kinship and community 
duties guarantee services that elsewhere must be paid 
for in hard cash. Nobody goes hungry.<P>

In a traditional Mexican village, for example, the private 
accumulation of wealth results in social ostracism 
- prestige is gained precisely by spending even small 
profits on good deeds for the community. Such a lifestyle 
only turns into demeaning &quot;poverty&quot; when 
under the pressure of an &quot;accumulating&quot; society.<I><P>

Destitution</I>, on the other hand, becomes rampant as soon 
as <I>frugality </I>is deprived of its foundation - community 
ties, land, forest, and water. <I><P>

Scarcity </I>derives from modernized poverty. It affects 
mostly urban groups caught up in the money economy 
as workers and consumers whose spending power is so 
low that they fall by the wayside. Their capacity to 
achieve through their own efforts gradually fades, 
while at the same time their desires, fuelled by glimpses 
of high society, spiral toward infinity. This scissor-like 
effect of want is what characterizes modern poverty.<P>

Until now, development politicians have viewed &quot;poverty&quot; 
as the problem and &quot;growth&quot; as the solution. 
They have not yet admitted that they have been largely 
working with a concept of poverty fashioned by the 
experience of commodity-based need in the North. With 
the less well-off <I>Homo economicus</I> in mind, they have 
encouraged growth and often produced destitution by 
bringing multifarious cultures of frugality to ruin. 
The culture of growth can only be erected on the ruins 
of frugality, and so destitution and dependence on 
commodities are its price.<P>

In societies that are not built on the compulsion to 
amass material wealth, economic activity is not geared 
to slick zippy output. Rather, economic activities 
- like choosing an occupation, cultivating the land, 
or exchanging goods - are understood as ways of enacting 
that particular social drama in which members of a 
community see themselves as the actors. The economy 
is closely bound up with life, but it does not stamp 
its rule and rhythms on the rest of society. Only in 
the West does the economy dictate the drama and everyone's 
role in it.<P>

It seems my friend from <I>Tepito </I>knew of this when he 
refused to be labelled &quot;poor.&quot; His honor 
was at stake, his pride too; he clung to his <I>Tepito</I> 
form of sufficiency, perhaps sensing that without it 
there loomed only destitution or never-ending scarcity.<I><P>

<H1><CENTER>A German Car Co-op</CENTER>
</H1>
<H3><CENTER></CENTER>
</H3>
<BR>
Cornelia Scholz lives in Cologne and commutes the 40 
kilometers to D&uuml;sseldorf by train because the 
traffic is so dreadful. She used to have a car, but 
she sold it after realizing that she was paying a small 
fortune to keep it sitting outside her house. Occasionally 
she still needed a car but didn't want to hire one 
for a whole day for small trips. What could she do?<P>

Cornelia joined <I>Stattauto</I>, one of a number of car-sharing 
organizations in Europe, and became one of 35 people 
who share three cars. Now she just calls a 24-hour 
number, books the car for when she needs it, picks 
it up from a garage and returns it when she's finished. 
At the end of each month, she receives an itemized 
bill for the hours and number of kilometers she drove 
the car.<P>

Cologne is one of 49 cities throughout Germany, Switzerland, 
and Austria where cars are shared this way. In some 
of these cities, the concept has really taken off. 
<I><P>

Stattauto </I>in Berlin has 57 vehicles - small cars, station 
wagons, and minibuses - shared by 800 registrants. 
Each has a magnetized plastic card to open a safe, 
placed near each car's parking spot, that contains 
the car's keys and registration documents. The card 
doubles as a ticket on the Berlin public transport 
system and can also be used as a charge card for taxicabs 
- so all urban transportation needs are met by one 
card, reinforcing the idea that the various forms of 
transport all have different functions to play in an 
integrated city transportation policy.<P>

Those planning out-of-town travel can book cars in other 
cities through a network of car-sharing organizations. 
That way, they can travel by train to their destination, 
and then use a share car for trips around town. <P>

To many members, the system's practical advantages are 
closely linked to the environmental benefits; sharing 
saves parking space, eases traffic, and allows cars 
to be used more intensively.<P>

In Berlin, <I>Stattauto'</I>s<I> </I>vehicles cover an average of 
36,000 kilometers a year - compared to a national average 
in German cities of 15,000 km. <P>

Surprisingly enough, problems are few. In Berlin, only 
once has a member taken a car without booking it. Only 
about once a week does someone not get the car they 
want exactly when they want it. If a car returns late, 
and a member has to wait, the latecomer pays a fine 
equivalent to about US$20 directly to the person inconvenienced. 
<I><P>

For more information on car sharing, write </I>Stattauto<I>, 
Manteuffelstrasse 40, D-1000 Berlin 36, Germany, telephone: 
01049-30-611 35 27. Adapted from a story that appeared 
last year in the Manchester Guardian.</I><P>

<H4><CENTER><I>by Donella Meadows</I></CENTER>
</H4>
<BR>
There's an astonishing page in the latest Patagonia sports clothing catalog,
written by Yvon Chouinard, president of Patagonia, Inc. It tells why he's
decided that his company should stop growing.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Last fall,&quot; he says, &quot;we underwent an environmental audit
to investigate the impact of the clothing we make.... To no one's surprise
the news is bad. Everything we make pollutes. Polyester, because it's made
from petroleum, is an obvious villain, but cotton and wool are not any better.
To kill the boll weevil, cotton is sprayed with pesticides so poisonous
they generally render cotton fields barren; cotton fabric is often treated
with formaldehyde. Wool relies on large flocks of sheep that denude fragile,
arid areas of earth. We are pursuing other alternatives, like buying wool
only from temperate regions ... and using 'organic' cotton. Another conclusion
we have reached is simple: We need to use fewer materials. Period.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
As a sheep farmer, I cringe at that association of wool with erosion. Sheep
can be raised even in arid lands in ways that don't destroy land (though
they often aren't raised that way). Cotton can be grown without pesticides,
as Chouinard recognizes. But his basic approach is not only sound, it's
worth a round of applause. Not many companies are willing to look at the
full consequences of their business, and to take responsibility for what
they see.<BR>
<BR>
Chouinard continues: &quot;During the eighties most of us managed to exceed
our limits. Patagonia... was no exception. By the end of 1989 we... had
nearly outgrown our natural niche, the specialty outdoor market, and were
on our way to becoming much larger than we wanted to be.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;As a society we've always assumed that growth is both positive and
inevitable. When our economies sour, as they always do, we simply look for
new customers and new resources. We hunt new export markets and new Third
World sources for raw materials. But Third World resources are close to
exhausted and many economies burdened by debt are no longer viable dumping
grounds for our manufactured goods.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
The points about the Third World are again extreme - maybe extremism is
inevitable in the newly converted. Some Third World resources are close
to exhausted, but not all. Third World markets are not saturated. The challenge
is not to leave producers in poor countries out of the world market but
to work with them so they can be steady suppliers through sustainable use
of their resources. And there's no reason why people everywhere can't be
customers if they are paid decent wages and if we produce what they really
need.<BR>
<BR>
Chouinard goes on to the essence of his new policy: &quot;We are limiting
Patagonia's growth.... We dropped 30 percent of our clothing line. This
catalog is much smaller and has fewer pages than our catalogs of the past....<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Last fall you had a choice of five ski pants, now you may choose between
two. ...You will see fewer color and style choices throughout the catalog.
Next season more cuts will be made. The fewer styles we make, the more we
can focus on quality. We think the future of clothing will be less is more,
a few good clothes that will last a long lime. We have never wanted to be
the largest outdoor clothing company in the world, we have only wanted to
be the best.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Only two kinds of ski pants! Not being the largest, but the best! Many people,
perhaps most people, will call these ideas extremist, too. To me they sound
like enlightened corporate policy.<BR>
<BR>
Growth is a knee-jerk goal for corporations and for governments. The quest
for growth is at the foundation of our culture. It's how we measure our
success. But you don't have to think about it very long before you start
wondering why we ever picked eternal growth as our economic Holy Grail.
Growth is a means, not an end. When it gets you to where you want to go,
the sensible thing is to stop. Unless you're addicted to power, there's
no reason to want a company to get ever bigger. There are many reasons to
want a company to be profitable, to produce high-quality goods or services,
and to be fully responsible for its operations.<BR>
<BR>
Corporate responsibility extends not only to the customers, the resources,
and the workers of the present, but to those of the future. Says Chouinard,
&quot;I've always believed that the key to the government doing the right
thing is to base its planning and decisions on the intention of being around
for a hundred years. If the government acted that way it wouldn't be clear-cutting
old-growth forests or building dams that will silt up in 20 years. We wouldn't
have gone to war to maintain our oil-dependent lifestyle. If we really believe
in the rightness of such planning then Patagonia as a company must walk
what it talks. Last year when we decided to limit our growth we also committed
ourselves to a life-span of a hundred years. A company that intends to be
around that long will live within its resources, care for its people, and
do everything it can to satisfy its community of customers.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Growth is a stupid goal. So, by the way, is no growth. Growth is beside
the point. The point is caring for people and resources and meeting real
needs with the highest possible quality. When that is done the growth will
fall where it may and where it should.<I><BR>

<H1><CENTER>Earth Summit Follow-up</CENTER>
</H1>
<H4><CENTER><I>by Carla Cole</I></CENTER>
</H4>
<BR>
<I>Agenda 21</I>, the document produced at the recent United Nations Conference
on Environment and Development, is pretty daunting. Written in polysyllabic
quasi-legalese, it exceeds 500 pages and costs $195. It would be easy to
applaud the tremendous effort that went into creating this rare international
consensus on critical environmental concerns and then just hope that somebody
else will do something about it. Peace Child International has a better
idea: get kids around the world to rewrite <I>Agenda 21</I> in language
that, well, a child could understand. Then get the kids to hold leaders
accountable for putting the plan to work.<BR>
<BR>
Besides explaining the provisions of the document, <I>Children's Edition
of Agenda 21 </I>will tell the story of the Earth Summit itself - the people,
planning, and problems which resulted in action plans overtly sanctioned
by an unprecedented international alliance. <BR>
<BR>
Students and teachers from around the world will be involved in Peace Child's
follow up on<I> Agenda 21</I>. Students will talk to government officials,
academics, and environmental experts, including both those who helped create
the document and those who are critical of it. <BR>
<BR>
The students will synthesize the information they gather and send representatives
to an editorial meeting at Peace Child headquarters in England, where they
will finalize copy and book design. Representatives will have canvassed
student participants to gather <I>their </I>ideas. These will become &quot;Agenda
21A,&quot; the last chapter of <I>Children's Edition of Agenda 21</I>.<BR>
<BR>
Peace Child International plans to launch the book on September 21, 1993
- the International Day of Peace. Then the most powerful part of the program
begins. Students throughout the world will meet with leaders in the public
and private sectors to check up on how much of <I>Agenda 21</I> they have
implemented and to discuss the points students raise in &quot;Agenda 21A.&quot;
Peace Child plans for this to become an annual event in which youngsters
- who usually consider themselves politically powerless - can meet with
their leaders to urge progress &quot;toward long-term survival for all life
on this planet.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
To participate in this effort, contact Peace Child International. In the
US: 7514 Girard Avenue, #1-544, La Jolla CA 92037. Elsewhere: Little Maltings,
Much Hadham, Herts SG10 6AW, United Kingdom.<BR>
<BR>
[<B>PLEASE NOTE:</B> &quot;Resources for Youth&quot; (p. 42, <I>IC</I> #33)
gives an out-dated address for Peace Child International. The correct addresses
are those given above. Peace Child coordinators David Woollcombe and Rosey
Simonds asked us to clarify that Creative Response, which also appears in
<I>IC</I> #33, was formerly part of Peace Child and carries on the theatrical
work Peace Child initiated. Besides the <I>Agenda 21</I> project, Peace
Child International programs currently focus on four problem areas - Cyprus,
the Middle East, Ireland, and the former Yugoslavia.] <I><BR>

</H1>
<H3><CENTER></CENTER>
</H3>
<H4><CENTER><I>by Karl H. Maret</I></CENTER>
</H4>
<I><BR>
When the board of directors of one of Holland's leading banks needed a new
headquarters, they asked for a design that would honor the human spirit
while creating a new, progressive image for the bank. The result is a structure
that integrates art and natural materials, sunlight and energy conservation,
low noise levels and unique water features. Karl Maret, a consultant with
the Metanoia Group and formerly an associate of Ton Alberts and Max Van
Huut, the architects who designed the new headquarters, provided this description.</I><BR>
<BR>
The head office of what is now the Internationale Nederlanden Group (ING)
Bank stands in southeast Amsterdam near the Bijlmer metro station. Completed
in 1983, this &quot;groundscraper&quot; is a synthesis of energy efficiency,
human-scale functionality, artistic inspiration, and organic architecture.<BR>
<BR>
What strikes the observer at first sight are the sloping walls of the complex's
10 towers. This design lends the building a sense of stability, while providing
advantages in terms of natural lighting, solar heat collection, decreased
wind resistance, and acoustical efficiency.<BR>
<BR>
The 538,000-square-foot complex is broken up into 10 slanting towers arranged
in a loose S-shape. A 1,400-foot-long internal &quot;street&quot; runs through
the bottom connecting level. <BR>
<BR>
Repetitive features in the towers helped keep the building's cost down to
$96.3 million in 1991 dollars, just 3 percent more than an equivalent standard
office complex in Holland. Many of the energy-efficient features that added
to the cost paid for themselves in less than a year.<BR>
<BR>
A 1,400-square-foot sloping glass pentagon with an attached glass house
crowns each tower. These structures contain the exhaust air heat-exchange
systems and the computer-controlled blinds for the solar collectors. They
also serve as skylights, converting each tower into a light well.<BR>
<BR>
All employees sit within 23 feet of an operable window, allowing each some
control over light and fresh air. Internal ceiling louvers, which bounce
daylight deep into each room, allow employees to work in natural daylight
80 percent of the time, saving significant amounts of energy. Task lights,
wall sconces, and overhead fixtures provide the rest of the lighting.<BR>
<BR>
The passive solar building stores heat in its half-million cubic feet of
precast concrete. Seven-inch-thick concrete walls, sheathed with four inches
of insulation and faced with 2.8 million bricks, store solar heat and the
heat generated inside the building by power equipment, lighting, elevators,
and people. Seven of the 10 towers have a southern orientation, maximizing
incident solar light and heat. <BR>
<BR>
Air-to-air heat exchange systems capture 70 percent of the heat from the
exhaust air to preheat the fresh air intake. Four 6,600-gallon hot water
tanks store the heat generated in conjunction with on-site electricity generation.
The hot water feeds hydronic radiators. A central computer system makes
adjustments as necessary.<BR>
<BR>
In place of air conditioning, the building is cooled by mechanical ventilation,
fresh air, and a back-up absorption cooling system powered by waste heat
from the cogeneration system. Cool air is admitted at night, put through
a thermal energy transfer device, and circulated throughout the building
during the heat of the day. <BR>
<BR>
Instead of humidifiers, a specifically calculated number of plants provide
the necessary moisture. The plants are watered by rainwater collected in
outside ponds and oxygenated and conditioned through specially constructed
flowforms.<BR>
<BR>
The building's annual energy consumption of 52,000 Btus per square foot
is less than one quarter of the bank's old headquarters and about a third
of conventional modern office buildings. The bank saves $2.4 million annually
as a result; it recovered its $700,000 investment in the energy system in
the first four months of operation. 
<H4>HUMAN-CENTERED DESIGN</H4>
The architects aimed for an organic theme and a human-centered design. To
provide a sense of connectedness with the building, each employee works
at a natural wooden desk, touches birch banisters while walking through
a multitude of inviting, light-filled stairways, and enters each room by
depressing a solid bronze door handle.<BR>
<BR>
Workers move through an interior in which few walls are parallel or perpendicular.
The halls within the towers are filled with light and life. They are also
the lungs of the building, where an exchange of energy between inside and
outside takes place. Even though there are 31 elevators, most prefer the
stairways, where they're likely to encounter their fellow workers. <BR>
<BR>
A sense of aliveness and rejuvenation occurs when they walk alongside the
trickling streams of collected rain water that flow through central handrails
and banisters. The flowing water in these sculpted handrails also provides
a soothing background noise that drowns out distractions.<BR>
<BR>
Absenteeism at the bank has dropped dramatically and initial reports indicate
that workers' blood pressure is improving. Architects Ton Alberts and Max
Van Huut estimate the bank may save $1.4 million annually from decreased
absenteeism alone.<BR>
<BR>
It was the synergy between the architects, builders, engineers, craftspeople,
artists, and interior designers that created such a marvelous sense of collaboration,
creativity, and love. All who participated in the building were deeply touched
by this process; some of the craftspeople even said they felt like they
had participated in the creation of a modern cathedral.<BR>
<BR>
For those who may spend as much as half of their waking lives working in
offices, the future may well lie in such &quot;organic&quot; buildings that
are designed to stimulate interaction, creativity, and invention.<BR>

<H1><CENTER>Audubon's Living Building</CENTER>
</H1>
<H3><CENTER></CENTER>
</H3>
<H4><CENTER><I>by Mark Worth</I></CENTER>
</H4>
<I><BR>
Though loaded with environmentally conscious and energy efficient designs,
the nine-story Audubon House in Lower Manhattan is no experiment. The improvements
made to the 19th century structure are cost-effective, readily available,
and, in many cases, cheaper than conventional refurbishing techniques. The
benefits include cleaner indoor air, softer lighting, lower energy bills,
and more open work spaces. </I><BR>
<BR>
It's been more than six months since the National Audubon Society moved
its headquarters into what has been called one of the most environmentally
friendly office buildings in the world. And while it will be a full year
before the people who retrofitted the 102-year-old New York City building
know for sure how well it's performing, Audubon staffers already know at
least part of the answer.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;The air in here is so fresh,&quot; said Tom Exton, Audubon's corporate
relations director. &quot;We have as close to a toxic-free environment as
you can get. I can't emphasize enough how fresh the air is.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
People who used to feel tired and suffer from headaches after a day at work
now say they don't, Tom said. &quot;We're thinking of bottling the air,&quot;
staffer Dave McGowan added.<BR>
<BR>
Tom and Dave are among the 145 staffers whose workplace - the nine-story
&quot;Audubon House&quot; in Manhattan's East Village - has become a prime
example of a design philosophy that elevates environmental and worker-health
considerations on a par with a building's structural and operational soundness.<BR>
<BR>
One of Audubon's first decisions was to retrofit an old building instead
of spending an estimated $33 million on a new headquarters. The organization
bought the Schermerhorn Building in 1989 for $10 million. Audubon then asked
the Croxton Collaborative, a New York City architectural firm, to apply
as many energy efficient and environmental technologies as could pay for
themselves in three to five years. Total cost of the renovation was $14
million.<BR>
<BR>
Because the architects, engineers, and other design professionals worked
as a team, they were able to break loose from predictable design patterns
and come up with imaginative solutions. Lighting experts talked with builders
about positioning walls and windows. Chemists talked with furnishing suppliers
to minimize chemical out-gassing. Air quality experts talked to architects
about installing air intakes on the roof instead of at street level. A full-time
researcher investigated new <I>and</I> old technologies for designers to
consider. <BR>
<BR>
With all this input, the process took longer, but &quot;all these things
have a payback and a financial benefit for the client,&quot; said Lauren
Reiter, Croxton's project architect.<BR>
<BR>
Here is a partial list of the innovations at Audubon House: 
<UL>
<LI><B>Separate chutes </B>on every floor carry plastic, glass, aluminum,
organic material, and different types of paper to a recycling center in
the building's sub-basement. In the future, the in-house compost will nourish
a rooftop conservatory. Audubon's goal is to recycle 79 percent of all products
coming into the building, including 42 tons of paper a year. Audubon also
wants 80 percent of all the products it purchases to contain recycled content.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Countertops </B>are made of recycled plastic, ceramic floors from
recycled glass, drywall from recycled newsprint, insulation from a component
of sea water, and wood from non-endangered sources.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Air is conditioned </B>with a high-efficiency, gas-burning heater/chiller;
faucets conserve water; pumps, fans, and motors are &quot;smart&quot;; windows
are thermal resistant; and internal stairwells discourage unnecessary elevator
use.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>To help prevent</B> sick-building syndrome, indoor air is changed
6.2 times an hour (six times New York's standard); wall coverings and furniture
give off few or no chemicals; undyed wool carpets contain neither formaldehyde
nor CFCs; carpet padding is made entirely of recycled paper; and 80 percent
of the particulates are filtered from the air.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Lighting energy </B>is saved by using high-efficiency fluorescents,
clerestory windows, motion sensors, pendant light fixtures, low work-station
walls, a skylight, an east-west office design, compact-fluorescent task
lights, full-range dimming linked to the amount of daylight, and highly
reflective surfaces. Filing cabinets are positioned near windows. 
</UL>
<BR>
During the 20-month-long refurbishing project, all the demolition material
that could be salvaged was sent off to recyclers. Concrete, masonry, wood,
steel, iron, glass - even the scrap metal from the old boiler was hauled
off; a small amount of the salvaged material was used on site. Many of the
other building materials contain recycled material.<BR>
<BR>
Despite the Audubon House's revolutionary design, its principles are not
hard to duplicate. All components are available off the shelf.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;We want this building not to be a solitary symbol of energy efficiency
and indoor air quality,&quot; Tom said. Audubon was interested in measures
that others could replicate, he said. &quot;The building is, in effect,
an educational tool.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
The work cost $142 per square foot, compared to the $120 to $130 a square
foot to renovate a typical Manhattan office building using conventional
technology, according to Croxton.<BR>
<BR>
Audubon hopes to save $100,000 a year in energy costs by using 60 percent
less energy than a conventional building of similar size - 98,000 square
feet. CFCs have been virtually eliminated, and greenhouse and acid-rain
gases are expected to be cut by 60-80 percent.<BR>
<BR>
Croxton designer Kirsten Childs said the building is &quot;performing as
planned,&quot; though she won't be able to back up that assessment with
actual data until mid-November, the first anniversary of the building's
re-opening. <BR>
<BR>
But workers are already giving the building high marks. &quot;There's always
daylight flooding into your office,&quot; Dave McGowan said. &quot;The layout
is very open.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Despite a few minor adjustments - like walking the distance of a city block
to get to copy machines located near recycling chutes - the building's design
is fostering a more congenial work environment. Staffers talk face to face
instead of over the phone. Offices have glass walls. &quot;The open work
area to a certain extent breaks down the imagined walls and inhibitions
people have,&quot; Tom said.<BR>
<BR>
Interest in the building has been &quot;staggering,&quot; Kirsten says.
Croxton, which previously applied similar though less extensive improvements
to the National Resources Defense Council's New York City headquarters,
has plans for other projects that embrace the same philosophy.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;There is a built-in resistance to doing work this way. It takes more
time and more effort,&quot; Randall Croxton, the firm's chief architect,
was quoted recently as saying. &quot;But anyone could go out tomorrow morning
and use the technology we have.&quot;<BR>

<H1><CENTER>Institutional Inefficiency</CENTER>
</H1>
<H4><CENTER><I>by Amory Lovins</I></CENTER>
</H4>
<I><BR>
This article condenses highlights from a 66-page report prepared in 1992
by E SOURCE, a membership-based, energy-efficiency information service;
1050 Walnut St., Boulder, CO 80302. Non-members can order the complete report
for $250. <BR>
<BR>
Amory Lovins, E SOURCE's principal technical consultant, is cofounder and
director of research for <A HREF="http://www.rmi.org/">Rocky Mountain Institute</A>
and an internationally recognized energy efficiency expert. </I><BR>
<BR>
Buildings rarely are built to use energy efficiently, despite the sizeable
costs that inefficient designs impose on building owners, occupants, and
the utility companies that serve them. <BR>
<BR>
The reasons for this massive market failure lie within the institutional
framework that shapes how buildings are and have been financed, designed,
constructed, commissioned, operated, maintained, leased, and occupied. Nearly
all of the roughly two dozen actors who play a role in this process have
perverse incentives that reward inefficient practice and penalize efficient
practice. As a result, our buildings cost more to build and operate, are
less comfortable, and use far more energy than they should. In the US alone,
and considering only space cooling and air handling, the unnecessary expenditures
made over the past several decades on space conditioning equipment and the
electricity supply infrastructure to run it total many hundreds of billions
of dollars.<BR>
<BR>
The forces that created this dysfunction are legion, their effects enormous:
<UL>
  <LI><B>Developers </B>- typically desiring fast, cheap buildings that
favor appearance over long-term value - rarely take energy efficiency into
account. Their profits usually are based on the immediate resale value of
their buildings - not on the building's actual long-term financial performance.
Yet developers control the design choices that largely determine that performance.<BR>
<BR>
  <LI><B>Lenders and their advisors </B>perpetuate the use of old, inefficient,
but familiar technologies because they have neither the time nor the inclination
to study innovative designs. They are generally rewarded for closing deals
as quickly as possible, with as little controversy as possible.<BR>
<BR>
  <LI><B>Commercial appraisers </B>tend to know even less about energy systems,
thereby reinforcing developers' and lenders' short-term priorities. The
competitive value of energy-efficient commercial buildings is seldom reflected
in their appraised market value or in their perceptions of risk/reward ratios,
nor is it part of any current due-diligence process in commercial lending.<BR>
<BR>
  <LI><B>Designers, architects, and engineers </B>all too frequently work
in isolation; rarely does anyone involved in a project take the responsibility
for the entire interactive system. A building's location, footprint, height,
orientation, and relationship to existing shading often are specified before
the building architect is even hired.<BR>
<BR>
Mechanical engineers - the people who design heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning
(HVAC) systems - usually are the last to be consulted. Specific design elements
are drawn up independently from other design considerations, killing the
opportunities to save labor and material costs that a coordinated design
effort can offer.<BR>
<BR>
  <LI><B>Mechanical and electrical equipment </B>often is grossly oversized.
Engineers, fearful of losing their jobs or being sued for underestimating
a building's particular needs, are likely to &quot;round up&quot; when in
doubt. Oversizing HVAC and other systems by up to tenfold is not unheard
of. Equipment oversizing is further encouraged when busy designers delegate
such decisions to manufacturers - a clear conflict of interest.<BR>
<BR>
  <LI><B>The best designs </B>often require an investment of time for learning
new methods or seeking out whole-system solutions. Only truly integrated
design can yield projects that are both ecologically and economically green.
Yet tightly scheduled, &quot;just-in-time&quot; designs assume that design
is a linear science rather than a systemic art, precluding whole-system
solutions and reducing the psychological freedom to innovate.<BR>
<BR>
  <LI><B>To make matters worse, </B>prevailing fee structures and bidding
systems reward obsolete rules-of-thumb and pre-packaged designs. This &quot;catalog
engineering&quot; is at the root of today's appallingly low mechanical-system
efficiencies. Further, these fee structures, instead of being based on the
engineer's qualifications, work record, effort or success, often are tied
to a project's cost. Project oversizing and complexity, not efficiency,
are rewarded by this percentage-of-cost fee structure. Creators of innovative,
less costly, and more efficient designs are penalized.<BR>
<BR>
  <LI><B>Contractors</B>, operating on a fixed budget, are rewarded for
cutting corners, not for adding value. Today's accelerated design and construction
schedules discourage the use of unfamiliar though more efficient technologies.
Expedience often leads to a divergence from blueprints, including the substitution
of sub-optimal equipment, resulting in poor building performance.<BR>
<BR>
  <LI><B>Once a building is completed</B>, poor operation and maintenance
often render efficiency measures useless.<BR>
<BR>
  <LI><B>Prevailing leasing practices </B>marginalize efficiency. Tenants
and building operators, particular those paying flat energy bills, rarely
are rewarded for energy savings. Landlords have no incentive to install
upgrades that will benefit their tenants but not themselves. Some landlords
mark up tenant utility bills, creating an incentive to <I>oppose</I> efficiency.
And leasing agents don't use a building's energy efficiency as a selling
point. To the contrary, higher rents fueled by higher energy bills can mean
higher commissions. 
</UL>
<BR>
Fixing these problems is possible, practical, and rewarding. Improvements
that could pay for themselves within a few years could save upward of <I>half</I>
of the energy used to cool and ventilate buildings in countries like the
US, a nation whose buildings use one-third of all energy produced and two-thirds
of the electricity generated here. The US air-conditioning savings alone
could displace 200 giant power plants (two-fifths of the nation's total
generating capacity).<BR>
<BR>
Doing all this requires a combination of education, incentives, and organization,
based on an understanding of each of the actors and how they interact. What
is really needed is no less than <I>reinventing the building design process,
</I>and with it, many current real-estate practices. Here are some suggestions
for how this might be done: 
<UL>
  <LI><B>Restructure design professionals' fees </B>so that they are rewarded
for efficient results. One promising approach involves rebates from utilities
directly to the design team, as Ontario Hydro has already done. These can
double normal design fees and still be very cost-effective for the utility.
Another promising approach is &quot;value-based compensation&quot; in which
the design fee is split into a basic part and an incentive term that rewards
the designer for cutting energy cost or total life-cycle cost.<BR>
<BR>
  <LI><B>Re-integrate </B>the now <I>dis</I>-integrated design process.
Only a fully coordinated, multidisciplinary design team - with one person
designated as the &quot;energy conscience&quot; - seems capable of producing
exemplary results.<BR>
<BR>
  <LI><B>Stage a frontal attack </B>on the use of design rules-of-thumb
and return to classical concepts of engineering optimization. Ensure that
design and construction professionals have access to cutting-edge technologies.<BR>
<BR>
  <LI><B>Educate developers </B>about the effect of energy costs on project
economics, including effects on <I>capital</I> costs. Show developers how
lower energy costs can lower rents, giving them a competitive edge in real-estate
markets, and how advanced energy retrofits can restore distressed properties
to financial health.<BR>
<BR>
  <LI><B>Increase energy efficiency education </B>at universities and through
professional associations. Through industry groups and government agencies,
systematically plan and manage the flow of technology from basic R&amp;D
through commercialization and into the marketplace.<BR>
<BR>
  <LI><B>Encourage utility design </B>professionals to consult with developers
<I>before</I> a project is built - not after - to enhance design integration.
Increase utility involvement in marketing efficient buildings and encourage
the use of &quot;feebates,&quot; in which property owners either pay a fee
or receive a rebate depending on a building's energy efficiency.<BR>
<BR>
  <LI><B>Improve building maintenance </B>and operation. Enhance preventative
maintenance. Increase spending on operator training.<BR>
<BR>
  <LI><B>Reform leasing practices </B>to promote, not discourage, the wise
use of energy. Enable tenant <I>and</I> owner to benefit from energy efficiency.
Replace master meters with per-occupant meters for multiple tenancies. Provide
complete information on energy costs to tenants, landlords, and brokers.
</UL>
<BR>
These and related measures can do much to overcome institutional problems
and fragmentation. They can go far toward unleashing the latent creativity
of many design professionals and rewarding them for money- and energy-saving
choices. The rewards for all of us will be a substantially more efficient
and sustainable society. <BR>

<H1><CENTER>Small Is Beautiful</CENTER>
</H1>
<H4><CENTER><I>Matt Holland</I></CENTER>
</H4>
<BR>
Our lifestyles are evolving. People marry and have children later, or not
at all; budgets are tighter; the environment is strained; fully a third
of US households consist of just one person. Now those changes are taking
a solid form: smaller, smarter houses.<BR>
<BR>
New Haven architect Melanie Taylor does a brisk business selling floor plans
as small as 575 square feet. <BR>
<BR>
In San Francisco, Donald MacDonald pushes the limits even further with a
design enclosing a mere 240 square feet, intended for a single occupant.<BR>
<BR>
More typical are new designs are around 1,000 square feet. McGill University
architecture professors Avi Friedman and Witold Rybczynski attracted international
media attention after building a model house of that size on campus. Their
modern rowhouse is only 14 feet wide, yet comfortable inside. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Fourteen feet is narrow for a house, but it is not narrow for a room,
and for an eat-in kitchen 14 feet square is spacious,&quot; Witold Rybczynski
wrote after finishing the project.<BR>
<BR>
Buyers obviously agree; hundreds of Rybczynski and Friedman &quot;Grow Homes&quot;
have been sold in the Montreal area.<BR>
<BR>
Prices are lower for a small house, which appeals to a generation of home
buyers who can't rely on the swelling economy that helped fund their parents'
mortgages. And there's less house to clean, which makes sense for time-strapped
two-earner families. <BR>
<BR>
Besides saving money on construction materials and labor, this approach
saves money on land. Avi Friedman and Witold Rybczynski's design cost just
$35,000 to build and $60,000 to buy, including land and development costs.
<BR>
<BR>
Melanie Taylor's 575-square-foot models are being built in the southeastern
US for as little as $30,000, and 800-square-foot versions range from $35,000
to $80,000 depending on options.<BR>
<BR>
Financial constraints are not the only force pushing people to buy smaller.
Small is becoming stylish, Melanie Taylor said.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Even people who can have whatever they want are doing this,&quot;
she said. &quot;People have realized that it's really gross to (play) the
'whoever has the most toys wins' game.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Environmental consciousness is built into the smaller houses, whether buyers
are looking for it or not. They require less building materials and take
up less open space. Since they can be placed closer together (even sharing
exterior walls in the rowhouse example) they require fewer roads and less
utility infrastructure. <BR>
<BR>
Smaller houses also use less power for heat and light. Besides helping to
save the Earth, that saves money for occupants. <BR>
<BR>
Many of these innovators also cluster their houses. That way they share
common open space and create a sense of community. Melanie Taylor said she
started designing small houses just because she likes them; only later did
she recognize that they made ecological, economic, and social sense.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;It's a case where what's best for the environment works out in the
'real world',&quot; she said. <BR>

</H4>
<I><BR>
For more than seven years, the city of Austin, Texas, offered a voluntary
energy efficiency rating system for new homes. The Energy Star Program appealed
to builders who use favorable energy ratings to market houses as &quot;green&quot;
and economical.<BR>
<BR>
The program also appealed to the city utility, which saves an estimated
0.5 to 1.0 kilowatts per home. Energy Star staff estimated that the program
kept more than $125,000 per year in Austin that otherwise would have been
spent on importing energy.<BR>
<BR>
Last year, with the encouragement of the Center for Maximum Potential Building
Systems (see page 20), the city decided to expand the program by including
water usage, building materials choice, and solid waste in a comprehensive
rating system; the result was the Green Builder Program. Doug Seiter, who
heads up that program, sent us this account of its progress to date.</I><BR>
<BR>
Since the Green Builder Program was introduced to the public in January
1992, the support has been overwhelming, much more so than when we were
promoting energy efficiency only. It appears there was a pent-up demand
for building practices that contribute to a healthy environment. <BR>
<BR>
The Green Builder Program, the nation's first sustainability rating system
for buildings, focuses on residential homes but also is applicable to small
commercial buildings. The relative success of the Energy Star Program and
the subsequent rapport established with builders gave us a head start.<BR>
<BR>
The program offers a <I>Green Building Guide</I>, which takes builders and
home buyers through a sustainability rating process based on a home's water
and energy use, choice of building materials, and solid waste handling.
Builders use the resulting overall score - ranging from one to four stars
- along with a score for each of the four areas as a marketing tool.<BR>
<BR>
Shortly after being introduced to the public, the Green Builder Program
was one of 12 finalists in the United Nations Local Government Initiatives
Honours Programme, presented in a ceremony at the Earth Summit. <BR>
<BR>
This acknowledgment by the global community of the importance of green building
gave the program an early shot in the arm. It helped builders here see that
they had an opportunity to participate in a new trend that appears to be
gaining ground in all parts of the world - and the builders have responded.
Representatives of the local builders' association helped develop the <I>Green
Building Guide </I>and have participated in an advisory capacity since the
program's introduction. This involvement laid the groundwork for the association's
early endorsement of the program.<BR>
<BR>
An unexpected result of the program has been the strong interest among owners
and developers of commercial property; such a level of support had not surfaced
for the energy rating program in its seven years of operation. The program
has also drawn the attention of the local Habitat for Humanity organization,
which is considering modifying its basic designs to appropriate Green Builder
guidelines. <BR>
<BR>
Another unanticipated result has been the formation of the Sustainable Building
Coalition, which has consistently drawn 60-70 people to presentations on
healthy homes, straw bale home construction, rainwater harvesting, passive
solar design, and other building innovations. <BR>
<BR>
The Green Builder Program addresses a small piece of a very large picture,
yet it gives us a chance to help accelerate the recognition that nothing
we do happens in isolation. Connecting home building to the local, regional,
and global environment allows other elements of sustainable community building
to fall into place. <I><BR>

</H4>
<BR>
<I>A demonstration house under development in Austin will take the progress
made in the Green Building Program (see page 19) to the next level. The
Center for Maximum Building Technologies has planned a house that will show
builders, designers, government regulators, and others how much farther
a home can go toward sustainability.<BR>
<BR>
Pliny Fisk is co</I>-<I>director of the Center for Maximum Building Technology,
8604 FM 969, Austin, TX 78724. Center staff distribute an assortment of
publications and give lectures and workshops. </I><BR>
<BR>
A sustainable home is one that is responsive to the natural environment
and the human environment. The Texas Advanced Green Builder Demonstration
Home, to be built in Austin is designed to be responsive to both. <BR>
<BR>
To accommodate the changing needs of its occupants, the house is designed
to either grow or deconstruct over time. Modular components can be added
on if, for example, a family expands or adds a home business. Or, the modules
can be removed and reused by other similar homes if the inhabitants' need
for space diminishes. <BR>
<BR>
The buildings will have &quot;ribs&quot; that facilitate the adaption of
modules, or trellises and greenhouses. The limiting factor to its growth
is the solar envelope: growth should not interfere with another home's solar
access.<BR>
<BR>
The Center for Maximum Building Technology, as well as building the demostration
home, plans to manufacture and sell the components. All parts will be lightweight
enough for three or fewer people to lift, making it a home that a few people
could build by themselves.<BR>
<BR>
The homes will be built from abundant indigenous materials such as straw
bales; bagasse panels, which are made from a sugar cane byproduct; and caliche,
a calcium carbonate widely available in arid parts of the world. <BR>
<BR>
Six different types of hard woods will be used - all are available within
100 miles of the center. Using locally grown wood is preferable because
we can assure ourselves that the harvest is being sustainably managed. <BR>
<BR>
The house will also use safe by-products such as wood chips, which will
be used as a concrete filler; sulfur as a binding agent; fly ash cement;
and certain mine wastes to be used as lightweight aggregates.<BR>
<BR>
The use of massive indigenous materials will produce a constant radiant
temperature to minimize heating and cooling loads. A solar dehumidifier
will make use of the heat recovery from a solar water heater. <BR>
<BR>
The building's electricity will be generated by a 1 kW photovoltaic system.
A hybrid electric car will act as an auxiliary electric energy source when
it is &quot;docked&quot; to the house. The Energy Docking Module capitalizes
on the fact that when the car leaves home with people, household energy
use drops off; upon their return, energy use goes up. Thus, the total capacity
of generators, motors, and batteries can be optimized by integrating functions.
<BR>
<BR>
The home will be completely self-sufficient in terms of water. In conjunction
with state-of-the-art conservation techniques, water from the building's
roof surfaces will provide all the home's needs. Landscape plants will aerate
and filter the water, prior to its storage in a cistern. <BR>
<BR>
Other plants, including bulb-based flowering plants, will treat the home's
black and gray water. A living fence, made of native woody and thorny plants,
and shade plantings near the house will all be supplied with nutrients from
the home's black and gray water systems.<BR>
<BR>
The Advanced Green Builder Demonstration Home is designed to reintegrate
the relationship between natural and human-made processes. The design is
based on an ecological approach to design: it uses renewable energy, treats
wastes as a resource, and makes full use of the other resources found on
site, such as rain water and solar energy.<BR>

<H1><CENTER>Clearing The Air</CENTER>
</H1>
<H4><CENTER><I>by John Bower</I></CENTER>
</H4>
<I><BR>
Building a healthy house is no more difficult than building an unhealthy
one. However, it takes more than just selecting non-toxic materials; builders
of healthy homes need to have an understanding of how a house functions
- for example, how a house &quot;breathes.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
John Bower, author of </I>Healthy House Building <I>and other books on indoor
air quality, suggests these guidelines for designing and constructing a
healthy home. For more information check the Resources Guide on page 58.</I>
<H4>SEVEN DO'S ...</H4>
1. Do build in a clean location * Selecting a site away from sources of
air pollution is the first consideration in healthy house construction.
<B><BR>
<BR>
2. Do build an airtight structure * </B>This not only improves energy efficiency,
but, when coupled with a mechanical ventilation system, it gives the occupants
maximum control over the indoor air. An airtight structure also minimizes
occupant exposure to insulating materials.<B><BR>
<BR>
3. Do install a ventilation system * </B>Mechanical ventilation can supply
fresh air as needed. Relying on infiltration for an air supply is unreliable
and frequently insufficient.<B><BR>
<BR>
4. Do install a radon removal system * </B>It is difficult to predict if
a particular house will have a radon problem, but it's easier to take precautions
during construction than to mitigate radon in a completed house.<B><BR>
<BR>
5. Do use metal or solid wood cabinetry * </B>Kitchen and bathroom cabinets
are generally made of manufactured wood products that contain glues and
use finishes high in formaldehyde. Use solid wood cabinetry with a low-tox
finish or metal cabinetry with a baked-on finish.<B><BR>
<BR>
6. Do use water-based adhesives, caulks, paints, etc<I>. </I>* </B>Water-based
products are more benign than solvent-based products because they have lower
levels of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Nonetheless, water-based products
aren't perfect, as they contain other ingredients that can cause negative
health effects. Several specialty manufacturers now offer more benign alternatives.
<B><BR>
<BR>
7. Do test materials with sensitive occupants * </B>This is necessary when
a home is to be occupied by someone with chemical sensitivities because
different people have varying reactions to the same material. Testing should
be done under the supervision of a physician. 
<H4>... SEVEN DON'TS</H4>
1. Don't use carpeting * When it comes to poor indoor air quality, carpeting
is one of the worst offenders. New synthetic carpeting outgasses more than
100 different VOCs. Old carpeting is a haven for microbes, some of which
are highly allergenic. A conventional portable vacuum cleaner blows a great
deal of dust into the air. Shampooing is not totally effective, and it may
contribute to an increase in microbes.<B><BR>
<BR>
2. Don't use products high in formaldehyde *</B> Of the two primary types
of resins used in manufactured wood products - U-F (urea-formaldehyde) resins
are perhaps 10 times more potent than P-F (phenol-formaldehyde) resins.
P-F resins are used in all construction grade products (interior and exterior
plywood; oriented strand board; laminated beams; fiberglass insulation;
etc.)<I>. </I>U-F resins are used in hardwood plywood for wall paneling
and cabinetry, medium-density fiberboard for shelving, and particle board.
<BR>
<BR>
No products containing U-F resins should be used within occupied spaces.
P-F resins can be used in the structure, but with sensitive occupants, they
should be well separated from the living space.<B><BR>
<BR>
3. Don't asphyxiate the occupants * </B>If a conventionally aspirated combustion
appliance is used, make sure that backdrafting and spillage will not occur.
Sealed combustion, solar heating, electric or heat-pump furnaces and water
heaters are highly recommended alternatives. Gas ranges are probably not
a good idea. Even if backdrafting and spillage are not serious enough to
kill the occupants, they can result in enough low-level carbon monoxide
to result in flu-like symptoms.<B><BR>
<BR>
4.</B> <B>Don't create a depressurized house * </B>Depressurization can
result not only in backdrafting and spillage, but also infiltration of pesticides,
mold spores, particles of insulation, radon, and other soil gases. Depressurization
occurs because of the HVAC system's blower, powerful natural drafts in chimneys,
clothes dryers, central vacuums, etc. Occupants should open a window slightly
when using such exhaust equipment<B>.<BR>
<BR>
5. Don't ignore physics * </B>Moisture migration, wind, mechanically induced
depressurization, and outgassing, all follow well-defined physical laws.
If those laws are properly understood, healthy, durable houses can be built.<B><BR>
<BR>
6. Don't believe everything you hear * </B>There is an increasing amount
of information available on healthy construction; some is better than others.
When dealing with sensitive individuals, don't believe anyone who tells
you that a product is universally tolerable.<BR>
<BR>
<B>7. Don't panic * </B>If you're apprehensive about healthy construction,
relax. There are many books and periodicals dealing with the subject. <BR>

</H4>
<BR>
<B>1. Make compost,</B> or if you don't want to build your own compost heap,
give your organic waste to friends.<B><BR>
<BR>
2. Move closer to work,</B> or work at home when possible. Commuting accounts
for more than a third of all car travel.<B><BR>
<BR>
3. Reuse paper bags, envelopes, etc.<BR>
<BR>
4. Maintain possessions</B> instead of discarding them. With a few tools
and a how-to book you can save money, resources, and landfill space.<B><BR>
<BR>
5. Xeriscape </B>with drought-tolerant native species in your yard. Plant
shade trees and vines to keep cool in the summer.<B><BR>
<BR>
6. Build an extra unit on top of your garage,</B> or convert your home into
a duplex or tri-plex; it will mean less open space sacrificed to new construction.<B><BR>
<BR>
7. Install low-flow showerheads. </B>With less water to heat, you'll save
water <I>and </I>energy.<B><BR>
<BR>
8. Buy in bulk, </B>and bring your own reusable containers to eliminate
wasteful packaging. <B><BR>
<BR>
9. Take down your back fence. </B>Share garden space and play areas with
your neighbors.<B><BR>
<BR>
10. Use compact fluorescents,</B> which screw into ordinary incandescent
light-bulb sockets but use far less electricity. Add<B> motion-sensing switches</B>
to turn them off when the room's empty.<B><BR>
<BR>
11. Ventilate with air-to-air heat exchangers. </B>They pre-heat fresh air
coming in with waste heat from the &quot;old&quot; air circulating out.
<B><BR>
<BR>
12. Plant deciduous shade trees </B>to cut summer cooling bills. Put them
on the west and east sides of the house to let light in during the winter.<B><BR>
<BR>
13. Bike, walk, and use public transit.<BR>
<BR>
14. Install a solar water heater;</B> they're often cost-effective even
in cloudy areas.<B><BR>
<BR>
15. Buy efficient appliances </B>with smarter designs, like front-loading
washers (they use half the water and detergent of top-loading washers).
Check efficiency ratings you could save up to 13 percent of your household
energy use. <B><BR>
<BR>
16. Use non-toxic cleaners.</B> Borax, vinegar, baking soda, salt, and lemon
juice are a few of the many natural alternatives.<B><BR>
<BR>
17. Move to a smaller house.</B> Okay, maybe not right now, but when you
<I>do</I> move, re-examine how much space you really need and how close
you are to work and the services you need.<B><BR>
<BR>
18. Tune up your car. </B>Without the required maintenance, it can lose
up to 9 percent of its fuel efficiency. <B><BR>
<BR>
19. Separate recyclables, and recycle 'em.<BR>
<BR>
20. Landscape with edible plants. </B>Decorative cabbage, fruit and nut
trees are lovely in the yard.<B><BR>
<BR>
21. Upgrade/service your furnace.</B> Newer models are usually more efficient.
Cleaning and adjusting your furnace also makes a big difference.<B><BR>
<BR>
22. Eat lower on the food chain. </B>Meat, eggs, and dairy products require
disproportionately more land, water, and other resources to produce than
they return in food value.<B><BR>
<BR>
23.</B> <B>Carpool and combine trips.<BR>
<BR>
24. Talk with your neighbors. </B>If you find you don't have time, cancel
a trip to the shopping mall or put the TV in the basement.<B><BR>
<BR>
25. Install faucet aerators. </B>They work like low-flow shower heads; most
have an on/off control to let you cut off the water while soaping up.<B><BR>
<BR>
26. Store rainwater; use your roof as the collector.</B> It's clean, it's
free, it's great for your garden or yard, and it doesn't take energy to
pump it to your house.<B><BR>
<BR>
27. Caulk and weatherstrip, </B>and insulate walls and ceilings. Local utilities
will often subsidize bringing older houses up to current standards.<B><BR>
<BR>
28. Fix leaky pipes.</B> Even small ones can waste thousands of gallons
of water a year, and most can be easily repaired by replacing worn parts.
<B><BR>
<BR>
29. Start a community garden </B>in unused open space. Buy your food from
local growers.<B><BR>
<BR>
30. Install low-flush toilets</B> and drop from six gallons per flush to
one and a half. It saves money as well as water, by cutting utility bills
and/or septic tank service calls. s<BR>

<H1><CENTER>Eco-Community Design</CENTER>
</H1>
<H3><CENTER> </CENTER>
</H3>
<H4><CENTER><I>by Guy Dauncey</I></CENTER>
</H4>
<I><BR>
Two years ago, author Guy Dauncey was invited to join local activists and
environmentalists in a think tank set up by Vancouver Island's leading residential
property developer. The team was asked, &quot;If you were to design a town
that was a model of environmental responsibility, what would you do?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
The seeds of their ideas, combined with thoughts and suggestions from others,
have borne fruit as Bamberton - a new community designed for 12,000 people.
In this article Guy, who now works as an environmental and community development
consultant for Bamberton, describes how the vision took shape and why its
pattern may represent a better model for the 21st century.</I><BR>
<BR>
The population of Vancouver Island, on the west coast of British Columbia,
is growing at a very fast pace, as people from other parts of Canada move
here in search of a more peaceful life. <BR>
<BR>
To accommodate them, development is proceeding wherever it can find a foothold.
Suburban sprawl is eating up the countryside and forest as a result of poor
land-use planning.<BR>
<BR>
In 1990, the South Island Development Corporation bought a 1,560-acre piece
of land 20 miles north of Victoria, on the site of a huge cement works which
had closed down in 1980. The site is quite steep, with some flatter benches
suitable for development. It faces due east onto the tranquil and sensitive
Saanich Inlet, a fjord-like body of water off the Georgia Strait, with magnificent
views across to Mount Baker in Washington State.<BR>
<BR>
Before engaging in any planning, South Island held numerous community meetings,
asking local people what they thought should happen on the site. They were
told, &quot;If you are going to develop that site, build it the way things
used to be in the old days. Design it to encourage a real sense of community,
with a lively town center. We don't want any more shopping malls or big,
fast roads. And furthermore,&quot; they said, &quot;don't trash the environment.
Protect the trees that are on the site and don't pollute the Saanich Inlet.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
At that point we were invited to offer our thoughts. Since then, I have
been immersed in the project night and day, along with Randy Hooper and
Roger Colwill, two other members of the environmental think tank. <BR>
<BR>
The leadership was there in the person of David Butterfield, president of
South Island, who is quite open about his desire to change the world.<BR>
<BR>
The market need was also there, in the form of 12,000 people moving to Vancouver
Island every year. <BR>
<BR>
The financing was in place from 200,000 Canadian trade union members, who
invested their pension funds in the project. This source of financing has
made it possible to plan the development of Bamberton over a 20-year period.
These pension fund managers are interested in long-term returns, so they
are willing to let us build the town up organically, rather than requiring
rapid development and a quick return on investment. And the workers get
the added benefit of the jobs created to build Bamberton.<BR>
<BR>
What has emerged is a proposal to build a town for 12,000 people as a model
of community, economic, and environmental sustainability.<BR>
<BR>
In order to do this, we have been designing for not one, but five levels
of infrastructure: 
<H4>CULTURAL INFRASTRUCTURE </H4>
The essential cultural infrastructure must lie within the hearts and minds
of the team that is doing the developing and the local community that approves
it. Without the values to guide the project down a new road, the tendency
is to stick to the old roads.<BR>
<BR>
The cultural infrastructure is expressed through the Bamberton Code, which
lays down five fundamental commitments (see related story on p. 25). The
code is an expression of an inner commitment to change, which every resident,
builder, and architect will be invited to sign. It is also expressed in
a volume called 'Issues and Principles,' which describes 95 different issues
and more than 300 design principles that put into concrete terms the principles
embodied in the code. This volume was the result of input from the surrounding
community and was completed before the developer would allow any design
work to begin. 
<H4>ENVIRONMENTAL INFRASTRUCTURE</H4>
The old cement works, which occupies some 60 acres, will require a thorough
cleanup. The rest of the site is land that was once glorious old-growth
coastal forest. Over the past 80 years, most of the land has been heavily
logged, leaving behind a canopy of arbutus (madrone) trees and some badly
eroded soil. As the project's environmental team, we have taken the Worldwatch
Institute's goals of the 'Turnaround Decade' to heart by attempting to design
sustainability into almost every aspect of the future community's life:
<UL>
<LI><B>A detailed biodiversity study</B> is showing us exactly which lands
need full protection. A 300-acre area, including old-growth forest that
the loggers failed to reach, is being designated as a park.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Every watercourse</B> and the entire waterfront 40 meters back from
the sea will be protected from development, except at the town center.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>All of the larger trees </B>will be protected by a tree protection
by-law, requiring a permit before they are cut. One quarter of each lot
will be left under native species.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Chemical pesticides, </B>herbicides, and fertilizers will be restricted
by ecological covenant on the land, accompanied by detailed educational
programs. Asphalt roof shingles and roads will also be prohibited to reduce
chemical run-off.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>The town's sewage</B> will be treated by an advanced biological tertiary
works, producing compost for re-use on the land and a liquid effluent of
high enough quality to raise fish.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Every house</B> will be built to a high standard of energy efficiency.
Building standards to encourage long-term sustainability are being written.
<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>A Site Protection Code</B> and training program will apply to every
builder and worker on site.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>A 'wet-dry' system of waste management</B> will recycle up to 85
percent of the town's wastes through a composting plant and materials recovery
facility.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>A community utility</B> will control the pricing of energy and water
to encourage efficiency and discourage use during peak-demand periods. Intelligent
house-wiring will enable appliances to minimize the energy loading during
those periods.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Formal linkages</B> will be established with local organic growers
to provide them with a stable market and residents with a regular supply
of locally grown organic food.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>A local economy,</B> including telecommuting satellite offices, will
minimize the need for commuting.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>For those who do commute</B> into Victoria, car-pooling, van-sharing,
and transit will be encouraged.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Local schools</B>, shops, businesses, and recreational facilities
will keep 60 percent of a household's normal daily trips within Bamberton,
and off the region's road network. 
</UL>
<H4>COMMUNITY INFRASTRUCTURE </H4>
<UL>
<LI>The village and street layouts are based on the principles of traditional
neighborhood development, popularized by Elizabeth Plater-Zyberk and her
husband Andres Duany, who came to Bamberton to help with the design. Houses
will be built close to the street to encourage conversation with pedestrians,
on a close network of neighborhood streets, within a five-minute walk of
a village center. <BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>The town center </B>is designed to be active and lively, combining
living, working, retail, and culture and connected to the villages by footpaths
and by community transit.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>To retain the industrial heritage</B> of the cement works, as much
of the ruins as is feasible will be kept and converted for re-use.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Traditional architecture</B> with some Victorian features will be
the norm in the first neighborhood, implemented through a detailed design
code.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>A strategy for affordability</B> will ensure that a minimum 10 percent
of the houses will be affordable for rental or purchase and that there will
be a lively rental sector. Cohousing, small growhomes, housing co-ops, and
self-building will all be encouraged. A Bamberton cohousing group has already
formed.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>The arts </B>will play a prominent role in the community. The first
Bamberton Arts Forum, held in March 1993, generated many practical ideas
and proposals. 
</UL>
<H4>ECONOMIC INFRASTRUCTURE </H4>
Without a healthy economy, the town would become a bedroom community to
Victoria and its residents would become commuters, contributing to greenhouse-gas
emissions and local traffic congestion. To foster a strong local economy:
<UL>
<LI><B>A business network</B> has been formed for people interested in locating
a business at Bamberton. Four business opportunities seminars have been
held so far, helping us build personal relationships with the network's
200 members.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>An electronic bulletin board</B> and a community directory have been
set up to facilitate the sharing of skills and resources. The Briarpatch
Network in San Francisco and the London-based Business Network are useful
models.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>The economy </B>is taking shape around eight sectors: building and
development; value-added wood products; environmental technologies; retail,
community services and home-based businesses; the arts; telecommuting and
computer services; education and eco-tourism; and consultancy and human
resource development.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>A Business Code</B> sets 20 voluntary principles, encouraging social
and environmental responsibility and mutual support among local businesses.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>An economic </B>development strategy has been drafted, and an economic
development coordinator will go to work full time once rezoning is approved.
</UL>
<H4>PHYSICAL INFRASTRUCTURE</H4>
<UL>
<LI>Storm drains (which normally channel run-off into a river or the sea)
will be replaced by a system of grass swales designed to maximize the reabsorption
of run-off back into the land.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>The community </B>will be wired with fiber-optic cable, permitting
a high use of broad band-width activities such as teleconferencing and electronic
town-hall meetings.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Instead of the clearcutting </B>that normally precedes development,
individual lots will be selectively hand-cleared and the larger trees will
be left intact.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Where there is a clash </B>between a road and a large tree, wherever
possible the road will give way. This has the added advantage of creating
winding roads, which add charm and help slow traffic. 
</UL>
<BR>
After two years of planning, the project has now reached the final stages
of a contentious rezoning process. If rezoning is approved, work on the
site will begin this fall, lots will be for sale in the fall of 1994, and
the first residents will be in their new homes that winter.<BR>
<BR>
At one level, the detailed matrix of considerations that make up a whole-systems
approach to sustainable community design seems complex. But at another level,
the issues have a simplicity to them that emerges from the desire for a
new harmony of nature, community, and economy.<BR>
<BR>
Among our guiding principles is a deep belief in human potential and in
the need to design communities that will enable us to shift the process
of growth in three ways: from the physical level to mental, emotional, and
spiritual levels; from economies based on quantity to those based on quality;
and from environmental degradation to restoration. Designing in ways that
maximize opportunities for individual fulfillment and community support,
in harmony with nature, will set a new pattern for development that will
provide a much needed model and inspiration for the future. <BR>

<H3><CENTER>THE BAMBERTON CODE</CENTER>
</H3>
<BR>
We, the builders and residents of the town of Bamberton, stand by the following
intentions : 
<OL>
<LI><B>That Bamberton represents</B> a way of living which seeks to serve
the needs both of our own generation, and of generations to come.<BR>
<B><BR>
<LI>That Bamberton represents</B> a new possibility for the way people co-exist
with nature, upholding the ideal of responsible stewardship, and seeking
to be ecologically sustainable in the use of natural resources such as water,
soil, habitat, energy and raw materials.<BR>
<B><BR>
<LI>That Bamberton represents</B> a rediscovery of the traditional virtues
of community, being conducive to social interaction, care and mutual support,
encouraging of responsibility in the pursuit of shared goals, and supportive
of cultural and artistic richness.<BR>
<B><BR>
<LI>That Bamberton represents</B> a new possibility for the building of
a self-reliant, local community economy, emphasizing enterprise and initiative;
the contribution of labor; mutual economic support; innovation, research
and development; personal, social and global responsibility; and long-term
ecological sustainability.<BR>
<B><BR>
<LI>That Bamberton represents</B> a positive opportunity for all who call
Bamberton home, being encouraging of creativity, learning and growth, and
nurturing of a deep appreciation of the gift of life. 
</OL>
<BR>
The Code and the Design Principles will be used to guide future development,
and to keep future partners, builders and residents mindful of the intentions
and commitments underlying the project.<BR>
<BR>
Once built, a town may exist for thousands of years. Perhaps more than anyone
else, the builders and designers of a new town are accountable to future
generations, and their unspoken needs. In honour of this trust, they must
endeavour to reflect the needs of the future in the designs of the present.<BR>

<H1><CENTER>Transforming Inner-City Los Angeles</CENTER>
</H1>

<H4><CENTER><I>by Lois Arkin</I></CENTER>
</H4>
<I><BR>
Lois Arkin was a co-organizer of the first Los Angeles Eco-Cities Conference,
co-founder of the Eco-Cities Council, founder and executive director of
the 13-year-old Cooperative Resources and Services Project (CRSP) and co-editor
of the books </I>Sustainable Cities: Concepts and Strategies for Eco-City
Development<I> and </I>Cooperative Housing Compendium.<I><BR>
<BR>
She has been a primary inspiration and keeper of the vision for the Los
Angeles Eco-Village project, which had been planned for an old landfill
site.<BR>
<BR>
Recently, the group decided to shift its focus to an inner-city neighborhood
that has been home to CRSP and Lois for 13 years. The group is committed
to maintaining the neighborhood's rich mix of cultures, income groups, family
structures, and lifestyles. <BR>
<BR>
In this article, Lois describes the emerging processes for retrofitting
this diverse neighborhood for sustainability and a more active community
life.</I><BR>
<BR>
Last year's civil uprising in Los Angeles left sections of the city in ruins.
The physical rebuilding has barely begun, and where it has, it tragically
replicates the unsustainable design and patterns of life disrupted by the
fire. <BR>
<BR>
People continue to leave the city in droves - some because of the region's
economic downturn, others because they are frightened and disillusioned.<BR>
<BR>
But among those who are staying, a growing number are engaged in healing
the city. From public housing tenants to block clubs to study groups within
public agencies, people are organizing, dialoging, and learning. Their agendas
are growing more and more consistent: empowerment for social, economic,
and environmental justice. <BR>
<BR>
The message is being heard in City Hall, where officials responsible for
neighborhood planning and revising the city's General Plan are seeking out
ways to engage the public in the planning process.<BR>
<BR>
Projects and programs are springing up throughout the area addressing bits
and pieces of the sustainability puzzle. Among them are graywater projects,
energy and water conservation demonstrations, organic gardens, a community-supported
agriculture movement, and an Eco-Home movement. There are also efforts to
unpave L.A., restore the L.A. River, create urban forestry, and stop various
freeways and street widenings. There are moves toward affordable and co-op
housing and cohousing, green businesses and ecological economic development.<BR>
<BR>
Now there is a single project that seeks to combine all these elements in
a single sustainable neighborhood demonstration, the L.A. Eco-Village at
Bimini-White House Place. <BR>
<BR>
On the day before Christmas 1992, I was talking to Esfandiar Abbassi, the
garden coordinator for our block, about recycling the 4-foot stack of cardboard
that has been collecting from our daily trip to the supermarket to bring
back produce clippings for composting. He commented that the city would
pick up the cardboard for recycling and all we needed to do was bind it
up in appropriate-sized piles.<BR>
<BR>
I'd been collecting twine from newspapers and our newsletter stacks for
several years, believing that some day there would be a use for it. It looked
like this was it! So, out came the box of 1- to 2-foot lengths of nylon
twine to be tied together. Soon Ming Gook, Dae Han, Johnnie, and James were
gathered around Esfandiar curious about what he was doing and how they could
help. These neighbor children, aged four to twelve, started making a game
of tying the strings together. Meanwhile, Esfandiar talked with the children
about gardening, composting, art, sports, Christmas, and his native Iran
and listened to their thoughts and concerns while tying the strings. <BR>
<BR>
In about an hour, the string was strung around poles across the street,
down the block - maybe 1,500 feet of it. Four-year old James insisted on
rolling it all up on a stick when we were through, and a fine job he did
of it, too.<BR>
<BR>
Later, Esfandiar was out on the street playing touch football with the kids
while I practiced tennis on the sidewalk with 10-year-old Johnnie. Mary
Maverick, who works with the composting and organic gardening project, came
by bearing a box of her wonderful ginger cookies for all.<BR>
<BR>
The night before, several members of our Eco-Village Planning group joined
me for Christmas caroling. In the 13 years I'd lived on this block, never
had there been caroling. As the five of us caroled, we met many new folks
in our two-block neighborhood and gathered information on their skills for
the local community currency system we're helping to organize. 
<H4>WHOLE-SYSTEMS ORGANIZING</H4>
These seemingly unrelated events are typical of the seeds needed to grow
a sustainable urban neighborhood or eco-village out of a damaged central
city area. Spontaneous encounters and working together build trust and a
sense of community. When neighbors see people of good will having fun on
the streets, they are more likely to join in, expanding a healthy sense
of play and good neighborliness. This helps neighborhood residents recapture
hope, reclaim the streets from automobiles and crime, and move into cycles
of empowerment. This is whole-systems or cyclic thinking, as distinct from
the linear approach characteristic of unsustainable practices.<BR>
<BR>
In cyclic or whole-systems thinking, everything is related. There are many
reasons for doing something. For example, Dianne and I take a walk down
the block together not only to chat with each other and get our exercise,
but to share the synergy of our joyous togetherness with anyone who happens
to be in our path, look for recyclable &quot;trash&quot; for the garden
and other projects, and more easily include neighbors in spontaneous conversations
that one of us alone might otherwise be somewhat shy about.<BR>
<BR>
A whole-systems approach to sustainable neighborhood planning and development
is interactive and collaborative. This kind of planning recognizes the value
of spontaneity and chaos as essential to innovation and creativity. It is
sensitive and respectful of the pace at which people can learn, plan, &quot;own,&quot;
and incorporate the changes.<BR>
<BR>
A neighborhood is sustainable when its economic, social, and physical systems
are sustainable. The emphasis is always on the people and how they can take
care of themselves and their environment in healthy ways that do not jeopardize
the ability of future generations to do the same. This is the stuff, then,
from whence eco-villages are made - a critical mass of people within a small
geographic area who are regularly thinking and acting in whole-systems ways.
<H4>ACTING LOCALLY</H4>
The Los Angeles Eco-Village is one place where these ideas are rapidly coming
together. Three miles west of downtown Los Angeles, at the north end of
last year's civil uprisings, this two-block mixed-use neighborhood is home
to approximately 500 people in a dozen somewhat run-down but architecturally
significant buildings. Although the neighborhood has been home to CRSP and
to me for the past 13 years, until recently we thought of ourselves as transitioning
out of the neighborhood. We had planned to create the eco-village on an
11-acre city-owned landfill site and its adjacent neighborhoods about seven
miles northeast of the current location. <BR>
<BR>
Our decision to stay and work on retrofitting the neighborhood we've called
home for so long evolved out of our commitment to participate in the healing
of our city. Our neighborhood had been the site of four major fires; my
home, the CRSP office, and several of our wonderful old buildings had been
threatened with fire during the uprisings. How, we asked, could we most
effectively introduce whole-systems planning to heal and provide a model
of sustainability in neighborhoods that have already been built up?<BR>
<BR>
At the same time, some of us were seriously rethinking our position concerning
urban development and open space issues. Contrary to popular myth, our city
is underdeveloped and, almost uniformly, inappropriately developed. Our
commercial corridors, with endless miles of single-story development and
ugly strip malls, could be transformed into beautiful three- to five-story
compact mixed-use areas interspersed with open space along tree-lined sidewalks
with bicycle, pedestrian, and mass transit-friendly streets. <BR>
<BR>
There should be incentives and mandates to help owners of large tracts of
open space transfer their development rights for use in underdeveloped urban
areas. Open spaces should no longer be developed, but rather protected and
restored so they can once again become part of the planet's life support
system.<BR>
<BR>
So you can see, our hearts were no longer set on creating yet another new
- sexy maybe, but nonetheless unnecessary - development! <BR>
<BR>
Meantime, Esfandiar had started composting and gardening in our backyard,
and Dianne Herring, a second-year graduate landscape architecture student
and co-coordinator of Eco-Village, was thinking that the old landfill would
make a great site for community supported agriculture.<BR>
<BR>
It all added up! Twenty-five members of the Eco-Village Advisory and Planning
Group unanimously and enthusiastically agreed that we could have the greatest
impact where it was needed most - by retrofitting our own neighborhood for
sustainability. 
<H4>AN ECO-VILLAGE VISION</H4>
Our own neighborhood already has many of the elements we hoped to develop
in an eco-village. It's an established mixed-use neighborhood with good
access to public transportation and job opportunities. Social, ethnic, and
income groups are diverse and in balanced proportions with many Asian, Latino,
Anglo, and African-American residents. The 500 people in our neighborhood
is a small enough number to ensure that we can all get to know one another
and build trust, and each feel we can influence the direction of the community.<BR>
<BR>
A major feature planned for the L.A. Eco-Village during the coming decade
is the acquisition of existing apartment buildings for conversion to permanently
affordable, cooperative ownership for the community's very low- to moderate-income
current and future residents. Some of the buildings will lend themselves
nicely to cohousing and other collaborative housing arrangements. We are
also promoting changes in city law that will protect neighborhoods such
as ours from gentrification. Without such a policy, increasing a neighborhood's
sustainability will also increase the value of real estate, driving out
the very people who improved the neighborhood. <BR>
<BR>
Our other plans for economic systems include a credit union, socially responsible
investment opportunities for neighbors and others, and non-polluting livelihood
opportunities through a community-owned neighborhood Eco-Business Incubator.
A Local Exchange Trading System (LETS) and community revolving loan fund
are already established.<BR>
<BR>
We also hope to restore the Bimini Baths, a hot mineral springs 2,000 feet
below the surface of our neighborhood. To our surprise, the industrial building
we had targeted for the restoration became available this year, and we're
working with other economic development groups on acquiring the building
for community ownership. Bimini means &quot;sacred site of healing,&quot;
a perfect match for what Eco-Village stands for.<BR>
<BR>
We also plan extensive &quot;street calming&quot; to slow the traffic, including
the unpaving of some traffic lanes for open-space community uses. The intersection
of the two four-lane streets in our neighborhood will be transformed into
a plaza. A three-day-a-week flea market, organized by a local El Salvadoran
family, an Earth Day organic fruit tree planting at the four corners of
the intersection, and Saturday morning brunches (sometimes right out into
the middle of the intersection with our handmade &quot;Thank you for slowing
down&quot; signs) have already begun to set the tone for a plaza. Monthly
neighborhood potlucks have begun in front of the buildings surrounding the
proposed plaza, and outdoor videos and films on a variety of sustainability
topics are scheduled for hot summer evenings over the next few months.<BR>
<BR>
Organic urban agriculture, an orchard, and community composting have already
begun within the neighborhood; rooftop and vertical gardens will be added
as viable. Planned water conservation and biological gray water reclamation
could cut our water use by 85 percent. Retrofits for energy efficiency can
reduce our conventional energy requirements by about 75 percent. We're also
talking about implementing waste-to-resource systems, retrofitting adjacent
commercial strips to mixed-use residential and commercial, retrofitting
buildings with non-toxic regional and recycled building materials, and operating
community-owned non-polluting vehicle pools.<BR>
<BR>
CRSP is already functioning as a community transformation center; neighbors
are dropping in to get information on a variety of interests and needs.
Bi-weekly dialogue groups bring speakers to the neighborhood to facilitate
dialogue on sustainability issues in Spanish, Korean, and Vietnamese. There
is a monthly newsletter, a tree steward group of a dozen children, ages
four to twelve, weekly open-houses, and monthly community meetings. The
current emphasis on community organizing is helping to build friendships,
trust, and leadership skills among neighborhood residents. <BR>
<BR>
On another front, we have developed input for inclusion in the City's Community
Plan, General Plan, and Housing Element regarding eco-village concepts.
<H4>&quot;ECO-VILLAGE IS A STATE OF MIND!&quot;</H4>
We are a neighborhood in the process of transcending the accident of our
residential choice to become an intentional community. Others are starting
to move here because eco-village energy is starting to concentrate in exciting
ways.<BR>
<BR>
Recently, Dianne Herring, co-coordinator of the L.A. Eco-Village, enthusiastically
said at an eco-village dialogue group, &quot;Eco-Village is a state of mind.
You think and you play around and you talk about and work on all these systems,
and eventually other people start doing it with you. And soon, it just jumps
out at you and you are thinking in Eco-Village systems about everything!&quot;<BR>
<BR>
An alignment is taking place as we realize we have to begin transformation
where we are. When we have the skills and knowledge to heal ourselves, our
neighborhoods, our cities, our planet, we have the public responsibility
to do so. There is no more time for narcissistic waiting and searching &quot;for
the place where I can live happily ever after.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
We believe our city, our bioregion, and the world at large desperately need
inner-city models of sustainable neighborhoods. We, too, have a longing
for community and meaningful work in the context of the pain of our city,
and the pain that it has brought to the planet through its giant media machine.
We are elated to be doing something about it!<BR>

<I><BR>
Inner-city neighborhoods don't have to erode into slums, and they don't
have to be gentrified. They can be restored and maintained for their original
mission: as healthy environments for people of diverse means to live, work,
and grow together. <BR>
<BR>
Some residents of the Sabin Neighborhood, in inner-city Portland, Oregon,
are using cohousing to anchor the community and provide support for women
who need a fresh start.<BR>
<BR>
For more information about cohousing, see Resources Guide on p. 60, a self-portrait
of Winslow Cohousing on page 39, and IC #14 and #21. </I><BR>
<BR>
The Sabin neighborhood is on the slippery slope many urban communities face
as they age. Income levels tend to be low, and houses on some streets are
sliding into ruin. Paradoxically, the low real estate prices coupled with
the neighborhood's proximity to downtown Portland are attracting affluent
buyers and, with them, the gentrification projects that have already priced
long-time residents out of other neighborhoods in town.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;The gentrification is happening faster than the deterioration,&quot;
said neighborhood activist Claudia Delgado. Gentrification may look nicer
than ghetto-ization, but it's just as disruptive to the existing community.
<BR>
<BR>
Rather than moving to newer turf, though, a group of energetic neighbors
has put down roots to bind the community together. OnGoing Concerns cohousing
is one of the flowers.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;We were always doing work in this neighborhood,&quot; said Diane Meisenhelter.
&quot;And creating housing with extended family networks that provided a
real strong point on the block seemed like one good way to stabilize the
community.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Diane is also a member of the Sabin Community Development Corporation, which
supports many community-strengthening projects, but focuses most of its
attention on affordable housing in this mixed race, lower-income community.
The SCDC is working to create a community land trust that would take land
out of the speculative real estate market, hold prices down, and reduce
absentee ownership. 
<H4>RESOURCE EFFICIENT; COST EFFICIENT</H4>
Members of OnGoing Concerns individually bought<B> </B>seven old, deteriorating
houses, then took out the fences separating their adjoining backyards. A
jointly-owned community kitchen and meeting room was recently added on to
one of the houses. <BR>
<BR>
The start-up period was unusually swift; only six months passed between
the first discussions and the first move-ins. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;We wanted to just get living and focus on the other things we're doing,
like the community development corporation, the multicultural festival,
the barter network, and the tree planting,&quot; Diane said.<BR>
<BR>
The initial investment was also lower than in many custom-built cohousing
communities; the houses were each bought for $30,000 to $60,000. <BR>
<BR>
One goal was to demonstrate &quot;that cohousing works not just for yuppies,
but for low-income and middle-income folks as well,&quot; Diane said. &quot;And
it's a resource-saving approach that can actually lower people's living
cost.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Of course, it wasn't exactly as cheap, quick, and easy as that. Two years
after moving in, the group is still working on rehabilitating the houses
and creating the common space.<BR>
<BR>
Insulation has been upgraded in the houses, and three houses have solar
water heaters. Double-pane windows and rain barrels are common, and recycled
building materials are used extensively in the renovations. Members also
use &quot;eco-landscaping&quot;: planting grape arbors in front of windows,
for instance, to shade the house in summer but let warming sunlight through
in winter. <BR>
<BR>
A composting toilet is planned for the common kitchen, but the resource-recovery
systems needn't be fancy or expensive - part of the graywater system is
a garden hose running from the upstairs bathtub down to the garden. <BR>
<BR>
Neighbors of OnGoing Concerns can borrow tools from the group's tool bank,
join the food-buying club, or let their kids play where they're sure an
adult will be nearby. Encouraged by the example, a number of those neighbors
are trying to join their homes into new cohousing clusters. 
<H4>A COHOUSING SUPPORT SYSTEM</H4>
OnGoing Concerns and the SCDC are also raising money and providing technical
support for another Sabin cohousing project, planned for and by African-Americans,
called Ujima. The Swahili word means &quot;collective work and responsibility.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Claudia Delgado, chair of the planning committee, said the heart of Ujima
will be two halfway houses for women completing drug- or alcohol-abuse treatment.
A partnership with the county correctional authority will allow women on
parole or probation to spend time there as part of a community re-integration
program.<BR>
<BR>
Some women have supportive families to help them get back to normal life,
Claudia said, but many have nothing. It's too easy to slip back into substance
abuse, or crime.<BR>
<BR>
At present, there are no halfway houses in Sabin. &quot;It's almost a punishment
that they can't come back here,&quot; she said. &quot;To be isolated from
that support is to undermine their recovery.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Elders, young people, and families of different types will live at Ujima,
probably renting low-cost homes owned by the SCDC, Claudia said. They'll
provide role models, friendship and a group for the women in the halfway
houses to belong to, she said. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Originally we'd hoped to have OnGoing Concerns be a mixed community,&quot;
Diane said. &quot;But our African-American friends said they preferred to
have a kind of cultural cohesion; they didn't necessarily want to eat tofu.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
The two groups may have different styles and different cultures, but they
are working toward a common goal: a stronger community. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;We've been working very closely together,&quot; Claudia said. &quot;Especially
now that we're kicking the Ujima project into high gear.&quot; <BR>

<H1><CENTER>Village Homes</CENTER>
</H1>
<H4><CENTER><I>by Bill Browning and Kim Hamilton</I></CENTER>
</H4>
<I><BR>
In 1973 renegade architect/developer Michael Corbett acquired a 70-acre
site in Davis, California. His plan was to design a model community that
would incorporate aggressive energy conservation with solar energy. Residential
clusters of various types would be interspersed with commercial and agricultural
uses, while common areas would enhance social interaction. <BR>
<BR>
Village Homes was completed in 1982, and the community has become one of
the most desirable in California's Central Valley. Bill Browning heads the
<A HREF="http://www.rmi.org/rmi_Green_Development.html">Green Development
Program</A> at <A HREF="http://www.rmi.org/">Rocky Mountain Institute</A>
and Kim Hamilton is a freelance writer.</I><BR>
<BR>
Village Homes has vindicated many of the experimental architectural and
land-use ideas of architect/developer Michael Corbett. Over the strenuous
objections of city planning and public works departments and the FHA, Michael
pressed for and accomplished a visionary design that has paid off in unexpected
bonuses both for the environment and for the residents of Village Homes.<BR>
<BR>
The narrow, tree-lined streets of Village Homes run east to west and feed
out to an adjacent minor arterial street. Houses are oriented north-south
along the streets to maximize solar exposure. Carports or garages and small
fenced and landscaped courtyards face the street. <BR>
<BR>
Streets are much narrower than conventional subdivision streets to discourage
traffic and allow trees to shade the road during the Central Valley's intense
summer heat. <BR>
<BR>
The concept of using narrower streets is one example of Michael's holistic
design approach, in which unexpected benefits arise from environmentally
governed choices. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;You know you're on the right track when you notice that your solution
for one problem accidentally solved several other problems,&quot; Michael
says. &quot;When you minimize the use of automobiles to conserve fossil
fuels, for example, this also reduces noise, conserves land by minimizing
streets and parking, beautifies the neighborhood, and makes it safer for
children.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
An additional unanticipated benefit of the narrower streets is that the
air temperature over the street is 10 to 15 degrees lower than surrounding
neighborhoods during the hot summer months. This is attributed both to a
reduction in the heat-soaking asphalt mass and the mature trees, which shade
more of the street area than would occur in a typical development.<BR>
<BR>
Initial concerns on the part of city planning officials regarding the ability
of emergency vehicles to negotiate the streets were met by mandatory 30-foot
easements on both sides of the street.<BR>
<BR>
Despite official concerns, the crime rate at Village Homes is only 10 percent
of the average for Davis, according to the Police Department.<B> <BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE><I>Village Homes site map (north is to the left). Two circulation
networks interlock: one is a set of roads; the other is the pedestrian network.

<H4>SOLAR GAIN CUTS ENERGY COSTS </H4>
Although most homes are single-family detached, there are some duplexes
and one co-op building. Styles vary from New<B> </B>Mexican and Northwestern
wood to California modern, with a few earth-sheltered homes.<BR>
<BR>
Solar energy contributes between 50 percent and 75 percent of heat needs.
All of the houses have 60 percent or more of their glazing on the south
side. The most basic solar features are calculated overhangs on south facades,
which shade the houses in the summer, but allow sun into the homes in the
winter. They also have extra insulation in roofs, and concrete slab construction
for thermal mass. Almost all the homes have solar hot water systems with
collector panels on the roof. <BR>
<BR>
Some homes have other systems which contribute to further solar gains. For
example, long-time resident Paul Tarzi's home has a sunroom/atrium with
skylights between the entry and the house. Heated air from the atrium is
blown through tubes under the house to the farthest corners of the house.
It then filters back up through a rock and tile floor. This system provides
about 10 percent of the household's heat. 
<H4>EDIBLE LANDSCAPING </H4>
Homeowners had the opportunity to provide input on the landscaping of the
common areas between the clusters of houses. Grass, shrubbery, sandboxes,
fire pits, and gardens were among the features chosen. All of the commons
included some fruit-bearing trees and shrubs. <BR>
<BR>
Residents grow vegetables, fruits, flowers, and herbs for home use and sale
to markets and restaurants. Michael planted a vineyard and several orchards,
which have matured, producing almonds, cherries, peaches, pears, persimmons,
and plums. Residents may freely harvest all crops with the exception of
almonds, which are harvested mechanically and sold, contributing about $3,000
annually to the maintenance fund. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;The aesthetics are remarkable now that the landscaping has matured,&quot;
Michael says. &quot;I think the pedestrian orientation and narrow streets
give it a very picturesque, rather European feeling. In fact, Village Homes
has become quite popular with non-residents who come often to stroll the
grounds.&quot; 
<H4>NATURAL DRAINAGE SYSTEMS</H4>
Running through the common areas is a network of drainage swales, a natural
alternative to expensive and wasteful storm drains. The system works like
this: <BR>
<BR>
In the typical subdivision, lots are graded toward the street. In Village
Homes, lots are graded away from the street so that rainwater trickling
off roofs and lawns finds its way into shallow swales landscaped like seasonal
streambeds with rocks, bushes, and trees. Runoff from the streets goes directly
into these larger channels. Small check dams help slow the flow and prevent
surges downstream. In heavier rains, the system empties some water into
the city's storm drains, but not nearly as much as would run off a typical
subdivision. <BR>
<BR>
The design saved approximately $800 per household in up-front costs which
was applied to landscaping enhancements. This system continues to provide
savings; the landscaping requires just two-thirds the watering of surrounding
developments because of the denser plantings and extra water provided by
the drainage system.<B> <BR>

<H4>A SENSE OF COMMUNITY</H4>
Village Homes was designed to facilitate neighborhood interaction within
subgroups of eight homes. Each house in the grouping faces a shared green
space linked to other green spaces by a network of pedestrian paths. <BR>
<BR>
Paul Tarzi, a resident of Village Homes since 1979, says the design works
well. &quot;The open spaces and play areas are well used and provide casual
meeting opportunities,&quot; he says. &quot;You're just more accessible
to your neighbors.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Paul's neighborhood group has had weekly potlucks for years. &quot;It's
something that people look forward to,&quot; he says. &quot;Everyone has
an orange flag they put out that day if they intend to come.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
The architect's efforts to enhance community cohesion have worked, both
at the neighborhood and the community-wide scale. Village Homes has community
events both planned and spontaneous throughout the year, including an annual
fall harvest party. <BR>
<BR>
Playing fields and numerous playgrounds dot the common areas. There is a
well-used solar-heated community center and swimming pool. The community
center is used as a day-care center and meeting facility. Nearby is a small
commercial building where residents rent space for their businesses. 
<H4>COMING OF AGE</H4>
Village Homes has proven to be a great environment for kids, according to
Paul, who has raised two children there. &quot;There's a play area right
outside our house and the kids made lots of good friends. The only difficulty
was, as they grew up and left, they had to adjust to the idea that the world
is not like Village Homes.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Although turnover is very low, the few families who have left Village Homes
have realized dramatic appreciation on their homes. In 1991, houses at Village
Homes were selling for a premium of $11 per square foot over other Davis
developments, demonstrating that features once considered of questionable
value by some have become not only mainstream, but extremely desirable.
More typical than moving away is movement within Village Homes or additions
made to original structures.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;We're finding that because people feel they've benefitted from the
community and enjoy where they are, they are committed to giving something
back,&quot; Paul says. &quot;This is paid out in terms of people's willingness
to serve on the board or get involved in ongoing community projects. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;A community is more than a physical location. It's a feeling of kinship.
Living at Village Homes has enhanced our lives in many ways. I guess I could
say I'm looking forward to growing old here.&quot;<BR>

<H1><CENTER>Community-Scale Technologies</CENTER>
</H1>
<H4><CENTER><I>by Bruce Coldham</I></CENTER>
</H4>
<BR>
A contemporary sage recently quipped - &quot;Technology is the answer ...
but what was the question?&quot; Much of the discussion of sustainable living
centers on technologies that improve efficiencies and conserve species.
However, technological innovation requires some form of social organization
to support its application <BR>
<BR>
The appropriateness of technologies varies with scale. A successful collaborative
micro-community, such as a cohousing community, offers an intermediate scale
between the single family and the town or municipality, thereby expanding
the palette of technologies that can be applied. The following are just
a few examples of what becomes possible at the community-scale:<BR>
<BR>
<B>Central heating and cooling -</B> A central heating system for a small
group of attached clustered houses is cheaper to install and maintain and
will operate more efficiently than a collection of individual heating systems.
<BR>
<BR>
An annual-cycle solar thermal heating system requires clustering and large
thermal storage. Such a system can only be done economically at this scale
as Swedish prototypes have so far demonstrated.<BR>
<BR>
Large, fast burning combustion and gasifying devices are cleaner and more
efficient than their smaller wood-burning cousins. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Transportation efficiency -</B> Residents of cohousing communities or
of neighborhoods with close social cohesion tend to use their carsless.
Less time is required for driving children around in search of playmates.
Carpooling, and even car sharing, is a reasonable prospect between households
that have close ties. When the community supports opportunities to work
at home or offers a telecommuting center, fewer people have to drive to
work.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Food production - </B>The close clustering of building in support of
shared common facilities creates potential for retaining larger chunks of
arable land. <BR>
<BR>
There is a natural marriage awaiting community-supported agriculture and
clustered residential communities. Farmers with a secure, long-term tenure
over the land can confidently invest the years needed to build up the soil.
The organic wastes of the community are easily returned to the land. <BR>
<BR>
The community, as both producer and consumer, is close enough to both provide
the casual labor at critical times during the season and to guarantee a
market for much of the produce. A community kitchen is a convenient and
lively setting for processing the harvest for storage through winter and
spring.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Bioshelters - </B>In Europe, some cohousing communities, which began
as courtyard arrangements focusing on a common house, have today evolved
to become integrated structures. Attached houses face each other across
glazed &quot;streets&quot; or galleries, which act as spinal, sun-tempered
common spaces providing sheltered access to shared facilities as well as
play spaces for children and year-round community living rooms.<BR>
<BR>
It is a small step to imagining, and then adjusting, these spaces at least
in part to work as community bioshelters in which food could be produced,
plants started in support of seasonal agriculture, and biological waste
treatment processes accommodated in a temperate, year-round environment.<BR>
<BR>
These projects may sound ambitious to groups that are struggling just to
build functional communities. However, we should think about what might
be in 30 or 40 years when we are operating on a completely different energy
and resources basis. We should be thinking about how conventional wisdoms
might change, and how we can at least retain options for the additionof
technologies that we can now reasonably predict as intelligent and sustaining.
<BR>
<BR>
We can keep options open by: 
<UL>
<LI>orienting buildings and sloping roofs appropriately;<BR>
<BR>
<LI>locating buildings at higher elevations; <BR>
<BR>
<LI>knowing where future cisterns or ponds will be located and how roof
water will be gotten to them; <BR>
<BR>
<LI>thinking about how access to potentially productive land might be maintained.
</UL>
<BR>
Clustered communities with sufficient social cohesion to plan and carry
out technical innovations at the community scale are fundamental to achieving
such a transformation to a self-reliant, sustainable, productive society.<BR>

<H1><CENTER>Winslow Cohousing: A Self-Portrait</CENTER>
</H1>
<H3><CENTER></CENTER>
</H3>
<H4><CENTER><I>interviews by Sarah van Gelder</I></CENTER>
</H4>
<BR>
Perhaps more than most kinds of intentional communities, cohousing is founded
on the premise that the design and layout of houses, common spaces, sidewalks,
and parking can either foster or inhibit a sense of community.<BR>
<BR>
At Winslow Cohousing, like most cohousing communities, homes are tightly
clustered, leaving space for orchards, organic gardens, play fields, forested
land, and small gathering spaces along pedestrian pathways. Cars are kept
to the periphery, making the outdoors an inviting, safe space for both adults
and children. The Common House, with facilities for community meals and
other gatherings, is the focus of community life.<BR>
<BR>
The cohousing concept was brought to North America from Denmark (where cohousing
has been flourishing for 20 years) by Kathryn McCamant and Charles Durrett,
a husband and wife team with a background in architecture and environmental
design (see <I>IC</I> #14 and #21).<BR>
<BR>
But this story is not about the theory or design of cohousing communities;
it's a self-portrait by the first group in the US to develop and build a
cohousing community. Sarah van Gelder, <I>IC</I> managing editor and one
of the early members of the community, interviewed her neighbors about the
ways their lives have changed since they moved into the community one year
ago. Therese K&uuml;nzi-Clark, also a cohousing member, took the photographs
for this article. <BR>
<BR>
As of this writing, there was room for two more households to join the community.
For information, write Winslow Cohousing, 353 Wallace Way, Bainbridge Island,
WA 98110. For other cohousing information, see page 60. <B><I><BR>
<BR>
Jane Trancho, </I></B><I>40, office administrator for a steel fabrication
company, mother of Aiden (age 9) and Courtney (age 11).</I><BR>
<BR>
Before we moved into cohousing, we lived in a nice single family house in
Seattle in a nice spot. We had nice neighbors and all that, but I kept looking
around. When I saw the flyer about Winslow Cohousing, it was something really
intuitive - I knew this was the piece that was missing and I just didn't
turn back. <BR>
<BR>
I feel better about my kids growing up here. I can't be around all the time,
but I know there's someone looking out for my kids. I know that they're
in a place where, not only are they safer than in a single-family house
situation, but they're also getting support and caring. <BR>
<BR>
There are times when cohousing is a mixed blessing. Moving here added a
lot of time to my commute, and all the meetings and all the decisions and
all the interactions take a lot of work. <BR>
<BR>
There are times when I feel really frustrated and I go, &quot;I've had it
with this. I'm leaving!&quot; Then I think, I can't leave. There's so much
here that is so good; just being able to talk with your neighbors and know
that, even if you have an argument, if push comes to shove, if you need
something, they're going to be there. That's one thing that is so amazing
about this place. So for all of its frustrations, I can't leave!<BR>
<BR>
I look at being here long term. I'm putting in my little garden in the backyard
and planning what it may look like in 10 - 20 years, feeling that this is
where I am going to stay. <B><I><BR>
<BR>
Patsy Casey,</I></B><I> 48, is one of the founding members of Winslow Cohousing
and the mother of Alison (age 17) and Ian (age 19). </I><BR>
<BR>
I have an especially good time with the little ones. I love the way they
view the world. Nina [age 2], for example, was visiting me, along with Isabelle,
Emily, and Ian [all age 2]. She had gone into my bed where Moji the cat
was asleep, and he woke up and snuggled next to her face putting his wet
nose on her forehead, and that just thrilled her to no end. She came out
and said with her lisp: &quot;Pathy, Pathy, Moji kithed me, Moji kithed
me. He kithed me right on my ...&quot; she patted her forehead and couldn't
think of the word, then her eyes lit up, &quot;... he kithed me right on
my ceiling!&quot; <BR>
<BR>
My daughter Alison won't be at home all that much longer, but I can see
her forming very close friendships and feeling good knowing that there are
grown-ups around her who like her and value her and who she can be herself
with. <BR>
<BR>
As for myself, I'm going through a really hard personal transition. Being
here in cohousing has made a <I>big</I> difference. Not so much that I talk
about it with everyone, but most people sense that I'm kind of vulnerable,
and there's a softness about the way I'm treated. They can tell when I've
had a bad day, and there'll be a hug or two, or a pat. It's clear that the
people care and that they know that I have to go through this myself, but
they're with me in it. <BR>
<BR>
When you are going through a grief process, you're feeling the anger and
the tears, and you're into denial and rage, and you never know what's going
to happen; it sort of comes in waves over you. It's important for you to
be in a place where you can have time by yourself. Even though I'm in one
of the smallest units, and even though I am basically an introverted person,
I've never felt intruded upon. I've always felt that I have as much space
as I need to be by myself, to heal myself. <BR>
<BR>
That was one of our goals, because there was a lot of concern that we were
going to share ourselves <I>ad nauseam</I>. I think we can pat ourselves
on the back and say, &quot;Hey, we did manage to create a very nice balance.&quot;
People can have their needs for solitude met, as well as their needs for
community. <B><I><BR>
<BR>
Kim Clark</I></B><I>, 36, is a computer analyst, father of Patsy's good
friend Nina (age 2) as well as Lucas (age 7), and a great bike mechanic
.</I><BR>
<BR>
Nina and Patsy are a great combination; that eases our burden a lot. <BR>
<BR>
It's really special that Nina can walk across the sidewalk by herself to
Ian's house; that's a unique experience for a two-year-old. As a parent
I've benefited when, for example, Tim takes the kids sledding, Jeff gives
us things that are broken and Lucas gets to take them apart. <BR>
<BR>
I think we have developed a shared sense of what it takes to get along together.
We are all willing to be a little softer, to listen to people, and to reconsider
what we want in light of what other people want. <BR>
<BR>
At this stage of our society, I think we have to develop skills to get along
better. I'm a person that tries to live my ideals, and so it seems like
my only choice was to do this. <BR>
<BR>
<B><I>Therese K&uuml;nzi-Clark, </I></B><I>36, is a member of the cohousing
board, Kim Clark's wife, the photographer for this article, and Nina's and
Lucas' mother. She grew up in Switzerland.<BR>
</I><BR>
I have a much better support system here than I did when we lived back East.
When we first moved here, Kim was sick in the hospital. I had people helping
me with the move and taking care of the children; I don't know how I would
have dealt with that emergency if we had just moved from one house to another.
<BR>
<BR>
Then when my mom died, we were even thinking of leaving the kids here when
we went to Switzerland for the funeral, feeling comfortable that they have
a support system here.<BR>
<BR>
It's great to cook once a week and be able to eat the other times without
spending that time cooking. The other day, I made a meal just for our family
and spent two hours, and I thought, I much prefer cooking for a big group
of people - it only takes an hour more. I used to spend a lot of time in
the car driving Lucas to his friends' houses and making appointments to
see his friends. It's totally different here, because he can just take off
on his own. <BR>
<BR>
It's fun to see the kids grow and to get to know people better. We will
be here for awhile and are living together every day, so we don't have to
rush relationships.<BR>
<BR>
I keep looking at my needs versus the community's needs. Do I need a study
in my unit or could I just have a little space for my art supplies in the
barn, if we ever have a barn? How much of my energy do I want to put into
the common facilities? <BR>
<BR>
It's important for me to share and not use up too many resources. We don't
all need three cars, lawn mowers, big yards. It's important to me to preserve
some land and live a little more simply.<B><I><BR>
<BR>
Paulie Thadigsman, </I></B><I>60 (going on 14), was, until her recent retirement,
a psychiatric nurse. She and her husband Jim are preparing to leave the
home in which they raised their seven children to move into their cohousing
unit.</I><BR>
<BR>
I don't like living in isolation. We're leaving a lovely home on the lake
with manicured lawns and icy cold neighbors, and I feel that I'm not leaving
anything behind, but I'm coming to something very positive.<BR>
<BR>
I've known the people in this community now for three and a half years;
some of them are closer to me than members of my own family, with the exception
of my kids. <BR>
<BR>
The children here are always so warm and receptive. So often I've seen young
kids afraid of old people or poking fun at them, and withdrawing from them.
I'd like to be able to convey to the kids a healthy respect for older people
and to convey to them that older people still do things like ski and sail
and hike. <BR>
<BR>
I surmise that I remind the kids here of grandparents, whom they see very
sporadically. I gush and ohh and ahh over them and tell them how important
they are and how much I love them. So when they see me, they come up and
give me hugs and kisses and remember that I bring treats sometimes, and
I certainly am going to spoil them much of the time, and that's a good feeling.
<B><I><BR>
<BR>
Tom Moench</I></B>, 43, is <I>a quality consultant, the husband of Ann Chadwick,
and the father of Theora (age 5).</I><BR>
<BR>
There's something about this place that is very nurturing; the sounds and
smells. I like just walking around and saying hello or striking up conversations
with people. I know that if I want to learn something or vent that there's
a place to go. <BR>
<BR>
One of my expectations about cohousing was that Theora would have an opportunity
to really engage and play with other kids. What I didn't expect is that
she would so totally lose interest in television. Now she always has some
place to put her energy and something interesting to do and she experiences
children of all different ages. She doesn't have time for television.<BR>
<BR>
Life here has been more of a challenge for the adults. Before we moved here,
it was like you were private, and to have community or to have other people
you had to call them up and have them come over. <BR>
<BR>
Now it's like you gotta try to figure out some way <I>not</I> to have them
come over. There's constantly a kind of pulling and beckoning you in, so
you can't just throw up your hands and say 'I'm not part of the larger whole.'<BR>
<BR>
Which means, of course, that the architectural design is working. It's much
easier to get solitude in the midst of community than to get community in
the midst of solitude.<BR>
<BR>
This is a demanding environment. Especially because there's so much that
we're learning. It's not for the faint of heart! I think the intimacy and
the knowledge and the strength of being able to work through things and
know where people are, and rely on them, is great. <BR>
<BR>
The fact that this place exists is an example of doing something that's
bigger than any one of us. So we've seen that physically, and now in terms
of the emotional and the social, there's real opportunities to wade through
the challenges and emotional ups and downs, and learn the kinds of behaviors,
understandings and patience to really connect at the community level.<B><I><BR>
<BR>
Bob Kincheloe</I></B><I>, 66, recently retired from Stanford, where he taught
electrical engineering. He spent six years in the Navy, and quite a few
more as an anti-war activist. </I><BR>
<BR>
For me, it's nice to have the contact with the kids because my own kids
are all grown, and I have no grandkids. <BR>
<BR>
The neighborhood where I was living in California was pretty much mature
families living in large homes that are separated, so that there's no contact
with others. We had friends, but it's not nearly as convenient to have day-to-day
contact as it is here. <BR>
<BR>
Things can happen here on the spur of the moment - like a potluck, or a
job needs to be done and you need help, and there are people willing to
help. <BR>
<BR>
I guess I'm a bit of a pessimist about where our culture's going. And things
like this are one of the few positive things that I've seen. <B><I><BR>
<BR>
Francie Powell, </I></B><I>43, is taking a sabbatical from her career as
a marriage and family counseler to raise Ian (age 2). </I><BR>
<BR>
The community part is not working as I imagined it would but it is definitely
working. Somebody will say, &quot;You're ill, you need some help?&quot;
or they'll make time to just get together and talk when you are stressed
out. <BR>
<BR>
With a two-year-old, there are times when it gets to be too much, and it
means a lot to be able to say to someone, &quot;Can you just take him while
I get it halfway together?&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Making meals together, or somebody helping you plant something because they
happen to have the time and energy - it's the little things that are creating
the community. It is happening in unseen ways, but is very deeply felt.<BR>
<BR>
The trades between parents help dilute parenting on a full-time basis a
little bit. I feel rejuvenated and not stuck. I shrink to imagine what it
would have been like raising a child in a single-family dwelling. Then when
[my husband] Steve isn't around there's adult company that I wouldn't have
if I lived in a single-family home. That has felt good! <BR>
<BR>
The part that strikes me as being tough is that there have been so many
changes. My ideas about what family life would be like have had to be altered
and changed. Being in the Common House setting is wonderful in some ways,
but you have to find a new time to sit down together and find out what is
going on with the family. <BR>
<BR>
When we first moved in, I felt like I was riding a wave. Cooperative living
for me has been a real stretch. I didn't realize that my finances and my
time could be so impacted by our needing to work things out together. I've
seen some of the best relating between people that I've ever seen because
of that, but I've also felt the frustration of, &quot;Are we ever going
to get <I>anything </I>done?&quot; <BR>
<BR>
As much as I am bellyaching, I find it hard to imagine living in a traditional
setting, at least not with kids. I don't know what my needs will be when
we no longer have children, but right now, I don't know what took us so

John T. Lyle is professor of landscape architecture at California State
Polytechnic University, Pomona, and acting director of the Center for Regenerative
Studies. This article includes excerpts from his book </I>Regenerative Design
for Sustainable Development<I>, to be published this year by John Wiley
and Sons, Inc., and portions of an address delivered to the International
Symposium on Cities in Coexistence with the Earth, sponsored by the Council
on Urban Ecosystems, Osaka, Japan, September 14, 1990.</I><BR>
<BR>
For thousands of years, cities have existed apart from nature. Why should
we begin now to think of cities in terms usually reserved for the natural
environment?<BR>
<BR>
The fact is, in the world that we've created for ourselves, cities occupy
pivotal positions, for better or worse, in the patterns of global ecology.
This becomes clear when we put aside our standard images of cities and consider
their ecological functions. <BR>
<BR>
Cities of the industrial era have consciously excluded natural processes,
substituting mechanical devices made possible by intensive use of fossil
fuels. Rather than using the solar energy continuously falling on their
streets and buildings, they dissipate it as excess heat. At the same time,
they import immense quantities of concentrated energy in various forms,
most of it derived from petroleum coaxed from the ground in distant landscapes.
<BR>
<BR>
They rush the water falling upon their roofs and streets as rain out through
concrete pipes and channels into the nearest bay or river and, at the same
time, bring water in from distant landscapes through similar concrete channels.
<BR>
<BR>
From outer landscapes, too, they import nutrients in the form of food, use
it once, then send it out through pipes as sewage waste. 
<H4>THE RUSHED TRIP FROM SOURCE TO SINK</H4>
If we think of the industrial city at the simplest possible level in systematic
terms, we can visualize it as a system of one-way flows of energy and materials.
The flows proceed from sources in the outer landscape, to production and
consumption in the city, to waste sinks in the air, water, and land.<BR>
<BR>
Among the sources are farms, forests, mines, oil fields, and large areas
of the oceans. Sinks are in both the upper and lower atmosphere, where the
by-products of combustion tend to accumulate; in lakes and bays, where we
usually put our sewage wastes; and in the land, where we bury garbage and
chemical and nuclear wastes. Altogether, the sources and sinks include virtually
the entire Earth.<BR>
<BR>
We might see our overwhelming problems of depletion and pollution as largely
outgrowths of our ways of shaping the urban environment. Sources are continuously
depleted and have few means of regeneration because the materials that might
otherwise replenish them are going into distant sinks. The sinks are continually
overfilled because their natural capacity to assimilate energy and materials
is far exceeded by the concentrated quantities being put out from the cities.
<BR>
<BR>
Although the global system of one-way flows took shape during the industrial
period - that is, over the past 200 years - one-way flows of smaller dimensions
have existed in various forms at least since the origins of agriculture
some 10,000 years ago. From the perspective of that time, both sources and
sinks looked unlimited. Now we know better, but changing such ancient patterns
will not be easy. It will require us to rethink our patterns of production
and consumption, as well as our concepts of waste. Most dramatically, it
will require that we rethink our ways of designing cities. 
<H4>CREATING INTEGRATED ECO-CITIES</H4>
If we concern ourselves with the materials of primary life support - water
and nutrients - the medium for recycling in the city, as in nature, is the
landscape. In cities of the future, the working landscape becomes the unifying,
integrating network of urban form, rather than a decorative addition as
in the industrial city. <BR>
<BR>
The urban landscape collects water when it rains and holds it in ponds or
tanks for future use or allows it to infiltrate slowly into underground
storage. Thus, the surface will be sculpted with swales and retention ponds,
some holding water through the year, some usually dry.<BR>
<BR>
The working landscape also processes water - both sewage and water polluted
by contact with roofs or streets - filtering it through plants in ponds
and wetlands. Plants and microorganisms assimilate nutrients and other materials,
recycling them through the landscape and in many cases eliminating the need
for a mechanical treatment system. <BR>
<BR>
The same working landscape that filters, assimilates, and stores water and
nutrients also serves to filter, cool, and direct the flow of air. Masses
of trees are located around heavily traveled streets, industrial plants,
and other sources of air pollution, where they assimilate some pollutants,
such as carbon dioxide, and produce oxygen. They also create micro-climates
within the city.<BR>
<BR>
Food production also becomes an important part of the urban landscape. Just
how great the potential for growing food actually is remains a question,
but the examples of Chinese cities show that urban farms can produce a great
deal of food. And certainly the biomass produced can be used in a great
many ways - for composting, for energy, and for making other products.<BR>
<BR>
As we shift to regenerative energy sources, we can also expect to see energy
generating apparatus appearing in the urban fabric. 
<H4>CONNECTING WITH THE LAND</H4>
Making visible the ecological processes that support life is an important
part of this emerging landscape. The child who grows up in a regenerative
city of the 21st century will know very well where the water she drinks
comes from and where her wastes go. She will have an inner feeling for the
atmospheric fluxes that make cool and warm places, and she will know how
food grows and in what season. All this will be part of her daily experience.
<BR>
<BR>
She will also know that the same landscape that accomplishes all this provides
a place to run, to play hide-and-seek or baseball, and to ride her bicycle
to the grocery store. In the same landscape, she will see birds and squirrels
and snakes, all as inhabitants of the same world she lives in.<BR>
<BR>
Within this green matrix, communities form identifiable neighborhoods. Though
cities will continue to spread over the landscape, we can hope that with
planning, the undifferentiated metropolis of the industrial era will give
way to a pattern of discrete, identifiable, interrelated communities, joined
together by the working landscape. <BR>
<BR>
If this happens, transportation will again have a great deal to do with
it. The need to use less energy will make it more desirable to walk or ride
a bicycle to schools, shops, meeting places, and local services. This will
pull residential, commercial, and civic areas closer together. <BR>
<BR>
Roads, like virtually all the elements of the landscape, will feature multiple
uses accommodating pedestrians and bicyclists as well as cars. 
<H4>REGENERATIVE BUILDINGS</H4>
In regenerative cities, buildings will be elements of the landscape like
hills or lakes or groves of trees, rather than discrete objects standing
apart from the landscape. Within the green matrix, they will cluster more
tightly together than the buildings of industrial cities. Rather than asserting
themselves and competing for attention, they will blend together more in
the manner of a medieval town, forming harmonizing clusters that reflect
a sense of interrelationship and community, as well as a sense of rootedness
in the earth. Structures within each cluster will be close enough together
to avoid wasting land and to minimize circulation routes, but far enough
apart to allow for sunlight and air movement.<BR>
<BR>
The buildings in a particular locale will have similar forms, reflecting
the climate and landscape. Buildings in the desert are likely to merge into
the earth, exposing little of their skins to the desiccating sun, while
buildings in the tropics will generally rise above the water-laden ground
into cooling breezes.<BR>
<BR>
In every climate, rooftops can be fertile and productive. Their walls can
be sheathed in living green as well. In most climates, buildings will turn
transparent faces towards the sun, with a variety of adjustable shading
devices moving and casting shadows that vary through the seasons. The sizes
of individual structures will vary from high-rise structures to single-family
houses. The mass of each building will be relatively small, however, to
allow for cross ventilation and natural lighting in every space.<BR>
<BR>
Within each cluster, or local neighborhood, uses will be mixed. Dwellings,
shops, offices, and schools will be close together, sometimes within the
same structure or grouped around a plaza or courtyard. Sizes and shapes
of neighborhood clusters will vary, especially since most will evolve out
of cities first built during the industrial period. Within the clusters,
outdoor spaces will be relatively small, scaled for human activity, in contrast
to the larger areas of the green matrix that envelope each cluster and knit
them all together.<BR>
<BR>
Within the green urban matrix, local communities are likely to vary greatly
in character and density. Cities everywhere, but especially American cities
with their enormous ethnic and social diversity, have always featured distinct
neighborhoods identified with distinct cultures. <BR>
<BR>
Densities can vary from highly concentrated mid- to high-rise communities
to dispersed communities made up of single-family homes. Though such cities
will spread over the landscape, they can be designed to embrace the ecology
of the landscape rather than obliterating it. Nature's processes can continue
to function in concert with human culture. In such a future, the conflicts
between nature and culture that characterized the industrial era will no
longer exist.<BR>

</H4>
<BR>
When I moved from China to suburban Seattle several years ago, I planned
to continue getting around by bicycle and bus, as I had during my two-and-a-half
year stay in Beijing. I was in for a rude awakening. <BR>
<BR>
The main streets adjacent to my suburban neighborhood were a nightmare of
speeding cars and congested intersections. The curving cul-de-sacs of the
suburbs made it impossible to use back streets to get anywhere - I felt
like a rat in a maze as I encountered one dead-end after another in my quest
to find a back route to the grocery store. Riding a bicycle became pointlessly
dangerous alone and impossible with a two-year-old riding behind. <BR>
<BR>
Walking was equally unpleasant. The beach was just a 15-minute walk away,
but the fumes from the cars roaring up the road beside the sidewalk, the
danger of letting go of my daughter's hand for even a second, and the disappearance
of the sidewalk halfway to the beach all made the experience unpleasant
and stressful. And once again, back streets were out of the question - they
all curved around and fed back into the main arterial.<BR>
<BR>
So, after living happily for over two years with no car, our family found
we couldn't get by without two. My husband and I joined the many people
who contribute to the smog, noise, resource depletion, congestion, and alienation
associated with the widespread use of the automobile. Ironically, in spite
of our family's much larger investment in transportation technology, we
found it neither quicker nor easier to get where we needed to go on those
congested suburban arterials than we had in our mixed-use neighborhood in
Beijing. 
<H4>THE ROOTS OF SPRAWL</H4>
The widespread dissemination of the automobile, and the associated destruction
of much of the existing mass transit system set the conditions for suburban
sprawl. <BR>
<BR>
Suburbs were intended to be safe refuges that would allow the middle and
upper classes to escape the contradictions of a divided society. But the
escape was illusory, the divisions made more severe as cities were abandoned
to the poor. In many areas, children are growing up without ever having
met a person of a different race or class. Moreover, suburbs have failed
to provide a warm community life.<BR>
<BR>
We now know that suburban developments are inevitably accompanied by congested
commutes of increasing distances, isolation, and waste. An automobile may
be designed to travel effortlessly and rapidly along a highway, but for
most commuters, that potential is seldom realized. Instead, the more highway
capacity built, the more sprawl, the more congestion. <BR>
<BR>
Industry, which was once chiefly to blame for poor air quality, now takes
second place to the automobile as the chief source of air pollution, and
much of our contribution to global warming can be traced to automobile use.
<H4>MOVING BEYOND SPRAWL</H4>
Many in planning circles now disparage sprawl, but those who want to make
the shift to a more sustainable pattern often find themselves in a quandary.
Most suburban areas lack the density to support a frequent and high quality
public transit service- the very type needed to attract ridership. Without
a good public transit system, commuters continue to depend on cars, and
planners continue to demand that developers include large allocations of
land for parking, and wide roads to handle the extra traffic, and the sprawl
continues.<BR>
<BR>
The solution is a whole-systems approach: land use and transportation must
be planned together. <BR>
<BR>
Architect/planner Peter Calthorpe is among the most important innovators
of this approach. He proposes &quot;pedestrian pockets,&quot; which are
balanced mixed-use areas within a quarter-mile, or a five-minute walking
radius, of a transit station. Within this 50 to 100-acre zone are housing,
offices, stores, day care, recreation, and parks. According to Peter Calthorpe,
2,000 units of housing and 1 million square feet of office space can be
located within three blocks of a transit station. <BR>
<BR>
There are variations on this approach; some are based in suburbs, while
others are &quot;urban villages.&quot; But many of the principles are the
same: relatively high density; mixed uses; a welcoming environment for pedestrians
and bicyclists; and preservation and in some cases restoration of open space
so that parks, natural areas, and agricultural land are interspersed between
and within pockets of development.<BR>
<BR>
Each pocket can develop its own identity and may have specific characteristics
that would attract people from other pockets, such as specialty shopping
facilities, light industry, etc. The pockets are connected along a rapid
transit system.<BR>
<BR>
As in many whole-systems solutions, once you solve one problem - like getting
better access to jobs and services - you find you've solved several other
problems as well. This style of development enhances community life. Those
without access to cars - older and younger people, the poor, or disabled
- can continue to participate in public life. <BR>
<BR>
A variety of housing types and sizes encourages a diversity of ages, income
levels, and races. Housing is made more affordable when infrastructure is
used more efficiently. Smaller homes on smaller plots of land, &quot;granny&quot;
apartments, or auxiliary units either above garages or added to existing
homes increase housing choices.<BR>
<BR>
Efforts to increase density have run into opposition in some areas. But
the trade-offs are becoming clearer and many people are ready to make the
switch. <BR>
<BR>
Anton Nelessen, a New Jersey designer, who, like Peter Calthorpe, is considered
a neotraditionalist, has found that when people see photographs of the two
types of developments - the sprawl that has become typical of development
in predominantly Anglo-Saxon countries, versus examples from Europe and
elsewhere of mixed-use neighborhoods, they often prefer the latter. <BR>
<BR>
Here are some ways to move toward this model of development: 
<UL>
<LI><B>Start charging automobile users the full cost of driving.</B> In
a new draft study, &quot;The Price of Mobility,&quot; John Moffet and Peter
Miller of the Natural Resources Defense Council estimate that the costs
of automobile travel that are not borne by the driver amount to between
$380 billion and $660 billion annually (see also <I>IC</I> #33 p. 8). This
does not include such unquantified costs as loss of wetlands and agricultural
space to automobile infrastructure, but it does include an estimated $120
billion to $220 billion from the effects of air pollution.<BR>
<BR>
If car owners paid the full costs of driving through the price of gas -
instead of passing those costs along to others in this and future generations
- gasoline prices would increase between $3.80 and $6.60 per gallon. <BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Encourage telecommuting.</B> Build telecommuting satellite centers
that can provide the facilities needed to expedite work at a distance. The
state of Washington has compiled a detailed volume of instructions on how
to institute telecommuting programs (see Resources, p.61) <BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Make long-term transit commitments</B>. Adjust zoning to accommodate
high densities and mixed uses in areas that will be well served by transit
(see below).<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Reclaim the streets</B> for bicycles, pedestrians and community activities<B>
</B>by using traffic calming techniques, holding outdoor community events,
and planting trees. <BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Encourage the development</B> of leading-edge transit technologies.
Provide federal incentives for research, development, and demonstration
of these technologies. Convert defense-related industry to mass transit
production.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Encourage bicycle commuting</B> by providing tax and other incentives
to employers who provide bike parking and showers for employees. Eliminate
tax incentives that encourage the ownership and use of automobiles in association
with work. <BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Encourage urban village-style</B> mixed-use redevelopment through
local action and through tying federal and state transportation, housing,
and community development funds to appropriate comprehensive land use/transit
planning. Adopt guidelines that steer reurbanization to areas appropriate
for urban villages.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Involve all the stakeholders </B>in envisioning what urban village
development would be like in specific locations. (See article by Wendy Morris
on page 50).<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Designate areas around ravines, </B>streams, rivers, and other natural
areas as permanent open space. When buildings become obsolete in such areas,
restore the areas to their natural condition.<BR>
<B><BR>
<LI>Allow the transfer of development rights</B> - within criteria set by
land-use goals - to provide financial incentives to leave some areas undeveloped
while others are built up more compactly.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Allow infill of residential neighborhoods</B> with &quot;granny units&quot;
and additional units over garages. This step alone would probably do more
than any other single step to increase quickly the supply of affordable
housing both for renters and owners. This would also put to good use the
excessive size of many homes.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Adjust mortgage qualification</B> criteria to take into account a
home's location. A home located in an area well served by mass transit or
within walking distance of amenities could save a potential owner the thousands
of dollars that US automobile owners spend each year on their cars. That
level of saving would make a higher mortgage more affordable.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Provide federal support for permanently affordable &quot;third-sector&quot;
housing. </B>Such housing is held in various ways ranging from community
land trusts to owner-occupied homes with deed restrictions. This approach
provides permanent affordability, a range of housing options, and accountability
to residents and community. <BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Direct pension funds</B> to sustainable building and retrofitting
projects. Long-term commitment of pension-fund money made a sustainable
design for Bamberton possible (see p. 23).<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Develop model design guidelines </B>that include the principles described
here. Require fast-growing communities to adopt a locally appropriate version
of these guidelines. Provide financing for projects that meet design criteria
(see p. 50). 
</UL>
<H4>CITIES OF EXUBERANCE</H4>
We can make that transformation to &quot;cities of exuberance&quot; - the
tools are at hand and the opportunities in a variety of venues are plentiful.
Let's do it! s<BR>

<H2><CENTER><A NAME="Toronto"></A>REURBANIZING TORONTO</CENTER>
</H2>
<BR>
Once a city makes a commitment to move away from sprawl towards an urban
villages model of development, how is that accomplished?<BR>
<BR>
Metropolitan Toronto commissioned the firm of Berridge Lewinberg Greenberg
Ltd. (BLG) to study the issues associated with increased housing density,
because the metropolitan area needed to absorb substantial growth when virtually
all its land was already developed.<BR>
<BR>
BLG, which specializes in urban planning, went beyond the original mandate.
It developed guidelines for the &quot;reurbanization&quot; of the city,
using an approach that integrates environmental, economic, and social concerns
with the built environment.<BR>
<BR>
Much of the BLG approach to reurbanization has been adopted in Metropolitan
Toronto's first draft Official Plan, which was issued last year for public
review.<BR>
<BR>
So fundamental is appropriate transit to this approach that the guidelines
propose that the level and location of planned transit service be established
at the outset. The availability of transit service will be among the major
criteria for assessing which areas to reurbanize. But other criteria will
also apply. Reurbanization should: 
<UL>
<LI>help an area move toward a ratio of 1.5 residents per job;<BR>
<BR>
<LI>increase the diversity of housing types and sizes, including a portion
of affordable housing;<BR>
<BR>
<LI>maximize densities in designated areas;<BR>
<BR>
<LI>designate at least 30 percent of the land area for public uses; <BR>
<BR>
<LI>make walking an interesting, welcoming, and efficient means of transportation;<BR>
<BR>
<LI>reduce parking requirements, and keep parking space from separating
the public realm from a building's entrance; and <BR>
<BR>
<LI>preserve and restore ravines, rivers and other natural areas. 
</UL>
<BR>
Reurbanization is aimed at creating the kind of community focus provided
by a traditional Main Street. By coordinating development of land and transit,
the need for automobile travel is reduced, along with pressures to develop
open space surrounding the metro area. <I><BR>

Wendy Morris, senior urban designer with the Victoria, Australia, government,
has been a leading figure in efforts to get the various players in the development
process to embrace alternatives to sprawl. She leads seminars and workshops
on townscape improvements, urban revitalization, and suburban development
alternatives. Wendy Morris can be reached at Urban Design Unit, Department
of Planning and Development, P.O. Box 2240T, Melbourne, Victoria, 3001,

<BR>
The views expressed in this paper are those of the author and do not necessarily
represent those of the Department of Planning and Development.<BR>
</I><BR>
Melbourne, Australia's second-largest city, has recently taken a new approach
towards sustainable development, after some earlier set-backs. Policy steps
taken in the late '80s and early '90s, which were meant to promote urban
consolidation, conservation, and more efficient use of infrastructure, resulted
in few changes in development patterns. <BR>
<BR>
We found that to make real change in building patterns those who make design,
permitting, and development decisions must be involved and retrained. The
innovative design workshops developed to this end have proven to be a key
step in Melbourne's effort to ensure that virtually <I>all</I> new residential
development takes some steps, however small, toward greater sustainability.
The workshops also helped build consensus for other important initiatives
toward sustainable design. 
<H4>SHAPING URBAN FUTURES</H4>
Of Victoria's 4.3 million people, 3 million live in the sprawling city of
Melbourne, so urban growth is a top concern of state officials. The Victorian
Department of Planning initiated workshops, entitled &quot;Shaping Urban
Futures,&quot; in 1989 in order to focus the attention of the designers
and builders on alternative development patterns. <BR>
<BR>
The workshops typically start with a critique of current residential design
practices by such international urban designers as Paul Murrain and James
Kaufman. That is followed by a presentation of alternative approaches, a
site briefing, and then work in small mixed-profession groups on a site
design. <BR>
<BR>
The experience allows participants to try out new skills, while debating
key issues within a small group setting. By ensuring that senior developers,
planning and engineering professionals, and local government officials are
represented, the workshops have developed a high level of credibility. 
<H4>A SUSTAINABLE BUILDING CODE</H4>
The change in attitude generated through the workshops facilitated the introduction
of new regulations for higher density, more cost-efficient housing development
on Melbourne's urban fringe. Workshop participants had seen for themselves
that urban consolidation can result in desirable communities that offer
housing diversity, convenient shopping, and other amenities. <BR>
<BR>
These regulations, the Victorian Code for Residential Development (VicCode),
are directed at achieving safe, stimulating, and sustainable communities
by addressing the detailed design of development proposals. VicCode is performance-based
rather than prescriptive, and thus rewards innovative design that meets
the code's objectives and performance criteria. <BR>
<BR>
As a result of the code, designs for low-density, car-based, single-use
residential developments are being replaced by more site-responsive, connected,
walkable neighborhoods, with housing diversity and mixed-use potential.
<BR>
<BR>
Instead of a design process based on computer-generated standard lot sizes
in hierarchical road layouts, the process is now likely to involve a team
of urban designers, planners, engineers, surveyors, marketers, social planners,
and environmental specialists.<BR>
<BR>
VicCode addresses issues of isolation and safety to ensure that new suburbs
better meet the needs of women (see page 52). It provides for environmental
management of stormwater through on-site infiltration and retention systems,
retains natural assets such as trees and valleys in public open space, and
encourages street layouts that capitalize on views of features in and beyond
the site. <BR>
<BR>
Energy efficiency is addressed through principles for connective but low-speed
street networks that minimize the amount of travel needed to conduct daily
tasks. Lot size variation makes possible densities high enough to support
public transport. Buildings open on to streets and open spaces to ensure
walking and bicycling are safe, interesting, and efficient. Energy requirements
are reduced through the form and solar orientation of houses. 
<H4>MODELLING ENERGY USE</H4>
In late 1991, the Victorian government began researching energy use and
greenhouse gas emissions associated with different models of urban expansion:
conventional low-density suburban sprawl, a VicCode development, and a transit-supportive,
traditional urbanism model - each model progressively increasing street
connectivity, housing density, and integrated land-use mix.<BR>
<BR>
The preliminary results of the Greenhouse Neighbourhood Report, to be released
in June 1993, demonstrate substantial energy savings per household moving
from the sprawl model through to the traditional urbanism model, especially
when the longevity of the urban form is considered. 
<H4>URBAN VILLAGES PROGRAM</H4>
The Greenhouse Neighbourhood Project confirmed that VicCode facilitates
many of the changes needed to bring about more sustainable <I>residential
</I>development on the urban fringe. However, the code does not address
changes required to generate well-integrated <I>mixed-use </I>communities.
<BR>
<BR>
A new program - in essence, a sequel to the residential design workshops
- is now underway to promote urban village style development. The work of
Australian researchers Peter Newman and Jeff Kenworthy, who have been promoting
higher density, interactive, transit-supportive, mixed-use nodes within
the fabric of a city, provided the impetus for the Victorian Urban Villages
Program.<BR>
<BR>
This program aims to encourage understanding of the links between energy
efficiency, urban form, land-use mix, density, safety, community development,
and public transport.<BR>
<BR>
First, city officials identify and analyze existing mixed-use nodes within
Melbourne that provide good examples of urban villages. These include many
of the city's most attractive and valued communities and are in parts of
the city developed prior to the rigid zoning introduced in the early 1950s.<BR>
<BR>
Secondly, multi-disciplinary design workshops explore reurbanization within
a 400-meter radius of existing transit stops and along existing or planned
rail transit routes on the urban fringe. A strategy for each village is
developed that fosters appropriate mixed-uses and street characteristics.
The site's public spaces are reviewed with respect to accessibility, amenities,
security, parking, and retail revitalization opportunities.<BR>
<BR>
Finally, the program provides design and development assistance to owners
and developers of demonstration sites within a 400-meter radius of transit
stops.<BR>
<BR>
The urban villages concept is generating strong interest, particularly from
local government and the planning and design professions. This land development
strategy counters declining public transport patronage and the resulting
service cutbacks. Again the design workshop process provides a forum for
presenting and debating new design principles and for preparing three-dimensional
design solutions. 
<H4>ACF GREEN HOME</H4>
Recently, agencies from the state Department of Planning collaborated with
the Australian Conservation Foundation (ACF) in building the first ACF Green
Home to environmental specifications that reduce non-renewable energy use
by up to two thirds and saves up to $500 in operation costs per year. The
specifications also minimize water consumption and require the use of some
recycled materials. <BR>
<BR>
Designed for the mass home market, finance for houses built to the ACF Green
Home Guidelines can be obtained on favorable terms through the ACF Green
Bonds investment fund. <BR>
<BR>
The ACF Green Bond fund was established jointly by ACF and a savings and
loan institution so that environmentally committed investors can be assured
that their money will be lent only for environmentally sound, financially
beneficial purposes. It also has special taxation advantages to investors.
<H4>CONCLUSION</H4>
The success of these programs to date can be attributed to several factors:
the willingness of a state bureaucracy to become involved at the detailed
design level; the professional excitement, credibility, and contact with
leading international design trends provided by the workshops; and the government's
willingness to establish processes for debate on the issues. <BR>
<BR>
The workshops have helped break down adversarial relationships between the
community, developers, and regulators. Instead, all now are involved in
developing a shared vision of a future based on cooperation and the synergy
of differently skilled professionals working together. <BR>
<BR>
By emphasizing processes that benefit the developer, the community, and
the environment, the Melbourne experience demonstrates the value of open
communication and collaboration within a government that has clearly expressed
a commitment to change.<BR>

<BR>
Almost every aspect of the design and development of new suburban estates
is done by men. That lack of balance has created problems because of the
different ways men and women view neighborhoods. Men often see residential
developments as places to get in and out of, to or from work, city or the
beach. Women, even those who work outside the home, move about their neighborhoods
on a daily basis - a short drive to drop kids off at play group, a quick
trip to the store or to the neighborhood house for a meeting. Cul-de-sac,
single-use development makes all these errands difficult and time consuming.<BR>
<BR>
Personal safety is poorly addressed in such developments: great lengths
of back fences line streets; public open space frequently lack abutting
houses. <BR>
<BR>
Women and children are the principal users of public transport on the urban
fringe, yet little consideration is given to making the walk to and from
it safe, efficient, comfortable, and interesting. <BR>
<BR>
The increasing privatization of residential developments has also contributed
to loneliness. For women at home, especially older women, views out to the
street provide a window on the world. This is constrained by houses designed
with garages dominating their frontage, lacking front rooms, porches, and
verandas. When coupled with the low level of activity in the street, this
can contribute to a real sense of isolation. The car-based hierarchical
street networks make it difficult for neighbors to meet. Thus modern subdivisions
build isolation and unrealistically stress the nuclear family unit. <BR>
<BR>
Many of these designed-in social problems of the modern suburban development
can be easily avoided, once they are recognized for what they are.<I><BR>

<H1><CENTER>The Evolution Of Eco-Cities</CENTER>
</H1>
<H3><CENTER></CENTER>
</H3>
<H4><CENTER><I>by Tony Dominski</I></CENTER>
</H4>
<I><BR>
Tony Dominski has taught ecology, environmental analysis, planning, and
design at the Pratt Institute, School of Architecture and University of
California, Santa Barbara. Since 1984, he has specialized in land-use planning
and integrated waste management. He presently works with the <BR>
Florida Department of Community Affairs.</I><BR>
<BR>
Transforming today's cities, with their predilection for destructive consumption,
is a daunting task. There are hundreds of billions of dollars and over a
century of effort invested in today's urban infrastructure - including the
buildings, the connecting freeways and roads, the utility networks, and
the landscapes in which everything else is embedded. Parallel to the physical
infrastructure is a legal and financial infrastructure in which there is
a huge emotional investment based on habit and familiarity.<BR>
<BR>
Just as an ocean liner can't be turned on a dime, thousands of square miles
of buildings, roads, and landscapes, and business habits built up over decades
cannot be changed overnight. Complete renovation will take a century or
more.<BR>
<BR>
However, the building of eco-cities is not a utopian task to be postponed
to the far-off future. Just below the surface are subtle but powerful forces
poised to take cities to an advanced stage. There is much that can be accomplished,
even within the next five to ten years. <BR>
<BR>
Already there is a substantial body of theory and case histories that suggest
how eco-cities will be built. In fact, urban dwellers have already initiated
a three-stage ecological remodel based on reduction, reuse and recycling.
<H4>REDUCE</H4>
The first stage of this eco-city evolution, the reduction or quick-fix stage,
has already begun. In cities around the world, people are reducing the impact
of their consumption-oriented lifestyle by carpooling, switching to more
efficient light bulbs, insulating their homes, recycling trash, buying non-toxic
cleaners, and using gray water, compost, and mulch in their backyards. <BR>
<BR>
The reduction stage is invaluable ecologically, economically, and educationally.
It is an introduction to a new ethic and it encourages the more far-reaching
measures of the reuse and recycling stages of evolution. 
<H4>REUSE </H4>
In the reuse stage, existing buildings, roads, landscapes, and utility networks
are employed in novel ways. For example, commercial buildings can be partially
converted to stores and residential units. <BR>
<BR>
Roofs, now used only for weather protection, are used to grow food and collect
energy. Existing roadways become rights-of-way for electric trains and bicycles.
Downtown streets become pedestrian malls and &quot;slow streets.&quot; Ornamental
landscapes are converted to fruit orchards. The electric grid and rooftop
panels are used to recharge small in-town electric vehicles, and the corner
gas station becomes a battery exchange shop. <BR>
<BR>
The reuse stage reaches further than the reduction stage in cutting consumption
and improving quality of life. It also sets into motion the forces that
will allow the modified building, road, and utility elements to be knit
together within the ultimate stage of recycling. 
<H4>RECYCLE</H4>
The goal of the recycling stage is a city of greenbelt-framed urban spaces,
where the daily needs of work, play, shopping and recreation are brought
together within walking distance. This is the stage where the urban village
reigns supreme. Urban villages of between 50-200 acres condense around the
nuclei of the densest suburban and inner-city areas, often surrounding train
stations. <BR>
<BR>
To achieve this ideal, some urban areas are more densely developed in a
checkered land-use pattern. Other urban areas are restored to farms, meadows,
forests, and open space for wildlife. This conversion involves some limited
demolition of streets and buildings. Demolition debris is re-manufactured
into concrete, asphalt, steel, glass and other building materials.<BR>
<BR>
The local electric train systems are linked regionally as are local sections
of bike and footpaths. Similarly, sections of stream rescued from culverts
and open concrete channels are linked as linear parks and forests along
stream belts. Some freeways are converted into high-speed inter-city rail
corridors, which become viable alternatives to regional plane travel.<BR>
<BR>
In this urban evolutionary succession, each stage prepares the necessary
conditions for the next step; this parallels the process by which a forest
eco-system regenerates itself. The three stages - reduce, reuse, recycle
- will be developing simultaneously in a patchwork fashion, much as regeneration
occurs in a large forest. As forest patches are always changing in response
to episodes of wind, fire, disease, and human disturbance, urban patches
change in response to emerging social and demographic conditions and expanding
ecological consciousness. 
<H4>ECO-CITY EVOLUTION</H4>
The successful evolution of an eco-city will depend on our developing an
understanding of the ecological systems that we live with and how we need
to relate to them, and on our willingness to act on that information.<BR>
<BR>
Three imperatives will form the basis for eco-city evolution: social justice,
prosperity, and a healthy natural environment. These are sometimes viewed
as separate and even contradictory, but are now merging in the overarching
vision of sustainability.<BR>
<BR>
Social justice is the gateway to sustainability. Mutual trust and cooperation
between neighbors will be essential. A widening gap between the haves and
have-nots and the associated high crime rates would frustrate and retard
the evolution of eco-cities. <BR>
<BR>
Secondly, an eco-city requires a coalition of businesses capable of responding
to, serving, and generating new enlightened consumers. The tasks will include
reweaving the urban fabric along ecological lines, and planning and building
the new urban infrastructures. <BR>
<BR>
These businesses will be synergistic. For example, a gray water plumbing
retrofit business needs another business to produce a non-toxic detergent.
An electric car manufacturer will want to purchase efficient non-toxic batteries.
Energy conservation firms need non-toxic insulation and efficient roof-top
solar panels. Organic farmers and gardeners will want to purchase mulch
and compost products produced by recycling firms. <BR>
<BR>
These eco-businesses will be reinforced by changing consumer preferences
and new government policies. An extraction tax for oil, coal, and uranium
will favor energy conservation firms and suppliers of solar energy products.
Similarly pollution taxes and high fees for landfills, in conjunction with
lower taxes on reused and recycled products, will encourage the manufacture
of non-toxic and recyclable products. To insure fairness, these policies
will have to insure that low-income people are protected from carrying the
major share of these extra burdens.<BR>
<BR>
The link between the natural environment and human survival, prosperity,
and quality of life is a third potent evolutionary force. Environmental
destruction is inevitably accompanied by a decline in health and quality
of life, and ultimately, a decline in the health of the economy.<BR>
<BR>
It is encouraging that the three-stage process of reduction, reuse, and
recycling is well underway. The first stage of awareness and application
of conservation techniques has gained widespread acceptance. The second
stage - the creative reuse of what is already built - is in the pilot or
demonstration phase. And already on the drawing boards are plans to recycle
existing roads, buildings, and landscapes into the qualitatively new forms
that will mark the eco-cities' mature stage.<BR>
<BR>
There is a lot of interesting work to do and optimism is warranted. An evolutionary
perspective can illuminate the way toward the forging of a new urban space,
lifestyle, and ethic that harmonizes the heretofore conflicting elements
of fairness, prosperity, and ecological survival. <BR>

<H1><CENTER>A City Of The Future</CENTER>
</H1>
<H4><CENTER><I>by Daniel Fischer</I></CENTER>
</H4>
<BR>
Anthropolis: A Tale of Two Cities<I>, by Daniel Fischer, is a utopian vision
of a city based on the notion that people, nature, and a recognition of
the interconnectedness of all life are paramount.<BR>
<BR>
The founders of this fictional city made two key decisions that set the
stage for much else that followed: automobiles and private land ownership
were eliminated. <BR>
<BR>
In the following excerpts</I>, <I>long-time resident Caleb Smith explains
the Anthropolis approach to two visitors, John and Nancy Jones. This excerpt
begins as the three walk to Caleb's home.</I><BR>
<BR>
Caleb knew everyone they passed. There was much pedestrian activity, interspersed
with adults and children on bicycles and roller skates. John and Nancy were
struck by the absence of harsh mechanical noises and the omnipresence of
banter and laughter. Birds, squirrels, and an occasional dog made their
presence known. No horns. No drone of tires. It was eerie and pleasant -
a distinctly different aural experience. Too calm and quiet for the city,
more &quot;human&quot; noise than the country. And clean, fresh air. <BR>
<BR>
Caleb: &quot;Our walkways are our primary transportation network. They aren't
as wide as conventional streets as they needn't accommodate six-foot wide
cars. They carry plenty of traffic: pedestrians, bicyclists, skaters, carts,
and an occasional skateboard.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;In conventional urban design, automobiles provide a high degree of
access, mobility, and anonymity; people are used to 'foreign' traffic traversing
their neighborhoods, making the potential thief relatively inconspicuous.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;In a more compact city, higher densities mean the public streets are
rarely deserted. When everyone travels by foot or bike, the traffic is also
more 'personal.' Add to this the ownership individuals experience in their
city, their neighborhood, their 'space,' and you have thousands of policemen
guarding every way. The opportunity for crime is significantly curtailed.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;The ability to get anywhere conveniently without the expense and hassle
of a car is a psychological benefit as well as a financial one. You feel
safe. And everyone can get around, including kids, the elderly and the infirm.
We wouldn't be in near as good physical shape without all the walking and
biking.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;When electric vehicles reached a level of technical maturity and popularity,
there was some pressure to accommodate them. The advocates of a non-auto
environment won out; it was obvious that the automobile's mode of propulsion
was incidental to its impact on the structure and nature of the community.&quot;<I><BR>
<BR>
In this excerpt, Caleb responds to John's question about why city founders
chose to hold the land in common.</I><BR>
<BR>
&quot;Our decision to limit private ownership was not driven by ideology.
It was never an end in itself, but rather the only effective method for
achieving other critical objectives. We were determined to control the cost
of housing for the second, third and fourth owner, not just the initial
buyer. This required measures to limit speculation. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;We also wanted to afford all residents the opportunity to own their
home and their place of business; this meant precluding a few members of
the community from gaining control over an inordinate share of land.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;We seriously explored alternatives to the community land trust. We
looked at community buy-back options, covenants, and other legal instruments
more consistent with conventional private ownership. Unfortunately, legal
precedent makes those alternatives weak and undependable tools. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;We also considered the possibility of maintaining a surplus of houses
to control the supply side of the equation, to moderate the price of resale
homes by being the supplier of last resort. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;That could work if the community realized moderate growth - if in
fact it wasn't too appealing or too successful. The thought seemed rather
self-defeating! We would at some point reach natural or desirable limits
to growth; expanding supply would no longer be an option. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Community ownership of land with long-term, low-cost leases proved
the only realistic and dependable option. It provides all the good elements
of private ownership while precluding the counterproductive results.&quot;<I><BR>

<H1><CENTER>Answering The King's Challenge</CENTER>
</H1>
<H4><CENTER><I>by Karl-Henrik Rob&egrave;rt </I></CENTER>
</H4>
<BR>
<BR>
<I>Perhaps the most important tool of change is the belief that we can make
things better in our own lifetimes. To judge from our mail, Sweden's &quot;The
Natural Step&quot; is among the most inspiring examples of that belief (see
&quot;Educating A Nation: The Natural Step&quot; </I>IC <I>#28, pp. 10-15).<BR>
<BR>
The project, conceived and implemented by leading cancer researcher Karl-Henrik
Rob&egrave;rt, has a straightforward goal: to muffle the quibbling over
exactly how bad our environmental problems are and focus attention instead
on what can be done immediately to turn things around.<BR>
<BR>
The results of this common-sense approach have been astounding. From King
Carl XVI Gustaf down to grade-schoolers, practically every Swede knows that
1) life can continue only if natural processes are allowed to recycle waste
into new resources; 2) current industrial society is producing too much
non-recyclable waste too fast. <BR>
<BR>
Now not just environmentalists, but politicians and businesspeople have
adopted &quot;cyclic thinking.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
How did this happen? By getting at what Karl-Henrik calls the trunk and
roots of the problem, not waiting to examine each leaf. <BR>
<BR>
Karl-Henrik compiled a consensus report on the essence of environmental
issues from scientists of many disciplines and ideologies. The report was
condensed into an educational packet.<BR>
<BR>
After winning the endorsement of the King, 4.3 million copies of the educational
packet were produced, one for every household and school in Sweden. Karl-Henrik
rounded up a cast of artists and celebrities to promote the nationwide project
on television, and before long everyone was talking about sustainability.
<BR>
<BR>
The Netherlands has now taken up The Natural Step as well.<BR>
<BR>
Searching for more good examples, last year King Gustaf, in consultation
with The Natural Step, called his first annual &quot;Environment Competition&quot;
among Sweden's communities. Here is Karl-Henrik's report on the results:<BR>
<P><CENTER></I><HR WIDTH="30%"></CENTER>
<P>Forty-nine local governments took part in the competition. The jury was
constituted of different professionals within The Natural Step network -
scientists, ecologists, and environmental advisers to local governments.
<BR>
<BR>
We were all astonished by the quality of the work done by the participants.
It soon became obvious to all of us how much more easily bad news travels
around in the media than good news. Some of the local governments had made
quite remarkable progress!<BR>
<BR>
The winner, Borl&auml;nge kommun, is a city of about 47,000 people, with
some heavy industries including pulp and steel mills. <BR>
<BR>
Ninety percent of the homes in this community are heated with renewable
energy resources. This high proportion is achieved through a central heating
system that gets its energy from a mixture of biogas from sorted garbage,
incineration of garbage with low heavy metal content, and warm water released
by the industries. <BR>
<BR>
In a few years, all the city's garbage will be sorted, not only from households
but also from industry. <BR>
<BR>
The schools teach sustainability, and all politicians in the local government
get training in sustainability and cyclic thinking. <BR>
<BR>
A whole new section of the city is planned, designed completely in accordance
with cyclic thinking.<BR>
<BR>
Many local governments have reached the same status as Borl&auml;nge, and
they gave that city a tough match. However, considering Borl&auml;nge's
difficult starting point a few years ago, because of the city's industrialization,
the <I>degree of change </I>settled the judgment.<BR>
<BR>
The prize was a crystal sculpture with the King's monogram and The Natural
Step's logo. The King presented the prize in the big &quot;Globe&quot; of
Borl&auml;nge in front of 5,000 proud citizens. All children were free from
school for the occasion. The prize is now kept in the city's museum.<BR>
<BR>
The King traveled to Borl&auml;nge by train, studying cyclic thinking on
the way with myself and other scientists from the Natural Step. <BR>
<BR>
In the competition, Kungs&ouml;rs kommun and &Ouml;rebro kommun placed second
and third respectively. Those communities also got crystal sculptures from
the King.<BR>
<BR>
Borl&auml;nge and &Ouml;rebro have now entered the eco-community movement
of The Natural Step. This taught the jury that you do not have to be a member
of The Natural Step movement to be progressive for sustainability - the
work that placed these cities at the top in Sweden had taken place outside
The Natural Step movement. <BR>

<H1><CENTER>Seven Steps To A Greener Company</CENTER>
</H1>
<H4><CENTER><I>by Guy Dauncey </I></CENTER>
</H4>
<BR>
<BR>
When a company claims to be &quot;green,&quot; how can you tell just how
green it is? I always lean towards encouraging whatever progress a business
has made, rather than dwelling on the work that remains undone. I know that
there are many in the business world who sincerely want to make a difference.<BR>
<BR>
On the other hand, many companies want to convince us that their disposable
diapers are greener than the next ones, or that if you buy their products,
all the birds will sing and Mother Nature will be happy.<BR>
<BR>
To help you rate your local company, and to help companies assess their
own progress, I have devised a seven-step evolutionary scale of company
greening. <BR>
<BR>
Most companies have been thinking environmentally for only two or three
years. As you will see from the scale, the process of &quot;deep greening&quot;
involves some very profound shifts that cannot happen overnight. So my advice
is be patient - and gently encourage a company to do more.<B><BR>
<BR>
Step One: Green Trimmings</B><BR>
<BR>
The company makes a symbolic nod in the right direction and offers five
green products among 5,000 ungreen ones, coupled with a big green marketing
push.<B><BR>
<BR>
Stage Two: Green Cuffs</B><BR>
<BR>
As well as its small green product line, the company orders in-house paper
recycling and stocks up with environmentally sound cleaning liquids. &quot;Switch-off&quot;
reminders are placed by light switches and the company runs a regular column
on the environment in the company newsletter. <B><BR>
<BR>
Stage Three: Green Clothes</B><BR>
<BR>
The company commissions an in-depth environmental audit, appoints an environmental
vice president, adopts an environmental mission statement, and includes
an environmental section in its annual report. Management institutes permanent
changes in such areas as waste management, packaging, transportation, paper
use, pollution control, employee involvement, eliminating ozone-depleting
substances, etc. They develop a solid green product line and adopt a policy
on social responsibility. <B><BR>
<BR>
Stage Four: Green Body</B><BR>
<BR>
The company redesigns its product line to eliminate toxins and non-recyclables
at the source. They do a complete materials-use analysis, with a view to
long-term sustainability and recyclability. They examine and overhaul their
purchasing policy to ensure that they are supporting sustainability down
the line. They adopt a policy on global responsibility.<B><BR>
<BR>
Stage Five: Green Brains</B><BR>
<BR>
The company develops and implements a long-term business plan designed to
achieve environmental sustainability and effects a strategic redeployment
of its assets and resources into sustainable products and activities (for
example, shifting from oil to solar). This entails a major shareholder education
plan to protect themselves from hostile takeover bids.<B><BR>
<BR>
Stage Six: Green Heart</B><BR>
<BR>
The company undertakes the transfer of its company stock from the open &quot;value-free&quot;
marketplace, where all that matters is the financial bottom line, into stock
ownership funds guided by social, environmental, and global responsibility
standards. It develops a community co-ownership program for local plants
and branch offices.<B><BR>
<BR>
Stage Seven: Green Soul</B><BR>
<BR>
At this final stage, the company embarks on a conscious evolution of its
overall goals, policies, practices, and processes, to shift into a mode
of planetary service. This is a shift that many individuals are undertaking
in their lives in response to the planetary situation. This involves asking
the question: &quot;How will this benefit the planet, the environment, the
community, the customer, and the work team?&quot; and incorporating the
answers into every action.<BR>
<BR>
As the company does this, it will discover that it is experiencing an unparalleled
release of synergy and co-creativity in the pursuit of higher goals. <I><BR>

<H4><CENTER><I>by Sarah van Gelder<BR>
<BR>
</I></CENTER>
</H4>
There is little question that the world is in the midst of a profound process
of cultural change. In the past five years, with the end of the Cold War,
all the old international certainties seem to have come unglued as humanity
gropes for new ways to be with itself and with the Earth. The pressure for
change is intense. Consider:<BR>
<BR>
* The human species is close to reaching the Earth's ecological limits.<BR>
<BR>
* The massive arms build-up of the Cold War is still spread across the globe;
we have hardly begun to deal with its side-effects - bankrupt economies,
a poisoned environment, and fear.<BR>
<BR>
* Population pressures, economic disparities, environmental degradation,
and ill-conceived development policies are disrupting communities and whole
societies, and drive migration both within and between countries and regions.<BR>
<BR>
* Global communication is spreading the cultural influences of the West,
eroding ancient cultural traditions. But the same technologies are making
possible a planet-wide response that draws on the wisdom of cultures worldwide.<BR>
<BR>
In a situation this dynamic, there is no question that there will be change;
the question is what direction that change will take. If there is to be
any hope of a humane and sustainable future emerging from this caldron,
we'll need to envision and develop fundamental alternatives to many major
worldwide institutions. We'll need realistic answers to questions such as:<BR>
<BR>
* What types of exchanges and trade foster self-reliance and cultural integrity,
while building on the synergy found when we cross borders?<BR>
<BR>
* What economic forms can reconnect us to the natural environment and to
community, and meet our material needs? * How can we democratically manage
those issues that must be addressed at a global scale? What is the right
distribution of governance among local, regional, and global scales?<BR>
<BR>
* How do we prevent the escalation of conflict into violence? How do we
keep small groups from using force to impose their will on others?<BR>
<BR>
This issue is an early exploration of this vital territory. We hope it will
inspire <I>you</I> to join in that exploration. It's becoming increasingly
clear that our visible &quot;leaders&quot; are actually followers, and it's
up to all of us to envision and to experiment with the institutional changes
that will make a better world possible.<BR>

<H3><CENTER>The evidence that humanity is reaching the limits of what the Earth can sustain<BR></CENTER></H3>

<H1><CENTER>Ecological Limits</CENTER>
</H1>
<H4><CENTER><I>by Robert Goodland</I></CENTER>
</H4>
<BR>
<I>What's wrong with continuing business as usual? There's increasing evidence
that the human species is close to filling the ecological space available
to it and other land-based species. It's hard to dispute that there is a
limit; the question is, how close are we to reaching that limit and how
much can we gain by arguing the fine points rather than getting on with
making a shift to sustainability? <BR>
<BR>
Robert Goodland, an advisor to the Environment Department of the World Bank
and a writer on tropical ecology, summarized some of the most compelling
evidence of ecological limits as part of his contribution, excerpted here,
to</I> Population, Technology, and Lifestyle: The Transition to Sustainability,
<I>published by Island Press in 1992.<BR>
</I>
<UL>
<LI>Human Biomass Appropriation: The best evidence that there are imminent
limits is the calculation by Peter Vitousek et al.1 that the human economy
today uses - directly or indirectly - about 40% of the net primary product
of terrestrial photosynthesis. (This figure drops to 25% if the oceans and
other aquatic ecosystems are included.) After only a single doubling of
the world's population (say, in 35 years) we will use 80%, and 100% shortly
thereafter. <BR>
<I><BR>
<LI>Global Warming: </I>Scientists now practically universally agree that
global warming will occur, although differences remain on the rates. Greenhouse
warming is a compelling argument that ecological limits have been exceeded
because it is globally pervasive, rather than disrupting the atmosphere
only in the regions where the CO2 was produced. The nearly 7 billion tons
of carbon released into the atmosphere each year by human activity (from
fossil fuel consumption and deforestation) accumulate in the atmosphere,
which suggests that the ecosystem's sinks capable of absorbing carbon have
been exceeded, and carbon accumulation appears for all practical purposes
irreversible on any relevant time frame. <BR>
<I><BR>
<LI>Ozone Shield Rupture: </I>Although 85% of CFCs are released in the industrial
North, the<B> </B>main ozone hole has appeared over Antarctica, showing
the damage to be widespread and truly global. The global ozone layer is
thinning far faster than models had predicted. A second hole has been discovered
over the Arctic, and ozone-shield thinning recently was detected over both
north and south temperate latitudes, including northern Europe and North
America.<BR>
<BR>
Even if CFC emissions cease today, the world still will be gripped in an
unavoidable commitment to 10 years of increased damage. This would then
gradually return to pre-damage levels over the next 100 to 150 years.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><I>Land Degradation: </I>Land degradation - decreased productivity such
as caused by accelerated soil erosion, salination, and desertification -
is not new; land degraded thousands of years ago (for example, in the Tigris-Euphrates
Valley) remains unproductive today. But the scale has mushroomed.<BR>
<BR>
Pimentel et al.2 found that soil erosion is serious in most of the world's
agricultural areas and that this problem is worsening as more marginal land
is brought into production. Soil loss rates, generally ranging from 10 to
100 tons per hectare per year, exceed soil formation rates by<B> </B>at
least tenfold. Today's agricultural practices are leading to erosion, salination,
or waterlogging of possibly 6 million hectares per year.<BR>
<BR>
As a result of widespread deficiencies in fuel wood, crop residues and dung
are being diverted from agriculture to fuel. This diversion coupled with
fuel wood overharvesting intensify land degradation, hunger, and poverty.
As 35 percent of the Earth's land already<B> </B>is degraded, and because
this figure is increasing and is largely irreversible in any time scale
of concern to society, such degradation is a sign that we have exceeded
the regenerative capacity of the Earth's soil source.<BR>
<I><BR>
<LI>Decrease in Biodiversity: </I>The scale of the human economy has grown
so large that there is no longer room for all species in the ark. The rates
of takeover of wildlife habitat and of species extinctions are the fastest
they have been in recorded history and are accelerating. The world's richest
species habitat, tropical forest, has already been 55 percent destroyed;
the current rate exceeds 168,000 square kilometers per year.<BR>
<BR>
Conservative estimates put the rate of extinction at more than 5,000 species
each year. This is about 10,000 times as fast as prehuman extinction rates.
Less conservative estimates put the rate at 150,000 species per year.3

and the People-Centered Development Forum</I></CENTER>

<I><BR>
This paper was produced by the participants in the Asian NGO Regional Fellows
Program held in Baguio, Philippines, in October 1992, under the joint sponsorship
of the Asian NGO Coalition and the Institute for Development Research, with
funding from the Ford Foundation. Participants included Chandra de Fonseca
(Sri Lanka), Sunimal Femando (Sri Lanka), David Korten (US), Tony Quizon
(Philippines), Sixto Roxas (Philippines), Bishan Singh (Malaysia), and Felix
Sugirtharaj (India). <BR>
<BR>
David C. Korten, who edited the following piece, can be reached at the People-Centered
Development Forum, 14 E. 17th St., Suite 5, New York, NY, 10003, tel. 212/620-7137;

<BR>
We in Asia have long defined our choices as between the Western capitalist
system of economic theory and practice, and the theory and practice of Marxist
socialism. It is ironic that while Marxist theory predicted the collapse
of the capitalist economic system and presented itself as the single viable
alternative to capitalist hegemony, its practice in the countries of Eastern
Europe and Eurasia has collapsed in disarray. Now flush with a sense of
victory over its fallen opponent, capitalism seems resolutely blinded to
the self-destructive consequences of its own present path.<BR>
<BR>
The evidence is mounting that both Marxist socialism and free-market capitalism
have failed the majority of human society, and for strikingly similar reasons:
<UL>
<LI>They both built economic systems that celebrated the destruction of
the living systems of the Earth.<BR>
<BR>
<LI>They both ignored the social and political consequences of concentrating
economic power in unaccountable, centralizing institutions - the state in
the case of Marxism and the transnational corporation in the case of capitalism.<BR>
<BR>
<LI>Both took a narrow, economistic view of human needs.<BR>
<BR>
<LI>Both equated growth in the economic output of the firm with improved
human well-being and neglected the community as a natural economic unit.
Both used essentially the same models of national income accounting.<BR>
<BR>
<LI>Both systems were basically Western constructs, products of Western
thought and experience. 
</UL>
<BR>
Neither system is a suitable guide for Asia, which is home to more than
half the world's people, as well as half the world's 1.2 billion people
who live in absolute poverty. Asia's economic miracle has been a miracle
only for a small fraction of Asia's peoples and holds little real promise
for the rest.<BR>
<BR>
Asia faces a stark reality. The industrialism-consumerism model on which
the practice of free-market capitalism has been based has depended historically
on the ability of industrializing countries to colonize the resources of
others. The scramble for the forests, lands, and minerals of Indo-China,
Irian Jaya, and Papua New Guinea is already underway. Where will Asia turn
once these are exhausted?<BR>
<BR>
Furthermore, if only China and India, with a combined population of some
2 billion people, were to heed the call of transnational capital and Western
governments to pursue the unsustainable Western economic model, they would
surely push the global ecological system into collapse long before providing
over-consuming lifestyles for even a fraction of their citizens.<BR>
<BR>
Asia's hope for the future lies in an alternative model of human progress.
That model would combine efficiency of resource use with a rediscovery of
life's innate spiritual character and the inseparable spiritual connection
of every person to nature and community.<BR>
<BR>
We believe that the essential elements of an alternative model are at hand.
The breakthrough in our own thinking came when we realized that what we
were looking for was not an alternative theory of development, which almost
inevitably buys into many of the assumptions of the prevailing growth model.
The alternative we sought was a theory of sustainability, which begins from
a wholly different set of premises.<BR>
<BR>
Our theory of sustainability draws its premises from the critiques of the
two failed dominant systems of economic thought and practice, insights from
Asia's rich cultural and spiritual heritage, and the wisdom of indigenous
peoples. The emergent theory takes a holistic view of human needs. It at
once identifies the roots of the ecological crisis and helps us to predict
the conditions under which the dynamics of human social processes are most
likely to work toward a balanced relationship between human society and
the planet's ecology. 
<H4>BONDING SPIRIT, COMMUNITY, PLACE</H4>
Our theory of sustainability is grounded in the most fundamental of insights:
that all life is an expression of a single spiritual unity and that the
spiritual growth of the individual consists of advancement toward the full,
conscious realization of this unity. <BR>
<BR>
Spirituality, community, and a bonding to place or habitat are central values
that have unified the Asian cultures over centuries. This was manifest in
countless cultural norms, such as the injunction that when a tree is harvested,
two must be planted. Where nature has been scarred, it must be given time
and opportunity to heal. In these many ways, sustainability is integral
to Asia's cultural tradition.<BR>
<BR>
A balanced and harmonious relationship between human communities and their
natural environment is associated with a reverence for the spiritual unity
of life and a strong bonding to community and place. Such communities almost
universally develop cultural values that maintain a sense of continuity
linking past and future generations to physical place. 
<H4>HUMANITY'S SPECIAL GIFT</H4>
In addition to the gift of life shared by all of nature, the human species
was endowed with the special gift of self-awareness. With this powerful
gift, our species set out on a unique evolutionary course of social, material,
and spiritual advancement as we consciously reshaped our relationship with
the living Earth. Yet, as with all powerful abilities, this gift contained
both creative and destructive potentials.<BR>
<BR>
In his book <I>The Dream of the Earth,</I>1 Thomas Berry refers to the dynamics
of our consumer society as the supreme pathology of all history, a pathology
in which humanity has virtually defined consumption as the highest human
purpose.2 He suggests we have lost our way due to the lack of a story that
gives meaning to our existence. This is something a dedication to consumption
can never provide. That story must give us a sense of our special role and
purpose in life's evolutionary journey.<BR>
<BR>
The gift of awareness conveyed an awesome responsibility not shared by other
species. To accept responsibility for life does not imply rejecting modern
technology or returning to the lifestyles of those groups that continue
to live untouched by the modern world. We are poised to reach for new levels
of social, intellectual, and spiritual advancement far beyond the reach
of previous generations specifically because of the current potential to
meld both ancient and modern wisdom to this end.<BR>
<BR>
However, to prepare the way we must replace the prevailing economics of
alienation with its antithesis, the economics of community.
<H4>THE ECONOMICS OF COMMUNITY</H4>
Moving toward a sustainable human societies involves far more than making
a few adjustments at the margins of the economy and investing in conserving
technologies. It means creating a framework of economic institutions and
management practices that anchor economic power in community and achieve
a substantial degree of equity in power relationships. <BR>
<BR>
An economics of community provides the foundation for an economic practice
aimed at restoring a necessary balance in the relationships among people,
place and community. Spirituality and community - not money - define the
dominant binding ties in such an economics. The preservation of the long-term
productive potential of ecological resources receives a high priority, and
long-term returns to community take precedence over short-term returns to
the individual investor.
<H4>ENTERPRISE-BASED ACCOUNTING</H4>
The economics of alienation (<A HREF="#AsianNGOsb">see below</A>) is deeply
imbedded in society's dominant institutional systems and procedures. This
includes the national income accounting systems by which gross national
product (GNP) - the universal proxy for national well-being - is measured.
One basic flaw of the GNP accounting system is that what it measures isn't
really national product. It is simply the aggregate product of the business
enterprises from whose accounting records it is compiled. There is no accounting
for gross <I>natural </I>product, or gross <I>people's </I>product.<BR>
<BR>
The firm is not expected even to be aware of, let alone manage, the external
social and environmental costs of its production. This same externalization
is carried all the way through the aggregation process. Consequently, GNP
takes no account of such things as the loss of environmental resources or
deterioration in the educational level of the work force over time - even
though these represent clear losses to society. <BR>
<BR>
The clean-up of the Exxon Valdez oil spill was counted as a net gain for
the Alaskan economy, and the insurance payments for the bombing of the World
Trade Center in New York showed up as a net gain for the economy of New
York City. Thus both were good for the economy by current accounting practice.<BR>
<BR>
Furthermore, GNP includes only the income and costs reflected in the income
statements and balance sheets of business firms operating in the formal
sector. Subsistence production, household labor, and the rental value of
owner occupied dwellings are all excluded in most countries. This excludes
a substantial portion of those activities on which most of the world's people
depend for their livelihoods.
<H4>COMMUNITY-BASED ACCOUNTING</H4>
Work on an alternative system of a community-based economic accounting system
is well underway in the Philippines. This system takes the household and
the community as the primary units of analysis and aggregation. The economic
performance of firms would be addressed in subsidiary accounts that reflect
their contributions to the community and those who reside in it. This approach
represents an important step toward a practice of sustainability derived
from the theory of sustainability outlined earlier. 3<BR>
<BR>
In this system the community unit defines both a citizenry and a habitat
with definable characteristics of land, water, soil cover, vegetation, marine
resources, and mineral resources. The citizens are classified by characteristics
such as age, gender, occupation, education, and income levels. Each household
is defined in terms of its bundle of economic needs, which the system compares
with actual consumption.<BR>
<BR>
The community balance sheet includes its natural resource as assets. Production
processes, such as in agriculture, forestry, mining, fisheries, trade, services,
create flows between asset or stock accounts, sectors, factors of production,
and households or consumers. This provides the basis for a community-based
double-entry accounting system.<BR>
<BR>
The accounts may be organized according to a hierarchy of settlements -
households comprising hamlets comprising neighborhoods comprising villages
clustered around market towns clustered around an urban center. At all levels
the community-based accounting system defines an economy that is inseparable
from its habitat and defines an essential role for local government in the
management of that economy and its underlying natural resource base.
<H4>A BASIS FOR LOCAL DECISION MAKING</H4>
Since the community-based accounting system accounts for both natural and
human capital stocks, the social and environmental costs of economic activity
are automatically internalized and highlighted. The clear cutting of a forest
is reflected immediately in the reduction of relevant asset accounts. <BR>
<BR>
Both the financial gains from economic activity and the consumption of the
goods and services produced are allocated by household, so distributional
outcomes are also integral to the system. It is clear who is capturing the
returns from productive processes, what household needs are being met and
what needs are not. Resource flows into and out of the community are also
highlighted, thus providing a very different perspective on investment decisions
than do conventional methods.<BR>
<BR>
Many investment projects are highly profitable to a firm or individual,
yet very costly for the community. Clear cut logging for export is a graphic
example. Logging activities can produce enormous profits for individual
firms and register positively in GNP without providing sufficient returns
to the community in the form of wages and fees to compensate for losses
from increased flooding and drought, soil loss, downstream siltation, and
the costs of replanting. <BR>
<BR>
Export processing zones provide another common example. They expropriate
land, dominate local government decision making, enjoy tax holidays, demand
fully developed infrastructure that must be paid for by local taxpayers,
make priority claims on local water supplies and power generation, have
few linkages to the local economy other than hiring labor at low wages,
and contaminate local land and water supplies with their toxic wastes. The
firms may generate handsome profits that go abroad, without compensating
the community for its costs.<BR>
<BR>
With a community-based accounting system, the full costs and benefits to
the community are revealed so that investment proposals may be assessed
accordingly. The community may then negotiate with outside investors and
trade interests on the basis of a community balance sheet, exactly as a
firm now decides whether to engage in a given market transaction based on
the results anticipated for its balance sheet.<BR>
<BR>
Community-based accounting supports application of the principle of subsidiarity
- i.e., that each decision should be made at the lowest feasible organizational
level - and its corollary that, to the extent feasible, basic needs should
be met within smaller, more localized economic units. <BR>
<BR>
This means that smaller units will seek trade with one another and with
larger units only as the exchange offers clear advantages to the community
over local production. Otherwise, the preference will be for local producers.
<BR>
<BR>
The community-based accounting system provides a tool for managing such
choices in the community interest. This strengthens the link between the
community's well-being and the health of its local ecosystems. It also reduces
external dependence and thereby the potential for exploitative alienation
of its resources by external interests.<BR>
<BR>
The effective application of the community-based accounting system demands
broadly based community involvement. By establishing the concept of a local
economy, the relationships of human interests to place and community take
on new meaning. This in turn enhances awareness that the community's ecological
resource base is the foundation of its well-being over time. The community
becomes deeply aware of the consequences of giving free reign to footloose
capital and external trading interests seeking only to extract local value
for export. Social practice based on an economics of cooperation and ecological
stewardship is encouraged.
<H4>ACTION OF THE SPIRIT</H4>
Our dominant institutions are blinded to the deeper realities of the sustainability
crisis by their own power imperatives. So long as this remains the case
there is no prospect that they will provide the leadership we so badly need.
Informed and enlightened citizen action is our only hope. <BR>
<BR>
Replacing the action of financial calculation with action of the spirit
goes right to the core of the transformational process. As that awareness
builds perhaps our most important task is to encourage one another to trust
our inner knowledge and to find the courage to act upon it. s<BR>

<H2><CENTER><A NAME="AsianNGOsb"></A>THE ECONOMICS OF ALIENATION</CENTER>
</H2>
We believe the source of our collective social and ecological crisis can
be traced to the long historical processes by which the human species has
become increasingly alienated from community and nature. This alienation
has both intellectual and institutional roots.<BR>
<BR>
Intellectually it is rooted in the Western concept of dualism, which sets
humanity apart from nature and legitimizes the view that humanity has not
only the right, but also the obligation to subdue nature to its own benefit.<BR>
<BR>
The concept of separation was central to Descartes' thesis that humans have
the ability to be objective observers of reality. This simple idea unleashed
the intellectual and institutional forces that produced the remarkable scientific
and technological advances of Western society. <BR>
<BR>
These advances in turn set in motion a long period of exponential growth
in the demands that human economic activity places on earth's ecosystem.
The dynamics of this growth continuously strengthened the basic illusion
that through their command of technology, humans have become the masters
of the natural world and no longer need to heed its limits. It is curious
indeed that a species that prides itself on its intelligence continues to
maintain this arrogance in the face of the mounting body of evidence that
the underlying belief is based on nothing more than a dangerous self-delusion.
Why?<BR>
<H4>MONEY</H4>
The answer may be found in the extent to which money has become the arbiter
of values and the motivating force of nearly all human institutions and
activities. The quest to endlessly replicate money has become so deeply
embedded in human values and institutions that we might easily conclude
that it is the organizing principle of public policy. <BR>
<BR>
The profound implications of that quest become clear only when we recognize
that the historical process has been one of substituting money, a substanceless
artifact, for spirituality, the universal life force, as the primary source
of value, meaning, and identity in human society. <BR>
<BR>
Our collective obsession with the replication of money is both cause and
consequence of our collective alienation from the reality of the spiritual
nature of all life. This alienation is the root cause of the social and
ecological crisis that now threatens our collective future.<BR>
<BR>
Money serves two functions in modern society: as a medium of exchange and
as a storehouse of value. Its function as a medium of exchange is purely
utilitarian, a useful and positive institutional invention. <BR>
<BR>
It is money's ability to serve as a storehouse of value, wholly divorced
from any intrinsic or instrumental values, that has made it a powerful instrument
of alienation. As money becomes the activating force of institutions, the
holder of a large store of monetary credits is increasingly able to exercise
alienating claims over the natural resources, talents, and knowledge of
others.<BR>
<BR>
Financial debts are a particularly common instrument of alienation. International
debts owed by countries to commercial and multilateral banks have the alienating
power of bonding the labor and resources of future generations of one country
to the future generations of another.<BR>
<BR>
The persistent processes of alienation have become a daily experience in
poor rural communities around the world. As ties to community and place
are broken, dispossessed people migrate to cities where they become dependent
on the monetary economy. Money becomes a substitute for the affiliational
ties of community and place. The accountant replaces the religious teacher
as the arbiter of value.<BR>
<BR>
The greater one's relative economic power and the more seamless the global
economy, the greater the freedom enjoyed by the powerful to exercise claims
over the non-monetary resources of the poor. <BR>
<BR>
Released from the constraints of place and of obligation to community, those
who control accumulated financial credits seek out ecological surpluses.
The poorer the existing claimants of those resources, the more easily the
holder of financial credits may gain control of them and shift any related
social and environmental burdens onto those unable to protest.<BR>
<BR>
Under conditions of equality, however, it is difficult, if not impossible,
for one group to alienate another from their physical resource base. The
greater the inequality, the greater the freedom enjoyed by the powerful
to plunder the environmental resources of others. The greater the plunder,
the greater the displacement and further impoverishment of the weak - until
the point of social and ecological collapse.<BR>
<BR>
It is neither poverty nor wealth that creates environmental destruction.
It is inequality. <I>Equity is an essential precondition for sustainability.<BR>
</I>
<H4>EQUITY AND SUSTAINABILITY</H4>
The behaviors of both rich and poor exacerbate the sustainability crisis:
the rich by their overconsumption of resources beyond what the ecosystem
can sustain; the poor by having large families that increase the number
of human claims that future generations will make against whatever resources
remain. Each is responding to the alienation process in terms of their own
experience and the opportunities available to them.<BR>
<BR>
The wealthy seek to fill their social and spiritual emptiness through consuming
the material goods that advertisers relentlessly assure them will provide
them with a sense of identity, empowerment, popularity, and meaning. <BR>
<BR>
The poor seek to reduce the overwhelming sense of insecurity created by
loss of community and rights to ecological space by having children - the
one thing they can call their own and their only prospective source of care
in their hour of need.<BR>
<BR>
Bringing both consumption and population levels into balance with what nature
can sustain is an essential precondition for sustainability. Both require
the elimination of gross political and economic inequality.<I><BR>

<I><BR>
Among the best examples we have of community economics at work can be found
in the cooperative movement. This movement, at its best, fosters self-reliance
and member participation at the grassroots. It can also provide the connections
both to other members and to producers that allow members to gain clout
in areas that had previously been closed to them.<BR>
<BR>
Among the most successful of such cooperatives is the Seikatsu Club, which
was started nearly 30 years ago by a Japanese housewife. <BR>
<BR>
What makes this example remarkable is its growth, not only in size - which
now tops 200,000 member-households - but its growth in the involvement and
empowerment of its members. <BR>
<BR>
This story is based in part on interviews with two Seikatsu Club members,
translated by our summer intern, Joseph Willemssen.</I><BR>
<BR>
Like millions of other married Japanese women, Iwaki Kayoru used to work
at home and do some volunteer work on the side. It was the late 1970s, and
her work helping severely handicapped children had gotten Kayoru thinking
about the health effects of food preservatives. But beyond that, she didn't
give much thought to such things as grassroots political organizing, the
price of her groceries, or Japan's environmental problems. <BR>
<BR>
Then, a friend told her about the Seikatsu Club, a consumer-goods cooperative,
which had, at the time, about 60,000 member households.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I joined Seikatsu and, as a result of all the studying and learning
I did, my consciousness was raised,&quot; says Kayoru, now 53 and living
in Kamakura. &quot;If I were still a plain housewife, there's no way I would
have been able to experience all that I have.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
With Seikatsu as a classroom, Kayoru learned what the rest of the co-op's
members also were discovering: that by working together and by valuing quality
over profits, housewives can have a tremendous effect on the food and other
household goods they purchase. Beyond that, they found they could assure
that their purchases were produced and distributed in safe, environmentally
friendly ways. When they reached the limits of what could be accomplished
within the cooperative sphere, they discovered they could muster political
clout and influence government policy in a country where for centuries men
have had the power.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Acquaintances of mine, who had spent their time relaxing at home drinking
tea, are now politically active,&quot; Kayoru says. &quot;People have made
dramatic changes in their lives.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Now, 15 years after Kayoru joined Seikatsu, the co-op has more than 218,000
member households in 12 Japanese prefectures, 700 full-time staffers, and
its own line of 60 products. With each<B> </B>member contributing 1,000
yen (about $9) a month, the co-op has $120 million in investments, the fourth-largest
total of any co-op in Japan. Last year, Seikatsu did 71 billion yen in retail
sales - about $650 million. <BR>
<BR>
Seikatsu - literally, &quot;life and living of ordinary people&quot; - is
part of <A HREF="Thompson.htm#JapanCoops">Japan's exploding consumer co-op
movement</A>.
<H4>CONSUMER DEMOCRACY</H4>
From all appearances, Seikatsu has been able to maintain the spirit out
of which it was created in 1965, when a housewife, concerned about the rising
price of food, organized 200 other women to buy 300 bottles of milk. In
one respect, in fact, Seikatsu is even <I>more</I> decentralized than when
that first purchase was made: today, bulk purchases are made by <I>hans
- </I>groups of 6 to 13 families that place orders for food and other products
once a month. Today, Seikatsu has over 26,000 <I>hans</I>.<BR>
<BR>
Because <I>hans</I> place orders well in advance of when member families
actually will need the goods, freshness and a timely delivery are assured,
and families and producers are better able to plan. <BR>
<BR>
The co-op also has been able to maintain a high level of member involvement:
members decide what items are purchased and produced, inspect for quality,
and elect representatives to the various levels of Seikatsu's internal &quot;government.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Members also work side-by-side with producers. &quot;It's epochal that in
this world of mass-market economics, we can now know who grew our food and
where and how it was processed,&quot; says Watanabe Mitsuko, 43, a Seikatsu
member since 1974. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;I've toured farms and factories, and helped with weeding and harvesting,&quot;
says Mitsuko. &quot;I've gotten to know the production methods and the producers'
way of thinking. In the process I can explain my thinking to them. It's
a relationship of mutual reliance.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
The result, Mitsuko says, is that &quot;instead of just hearing demands
for reasonable prices and stable supplies, the producer now hears our requests
for high-quality, safe food.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
These lines of communication also have enabled Seikatsu organizers to eliminate
middlepeople; goods are delivered by co-op staffers directly from the producer
to the <I>hans</I>, which helps to hold down costs, ensure product freshness
and foster unity. <BR>
<BR>
The operation is further simplified by the co-op's &quot;one product/one
variety&quot; policy of selling, for example, only one type of soy sauce
in one-liter glass bottles. Seikatsu handles 400 different products, of
which 60 percent are staple food products, whereas more than 300,000 products
are available on the open market. <BR>
<BR>
The co-op supports small, local farms by guaranteeing them a certain amount
of business if they avoid using chemical pesticides and fertilizers. When
it can't find products that meet its standards, the club starts its own
farm or processing facility.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;It takes time and it's not easy,&quot; says Mitsuko, who has held
several management positions within the co-op. &quot;But we've had an opportunity
to learn self-management and self-reliance.&quot;<BR>
<H4>EMPOWERING WOMEN</H4>
The co-op's emphasis on member-empowerment has given rise to about 150 worker-run
business collectives made up of more than 3,000 members, again, mainly married
women. Kayoru runs one of them, a &quot;welfare club co-op&quot; that delivers
food to the elderly.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;In a big company you are just a cog in the machine,&quot; she says.
&quot;But in a workers' collective, one can express one's thoughts and do
things one likes much more easily. Further, men already have the advantage
in the world of big firms. But in a collective, women are in the mainstream.
I find that much more interesting!&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Other spin-off enterprises include a medical-insurance collective, a mental-health
service, and a volunteer-labor pool to help the needy.<BR>
<BR>
Lately, women have begun to make gains within the Seikatsu organization.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Initially, men held most of the executive and administrative positions,
and we went along with that tradition,&quot; Mitsuko says. &quot;But women
are now taking on these positions.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
According to Mitsuko, the co-op's philosophy and structure have taken on
feminine characteristics, which is not surprising when you consider that
95 percent of the members are women.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;The special qualities of women - in particular their softness, their
pragmatism, their regard for life and proper lifestyle, their personal connections
with the community - have made a large contribution to the growth and success
of Seikatsu,&quot; she says.<BR>
<H4>POLITICS FROM THE KITCHEN</H4>
In this setting, the members' broader environmental, societal, and other
concerns can be heard up the organizational ladder. Seikatsu has a strict
policy against producing or selling any artificially seasoned foods, clothing
with fluorescents, and synthetic detergents. <BR>
<BR>
This democratic, personal-involvement philosophy has had ripple effects
throughout the co-op's membership. With <I>hans</I> getting together at
least once a month to plan their food orders, the infrastructure is in place
to address issues beyond the immediate scope of the cooperative.<BR>
<BR>
There was the &quot;soap movement&quot; of 1974, launched when parents discovered
skin irritation on their young children and cracks in their own skin. The
ubiquitous synthetic soap that caused the problems also apparently led to
the disappearance of the <I>shirauo</I> fish from at least one river.<BR>
<BR>
So Mitsuko, along with two-thirds of the co-op's members, switched to natural
soap and started a national petition drive urging local and regional governments
to ban synthetic soaps. Seikatsu now makes its own soap powder from used
cooking oil in its own production plant, and the <I>shirauo</I> has made
a comeback.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Our water, our soil, our air - if we do not protect our ecosystem,
we cannot assure safe living,&quot; Mitsuko says. &quot;I did not have this
understanding before entering Seikatsu. Being in Seikatsu has really changed
my way of thinking.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Seikatsu changed Mitsuko so much, in fact, that she ran for public office,
winning a seat in the Kanagawa prefectural assembly in 1991. All told, about
75 co-op members have been elected under the &quot;Political Reform from
the Kitchen&quot; platform. Co-op members also are networking with grassroots
organizations in other countries, and they sent representatives to the Earth
Summit and The Other Economic Summit.<BR>
<BR>
The co-op's accomplishments have not gone unnoticed outside of the country.
In 1989, Seikatsu won the Right Livelihood Award, otherwise known as the
Alternative Nobel Prize. During a ceremony held that year in Stockholm,
award founder Jakob von Uexkull said of the co-op: <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Alternative economics, in order to have an impact, cannot just withdraw
from society but must aim to create a new mainstream. We honor Seikatsu
as a project which has successfully taken up this challenge, proving that
it is possible to grow an organization of over 500,000 members without losing
the original vision.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
It's a vision, Mitsuko says, that will not easily blur.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;We're using our collective strength to take an idea, put it in practice,
and keep it going,&quot; she says. &quot;We're bringing this idea to society's
attention as a practical model for our future society.&quot;<BR>

<H1><CENTER>Co-ops &amp; Competition</CENTER>
</H1>
<H4><CENTER><I>by David Thompson</I></CENTER>
</H4>
<I>David Thompson is principal of Thompson Consulting and works with coops
in the US, Europe and Japan. He is also president of Twin Pines Cooperative
Foundation and author of more than 100 articles and publications about</I>
<I>co-ops.</I><BR>
<BR>
In 89 countries of the world, over 700 million individuals are members of
cooperative organizations. Aggregated globally, cooperatives are a powerful
economic model. In some countries they are a sizeable force within the national
economy. <BR>
<BR>
On the other hand, many cooperatives are small, independent and marginal.
Frequently they are invested in their local community to the exclusion of
external alliances and networks. One of the great and yet unsolved dilemmas
facing cooperatives today is how to maintain sustainability as a locally
controlled independent economic unit in a competitive market dominated by
larger and larger players who have neither respect nor interest in community
or national borders. 
<H4>CO-OPS IN EUROPE</H4>
At the end of the Second World War, consumer cooperatives were a major presence
in most European countries. They could be found in almost every town and
city. Most were still locally owned and controlled democratic institutions
responsive to their local community. <BR>
<BR>
Cooperatives in the modern sense have been around since the people of Rochdale,
England founded their co-op in 1844. The consumer cooperatives of Europe
were the first to organize group purchasing, wholesales, transportation
networks, and a host of allied services, such as banking and insurance.
While they were the only retailers doing it, the independent local co-ops
were economically successful and they were growing. Fortunately for the
cooperatives, it was not until after the Second World War that competition
among retailers began to heat up. Chains were forming, wholesales being
organized, supermarkets being built. For about 25 years, the co-ops stood
and watched the competition take away their market share. The local cooperative
societies, with their small corner shops on High Street, were no match for
the big supermarkets sitting on cheap land on the outskirts of town. <BR>
<BR>
Does this all mean that the future of retailing is in the hands of the multi-nationals?
What has to be done to maintain a cooperative in a competitive environment?
<H4>BANDING TOGETHER</H4>
Consumer cooperative organizations in Europe, Israel and Japan recognized
the growing global market and created Inter-Coop in 1971. The objective
was to promote economic collaboration between the member organizations and
thus to increase their competitive power. By the end of 1992, 18 central
buying organizations from 16 countries were members of Inter-Coop. The 2,800
primary-level society members operate 15,500 shops; the members' 1991 turnover
was 45,229 million ECUs (European Currency Units).<BR>
<BR>
Inter-Coop created a non-food buying group, which in 1992 accounted for
joint purchases of 70 million ECUs. During 1992, Inter-Coop signed agreements
with 17 major European non-food suppliers. <BR>
<BR>
The main headquarters of Inter-Coop are in Denmark with an office in Hong
Kong. Inter-Coop also has a close working relationship with NAF, a Danish
organization owned by eight of the Inter-Coop members that handles joint
food purchasing. NAF, through its California office, is one of the largest
purchasers of food products from California's agricultural cooperatives.<BR>
<BR>
Due to the volume of purchases from Asia, Inter-Coop created a transportation
system for the region that last year shipped 6,500 containers to Inter-Coop
member organizations.<BR>
<BR>
Inter-Coop also established Inter-Coop Retail to exchange information and
experience on retail trade, to train senior managers, and to develop a &quot;Strategic
Management&quot; course.<BR>
<BR>
In response to the member co-ops' environmental concerns, Inter-Coop buyers
do what they can to obtain environmentally friendly goods. The creation
of Inter-Coop was an important step in increasing savings through collaboration.
The Inter-Coop link allowed the co-ops to benefit by obtaining discounts
based upon their combined volume, just as the commercial chains were already
doing.<BR>
<BR>
At the same time, this interdependence at the top helped to strengthen the
independence of the national cooperative movements. <BR>

<H2><CENTER><A NAME="JapanCoops"></A>JAPAN'S COOPERATIVE MOVEMENT</CENTER>
</H2>
<BR>
The Japanese cooperative movement today has 13 million members involved
in 665 local cooperative societies, which operate 2,300 stores with over
50,000 employees. Over 5 million households participate regularly in nearly
1 million <I>han</I> groups. The number of <I>han </I>groups has doubled
in the past five years.<BR>
<BR>
The success of the <I>han </I>approach can be attributed to a combination
of features:
<UL>
<LI>They reduce the need for tremendous amounts of capital by not having
to build or own stores. At least in the early stages, their capital investment
went only into distribution centers and small delivery trucks. <BR>
<BR>
<LI>They take advantage of the huge jump in computer technology to give
people at home tremendous ease in ordering and communica-tion. <BR>
<BR>
<LI>They separate the centralized management and distribution center from
the decentralized <I>han </I>groups. The business side focuses on aggregating
and using economic power, allowing participants at the <I>han </I>level
to concentrate on member activity and democratic participation. 
</UL>
<BR>
As a result, the cooperatives offer economic advantages of scale to their
members as consumers, while at the same time providing the organizing advantages
of decentralization to their members as citizen activists. The combination
of the two elements is without doubt the most important example of a successful
consumer cooperative to emerge in the 20th Century.<I><BR>

<H4><CENTER><I>an interview with David Morris, by Sarah van Gelder</I></CENTER>
</H4>
<I><BR>
All the controversy over free trade has raised interesting questions about
the kind of world we want. What are the trade-offs between community control
and a global culture? What's the connection between trade and sustainability?
<BR>
<BR>
We asked David Morris to share his perspectives on trade. He is vice president
of the Institute for Local Self-Reliance, a 19-year-old organization that
promotes humanly scaled, environmentally sound economies and institutions.
The author of four books and several dozen monographs, he is a consultant
to business and government in the US and abroad. His most recent reports
include: The Carbohydrate Economy, The Mondragon Cooperative, and The Trade
Papers.<BR>
<BR>
</I><B>Sarah: Can you tell me what you mean by self-reliance and how you
differentiate it from self-sufficiency?<BR>
<BR>
David: </B>Self-reliance is the <I>capacity </I>for self-sufficiency, not
self-sufficiency itself. Self-reliant communities are self-conscious and
self-confident. They extract the maximum value from local resources - labor,
capital, materials. Their diversified economies are characterized by a substantial
locally owned productive capacity. They satisfy a significant proportion
of their needs from their own resource base. <BR>
<BR>
Self-reliant communities also possess the collective authority to make the
rules that influence their futures, and their members have access to the
information necessary to write these rules wisely. <B><BR>
<BR>
Sarah: Why is self-reliance preferable to a system in which every community
specializes in one or two products that are traded and consumed elsewhere?<BR>
<BR>
David: </B>Classical economists like David Ricardo and Adam Smith - the
fathers of free trade theory - were absolutely correct in their belief that
efficient and innovative economies must rely on a division of labor. A division
of labor demands a system of exchange or trade. <BR>
<BR>
But these 18th and 19th century economists also were clear that the benefits
of trade must be balanced against the need for security and community. They
did not believe, for example, that we should make ourselves defenseless
by becoming totally dependent on distant resources even when we might make
money by doing so. They opposed foreign ownership of key resources or productive
capacity. <BR>
<BR>
The fathers of free trade lived during an era in which capital was not very
mobile, transportation systems were primitive, and advanced communications
systems were non-existent. <BR>
<BR>
Today all resources, except for land, are mobile. The heirs of Adam Smith
now seem to argue that the most efficient and perfect economy is one in
which the productive capacity of communities is absentee owned and everything
produced in these communities is exported while everything consumed is imported.
And the authority of citizens to regulate commercial behavior is extremely
limited.<BR>
<BR>
Such a future has many hidden costs. For one thing, it heavily depends on
physical transportation systems, which, by definition go through somebody
else's backyard. Within this country, the government has the authority to
seize private property to build roads, ports, airports, and it does so regularly.
Interestingly, this is the only governmental authority both liberals and
conservatives stoutly defend. <BR>
<BR>
Outside of the country we don't have a legal right to seize property, but
we do so anyway. The US invasion of Panama in the beginning of this century
and the repeated invasions since have had as their sole purpose the construction
and defense of a short-cut canal between the East Coast and Asian markets.
The Gulf War was fought to protect our transportation routes to Middle Eastern
oil. When you build economies that depend on long-distance physical transportation
systems, you build economies that depend on invading someone's territory.<BR>
<BR>
Physical transportation systems not only invade our space with their bulk
but also with their pollutants. Transportation is the single most polluting
sector, and the use of heavy trucks and highways is the most polluting system
of all.<BR>
<BR>
Another cost of the planetary economy as currently envisioned is that it
separates the producer from the consumer, the employer from the employee,
the investor from the investment. The end result is undemocratic and inefficient
decision-making. <BR>
<BR>
Consider what might happen if this were to change. Today we separate the
producer, the consumer, and the waste dump. The result is to encourage pollution.
Imagine if we were to pass a national or international law that required
households or industries to dispose of their wastes within two miles of
where it was generated. I think they would quickly use their genius to design
technologies and techniques that dramatically reduce waste, especially hazardous
waste, and maximize recycling and re-use.<B><BR>
<BR>
Sarah: Presumably, even with increased self-reliance, there would still
need to be some kind of trade. You mentioned in &quot;The Trade Papers&quot;
that part of that trade might be electronic. Can you expand a little on
that?<BR>
<BR>
David: </B>Albert Einstein once observed, &quot;Perfection of means and
confusion of ends seems to characterize our age.&quot; Trade agreements
illustrate his point. They perfect means, such as mobility, and simply assume
the ends will take care of themselves. Indeed, trade discussions rarely
include any mention of ends, except for the vague end of increased growth.
<BR>
<BR>
We need to agree on a set of goals and design the means with an eye toward
achieving those goals. The following goals seem to me relatively uncontroversial:
rootedness, a sense of community, a high level of psychological peace of
mind, national security, environmental protection, a meaningful level of
participation by members of the community in decision-making, and a dynamic
and innovative economy.<BR>
<BR>
Trade discussions apply the same philosophical and regulatory approach to
all factors of production. That simplistic and simple- minded approach burdens
the discussion. Trade in each factor of production - labor, raw materials,
finished goods, information and capital - has a very different impact on
our sense of community, our national security, and our natural environment.
Let me briefly address each:
<UL>
<LI><I>Raw materials.</I> From an environmental perspective the goal is
to minimize materials consumption and substitute renewables for non-renewables.
Improving efficiency and increasing reuse and recycling can dramatically
reduce consumption. Doing this, as well as shifting to renewables like wind
and direct sunlight and plant matter for fuels and industrial materials,
encourages a miniaturization of economies. The higher the efficiency with
which we use materials, the fewer materials we use and therefore the fewer
we import. The more we recycle or reuse the more we rely on local products
or materials. And renewable resources are widely available and easily harnessed
on the decentralized level.<BR>
<BR>
Trade rules should maximize efficiency and recycling and the use of renewable
rather than non-renewable materials. The result will be a dramatic reduction
in long-distance trade.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><I>Finished goods.</I> Ten years ago, our economies were still based
on mass production systems. The bigger the production unit the lower the
unit cost of production. Factories that produce tens of thousands of a product
must sell to national and even global markets.<BR>
<BR>
Today business leaders use the term economies of <I>scope </I>rather than
economies of <I>scale</I>. Flexible manufacturing and other techniques allow
factories to produce small batches of many kinds of products at the same
cost as producing large quantities. These factories could, in theory, serve
smaller markets. When it comes to finished goods, trade rules should encourage
distributed, decentralized, and flexible production systems. The result
will be to significantly reduce long-distance trade.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><I>Labor.</I> A true free-trade regime would open its borders to unlimited
immigration. Doing so, in the long term, might equalize the wealth of poor
and large countries. However, in the process it would disrupt communities,
breed a violent backlash, and destabilize democracies. The rules of trade
should foster development that doesn't encourage or force people to leave
their homes and communities and doesn't subject other communities to a wave
of immigration.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><I>Capital.</I> Once upon a time money on the international level was
simply a medium of exchange. Up until 1970, the amount of currency exchanged
on the international level was about equal to the amount of world trade
in goods and services. People changed currencies when they visited a foreign
country or bought or sold foreign goods. Today the value of currency exchanges
in one day is about equal to the value of world trade in one year. And as
currencies change hands, the comparative value of currencies changes and
with it the comparative prices of goods and services.<BR>
<BR>
Free traders believe this global sloshing about of waves of currency fosters
economic efficiency. It may be that one can now borrow money at a slightly
lower interest rate because one can borrow globally. But the consequence
has been increasingly volatile exchange rates. Business executives now spend
much time tracking currency exchanges or buying financial instruments called
hedges, which lock in a given exchange rate. The cost of these insurance
policies offsets the benefit of the marginally lower interest rates derived
from global financial markets.<BR>
<BR>
Another consequence of the globalization of money is the diminished ability
of governments to manage their economies. The real economy of goods and
services is now driven by the artificial and even mystical economy of currency
exchange, an economy dominated by a few very large currency speculators.<BR>
<BR>
In the 1970s the US passed the Community Reinvestment Act. It said that
banks had to lend at least a part of their deposits generated within their
communities back to all segments of their communities. Trade rules should
encourage the reinvestment of wealth generated by a community back into
that community.<BR>
<BR>
Capital can also translate into ownership and control. Communities should
be able to develop rules that encourage local ownership and discourage absentee
ownership. <BR>
<BR>
<LI><I>Information.</I> Digital highways, unlike concrete highways, are
not polluting And information, for the most part, is non-invasive. We should
design rules that accelerate the flow of informational products. However,
these rules should not only encourage increased flows but also encourage
an increasingly horizontal rather than vertical transfer of information.
Today planetary corporations beam messages to people who they view solely
as consumers. In the future information systems could allow neighborhoods,
households, and small businesses to produce informational goods and services
and market (for example, broadcast) them directly to the final customer.
We could become, in Alvin Toffler's words, a world of <I>prosumers</I>.<BR>
<BR>
In addition, we should take into account the needs of low-income communities
and countries and strive for universal, low-cost access to basic information
systems.<BR>
<BR>
The end result of developing trade rules with social, environmental, and
political goals in mind might be a new kind of dual economy, a global village
and a globe of villages. A globe of materially self-reliant villages would
produce a significant portion of their materials and energy and perhaps
even finished goods within their regions, while a global village trades
informational products along a planetary electronic network. 
</UL>
<BR>
Sarah: I'd like to ask you about the province of Kerala, which is one of
India's most highly populated provinces and which has done a lot to alleviate
poverty and increase literacy, and so forth. But one thing they haven't
been able to do is to become self-sufficient in food, and it doesn't sound
like they are likely to do so. Given that there are parts of the world in
that situation, under what circumstances should trade be encouraged? <BR>
<BR>
David: Let me repeat that self-reliance doesn't mean <I>autarchy </I>or
complete self-sufficiency. Very high density countries like Singapore are
not going to grow a significant amount of their own food. <BR>
<BR>
Having said that, I should also add that agriculture has been heavily distorted
by the demands of trade. Countries and regions that once grew food for their
own consumption are now growing export crops, usually because of external
pressure from international financial institutions that want these countries
to earn hard currencies to pay back their debts. One result is that they
have become increasingly dependent on remote and unstable customers for
their crops, while in many cases lowering the overall nutritional levels
of their own populations. <B><BR>
<BR>
Sarah: Some people claim that free trade will bring greater prosperity to
parts of the world that aren't now prosperous. <BR>
<BR>
David: </B>The level of inequality both within nations and external to nations
has increased every decade since we began the free trade regime. In the
mid-19th century, richer countries were about twice as wealthy as poorer
countries. That ratio went to 5 to 1 and then 8 to 1 and now I think it's
something like 12 to 1. Inequality has also increased inside many countries.
So I don't think that one can argue that increased trade has made us all
more prosperous.<BR>
<BR>
When you look outward for development you tend to overlook your local capacities.
In Latin America, where I lived, when they have shifted to exports it has
enriched a segment of the economy, but the overall living standards have
not increased. <BR>
<BR>
In Mexico, where exports have soared in the last 10 years, real manufacturing
wages have been cut in half. So I don't think that one can make an argument
that increasing trade lifts up countries. <B><BR>
<BR>
Sarah: Since there will be some level of trade, what's your sense about
how that trade can be structured so that it doesn't have the kind of environmental
effects and impacts on workers and local communities that our current trade
system has?<BR>
<BR>
David: </B>First, we should encourage <I>fair </I>trade rather than <I>free
</I>trade. That means we should compete on the basis of quality, reliability,
productivity, customer satisfaction or turn-around time rather than simply
on the basis of price, especially when price is determined by how much workers
are paid or how lax or rigorous the environmental standards are. <BR>
<BR>
Second, we should allow communities to impose the same rules on imports
as they do on domestic producers. Eighteen months ago, a GATT [General Agreement
on Tariffs and Trade] panel concluded that parts of the US Marine Mammal
Protection Act constituted unfair trade practices. US law banned the sale
of tuna caught by fishing techniques that slaughtered dolphins. The GATT
panel ruled that the US could impose such a law on its own fishing fleets
but not on foreign fleets that sell fish in the US. Complying with that
ruling could force US companies out of business. <BR>
<BR>
Recently, the European Commission issued a report identifying unfair trade
practices in the US. It specifically cited California's requirement that
glass containers sold in the state contain a minimum proportion of recycled
content. California had vigorously encouraged recycling and its residents
had responded, and it had accumulated a mountain of materials in search
of markets. The state passed the recycled-content law to force manufacturers
to use these materials. The EC agreed that the environmental objectives
were worthy, but argued that since such a law would favor local bottlers
it constituted an unfair trade practice. <BR>
<BR>
Third, we should establish minimum, not maximum international labor and
environmental standards. Consider our own history. In the 1930s, low-wage
states aggressively pursued northern manufacturers. In 1938 the nation enacted
the Fair Labor Standards Act. It established minimum wages and maximum hour
standards, but allowed states to exceed these standards. In the 1970s and
1980s national environmental standards, in most cases, also allowed states
to do better. <BR>
<BR>
Fourth, we should adhere to the principle of subsidiarity. We should delegate
authority and responsibility to the lowest possible levels and impose a
significant burden of proof on higher levels of government to justify any
pre-emption or intervention in the affairs of cities or states or regions.<BR>
<BR>
Remember, free trade agreements are super-constitutions. They pre-empt national
and state constitutions and laws. Yet unlike Constitutions, these agreements
do not include a structure of government, a process for citizen participation
in decision-making, or a bill of rights. They have only one goal - the increased
mobility of all resources - and few if any safeguards. We need global rules
that allow us to manage the international and subnational flow of resources,
but they should be rules that reflect our core social and political values.<B><BR>
<BR>
Sarah: What are the most promising things you see happening in this arena?<BR>
<BR>
David: </B>One is the debate over free trade itself. Free trade discussions,
whether about the US-Canadian free trade agreement or GATT or NAFTA, or
the Single European Treaty are about the rules we design to manage our futures.
Increasingly, numbers of people are using these debates as an opportunity
to begin thinking about the kinds of rules they would enact. Creating global
rules that enable strong communities, preserve natural environments, defend
local cultures, and encourage innovation and resource efficiency is one
of the most important challenges of our time. <BR>
<BR>
Another reason for optimism is the debate around sustainable development,
which also offers us the opportunity to envision a different kind of economy
and society. Once again, it invites us to write the new rules that will
guide investment capital, entrepreneurial energy, and scientific genius
in different directions.<BR>
<BR>
A third reason for optimism is the new debate over the transportation system
itself. The recently enacted Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency
Act for the first time lets us spend gas tax money on bicycles, compact
communities, mass transit, telecommunications, and a host of non-road alternatives.
Hundreds of communities are now engaged in a healthy and at times wide-ranging
debate about the very design and layout and function of their areas. <BR>
<BR>
My optimism does not mean I ignore the fact that in all of these debates
there is an extraordinary inequality of power and resources between those
who believe the future should be a simple extrapolation of the present and
those who believe we can and should dramatically refashion societies and
economies. <BR>
<BR>
On the other hand, the fluidity of the current situation, the clear inability
of conventional ways of doing things to satisfy our basic needs, the overwhelming
disenchantment with what is, affords those of us who propose bold and even
radical solutions an unprecedented opportunity to be heard.<BR>

<BR>
<I>While the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) has been receiving
a lot of attention in the media lately, little attention has been focused
on an even more sweeping trade agreement, now in the works. Provisions of
the Uruguay round of talks on GATT (the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade) would further open the world to unrestrained transnational commerce.
Like NAFTA, GATT could set back efforts to gain more democratic control
over resources, technology, and living and working conditions. IC contributing
editor David Korten is a fellow of the People-Centered Development Forum,
14 E. 17th Street, Suite 5, New York, NY 10003.</I><BR>
<BR>
International trade and investment are means, not ends. Both can advance
the world's social and environmental well-being when managed within a political
framework that aligns market forces with the public interest, and preserves
the right of publics to determine what constitutes their interests.<BR>
<BR>
Unfortunately, little sunlight permeates the discussions on GATT. Its affairs
are conducted in secret meetings and are seldom exposed to public debate.
The public hears only assur-ances that a successful agreement will bring
new well-paying jobs for workers and lower prices for consumers. <BR>
<BR>
It is not mentioned that the Uruguay Round proposals include sweeping provisions
of uncertain outcome, including provision for trade sanctions imposed in
an attempt to force the repeal by signatory countries of conflicting national
and local laws. <BR>
<BR>
Under current GATT rules, enacting sanctions requires an unanimous endorsement
by GATT members. Under the draft proposal now being considered, the so-called
Dunkel draft, decisions by GATT dispute panels - three unchecked and unaccountable
officials meeting in secret - would be binding and enforceable unless overturned
by a unanimous vote of all GATT member countries.<BR>
<BR>
The mandate of the GATT is to deregulate trade. The proposal now under negotiation
seeks to expand the definition of regulatory trade barriers to prevent a
national or local government from: 
<UL>
  <LI>Excluding foreign products that fail to meet local environmental health
and product-safety standards if these exceed recognized international standards;<BR>
<BR>
  <LI>Restricting the export of natural resources, for example, through
laws requiring local value-added processing; <BR>
<BR>
  <LI>Giving preferential treatment to local producers;<BR>
<BR>
  <LI>Limiting foreign participation in any area of manufacturing, mining
or services (such as banking, insurance, and shipping); and<BR>
<BR>
  <LI>Failing to prevent infringement of the intellectual property rights
of foreign companies. 
</UL>
<BR>
Many of these GATT provisions are being advanced as necessary to assure
the efficient functioning of competitive markets. <BR>
<BR>
The GATT proposals do advance competition - among workers whose jobs can
be exported to low-wage, labor-surplus economies; among raw materials producers;
and among localities seeking to attract investment by offering cheap labor,
lax environmental, health and safety regulation, tax exemptions, and other
subsidies. <BR>
<BR>
The provisions do nothing to limit the ability of transnational corporations
to use their monopolistic powers to drive competitors out of the market
by unfair means, to eliminate competitors through mergers and acquisitions,
or to form non-competitive strategic alliances with &quot;competitors&quot;
to share technology, production facilities, and markets.<BR>
<BR>
The proposed GATT provisions will accelerate the shift of power from labor
and democratically elected governments to huge corporations, increasingly
freeing the latter from both the restraints of law and the competitive discipline
of the market. <BR>
<BR>
Capital and technology are the critical control points in a free and open
global economy. Removal of restrictions on investments by international
banks and other financial services companies will allow a few transnational
corporations to further extend their control over capital markets worldwide.
<BR>
<BR>
The intellectual property rights agreements will secure monopolistic control
by a small number of corporations over much of the world's store of technology
and genetic materials, including seeds and medicines. <BR>
<BR>
The ability of national and local legislative bodies to set and enforce
social, health, and environmental standards will be seriously compromised.<BR>
<BR>
The agenda of an open, one-world economy promoted by the IMF, World Bank,
and GATT has an intuitive appeal as a path to universal peace and prosperity.
Unfortunately, the more evident outcome is accelerating social and ecological
disintegration driven by cultural homogenization and the unrestrained concentration
and centralization of unaccountable economic power far removed from ties
to place and community.<BR>
<BR>
Closing the gap between rich and poor, moving toward a sustainable relationship
between human society and Earth's ecology, and giving real meaning to democratic
governance depend on exactly the opposite - the decentralization and distribution
of economic power and the nurturing of cultural diversity.<BR>
<BR>
It is time to make a fresh start toward rethinking and recreating the global
economy based on principles of decentralization, diversity, and distribution
- with full and open public debate.<BR>

<I><BR>
How can we bridge the gulf between the world views and standards of living
in the South and the North? The experience of citizen diplomacy gives some
clues: when ordinary people in the US and the USSR met face to face, the
illusion that they were enemies quickly fell away. <BR>
<BR>
Crossing the North-South divide and meeting people in their own communities
can also change the way we view the world. This has been the experience
of members of the Bainbridge Island-Ometepe Sister Islands Association,
who have worked, traded, and expanded their understanding about themselves
and their world through their ongoing relationship. <BR>
<BR>
David Mitchell, president of the association, shared his experience with
us. You can contact the association at PO Box 4484, Rolling Bay, WA 98061.</I><BR>
<BR>
In June of 1988 I stood in a rustic community center in the town of Altagracia,
on the Island of Ometepe. I was listening to my friend Kim Esterberg talking
to five, six, and seven-year-old children. We had just promised their parents
we would help them build a preschool. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;People come here because this is a beautiful island, but then they
go away,&quot; Kim told the kids. &quot;We want you to know that we will
be coming back, again and again. I'm looking forward to the time when I
can visit your children.&quot; It is this spirit that has nurtured the sisterhood
between Ometepe, in Lake Nicaragua, and my community on Bainbridge Island,
near Seattle. <BR>
<BR>
For me, this spirit is at the heart of a relationship that began with my
first visit to the island. During that visit, I stayed in a large barn,
which had been the main building on a large farm before the revolution in
1979 that overthrew the dictator Anastasio Somoza. The farm now belongs
to a cooperative made up of about 35 families, most of whom had worked this
land for absentee owners all their lives. After the revolution, they bought
the farm at great financial risk to themselves and began to build a new
life for their children.<BR>
<BR>
Our host, Denis Lopez Castillo, told us about having fought in the revolution
and about the challenges of administering the farm. We asked lots of questions,
and teased Denis that although he was younger than we were, he was teaching
us as a father would teach his children.<BR>
<BR>
In that setting, I came to terms with something I hadn't been aware of about
myself: I had thought of these people as beneath notice. Through traveling
to this beautiful island and having face-to-face contact with its people,
I discovered the heavy dose of Hispanic racism I had collected while growing
up. It was a terrible thing to have to see, but a valuable gift gently given.<BR>
<BR>
As that first trip taught me, the Sister Islands program is about building
bridges between people. I think the depth of our connections makes our sisterhood
program special. <BR>
<BR>
Many communities have sister relationships. Usually, politicians visit each
other and trade delegations and business people visit now and again. <BR>
<BR>
But the people from Bainbridge Island who travel to Ometepe - more than
100 since 1986 - represent a broad cross section of our community. And we
don't stay in hotels or inns. We stay with families; we get to know them
and make friends, and build a stake for ourselves in the community. <BR>
<BR>
We tend the relationship, and we understand that the projects we do are
secondary to the friendships we build. It's a process of building connections
that will last a long time.<BR>
<H4>THE COFFEE CONNECTION</H4>
One of these connections was made possible by the climatic conditions that
make Ometepe a perfect place to grow coffee, and the Seattle area a perfect
place to sell it.<BR>
<BR>
In 1991, the year after the United States lifted its embargo on Nicaraguan
imports, we sold on Bainbridge Island 2,200 pounds of organically grown
coffee from the same farm on Ometepe I had visited in 1988. Within a year
that total grew tenfold. Caf&eacute; Oro de Ometepe costs $8 a pound at
the island grocery and at other outlets, but people like it and are charmed
by the fact that we're not just asking for money but offering something
in exchange. They seem quite willing to pay a small premium.<BR>
<BR>
Besides coffee, the cooperative, one of 26 agricultural co-ops on Ometepe,
grows plantain, rice, honey and sugar cane, and raises cattle on its 1,000-acre
farm. What the members don't sell or barter on the island or elsewhere they
use for their own subsistence.<BR>
<BR>
For the cooperative's coffee, we pay 50 percent above the usual price for
coffee, or about 40-45 cents a pound extra. (The market price isn't even
enough to pay their expenses.) <BR>
<BR>
With our share of the coffee profits, we've been able to pay for a new water
system in a little village called San Pedro. We spent $17,500 to buy the
materials and pay a consultant to design the project and do the community
organization work. The people of the village volunteered an incredible amount
of work - digging trenches in volcanic rock and soil, hauling cement and
sand up to the dam, laying a mile's worth of pipe, and building a storage
tank. <BR>
<BR>
Now, the village's 65-odd families are free of the daily hardships associated
with hauling buckets of contaminated water up a steep, rocky trail from
the lake.<BR>
<BR>
It's a wonderful example of a tiny-scale project in which people worked
together despite ideological differences that had divided the community.
It's paying off for them - both personally and in terms of the whole community.
<BR>
<BR>
This kind of development is more effective than the usual foreign aid approach,
in which loans and grants often reinforce structures that promote inequality
and increase alienation.<BR>
<BR>
Other connections, although less palpable, are no less important or beneficial.<BR>
<BR>
For example, it's easy to say of our Nicaraguan friends, &quot;They're extremely
poor and we're well off, and that's the difference between us.&quot; But
it isn't that simple. Materially they lack a lot and suffer for it in many
ways. But they tend to live very rich family lives. The sense of community
on Ometepe is something many of us want very much for our own families and
communities.<BR>
<BR>
The relationship also has given us a way to begin to share our resources
with people who far too often have given up their resources - not necessarily
willingly and certainly without fair compensation. For those of us who have
gone there, Ometepe has been a beautiful and gentle reminder that much of
the world lives in great need of the kinds of resources we take for granted.<BR>
<BR>
While we have seen great differences between life on Bainbridge and on Ometepe,
we've also realized that we are in many ways the same as each other, that
we are interconnected in surprising ways. The problems we share will have
to be worked out together; beginning that process has been a marvelously
rewarding experience.<BR>

<H1><CENTER>Finding a Balance</CENTER>

<H3><CENTER></CENTER>

<H4><CENTER><I>An interview with Ricardo Navarro, by Sarah van Gelder</I></CENTER>
</H4>
<I><BR>
Ecological balance can't be obtained without also achieving improved economic
and social balance. That message, which goes to the heart of the concept
of sustainability, is also at the heart of the work being done by Ricardo
Navarro, the president of the Salvadoran Center for Appropriate Technology.
We had an opportunity to discuss these issues with Ricardo when he dropped
in at the Context Institute's office on Bainbridge Island this summer.<BR>
<BR>
For more information about CESTA, write to them at APDO. 3065, 33 Calle
Pte. 316, San Salvador, El Salvador.<BR>
<BR>
</I><B>Sarah: What makes ecological projects a priority for a country like
El Salvador, which has so many other pressing problems?<BR>
<BR>
Ricardo: </B>When we talk about solving ecological problems, we are not
talking about preserving the beauty of the landscape or saving the little
koala bear or a bird that is in danger of extinction. These are important
problems, but in El Salvador our problems are worse than that.<BR>
<BR>
The government's statistics at the childrens' hospital will tell you that
the leading causes of death are infectious respiratory diseases, which are
a product of air pollution. That means that breathing is dangerous for a
small child! And the same thing goes for drinking water and food.<BR>
<BR>
So when we talk about ecological problems, we are talking about issues of
life and death. Ecological problems in El Salvador are therefore social
problems, and very soon they are going to be political problems. <BR>
<BR>
We have a lot of air pollution. But who generates it? The people who have
cars and who buy the goods produced in the industries that generate pollution.
<BR>
<BR>
In our free-enterprise economy, the benefits are privatized but the costs
of pollution are socialized! <BR>
<BR>
Besides creating pollution, the overuse of resources by some people leaves
other people without them. Poverty is very predatory. When a poor person
sees a turtle laying 100 eggs, he knows that with 100 eggs he can have money
to buy food for a week for the family. So he takes them.<BR>
<BR>
If we want to re-establish the equilibrium of nature, we need to get rid
of extreme poverty and extreme wealth. The more poor people we have, the
worse it is for the environment. And the more wealth we have concentrated
in very few hands, the worse it is. So that gets ecologists into things
like the distribution of wealth, and of course that means we must deal with
politics. <B><BR>
<BR>
Sarah: How do you relate this principle to the relationship of El Salvador
and the rest of the world?<BR>
<BR>
Ricardo: </B>Look at global warming, which is a product of consumption of
fuel. That fuel is not consumed uniformly by everyone in the world; countries
in the North consume much more fuel than countries in the South. <BR>
<BR>
As a result, they are generating an ecological debt to the whole world.
El Salvador has an <I>economic</I> debt with the North, but the countries
of the North have an <I>ecological</I> debt with the whole world, including
our country. I'm sure the ecological debt is 10 times bigger than the economic
debt, if we can even assign a price to life. In economic terms we are talking
about material things, but in ecological terms we are talking about the
death of the planet.<B><BR>
<BR>
Sarah: What steps should we take to re-establish the equilibrium?<BR>
<BR>
Ricardo: </B>The first step is to change our consciousness. In El Salvador,
we have said many times that the ecological problem starts in our minds.
We have to change our values. <BR>
<BR>
We are told if you have a little car, you are not as important as if you
have a big car. What if this was turned around? Then people who have small
cars would be seen as better than people who have big cars. <BR>
<BR>
Society tricks you. To make you comfortable, they sell you a car. But because
you don't get the exercise you need, they sell you a stationary bicycle
to do the exercise. Can you believe it? It would be much easier and cheaper
if they sold you the bicycle in the first place!<BR>
<BR>
I think we need a major campaign to try to make people understand the value
of living without destroying the environment. That means to live simply.
<BR>
<BR>
We also have to look for specific solutions to problems. We have to make
architecture more ecologically sound. We have to promote the use of bicycles
everywhere. We have to make sure we use as much solar and wind energy as
we can. We have to reuse and recycle. We should try to produce and eat food
that is highly nutritious and not polluted with pesticides. <B><BR>
<BR>
Sarah: Many of the changes you're describing are needed in the North, but
are similar changes needed in the South as well?<BR>
<BR>
Ricardo: </B>Yes. In the North in particular, because the North has the
power. But<B> </B>the North and the South have the same values. Why do people
in El Salvador not have as many Cadillacs as people in the United States?
Because they don't have the money or the resources to get them, not because
they don't like them! So I think the education has to be worldwide - for
the North not to destroy so many resources, and for the South not to aspire
to be like the North.<B><BR>
<BR>
Sarah: How can people in the North support your work?<BR>
<BR>
Ricardo: </B>If you could make lifestyle changes in the United States, that
would be helpful for everyone else in the world - especially in the Third
World. The United States can continue to live on the resources of the world,
but it is not sustainable. It will be a matter of a couple of decades before
something serious happens. We have destroyed a lot of resources, but I think
there is still time to recover. <BR>
<BR>
You can also influence the foreign policy of your country. We witnessed
during the Reagan years how something like $6 billion was given to the government
of El Salvador to kill people. What was the result of all that? Seventy-five
thousand people died and there was a lot of destruction.<BR>
<BR>
Support could be given to the appropriate technology movement through transfers
of technology. In El Salvador, we have had people from Switzerland working
on bicycles, people from Denmark working on garbage, and people from the
United States working on women's issues and organic gardening.<B><BR>
<BR>
Sarah: Looking ahead 10 or 20 years, where do you see us headed?<BR>
<BR>
Ricardo: </B>It is very difficult to feel optimistic about the way things
are going. We have to make major changes in the world. <BR>
<BR>
It is very important that we restructure our economic system in order to
achieve environmental equilibrium. Instead of developing the world according
to economic criteria, we should develop it according to ecological criteria
- because ecology follows the logic of nature, and economics follows the
logic of money. <BR>
<BR>
There's a story we often tell people in El Salvador who are very rich. We
tell them that if we are all on a jumbo jet that crashes, it won't matter
much if somebody is going first class. There may be one second difference
between the people who die first and the rest. In planetary terms, it may
be 10 to 50 years. But the problem is not going to go away. <BR>

</H2>
<BR>
Founded in 1980, the Salvadoran Center for Appropriate Technology is a non-governmental
organization that gets financial support from private foundations (many
of which are European), the InterAmerican Foundation (a US-based, quasi-governmental
agency), and from selling bicycles and other products.<BR>
<BR>
CESTA's work in promoting sustainable technologies and projects falls within
four program areas:
<UL>
<LI><I>Ecobici</I>, which teaches people how to make and use human-powered
machines such as bicycle carts to collect garbage, pedal-driven corn grinders,
air compressors, and water pumps. The center also makes wheelchairs for
the poor.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><I>Ecomuna</I>, which facilitates ecological and social community-based
solutions, such as replanting forests, growing medicinal plants, composting
garbage and human waste, and enhancing nutrition by promoting the use of
soy products with local staple foods.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><I>Econciencia, </I>which seeks to raise ecological consciousness through
a multimedia campaign, and through seminars with university professors,
union leaders, politicians, church leaders, students, and others. Topics
discussed at the gatherings have included women and the environment, and
children and the environment.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><I>Garbage, </I>which conducts environmental research, and helps cities
and industries solve waste problems.
</UL>
<BR>
As the center's president, Ricardo Navarro travels in North America and
Europe to raise awareness about the organization. He is planning an international
network to support sustainable development in Latin America.<I><BR>

In an effort to strike a balance between the resource use of the North and
the South - and in the process help ensure a sustainable future - the Dutch
chapter of Friends of the Earth has proposed quantifying the amount of resources
that each of the planet's citizens can sustainably consume. Soon, FOE's
US chapter will release per-person consumption targets for Americans. This
excerpt is from &quot;Sustainable Netherlands,&quot; an FOE Action Plan.</I><BR>
<BR>
The northern environmental movement, by focusing only on protecting the
environment, actually prolongs the ecological predicament. We must go beyond
dwelling on protection to address the underlying reality that the main obstacle
to sustainability is overproduction and overconsumption in wealthy countries.<BR>
<BR>
How can social movements in the North develop strategies that lead to changing
production and consumption patterns and also offer Northern<B> </B>consumers
the prospect of high-quality lifestyles? <BR>
<BR>
Working towards this goal, Friends of the Earth Netherlands launched an
Action Plan for a Sustainable Netherlands to demonstrate that, even after
adopting consumption behaviors that allow equitable distribution of the
world's natural resources, northern consumers will still enjoy an acceptable
quality of life. <BR>
<BR>
The Action Plan quantifies the consequences of sustainability based on a
concept of <I>environmental space</I>: the overall quantity of environmental
resources available to the world at large on a sustainable basis. In other
words, the rates at which the planet's energy, fresh water, land, fisheries,
forestry, pollution rights, and waste disposal, and other resources can
be used without decreasing their availability to future generations. <BR>
<BR>
Based on the premise that every world citizen has a right to an equitable
portion of the Earth's available environmental space, FOE calculated the
per person share for the Netherlands in the year 2010, when the world population
is expected to reach 7 billion. Here are some of the results:
<UL>
<LI>The CO2 space per person from fossil fuel use in the Netherlands needs
to be reduced from the current 12 tons per year to 4 tons by 2010, and down
to 1.7 tons by 2030.<BR>
<BR>
<LI>The fresh water space (calculated regionally, not by worldwide availability)
for the Netherlands will have to be reduced by at least 40 percent, or from
130 liters per person per day to 80 liters.<BR>
<BR>
<LI>Per person cropland use will have to be reduced from 0.45 hectares to
0.25 hectares, 0.19 of which is needed for a basic food package. This will
leave 0.06 hectares for non-food production, such as cotton, and luxury
products such as coffee, beer, and wine.<BR>
<BR>
<LI>World per capita rangeland use for production of meat and dairy products
will have been reduced from 0.61 hectares to 0.44 hectares due to overgrazing.
The remaining lands might provide a sustainable meat supply of about 60
grams per person per day, compared to the current average of 190 grams.<BR>
<BR>
<LI>Timber usage must be reduced by 60 percent for the Netherlands, from
1.1 cubic-meters to 0.4 cubic-meters per person, including wood used for
paper.<BR>
<BR>
<LI>No harmful substances such as organic chlorine will be allowed, and
the use of finite resources will be severely limited - in the case of aluminum,
to 2 kilos per year compared to today's 12 kilos.
</UL>
<BR>
It will not be easy for the Dutch public, or others accustomed to unrestrained
consumption, to accept these limits. It is important to note, however, that
there is a difference between per capita environmental space and per capita
consumption. To the extent that production and consumption are organized
to get the greatest use of every unit of available environmental resources
extracted for human use, comfortable levels of consumption are possible
without consequential environ-mental damage.<BR>
<BR>
The first rule is that nothing must be discarded. Everything must be reusable,
recyclable, or repairable. Take paper consumption as an example. Currently,
37 percent of the paper used in the Netherlands is recycled. By increasing
recycling to 75 percent and increasing the efficiency of paper production,
a reduction of 75 percent can be achieved in environmental space used with
no reduction in actual paper use. <BR>
<BR>
Likewise, radios, televisions, washing machines, and other electrically
driven appliances can be designed to be more durable and energy efficient
without use of harmful materials, and to facilitate complete recycling of
their material content at the end of their useful service life.<BR>
<BR>
Armed with this hopeful scenario for a sustainable adjustment of northern
economies, the environmental movement must set out to mobilize the citizens
of industrial society for necessary action. We first must recognize that
attempting to make the policies of the IMF, the World Bank, and GATT environmentally
friendly cannot address the root causes of environmental threats. <BR>
<BR>
These institutions first must abandon the growth-model myth to which they
are committed and acknowledge the necessity of redistributing environmental
space. Under this alternative, southern countries would export less, reducing
pressure on natural resources and giving more access to these resources
to their own poor. Production for the basic needs of all people then would
take precedence over luxury-item production.<BR>
<BR>
The key to developing such perspectives lies in the North, and this is the
task to which northern environmental activists must devote themselves. Activists
from the South and from Eastern Europe must constantly challenge them to
do so.<BR>

<H3><CENTER>The environmental crises brought on by our microscopic ancestors
nearly destroyed them - but they found a way out, and we can, too</CENTER>

<H1><CENTER>The Evolution of Governance</CENTER>
</H1>
<H4><CENTER><I>by <A HREF="http://www.ratical.com/LifeWeb/">Elisabet Sahtouris</A></I></CENTER>
</H4>
<I><BR>
What sort of governance makes sense in a complex global society? To consider
that, we go back into deep time, before humans, before dinosaurs or insects,
to a time when our microbial ancestors faced a global environmental crises
of their own making. <BR>
<BR>
Telling the story is Elisabet Sahtouris, Ph.D, an American/Greek evolutionary
biologist, ecologist, futurist, consultant, and author of GAIA: The Human
Journey from Chaos to Cosmos. She is a founding member of WISNet, the Worldwide
Indigenous Science Network, a member of the Earth Parliament and of the
Women's International Policy Action Committee on Environment and Development,
among others. </I><BR>
<BR>
In studying the Earth's evolution, the most fascinating story I know is
that of ancient beings who created an incredibly complex lifestyle, rife
with technological successes such as electric motors, nuclear energy, DNA
recombination and worldwide information systems. They also produced - and
solved - devastating environmental and social crises and provided a wealth
of lessons we would do well to consider.<BR>
<BR>
This was not a Von Daniken scenario; the beings were not from outer space.
They were our own minute but prolific forebears: ancient bacteria. In one
of his popular science essays, Lewis Thomas, observing that the myriad of
mitochondria in each of our own cells are descendants of these bacteria,
suggested that we may be huge taxis they invented to get around in safely.<BR>
<BR>
From whatever perspective we choose to define our relationship with them,
it is clear we have now created the same crises they did some two billion
years ago. Further, we are struggling to find the very solutions they arrived
at - solutions that made our own evolution possible and that could now improve
the prospects of our own far distant progeny, not to mention our more immediate
future.<BR>
<BR>
I owe my understanding of this remarkable tale to microbiologist Lynn Margulis,
whose painstaking scientific sleuthing traced real events of a few billion
years ago (see <I>IC</I> #34, page 18). The bacteria's remarkable technologies
(all of which still exist among today's free-living bacteria) include the
electric motor drive, which functioned by the attachment of a flagellum
to a disk rotating in a magnetic field; the stockpiling of uranium in their
colonies, perhaps to keep warm; and their worldwide communications and information
system, based on the ability to exchange (recombine) DNA with each other.
<BR>
<BR>
Yet, like ourselves, with our own versions of such wondrous technologies,
the ancient bacteria got themselves deeper and deeper into crisis by pursuing
win/lose economics based on the reckless exploitation of nature and each
other.<BR>
<BR>
The amazing and inspirational part of the story is that entirely without
benefit of brains, these nigh invisible yet highly inventive little creatures
reorganized their destructively competitive lifestyle into one of creative
cooperation.<BR>
<BR>
Their crisis came about when food supplies were exhausted and relatively
hi-tech respiring bacteria (&quot;breathers&quot; with electric motor drives)
invaded larger more passive fermenting bacteria (&quot;bubblers&quot;) to
eat their insides out - a process I have called bacterial colonialism or
imperialism. The invaders multiplied within these colonies until their resources
were exhausted and all parties died. No doubt this happened countless times
before they learned cooperation.<BR>
<BR>
Somewhere along the line, the bloated bags of bacteria also included photosynthesizers,
&quot;bluegreens,&quot; which could replenish food supplies if the motoring
breathers would push the enterprise up toward a lighter part of the primeval
sea. Perhaps it was this lifesaving use of solar energy that initiated the
shift to cooperation.<BR>
<BR>
In any case, bubblers, bluegreens, and breathers eventually contributed
their unique capabilities to the common task of building a workable society.
In time, each donated some of their &quot;personal&quot; DNA to the central
resource library and information hub that became the nucleus of their collective
enterprise: the huge (by bacterial standards) nucleated cells of which our
own bodies and those of all Earth beings other than bacteria are composed.<BR>
<BR>
This process of uniting disparate and competitive entities into a cooperative
whole was repeated when nucleated cells aggregated into multi-celled creatures.
Once these biological &quot;governments&quot; evolved, they continued to
function beautifully. What nature's healthy bodies and ecosystems exemplify
are beautifully unified democracies of diversity, organized by locally productive
and mutually cooperative &quot;bioregions,&quot; and coordinated by a centralized
service government. The underlying and overriding motive is toward healthy
production and consumption for all. <BR>
<BR>
We humans, like the bacteria of old, have produced a major crisis. But humanity,
like other living systems, is resilient and creative under stress. And we
have the further advantage that we can see how other living systems have
evolved and survived, and gain clues as to what we are doing dysfunctionally
and what could set us on a path of viability.<BR>
<BR>
To watch the world through the broad lens of an evolutionary biologist is
to see signs of hope in many directions. Everywhere I look, people are &quot;getting&quot;
the principles of living systems - they are recognizing that we cannot separate
science, politics, economics, religion, art and education any longer.<BR>
<BR>
At the Earth Summit in Rio last year, I told the tale of the ancient bacteria
to my fellow &quot;Wisdom Keepers,&quot; a group organized by Hanne Strong.
I added that I'd long wondered exactly how the ancient bacteria did it,
and that I was now extremely privileged to see the same process first hand,
as witness and as participant.<BR>
<BR>
However poorly reported in our media, most participants I spoke with felt
the gathering was a critical event in the reorganization of humanity from
a competitive, win/lose lifestyle to a worldwide, cooperative venture. Clearly,
those involved in the people's summits, not the official proceedings, were
leading the way.<BR>
<BR>
The image of humanity reorganizing itself from a chaotic mass to a new order
was especially vivid from the sound stage of the huge concert held on Flamengo
Beach under a brilliant eclipsing moon on our final night in Rio. <BR>
<BR>
Looking out over the vast crowd on the beach, I watched circles form spontaneously
in dance, then dissolve as others formed. Lines of people appeared and wove
their way through the mass; great roars of approval greeted every proposal
for a better world that was broadcast from the nuclear sound stage. <BR>
<BR>
A giant cell was forming itself symbolically on that sandy beach, human
protoplasm in motion, making order out of chaos beneath the ever-changing
watchful eye of the eclipsing full moon. Beams of laser light patterned
their way from nucleus to the boundaries of the great cell lying between
the glittering sea and the dark trees of Flamengo Park, lighting the participants
in rich patterns of color and sound.<BR>
<BR>
Families in the audience trustingly gave us their children to take up on
the stage, where they sang songs quickly learned. As they sang back to their
people, I thought of the sharing of DNA by the ancient bacteria - each giving
a little of theirs to form the new nucleus. It was a crucible of joyous
sharing, a celebration heralding the formation of a network spawned and
realized during the preceding two weeks and continuing around the world
even now.<BR>
<BR>
By sharing our grassroots experience, by establishing every possible means
of communications around the planet, and by making plans to link and expand
Earth restoration projects and alternative economies, we took matters into
our own hands. <BR>
<BR>
Like our bacterial ancestors, we were learning to use the technologies invented
during our nearly disastrous competitive phase to implement the shift to
cooperation. If we understand the evolutionary pressure on us now to complete
the organization of this new &quot;body of humanity,&quot; we can work at
the task consciously and rapidly. <BR>

<H1><CENTER>What Works and Why</CENTER>
</H1>
<H3><CENTER></CENTER>
</H3>
<P><CENTER></CENTER>
<H4><CENTER><I>by Harlan Cleveland</I></CENTER>
</H4>
<I><BR>
Harlan Cleveland has built his long political and academic career around
the study of national and global trends and solutions; he's a former US
ambassador to NATO, assistant US secretary of state, and foreign aid manager
under the Marshall Plan. <BR>
<BR>
In his latest book</I>, Birth of a New World,<I> published by Jossey-Bass
this year, Cleveland draws from his experiences and looks at what he calls
an &quot;open moment&quot; in history, a time to re-examine the political
and economic structures that have shaped our current global crises. <BR>
<BR>
These examples, which were excerpted, with permission of the author and
publisher, from </I>Birth of a New World <I>show that there's every reason
to believe that international cooperation is possible. After all, when governments
have put their minds to it, they've shown that they can make all kinds of
progress through cooperation!</I><BR>
<BR>
The first thing that comes to mind when you think of world affairs may not
be love, or even tolerance, humanity, and cooperation. Most of the news
about international cooperation is its absence: distrust, suspicion, controversy,
conflict, terrorism, war. <BR>
<BR>
Collaborative success, what's actually <I>working</I>, is seldom highlighted.
Yet if you stand back and look at the whole scene, you see all kinds of
international systems and arrangements that are working more or less the
way they are supposed to work:
<UL>
<LI>Eradication of infectious diseases. Diseases such as smallpox and diphtheria
have been wiped out, and malaria and others have been tackled by combining
medical science with a massive worldwide public health information system.
Coordinated through the World Health Organization, the system requires the
continuous cooperation of almost every nation on earth. Next on this never-ending
agenda: AIDS.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><I>The Law of the Sea. </I>By an extraordinary act of consensus, the
world's nations spent 15 years rewriting ocean law in a book-length treaty,
the most complex single document ever negotiated among nations. The UN General
Assembly declared the deep ocean and its seabed to be &quot;the common heritage
of mankind.&quot; By unanimous consent, the world's governments also provided
for stronger environmental protection and for military and scientific use
of the open ocean and the important narrow places in the world's seas.<BR>
<BR>
Despite the absence of a US signature (because of its disagreement with
regulations on the use of the seabed) the White House later declared that
all the rest of the long treaty text had become &quot;customary law.&quot;<BR>
<I><BR>
<LI>The Ozone Treaty. </I>In 1974 two chemists first guessed that human
activities might be eroding the ozone shield that protects humanity from
receiving too much ultraviolet radiation from the sun. In 1987, only 13
years later, 50 nations agreed by treaty to slow down the use of ozone eaters,
such as CFCs, by setting emission targets but leaving to the market the
task of reducing CFCs. For reasons of fairness, those targets were tougher
on the richer countries than on the poorer ones and were left open for future
revision in a flexible and dynamic process.<BR>
<BR>
The issues, says US diplomat Richard Benedick, were &quot;staggeringly complex,&quot;
the science still speculative, the evidence of damage missing. Yet this
remarkable achievement was possible because there was an international scientific
consensus, information on the subject flowed freely, the fact-finding process
pulled in the nongovernments (notably the industries using CFCs), and an
active international gadfly - the UN Environment Program (UNEP) - helped
push governments to set aside their conflicts on other matters and cooperate
on this one. <BR>
<I><BR>
<LI>The Antarctic Treaty. </I>Twelve countries agreed in 1959 to suspend
their pie-shaped national claims to parts of Antarctica and open up the
entire continent for scientific research, including the core sampling of
ancient ice to help meteorologists and astronauts. The countries also banned
all military activity, nuclear tests, and disposal of nuclear wastes in
this frozen no-man's-land.<BR>
<BR>
The treaty process is unusual in that there is no international staff; all
the political and administrative business is conducted at periodic meetings
hosted by the member countries in turn. When the treaty was reviewed in
1991, all signers stayed hitched and even added a 50-year ban on digging
for minerals.<BR>
<I><BR>
<LI>UN peacekeeping and peacemaking. </I>&quot;Soldiers without enemies&quot;
have been stationed in many contentious corners of the world. And UN observers
and mediators - at times the secretary general himself or his personal representative
- have been active in dampening conflict and sometimes settling disputes
all around the world. (See also &quot;UN Peacekeeping: Promise and Peril&quot;
on page 50.)<BR>
<I><BR>
<LI>The High Commissioner for Refugees. </I>The General Assembly<I> </I>set
up this office as a way of recognizing a universal responsibility toward
refugees and displaced persons for whom new homes had still to be found
after World War II. Today, with a very different ethnic mix of peoples,
there are more international refugees than there were forty years ago -
more than twice as many if people displaced inside their own countries are
counted. The UNHCR has stimulated actions that have saved many millions
of people from international homelessness and many from disease and death.
The High Commissioner's office twice has won the Nobel Peace Prize.<BR>
<I><BR>
<LI>International civil aviation. </I>Planes of all nations use each other's
air space, control towers, and airfields with astonishingly few mishaps.
There is even an agreement that all communication between planes and controllers
will be in a common language: English.<BR>
<I><BR>
<LI>Allocation of the frequency spectrum. </I>The International Telecommunications
Union periodically assembles an all-nations gathering called &quot;Administrative
Radio Conference&quot; to divide up the electromagnetic frequency spectrum
among all users and purposes. This international public regulation makes
possible an international market in radio and TV reception, satellite, phone,
and fax connections. It also makes space probes and modern military communication
possible.<BR>
<I><BR>
<LI>Weather forecasting. </I>Beginning with a 1963 initiative of the Kennedy
Administration, the World Meteorological Organization developed the World
Weather Watch, which put to work picture-taking, communication, and remote-sensing
satellites.<BR>
<BR>
A world weather system now merges observations every day from more than
100 countries, ships at sea, and balloons, with cloud pictures and wind
and moisture data from satellites.<BR>
<I><BR>
<LI>Globally oriented technology and communications. </I>New systems of
measurement, modeling, and mathematics have generated an &quot;ecumenical
movement&quot; among the earth sciences, enabling experts to think seriously
and systematically about very large environmental issues in the framework
of a global commons.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><I>Cooperation in outer space. </I>A generation ago, the United Nations
declared outer space and &quot;celestial bodies&quot; including the Moon
&quot;the common province of mankind.&quot; There followed formal treaties
on issues such as damage to the Earth, and returning errant astronauts and
cosmonauts to their home countries.<BR>
<BR>
As space began to fill up, other kinds of international cooperation seemed
necessary: banning bombs in orbit, keeping track of launches (which the
United Nations does), and crop forecasting. A 1978 French proposal to provide
the UN secretary general with the capacity to observe military movements
by satellite could turn out to be practical politics in the 1990s. 
</UL>
<H4>MAKING IT WORK</H4>
Why does international cooperation work - when it does? These characteristics,
when taken together, are the priceless ingredients for advances in global
cooperation:
<UL>
<LI><I>There is a consensus on desired outcomes.</I> People who disagree
on almost everything else can agree, for example, that smallpox is a threat
to all, more accurate weather forecasts would be useful, civil aircraft
should not collide, and somebody should help refugees.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><I>No one loses.</I> Each success story turned out to be a win-win game.
For instance, we did not begin to see real progress on disarmament until
both the Soviet Union and NATO concluded that their security would actually
be enhanced by eliminating dangerous but unusable weapons.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><I>Sovereignty is pooled.</I> Cooperation does not mean giving up independence
of action but pooling it - that is, using sovereign rights together to avoid
losing them separately.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><I>Cooperation is stimulated by &quot;a cocktail of fear and hope.&quot;</I>
Alone, fear produces irrational - sometimes aggressive - behavior, and hope
produces good-hearted but unrealistic advocacy. Combined, reality-based
fear and hope seem to provide the motivation to cooperate. <BR>
<BR>
<LI><I>Individuals make things happen. </I>In the early stages of each success
story, a few key individuals acted internationally to lead, insist, inspire,
share knowledge, and generate a climate of trust that brushed past the prevailing
distrust. On the World Weather Watch these were mostly scientific statesmen;
on smallpox eradication, public health doctors; on the Law of the Sea, visionary
lawyers including key players from the developing world.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><I>Modern information technologies are of the essence. </I>The marriage
of computers and electronic telecommunications is driving the world toward
larger systems of cooperation.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><I>Nongovernments play a key role.</I> The recent story of international
cooperation is replete with the contributions of scientific academies, research
institutes, women's groups, international companies, and &quot;experts&quot;
who don't feel the need to act as instructed representatives of their governments.
<BR>
<BR>
<LI><I>Educated local talent is essential.</I> Especially where developing
countries have major global roles to play, cooperation works best when they
develop and use their own experts and systems managers. <BR>
<BR>
<LI><I>Flexible, uncentralized systems work best.</I> The more complicated
the task and the more diverse the players, the more necessary it is to spread
the work around so many kinds of people are improvising on an agreed sense
of direction. 
</UL>
<BR>
A sensible system of peaceful change for more people than ever before in
world history is a feasible goal. Some steps in its direction already have
been taken - piecemeal, the practical way. The guiding principles have made
themselves apparent. The puzzle, complex but not insoluble, is how to move
- no doubt untidily, in a zigzag course - toward carrying into action what
the past half-century has taught us by trial and error. <BR>

<P><BR>
<I>When the term &quot;global governance&quot; is used, many people picture
centralized, top-down bureaucracies. But global governance can also come
from the grassroots. For example, every time a member of Amnesty International
writes to a foreign head-of-state demanding the release of a political prisoner,
or any time environmentalists meet across national borders to exchange scientific
information and discuss strategies, a form of global governance has occurred.<BR>
<BR>
Hazel Henderson, an international development policy analyst, has organized
many citizen groups worldwide. Her latest book is &quot;Paradigms in Progress;&quot;
her quality-of-life &quot;Country Futures Indicators&quot; will debut in
1994. Hazel held the Horace Albright Chair at the University of California
at Berkeley. She can be contacted at PO Box 5190, St. Augustine, FL 32085

This article is adapted from &quot;Social Innovation and Citizen Movements,&quot;
which appeared in Futures, Vol 25, No 3, April 1993, pp 322-339, and is

author.<BR>
</I><BR>
The blossoming of citizen-based organizations as one of the most striking
phenomena of the 20th century has been described by Elise Boulding as 'a
major shift in the nature of the international system.'1<BR>
<BR>
Citizen movements and people's associations cover the whole range of human
concerns - from service clubs, churches, self-help, and spiritual groups
to chambers of commerce and professional associations of teachers, doctors,
farmers, scientists, musicians, and artists - all sharing some concern for
human society that crosses national borders. <BR>
<BR>
Citizen movements, now global as well as national and local, are key drivers
in changing societies. They constitute an evolving form of democratic governance,
sometimes rivaling the influence of heads of state, generals, scientists,
inventors, and multinational corporate executives. <BR>
<BR>
The power that citizen movements wield is informal, unpredictable, and often
unnoticed by elites until it emerges as a critical mass. Such movements
generally constitute 'social early warning systems' signaling dysfunction.
Their role in social innovation stems from their ability to provide corrective
feedback and creative approaches to social evolution. <BR>
<BR>
These networks of citizens groups are often freer to act and respond to
humanitarian concerns than nation-states. They often serve as precursors
to new national and international government systems. The United Nations
recognizes these proliferating non-state actors as 'non-governmental organizations'
(NGOs) or international non-governmental organizations (INGOs).<BR>
<BR>
The structure and philosophy of NGOs make them ideally suited to solve problems
that prevailing institutions either ignore or find intractable: </P>

<UL>
  <LI>NGOs can question conventional wisdom and relentlessly point out cases
  where the 'emperor has no clothes.' <BR>
  <BR>
  </LI>
  <LI>Because they can tap and organize information laterally - across borders,
  as well as corporate and government boundaries - they rapidly synthesize
  overlooked and new information into new approaches and paradigms. 2 <BR>
  <BR>
  </LI>
  <LI>NGOs and INGOs serve as nodes and 'magnets' that attract previously
  censored information, as well as that from 'whistle blowers' in business
  and government. <BR>
  <BR>
  </LI>
  <LI>At all levels, from local to global, citizens' organizations arise
  around the <I>social and environmental impacts </I>of existing policies
  and industrial technologies - from air and water pollution, toxic chemicals,
  nuclear wastes, and distorted energy-intensive development policies to
  coercive family planning programs and foreign assistance that reinforces
  social, economic, and gender inequalities.3 <BR>
  <BR>
  </LI>
  <LI>Although such groups often organize around problem-identification,
  they quickly move to more positive and prescriptive agendas - often forced
  to innovate because existing institutions cannot respond to their proposals.
  For example, the Kenya-based Greenbelt Movement and India's Chipko Movement
  were busy planting trees long before scientists studying climate change
  began advocating reforestation.<BR>
  <BR>
  </LI>
  <LI>Independent groups often represent a priceless social resource that
  offers new paradigms to societies trapped in wasteful consumption and production
  habits, and obsolete technologies that are proving unsustainable. For example,
  the coalescing of INGOs with indigenous peoples has brought forth new agendas
  based on ancient wisdom and spiritual traditions about how to live sustainably.
  4<BR>
  <BR>
  </LI>
  <LI>Citizen organizations have emerged worldwide as major actors in leading
  the search for global ethics. They have staged 'citizen summits' on vital
  issues wherever leaders have dragged their heels - such as The Other Economic
  Summit (TOES), which has dogged the G-7 nations' annual summit meetings
  since 1984 with alternative approaches. And, through their work, citizens'
  summits and diplomacy activities helped end the Cold War. </LI>
</UL>

<H4>NEW POSSIBILITIES FOR NGOS</H4>

<P>The further growth of global independent sectors will be driven by the
increasing loss of nation-state sovereignty and competence resulting from
the globalizing forces of technology, finance, information, labor markets,
arms trading, pollution, and culture. As NGOs and their proposals are judged
more pragmatically on their merits, we may expect an enormous burst of creativity
and social problem-solving.<BR>
<BR>
To put this landscape into perspective, we would do well to study social
movements and citizen groups even more carefully as old structures and nations
devolve.5<BR>
<BR>
The Cold War era hastened the blossoming of NGOs focusing on peace, human
rights, nuclear test bans, non-proliferation, disarmament, development,
globalizing educational curricula, student-exchange programs, and humanitarian
relief, all of which offered major new forms of expertise to governments.
<BR>
<BR>
By the 1960s, massive citizen movements emerged to respond to such planetary
issues as biosphere degradation, desertification, species extinction, and
resource depletion. They also addressed unchecked human population growth,
the widening poverty gap between North and South, and extending human rights
and fuller political and economic participation to women.<BR>
<BR>
The UN became a natural venue for these new national and transnational concerns.
Citizens' organizations emerged, such as the National Organization for Women,
Friends of the Earth, and Zero Population Growth in the US. They joined
older NGOs, such as Planned Parenthood and the Swiss-based International
Union for the Conservation of Nature, to push new issues onto their national
governments' agendas.<BR>
<BR>
Such pressure on UN member-states, from NGOs in both the North and South,
resulted in a series of <I>ad hoc </I>UN conferences, notably on environment
(1972), population (1973), food (1974), women (1975), habitat (1978), and
new and renewable energy sources (1982). At each of these UN conferences,
it became successively more recognized that their agendas had been shaped
by NGOs, new citizens' organizations, and broader social movements bringing
pressure on member-states' governments.<BR>
<BR>
In early conferences - such as that on the environment, held in Stockholm,
Sweden in 1972 - these citizens' organizations were grudgingly recognized;
they organized their own parallel Environmental Forum a half-hour bus ride
away from the press and the main conference held in the city center. While
often ill-informed government delegates droned on in the main conference
(the US delegation was headed by former child movie star, Shirley Temple
Black) the people's Forum hosted brilliant debates by many of the world's
leading intellectuals from North and South, including representatives from
indigenous peoples from all over the world. The air was charged with excitement
as NGOs hammered out their own declarations of principles and drafted treaties
and protocols for protecting the Earth; changing the course of economic
development towards new values, ecological sustainability and poverty reduction;
and recognizing the key role of women as the world's primary food producers,
educators of children, and protectors of the environment.<BR>
<BR>
Indeed, many of the policies and social innovations proposed by NGOs at
the Stockholm Environmental Forum - from environmental auditing of corporations,
socially responsible investing, and 'green' taxes to subsidize R&amp;D in
renewable resource and energy-efficiency technologies - are now government
policies in scores of countries. Government and corporate elites often are
the last to hear of such viable policy alternatives, as they are insulated
within top-down hierarchies from such inconvenient information. <BR>
<BR>
The greatest outpouring of interest in these paradigm-shifting debates and
the world's independent sectors occurred at the United Nations Conference
on Environment and Development, the Earth Summit held in Rio de Janeiro
in June, 1992.6 The Rio Conference boosted the growth of these citizens'
organizations by providing a global forum for some 13,000 such groups and
reinforced their networking activities.<BR>
<BR>
Many of the citizens' organizations attending Rio's Global Forum were already
sophisticated and linked on computer-conferencing systems, such as PeaceNet
and EcoNet. Today, these electronically linked citizens' groups are becoming
a truly global independent sector, a third way for global problem solving
and in Boulding's phrase, 'a global civic culture.' 7 s<BR>

<I><BR>
With the Cold War now behind us, how can we make and keep the peace? With
regional conflicts taking the place of superpower tensions, how must our
efforts change to meet new challenges? Are there lessons and examples from
which we can build and learn?<BR>
<BR>
Providing some answers is Michael Renner, a senior researcher at the <A HREF="http://www.worldwatch.org/">Worldwatch
Institute</A>, where he studies and writes about the link between environmental
and peace issues. This article was adapted, with permission, from Worldwatch
Paper #114, &quot;Critical Juncture: The Future of Peacekeeping,&quot; published
in May 1993.</I><BR>
<BR>
In the three years since the formal end of the Cold War, the world has been
rocked by a series of events as unexpectedly momentous as the East-West
conflict itself: the 1991 Gulf War, the collapse of Somalia, the brutalization
of Bosnia, and many others. The international community is faced with a
wave of new conflicts even as it inherits from the previous era such formidable
challenges as slashing the accumulated stocks of weapons and preventing
the further spread of weapons of mass destruction.<BR>
<BR>
Seen individually, these events pose some perplexing regional problems.
Taken together, however, they amount to nothing less than an epochal watershed:
a time that future historians may describe as the moment when humanity seized
- or failed to seize - the opportunity to replace obsolescent mechanisms
for resolving human conflict.<BR>
<BR>
The traditional rule for regulating conflict and providing security was
expressed by the ancient Roman maxim, <I>si vis pacem, para bellum:</I>
If you want peace, prepare for war. This has been a guiding principle of
nations for some 2,000 years, and it has rarely been questioned. The vast
bulk of all preparation for war during these 20 centuries has been concentrated
in <I>this </I>century. By the ancient logic then, the 20th century should
also have produced the most stable peace. <BR>
<BR>
Yet, the result has been the opposite: devising ever more ingenious weapons,
governments have acquired an unprecedented ability to destroy but little
capacity to defend. The 20th century has produced 75 percent of all war
deaths inflicted since the rise of Rome.<BR>
<BR>
A new principle of conflict resolution is therefore warranted: If you want
peace, prepare for peace. Unless the world consciously replaces the ancient
doctrine with a new and more effective kind of <I>collective </I>security,
the post-Cold War conflicts may take on a dangerous momentum of their own.<BR>
<BR>
Indeed, the international community already is edging toward a greater reliance
on the promise of &quot;collective security,&quot; in recognition of the
fact that in a world of increasingly interconnected economies and communications,
fortress-based forms of security are becoming more and more anachronistic.
<BR>
<BR>
But the contours of a collective security system are emerging less by design
than by ad hoc responses to crises around the globe. The United Nations'
moves toward an alternative security system have been tentative, inconsistent,
and often lacking in teeth. And the UN's efforts have been undermined by
lack of agreement on what its powers should be, underfunded by a refusal
of key members to pay all their dues, and overwhelmed by demands for services
it is not fully prepared to render.
<H4>THE POST-COLD WAR WORLD</H4>
Far from gaining a new stability from the breaking up of the Soviet Union,
the world is being torn by contradictory trends toward globalization and
fragmentation and by conflicts left unresolved during the Cold War. 
<UL>
  <LI>On one hand, the world is being pulled together by international trade,
investment, travel, and communications. On the other, it is being rocked
by the reassertion of local identities and - in fearful reaction - by the
rise of xenophobic and exclusivist movements. <BR>
<BR>
  <LI>The Cold War era left enough weapons stocked up around the world to
keep conflicts raging for many years to come. <BR>
<BR>
  <LI>The new era has unleashed a rash of new hostilities, many of which
were previously suppressed or otherwise held in check because that was what
the superpowers considered to be in their interest.<BR>
<BR>
  <LI>Many conflicts &quot;internal&quot; to contemporary nations are in
part the legacy of imperial rule. People of the same culture, language and
ethnicity often found themselves separated by international borders, and
grouped with people of other backgrounds and origins, irrespective of whether
they had previously coexisted peacefully, been at odds, or had no significant
contacts at all. <BR>
<BR>
  <LI>Given severe economic underdevelopment and undemocratic, often repressive,
patterns of governance, the competition for resources and power among ethnic
groups and other contenders is intense. Exacerbating these explosive conditions
are the growing pressures of population growth, resource depletion, and
environmental degradation.<BR>
<BR>
  <LI>The widespread availability of arms and the lack of an alternative,
non-violent system for the settlement of conflicts virtually invite recourse
to coercive means. 
</UL>
<BR>
If, in this setting, war is to lose its legitimacy as an acceptable instrument
in the conduct of human affairs, the still feeble norms against the use
of force need to be reinforced, and global institutions that can promote
peaceful conflict resolution need to be bolstered. 
<H4>MAKING COLLECTIVE SECURITY WORK</H4>
Among the key components of an alternative system are a shift from offensive
weapons and strategies to ones that can defend but not attack, and a strengthening
of international peacekeeping and peacemaking capacities. <BR>
<BR>
In the kind of collective security system needed, unlike the ad hoc one
which now exists, priority would be given to enabling observers to identify
potential crises and to preventing disputes from escalating into armed conflicts.
The United Nations would be given a greatly strengthened capacity, where
conflicts do erupt, to deal with them through reconciliation efforts, in
addition to its traditional peacekeeping activities. It would also have
the power to enforce the terms of cease-fire and peace agreements. And,
it would have the capability to help with establishing conditions that prevent
the resumption of violent conflict.<BR>
<BR>
With his June 1992 report to the UN Security Council, <I>An Agenda for Peace,
</I>Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali seized the initiative for strengthening
UN peacekeeping and peacemaking. At the core of his report is a call for
member states to make available, on a standby basis, contingents of their
armed forces for both peacekeeping and cease-fire enforcement purposes.
Boutros-Ghali further emphasizes the importance of preventive diplomacy.
<BR>
<BR>
The report, however, as one commentator gently put it, is &quot;written
with an acute sense of the limits of the possible.&quot; Boutros-Ghali's
ideas make for a good beginning, but they do not provide the framework for
a reform of the magnitude required in the long run.<BR>
<BR>
For example, the UN can make fuller use of conflict resolution techniques.
Throughout the organization's existence, the secretaries-general have offered
their help in personally mediating disputes - as they did in the Afghanistan
and Iran-Iraq wars. These interventions are often high-profile, last-ditch
efforts to avert the outbreak of hostilities, or to halt fighting where
it has already begun. But more routine, low-key efforts could help to defuse
tensions and resolve disputes at an earlier stage, long before violent conflict
is imminent.<BR>
<BR>
If an early warning alert or the conclusions of a fact-finding mission warrant
it, the UN could decide on the preventive deployment of observers or lightly
armed peacekeepers. Monitors could be dispatched to areas where tensions
exist but are still sufficiently far from turning violent, while peacekeepers
could be sent where violence seems more imminent. For instance, the Security
Council recently decided to station a small UN observer force in the former
Yugoslav republic of Macedonia.<BR>
<BR>
It also would be useful to explore the possibilities for vesting greater
authority in the secretary-general (albeit within clearly defined parameters),
because the Council may not always be willing or able to act in a timely
manner. The secretary-general, for instance, could be given the power to
send unarmed observers to any international border at any time, and perhaps
to <I>any </I>area where heightened tensions threaten to explode.<BR>
<BR>
Above and beyond these less-sweeping reforms, a permanent peacekeeping force
under direct UN authority should be created. Unlike an army, such a force
would be neither equipped nor mandated to use force. Its impartiality -
and therefore its acceptability - could be emphasized by directly recruiting,
from a broad variety of countries, individuals whose loyalty to the UN is
not in question, rather than forces drawn from sometimes reluctant governments.<BR>
<BR>
Whether a future UN peace force is permanent or standby, its officers will
need to have at least some knowledge of the history, politics, culture,
and language of the countries and regions they serve in. Even more importantly,
they need skills in negotiation and conflict mediation. Systematic training,
therefore, is critical. 
<H4>WHAT KIND OF FUTURE?</H4>
The Bosnian tragedy, in particular, has led to an impassioned debate about
the pros and cons of intervention. Most Western governments and the leaders
of their militaries have decided that no &quot;strategic&quot; interest
is at stake, and therefore have little appetite for getting drawn into what
they fear may be a quagmire. But a chorus of commentators has argued for
military intervention, denouncing the international community's passivity
toward the horror of mass killings, rapes, and &quot;ethnic cleansing.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
On the other side, however, are those who feel that the use of force does
not solve underlying problems, and instead of constraining violence may
encourage even more of it. The debate is emblematic of the new uncertainties
stirred up by the end of the Cold War. It has deeply divided government
officials, policy analysts, and even the peace movement.<BR>
<BR>
Humanity is faced with an anguishing dilemma. Continued reliance on military
means - even by the UN on behalf of the world community - inevitably re-legitimizes
the use of violence for political ends. Realistically, a &quot;just war&quot;
still kills and maims not only the perpetrators of barbaric acts but innocent
people as well. Yet when the world community stands by, letting innocents
be slaughtered, it in ef-fect endorses political change by violent means
and sets a dangerous precedent.<BR>
<BR>
More than 30 years ago, Adlai Stevenson explained in a speech at the United
Nations: &quot;We do not hold the vision of a world without conflict. We
do hold the vision of a world without war - and this inevitably requires
an alternative system for coping with conflict.&quot; Strengthening the
UN's capability would go a long way toward responding to Stevenson's challenge.<BR>
<BR>
The most sensible solution is to establish a two-tiered UN force. The first
tier would consist of a permanent, directly recruited and specially trained
peacekeeping force that adheres to the principle of nonviolence. The second
tier would be composed of more militarily capable standby units to deter
aggression and to enforce cease-fire agreements, if necessary, by disarming
and demobilizing warring factions. In most cases, the second tier would
function as a backup, mobilized only if peacekeeping units faced severe
challenges to their authority. Where an act of aggression seems imminent,
it could serve as a first recourse. <BR>
<BR>
The question facing the international community now is whether a strengthened
UN peacekeeping system can offer a workable and affordable alternative to
the use of force by national governments and their adversaries. The answer
can be found in the two types of conflict the UN now faces - and that any
successful security system will have to cope with: transborder attacks like
Iraq's 1991 invasion of Kuwait and civil wars like that now raging in the
former Yugoslavia.<BR>
<BR>
In Kuwait, there is good reason to conclude that the conflict would have
taken a different course had the UN's capabilities already been strengthened
as proposed here. Once Iraqi troops began assembling near the border, the
UN could have quickly dispatched a peacekeeping force. In Bosnia, any last
hope of dissuasion by the UN was extinguished when the Security Council
discussed, but did not send, a proposed large peacekeeping force prior to
the outbreak of hostilities.<BR>
<BR>
The international community will need to learn - by trial and error, at
first - how to employ the tools of preventive diplomacy and peacemaking
effectively. The UN's current large-scale efforts in Cambodia, Somalia,
and the former Yugoslavia could turn out to be crucial tests - watershed
events in the long history of human conflict.<BR>
<BR>
The perception that national interests collide with a strengthened United
Nations may still preclude rapid reform. Yet in region after region, the
dangers of reverting to violence as a means of settling differences are
becoming clear. The question is whether the nations of the world are prepared
to transform the United Nations from a peacekeeper of last resort to a peacemaker
of first, and routine, recourse.<BR>
<BR>
That human history is riddled, and even largely defined, by patterns of
violent conflict leads many people to assume that war is part of human nature
and is therefore unavoidable. Yet, at the same time that humans have strived
to perfect technologies of destruction, they have also struggled to define
acceptable behavior during war and - more recently, and haltingly, but with
growing confidence - to establish norms against the use of violence. <BR>
<BR>
Just because war is a social institution does not mean it is inevitable:
created by us, it can also be abolished by us.<BR>

</H2>
The $8.3 billion that the United Nations spent on peacekeeping from 1948
to 1992 is less than three one-hundredths of one percent of the roughly
$30 trillion devoted to traditional military purposes over the same period.
<BR>
<BR>
With operations growing in both number and size, annual UN peacekeeping
outlays have risen from $233 million in 1987 to some $1.4 billion in 1992
- still only about as much as the US Air Force spent that year to purchase
48 F-16 jet fighters.<I><BR>

</H2>
<BR>
Curiously enough, peacekeeping - as presently practiced by the UN &quot;Blue
Helmets&quot; - is an accident of history. Originally, the Security Council
was to have had, on call, a full-strength armed force assembled from national
armies of member states, for &quot;maintaining international peace and security.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
But the Cold War rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union
deadlocked the Security Council over the issue. An improvised alternative
- peacekeeping with no combat capability - arose in its place. &quot;The
vision of the United Nations was downsized from world police to world volunteer
fire brigade,&quot; says Jeff Laurenti of the private United Nations Association
of the United States.<BR>
<BR>
Improvisation turned this weakness into a virtue, however. Instead of enforcing
the will of the Security Council by simply becoming another combatant trying
to outgun any opponent, the UN found that it could succeed by adhering to
nonviolent principles. <BR>
<BR>
This non-aggressive approach was adopted as a general policy, with peacekeeping
troops using their light weapons only in self-defense. Another crucial element
in marshaling support for its efforts has been the UN's reputation for impartiality,
its being an &quot;honest broker.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
In the first four decades of UN peacekeeping, only 14 operations were undertaken.
The past five years, however, have witnessed as many new operations as the
previous four decades - including the three largest ever undertaken, in
Cambodia, Yugoslavia, and Somalia.<BR>
<BR>
For many years, peacekeeping operations focused narrowly on conflict containment
- monitoring borders and buffer zones after cease-fires were signed, as
happened on the Golan Heights between Israel and Syria. But since the late
1980s, missions have become far more complex and ambitious - supervising
the disarming or disbanding of armed factions, establishing protected areas,
monitoring elections and human rights records, and repatriating refugees.
<BR>
<BR>
While the peacekeeping role evolved mainly in response to conflicts between
nations, the UN now finds itself increasingly drawn into mediating internal
conflicts as well. And the traditional distinction between internal and
international affairs is becoming increasingly blurred. Not only are outside
powers often drawn into the conflict because they want to affect the political
outcome, but ever larger streams of refugees threaten to destabilize neighboring
countries, and today's far greater economic interdependence means that the
fighting may have more pronounced effects in other nations.<BR>
<BR>
The rapidly rising demand for the UN's services suggests that on the whole,
UN peacekeeping has been fairly successful. It was the peacekeepers, for
example, who verified the withdrawal of foreign troops from Angola and Namibia;
and who facilitated the peaceful political transition in Nicaragua. Among
the current operations, however, at least a few - in Angola, Cambodia, and
the former Yugoslavia - have encountered protracted difficulties, reflecting
fundamental weaknesses in the peacekeeping forces as now constituted.<BR>
<BR>
Preventing the eruption of disputes into full-scale hostilities is by no
means an easy task, but its difficulties pale beside those of ending them
once large-scale bloodshed has occurred and antipathies have been aroused
and unleashed. Early recognition and defusion of emerging crises is crucial
to resolving conflicts peacefully, but the UN still lacks appropriate tools
and mechanisms.<I><BR>

<H1><CENTER>A Path to Global Disarmament</CENTER>
</H1>
<P><CENTER></CENTER>

<BR>
There was a time in our history when slavery was considered by most people
to be a normal, justifiable institution; those calling for the abolition
of the slave trade were considered a fringe element. After all, slavery
formed the basis of an entrenched economic system and was supported by much
of the day's political, religious, and intellectual establishment. <BR>
<BR>
Today, the people calling for the end of the arms trade could also be thought
of as a small, fringe group with little chance of success. Millions of people
depend on the jobs and profits associated with arms production and trade.
And, armaments are among the largest exports of the US and other permanent
members of the UN Security Council. <BR>
<BR>
Nonetheless, there is an international group of people calling for the end
of the arms trade, and this just might be the time when such a move is possible.
<BR>
<BR>
One of those people is Saul Mendlovitz, director of the World Order Models
Project and Dag Hammerskjold Professor of Peace and World Order Studies
at Rutgers Law School. Saul is heading up an international effort aimed
at making the arms trade as unacceptable as the slave trade is now. And
just as ending the slave trade was a first step to ending the institution
of slavery, Saul believes ending the arms trade could be a key to ending
war. I met Saul at his office in New York City. <BR>
<H4>WHY NOW?</H4>
Disarmament may now be a real possibility because of several inter-related
developments, Saul says. The end of the Cold War has reduced fears of all-out
war among those who had been members of the superpower alliances. The developing
countries, released from their roles as pawns in the superpower game, now
are free to consider for themselves how to achieve real security. <BR>
<BR>
At the same time, unilateral battlefield force is no longer seen as an effective
response to many of the world's conflicts, Saul says. In Yugoslavia, Sudan,
the Middle East, and elsewhere, it's becoming clear that solutions are not
found through massive military confrontations. <BR>
<BR>
These developments mean that there is a new openness among many players
to alternative approaches to security. <BR>
<H4>PHASING OUT WAR</H4>
The idea for an international convention ending the arms trade was sparked
by a resolution proposed by representatives of non-aligned nations and adopted
at the 1991 General Assembly. That resolution calls for a voluntary registry
of arms transfers. <BR>
<BR>
The support of developing nations for the phasing out of arms transfers
is key, according to Saul. None of the advocates of this proposed convention
want to perpetuate the current lopsided balance of military power, which
leaves the less-well-armed developing world at the mercy of the big arms
producers. <BR>
<BR>
The Draft Convention on the Monitoring and Reduction of the International
Arms Trade was written and revised by a group of legal scholars, diplomats,
and peace activists from over a dozen countries, including substantial representation
from the developing world. <BR>
<BR>
The convention builds on the long history of international laws that have
sought to limit certain arms transfers and to regulate the conduct of warfare.
<BR>
<BR>
The convention calls for a three-phase disarmament process, which could
take from five to 40 years:
<UL>
<LI>The voluntary registry supported by the General Assembly would become
mandatory and expand to include weapons stockpiles also. This phase is based
on the emerging sense that security is better achieved through openness
about the military stances of potential adversaries than through secrecy.
<BR>
<BR>
<LI>During the second phase, all nation-state military functions become
defensive only. An international agency would verify each nation's compliance.
By the end of this phase, all arms production would be subject to outside
monitoring.<BR>
<BR>
<LI>The third phase would see the emergence of an alternative regional and/or
global security system; national weapons stockpiles would be eliminated;
and arms production would be cut to the amount needed for internal order.
</UL>
<BR>
Using a legal document as a basis for a peace effort may put some people
off, but it also offers a sort of legitimacy, Saul says. &quot;You've honored
it. You've privileged it in some fashion - made it more real.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Saul hopes that with sufficient preparation, the UN General Assembly will
be ready to adopt the treaty by the centennial of the 1899 Hague conventions,
which brought international law to bear on the practice of warfare. <BR>
<BR>
So, just as the 20th century was free of slavery - at least as an accepted
part of civil society - the 21st century could see the end of armaments
and war as legitimate means for resolving conflict.<BR>

<H4><CENTER><I>An interview with Jack Yost, by Sarah van Gelder</I></CENTER>
</H4>
<I><BR>
Global governance is already a reality, as the previous articles by Harlan
Cleveland and Hazel Henderson point out. Some of that governance is highly
democratic, based in citizens' organizations banding together to make their
voices heard. But much of global governance remains unaccountable and out
of the control of ordinary people. For example, transnational corporations
make decisions that affect large numbers of people, but they have outgrown
the regulatory structures designed to keep their activities in line with
the public good. <BR>
<BR>
What we need now are new, democratic forms of planetary governance, say
leaders of the World Federalist Movement. Representing the World Federalists
at the UN is Jack Yost, who has written extensively about the drawbacks
of the UN's current form and his group's proposal for a world parliament.
The World Federalists' UN office is at 777 UN Plaza, 12th Floor, New York,
NY 10017, tel. 212/599-1320.</I><B><BR>
<BR>
Sarah: Why do you see the need for changes in the way decisions are made
at the global level?<BR>
<BR>
Jack</B>: The planet is facing an emergency, and governments are reaching
for the lowest common denominator when it comes to making decisions. The
whole UN treaty-making process is in a kind of global gridlock; you either
have no decisions being taken - as in the case of the arms trade, which
is totally, absolutely out of control - or you have steps that are very
minimal. <BR>
<BR>
In the General Assembly, you need 183 countries to agree on something before
you can take action. It's not a formula for taking bold and timely action
to solve problems! On the Security Council, there's always the threat of
a veto. <B><BR>
<BR>
Sarah: How do you think this system could be improved? How would you like
to see global decision making take place ?<BR>
<BR>
Jack: </B>We've got to vastly cut back on the bureaucracies at the national
level and devolve power to the local level and to the global level. That's
going to be the big challenge. National governments are always looking out
for their own interests.<BR>
<BR>
The current system, based on a national security state, is like this big,
fat belly sitting atop local government with a little toothpick at the top.
It's an impossible system of governance that absolutely doesn't work. <BR>
<BR>
The problem, of course, with global governance is that people imagine another
big, more bloated belly on top of the one that is already there. That's
why accountability and transparency and participation of citizens is so
important in whatever system of governance we build. <B><BR>
<BR>
Sarah: What is the philosophical basis for your approach?<BR>
<BR>
Jack: </B>I think we need to start with fundamental federalist principles.
Sovereignty, according to this concept, resides with the citizen. And while
citizens may choose to delegate powers to higher levels of government, those
holding power remain directly accountable to citizens. Moreover, decisions
should be made at the lowest level of government that can effectively deal
with an issue. In some cases, that will be at the global level - that's
true, for example, of global warming. We need global agendas for issues
like peacekeeping, human rights, and the environment. <BR>
<BR>
At the same time we need more resources at the local level so that people
can implement local solutions such as recycling, harnessing renewable energy
resources, and so on.<B><BR>
<BR>
Sarah: Tell me about the World Federalists' proposals for a parliamentary
assembly. How would that work? <BR>
<BR>
Jack: </B>There would be a parliamentary assembly set up as a committee
of the General Assembly, with its members coming from national parliaments.
This would give an advantage to the parliamentarians, because it would give
them a voice in global decision making, and it would be good for citizens
because indirectly, at least, they'd be represented at the global level
through their elected officials. <BR>
<BR>
Eventually, there would be a global parliament of members elected directly
by the people of the planet. Then we'd have true democratic decision making
at the global level. <BR>
<BR>
As far as the specifics, we don't propose exactly how it would work; what
powers the parliament would have would be subject to negotiations.<BR>
<BR>
For now, we can start moving toward more democracy in other ways. We can
start by having citizen representation in international agencies. The World
Bank, International Monetary Fund, and the Atomic Energy Commission, for
example, should have representatives of citizens' groups on them. But citizens'
groups will have to put a lot of pressure on those organizations for this
to happen. <B><BR>
<BR>
Sarah: Why would a world parliament make better decisions than those now
made by the UN?<BR>
<BR>
Jack: </B>The representatives wouldn't be taking instructions from their
governments, so they'd be free to vote as their conscience dictates. They
could be influenced by their fellow parliamentarians and would be more likely
to come together because they'd have a common interest in global and planetary
issues. <BR>
<BR>
A lot of the diplomats at the United Nations are very progressive, because
just being around here you develop a more globally oriented point of view.
But that doesn't mean they can vote the way they think best; they have to
call back to their national capital, where, often times they'll be told,
&quot;Don't do this; it will impinge on our national sovereignty,&quot;
even when it's a matter of ridiculously petty phrases in some document.<BR>
<BR>
Also, these diplomats are not politicians; they're not legislators. They're
not used to making decisions. But with national parliamentarians - whatever
we think of the gridlock in Congress - at least things get done, eventually.
Just having them here at the UN is going to create a different kind of climate.
<BR>
<BR>
There's a tremendous need to link UN decisions to what's going on in national
capitals. Having a global parliamentary assembly would help the executive
branches of governments because it would be easier for them to argue in
support of the United Nations.<B><BR>
<BR>
Sarah: How would you address concerns that a centralized government could
exercise arbitrary and bureaucratic control over critical global matters?<BR>
<BR>
Jack: </B>The current system is what really is dangerous, because we have
a system of big-brother rule. We have powerful nation-states and powerful
corporations that are ruling the world in a non-democratic fashion, and
they're not accountable to anyone. You have people punching computer keyboards
all over the world and making millions of dollars in the international money
market. <I>That's</I> big brother.<BR>
<BR>
The last thing we'll have to worry about is a global government that's too
powerful. Before nation-states will give up any of their real power, they
will make sure there are checks and balances built into the system.<B><BR>
<BR>
Sarah: What is it about our world today that makes you think that these
ideas could work?<BR>
<BR>
Jack: </B>I believe we are in a cultural transition as dramatic as the one
that opened our world to scientific inquiry and the industrial revolution.
We can now see that we're not just victims of trends, wondering what will
happen next and reacting to events after they happen. We have sophisticated
means of communication and the ability to collect the best ideas from all
over the world. We can work together to come up with a plan for the future.
We have the understanding of core problems and core solutions that could
flip the planetary system into a far more effective and benign means of
governance. <BR>

<H1><CENTER>Ecological Renewal<BR>
In Former East Germany</CENTER>
</H1>
<H4><CENTER><I>by Michael LaFond</I></CENTER>
</H4>
<BR>
The disintegration of the economic and political systems of the former Soviet
Bloc led some to believe that Western development models were the only alternative.
The people of Leipzig, formerly in East Germany, think otherwise. <BR>
<BR>
Michael LaFond, who has worked for the last couple of years on ecological
restructuring projects in former East Germany, sent us this report.<BR>
<BR>
Leipzig, a longtime center for trade between East and West, played a leading
role during the political transition of East Germany. The Leipzig Monday
Marches brought hundreds of thousands into the streets for non-violent demonstrations
that helped bring down the wall dividing Germany. <BR>
<BR>
Leipzig has since remained a center of citizen activism in a reunited Germany,
but with a new focus: finding alternatives to Western models, especially
those of urban development, which are increasingly seen as unsustainable
and inappropriate to the needs of the former Eastern Bloc countries. <BR>
<BR>
As in much of the former East Germany, many of the older sections of Leipzig
were neglected, and in some cases abandoned over the years prior to reunification.
The need to rebuild and repair presents an historic opportunity to develop
and apply sustainable models that are appropriate to local conditions.<BR>
<BR>
The responses to this opportunity have taken a number of forms. People and
groups have occupied some of the abandoned buildings and are working on
retrofitting them and on obtaining the legal rights to remain in the buildings.
<BR>
<BR>
Community groups have sprung up to provide mutual assistance in the restoration
of decaying neighborhoods. <BR>
<BR>
City-wide organizations, such as the Association for Ecological Building,
have begun working with neighborhood groups and others on implementing an
alternative model of urban renewal. This approach focuses on restoring existing
buildings using ecological designs and materials, rather than building anew.
Using an integrated neighborhood approach to energy, water, waste, landscaping,
and transportation, these groups work with existing residents to ensure
that those who live there now can remain. <BR>
<BR>
The East Leipzig initiatives, as these efforts are now called, also are
helping establish connections between urban and rural areas, and fostering
the development of sustainable agriculture.<BR>
<BR>
Projects include a bio-dynamic farm, which sells its produce in nearby neighborhoods;
cooperative housing; self-help renovation and building; and training in
the use of sustainable construction practices. <BR>
<BR>
An ecological-cultural center has been opened in an abandoned building.
The center has a natural food store and caf&eacute;, and offices for organizations
working on urban ecology, eco-construction, and eco-nutrition. The center
also hosts discussion programs, trainings, and cultural events. <BR>
<BR>
Also on the drawing board is the transformation of a former railyard into
the centerpiece of an urban-rural system of green corridors. A network of
corridors is to provide pedestrian and bicycle connections both within the
city and between urban and rural areas. <BR>
<BR>
Economics play a key role in the planning for East Leipzig. Much of the
city's infrastructure is failing, while the unemployment rate has climbed
to about 25 percent, and frustration, crime, and right-wing extremism are
increasing.<BR>
<BR>
The project supports businesses that will create jobs while implementing
this sustainable model of urban renewal. Corresponding employment, education,
and retraining programs are planned.<BR>
<BR>
The East Leipzig initiatives have recently been awarded substantial funding
from the Life-Program of the European Community, which is to be matched
and supplemented by the German government, the city of Leipzig, and others.<BR>
<BR>
There is now a cautious optimism that the East Leipzig project will emerge
as a positive example for the European Community, if not for the world.<BR>

<H1><CENTER>RESTORING JUSTICE </CENTER>
</H1>
<H4><CENTER><I>by Joanne Lucas Cvar</I></CENTER>
</H4>
<BR>
We are losing the &quot;war on crime&quot; with our strategy of deterrence
through retribution. We can't hire enough cops or build enough prisons to
restore a sense of public safety to our streets. This escalation of fear
and violence is eroding the social glue at all levels of society. <BR>
<BR>
The Victim Offender Reconciliation Program (VORP) of Polk County, Oregon,
is one of 120 organizations in the US that are trying a different approach:
restoration of community rather than retribution. Volunteer mediators meet
separately with victims and offenders, and then bring them together to negotiate
restitution for the crime. <BR>
<BR>
In one instance in this rural western Oregon county, a teenager was caught
after shoplifting several times. The store manager, who was very angry at
first, admitted during the negotiating session that he also had stolen when
he was young. As restitution, the teenager agreed to work 20 hours in the
store without pay. At the end of that period, the manager hired him as a
regular employee.<BR>
<BR>
In another case, a young man threatened with a gun an elderly woman who
had stopped to take a break after developing severe leg cramps. During the
mediation session some weeks later, the woman described how the incident
had affected her life: she had been ill for over a week, and not a day had
gone by when she hadn't relived the experience of the &quot;ugly, threatening,
red-haired young man.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
The offender, shaken by her description, expressed remorse for his action.
A behavioral contract was drawn up, and the woman accepted his apology,
saying she was glad to see that the young man was not the &quot;monster&quot;
she had imagined. The two embraced at the end of the session, and she told
the youth she expected he'd become a fine young man. &quot;I think you've
learned a lot from this,&quot; she said.<BR>
<BR>
A study now underway is expected to provide hard data about the success
of the program by next year, but director Sandie Pattison says the evidence
is clear. Ninety percent of participants fulfill their restitution agreements,
and only 6 percent of program participants under age 17 who have completed
the program get into further trouble with the law. In contrast, the recidivism
rate for government-run juvenile corrections programs is about 96 percent,
according to the <I>Oregonian </I>newspaper<I>.</I><BR>
<BR>
The concept of Restorative Justice, which provides the philosophical underpinnings
for the Polk County program and other VORPs, is not new. The term dates
back at least as far as 1974, when a Mennonite probation officer and a volunteer
service director in Kitchener, Ontario, organized a discussion group to
look for a more humane and effective system of criminal justice. <BR>
<BR>
But Restorative Justice is based on far older traditions that pre-date Western
culture. In these traditions, crime is viewed as a breach of the common
welfare and an injury to the victim and the victim's family that require
just reparation. Restoration is a healing process, aiming for reconciliation
rather than retribution, in the interests of re-establishing right relationships
and peace in the community. <BR>
<BR>
The Restorative Justice approach is holistic, recognizing that the needs
and responsibilities of all the parties to a crime - the victim, the offender,
secondary victims (such as the families of the victim and the offender),
the community, and the state - are interconnected in a dynamic relationship.
In contrast, our current <I>get tough </I>justice system views crime as
a violation of law and a challenge to the authority of the state. <BR>
<BR>
Community involvement, in the form of a mediation panel, recognizes the
partial responsibility of a community for the actions of its members. In
most cases, punishment is community based, providing supervised conditions
that enable the offender to eventually be restored to a position of respect.
Available prison space is reserved for dangerous criminals, an estimated
20-25 percent of those now incarcerated. <BR>
<BR>
VORPs have been established in Canada, England, and Germany, and victim/offender
mediation was the topic of a recent NATO conference in Italy.<BR>
<BR>
This transformation in criminal justice is not just one more new program
in a 200-year succession of failed programs, but a revolution in the paradigm,
a change of heart as well as a change of mind. The failure of our criminal
justice system is now so overwhelming as to serve as the catalyst for a
radical change. <BR>

<H1><CENTER>Sustainable Forestry</CENTER>
</H1>
<H3><CENTER></CENTER>
</H3>
<P><CENTER>by Matt Holland</CENTER>
<P>When is a forest not a forest? <BR>
<BR>
According to people who really understand the forest ecosystem, like sustainable-forestry
pioneer Merv Wilkinson, a forest is more than trees and underbrush. It's
a complex web of interrelatedness. That web does not come into being in
mono-culture tree farms, and new evidence indicates that it also is severely
disturbed in areas adjacent to clearcuts. <BR>
<BR>
Using data from Landsat satellite images, two US scientists found this year
that while the total area of the Brazilian Amazon basin deforested by 1988
was smaller than previously thought, the area &quot;severely affected with
respect to biological diversity&quot; totaled 588,000 square kilometers,
more than twice earlier estimates. The culprit: &quot;edge effects.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
Edge effects in the area around a clearcut can reach up to a kilometer into
the forest. In these zones there is a greater exposure to winds, the microclimate
may be dramatically changed, livestock have easier access, and predator-prey
relationships may be disrupted as some species move on to undisturbed ranges.
<BR>
<BR>
Since tropical rainforests are typically cut in a patchwork pattern (as
are North American forests), there are many kilometers of edges affected
this way.<BR>
<BR>
Fortunately, for the past decades, a few foresters have been quietly perfecting
a better way to log, and others are catching on. Sustainable, selective
forestry may be the bridge between our ongoing need for forest products
and the immediate necessity for a more responsible relationship with the
woods. And it may even heal some wounds between the angry, polarized groups
that have formed around the forest practices debate.<BR>
<BR>
Merv Wilkinson has logged his 136-acre woodlot on Vancouver Island, British
Columbia since 1945. During that time, the woodlot has remained a viable
forest ecosystem. Merv says he can continue to log &quot;indefinitely&quot;
because he allows the trees to grow faster than he removes them.<BR>
<BR>
In <I>Wildwood: A Forest for the Future</I> Merv shares the lessons he has
learned over the years: to leave the prize-specimen &quot;grandparent trees&quot;
standing to reseed the forest; not to clear out &quot;unwanted species&quot;
such as willows, which build soil by dropping their leaves; to make his
few logging roads follow natural contours to minimize erosion; and to let
most tree diseases run their course without intervention.<BR>
<BR>
Merv has gained his knowledge working close to the Earth, in one small corner
of Canada. But there's similar work being done all over the planet.<BR>
<BR>
The International Tropical Timber Organisation, a trade association of 47
producers and importers, has set a goal of making responsible, selective
logging the norm in tropical forests by the year 2000. <BR>
<BR>
In North America, sustainable forestry leader Orville Camp is training new
foresters in environmentally sensitive techniques at his Ecoforestry Institute,
based in Portland, Oregon. <BR>
<BR>
Orville, who wrote the <I>Forest Farmer's Handbook</I> nearly a decade ago,
is worried about people who call themselves sustainable foresters, throw
around a few catchwords, and then do a lot of damage with their chainsaws.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;The term is kind of meaningless unless you set some sort of standards,&quot;
he says.<BR>
<BR>
The need for standards is now widely recognized. The Rogue Institute for
Ecology and Economy, the Rainforest Alliance, and Scientific Certification
Systems are all working on a process to certify lumber that comes from forests
that are managed sustainably. <BR>
<BR>
No one knows yet which certification system or combination of systems will
become industry standard, and there is considerable controversy surrounding
the matter. In the meantime, architects and builders are increasingly interested
in using certified lumber.<BR>
<BR>
The Institute for Sustainable Forestry is also developing a certification
process. Peggy Iris and her late husband Jan founded the institute to teach
sustainable forestry techniques and help woodlot managers develop sustainable
forestry plans. <BR>
<BR>
A long-time homesteader and alternative school teacher, Jan Iris wanted
to create a job base in Humboldt County so his students could live and work
in the area. He had already been thinning out trees on the property he shared
to control the fire risk and decided to build on that experience.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Holistic forestry,&quot; Peggy says, is &quot;all-age, all-species
management, very gentle forestry, not ever letting any heavy equipment leave
the roadways.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;It takes longer,&quot; she says, explaining that trees are selected
and cut carefully. It's a big contrast to the forestry practiced by most
timber corporations, which prefer to plant same-age stands of a single species
for quick, efficient harvesting. <BR>
<BR>
Since Jan's motivation was economic development, he had to make up for the
higher cost of selective forestry. So Wild Iris started adding value to
the wood instead of selling the logs green; it now produces cured and dried
hardwood lumber and flooring, and is planning to expand.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;With the timber industry collapsing as it is under the restrictions
and the depletion of the resource base, it's becoming really clear that
this is the way to go,&quot; says Peggy. &quot;Sustainable forestry is definitely
taking off.&quot; <BR>

</H4>
<BR>
There may be nothing more basic to our sense of well-being than what we
choose to do with our time every day. <BR>
<BR>
We all have constraints on our time, of course. There is money to be earned,
dishes to be washed, people who need our care. It often seems that there
isn't enough time in the day for the things we value most, and we are often
too worn out from keeping up with it all to ask ourselves what it is that
we value - how it is that we really want to spend our lives.<BR>
<BR>
There are important reasons to ask these questions. The deeper searching
involved in asking what we really want out of life helps us discover both
what we want to say &quot;yes&quot; to and how to clear away the things
that are cluttering up our lives.<BR>
<BR>
Tuning in to our deeper values can also help us tune out our advertising-driven
culture's non-stop messages of consumerism. Doing so is a prerequisite for
a sustainable lifestyle - and ultimately a sustainable culture.<BR>
<BR>
Bringing our work life into keeping with our sense of purpose is particularly
challenging because our job system is in a time of major transition. Job
growth no longer tracks economic growth in the way it once did. A growing
employment crisis makes even basic subsistence a challenge for many, and
full participation in our culture a distant dream for many more. Even those
with steady jobs often feel trapped in work that seems to have little value.
<BR>
<BR>
These changes in the job system are frightening <I>and </I>they provide
the dynamic climate in which real change is not only possible but inevitable.
The job crisis, coupled with a sense that there is more to life than rushing
from one urgent task to another, is convincing many of us take a fresh look
at our lives and to question what is really important. <BR>
<BR>
The personal choices we make as a result of that questioning, taken together,
form the beginnings of a sustainable culture. <BR>
<BR>
The contributors to this issue have shared their ideas on how this transition
can occur; we hope you'll send us your story about the changes you've made
in your use of time.<BR>

<H1><CENTER>Saging - Not Aging</CENTER>
</H1>
<H3><CENTER></CENTER>

<H4><CENTER><I>by Rabbi Zalman Schachter-Shalomi</I></CENTER>
</H4>
<BR>
<I>Rabbi Zalman Schachter-Shalomi, professor emeritus 
at Temple University, is an internationally recognized 
teacher of the heart who draws from many disciplines 
and cultures. He is the founder of Spiritual Eldering 
Institute, which teach elders how to expand their lives 
and consciousnesses to meet their extended life span. 
You can contact him at the institute: 7318 Germantown 
Ave., Philadelphia, PA 19119.</I><P>

If somebody says to me: &quot;I'm not happy about the 
way I'm growing old,&quot; I talk to them about shifting 
from aging to saging.<P>

The first step is to face our mortality. When I look 
ahead, I see the end. I'm going to die. Most people 
have an aversion to looking in the direction of dying. 
The future inexorably comes, and if I'm not facing 
it, I'm backing into it.<P>

Many people see the past and all its problems and they 
don't want to look at the past either. The present 
isn't so hot, what with the diminishments, the cataract 
operations, the prostate thing, and so on.<P>

So there sets in a compressed awareness, and with it 
comes depression: you have no past, you have no future, 
and the present is very bleak. <P>

Then people realize &quot;Hey, I can't afford that because 
I'm not living longer, I'm dying longer!&quot;<P>

Once they've looked directly at their mortality they 
can ask a realistic question: How long have I got? 
And most of the time it's not so bad. If I've lived 
up to today, the likelihood is that I'm going to live 
some more, and maybe a lot longer. Once people realize 
that they can begin to plan.<P>

They may consider going back to work, but for many elderly 
people that would be neglecting what they most need 
to do, which is to harvest their lives. Anything that 
takes one away from that task leads to depression; 
anything that'll further that task brings elation: 
&quot;Ah, that's what I need to do right now!&quot;<P>

Part of the harvesting process involves letting go of 
old grudges, doing one's energy budget and figuring 
out how much energy is tied up in not forgiving. <P>

This is all part of what I call &quot;life repair,&quot; 
which also includes paying attention to intergenerational 
relationships and finding the pearls in anxious memories.<P>

There are contemplative tools available from all the 
mystical traditions that help tremendously with this 
process. These tools have one thing in common: you 
work with your spirit, with your inner awareness, with 
your intuition. There's a certain guidance that people 
feel comes to them from beyond their own personal selves. 
<P>

Using these contemplative tools and Martin Buber's teachings 
I've designed something I call socialized meditation. 
In a process similar to co-counseling, we encourage 
what we call spiritual intimacy. For instance, I have 
to do forgiveness work, and you and I are working together. 
The state of mind in which I do that work is not everyday 
banter. Instead it's a very deep <I>I-Thou</I> relating. These 
are the tools that enable us to begin the process of 
<I>saging </I>instead of just <I>aging</I>. <P>

One of the things I ask people who are getting older 
is, &quot;Are you saved?&quot; Most of them haven't 
done any mentoring or journal writing, so when the 
plug gets pulled, all that memory in (biological) RAM 
is gone. So we need to upload it! <P>

You know, crazy as it may seem, if you've been reincarnated 
a couple of times and you haven't graduated, it may 
be because you have incompletes in your eldering!<P>

Spiritual eldering carries with it special opportunities; 
it means acting as guide, mentor, and agent of healing 
and reconciliation on behalf of the planet, nation, 
tribe, clan, and family. We become wisdom keepers.<I><P>

</H1>

</H3>
<H4><CENTER><I>by Sarah van Gelder</I></CENTER>
</H4>
<BR>
What will it take to reduce the waste described by 
J.W. Smith? <P>

The massive restructuring of US corporations with the 
axing of thousands of jobs indicates that much unnecessary 
work is already being eliminated. <P>

This system-wide transformation could be another step 
toward dividing the population into two groups: one 
that includes a shrinking number of over-worked, over-consuming, 
and over-stressed people, and a second group that contains 
a growing number who work in low-paying temporary jobs, 
with a diminishing sense of self-worth, security, and 
belonging.<P>

On the other hand, the shift in employment patterns 
could be a major opportunity to rethink our job system, 
which, after all, is a relatively recent invention. 
Moving toward a system that divides the work among 
a greater number of people is a prerequisite to any 
humane effort to cut unnecessary work (see page 39 
for some specific approaches). <P>

One of the impediments to sharing work in the US is 
the fixed cost associated with each worker hired. One 
of the largest of these fixed costs is health insurance. 
Adopting a system that de-couples health insurance 
from employment would remove a significant block to 
shorter work hours in the US. Doing so could also cut 
the tremendous excess costs associated with filing 
forms and resolving claim disputes.<P>

There are additional steps that government could take 
to help reduce unnecessary labor. Paul Hawken has suggested 
that taxes should be levied on the things we want to 
discourage, rather than things (like income) we want 
to encourage.<P>

Perhaps the corporate income tax should be replaced 
with a tax on waste:  advertising, legal expenditures, 
solid and hazardous waste, and salaries in excess of 
$100,000. <P>

While government could have a very positive role in 
reducing waste, it's more likely that the more creative 
solutions will come from businesses, community groups, 
and individuals who see ways to avoid the expenses 
associated with these vast waste territories.<P>

There are already many examples of this in a wide variety 
of sectors. Some business contracts now stipulate that 
disagreements should go to binding arbitration instead 
of to court; the resulting savings in lawyers' fees 
increases the pool to be divided in a settlement. <P>

Here are some other ways to circumvent the waste territories. 
<P>

* Alternative trade organizations allow people in different 
countries to buy and sell goods without going through 
large corporations (see <I>IC</I> #36). Revenues go directly 
to the people who produce the goods, rather than to 
intermediaries.<P>

* Worker-owned businesses and those that adopt a team 
approach to production and decision making can save 
much of the cost of management oversight and increase 
efficiency. Levi Strauss and Chrysler are among the 
corporations that have seen major increases in efficiency 
through empowering teams of employees to make decisions 
and organize their work.<P>

* Credit unions help keep money out of the vast waste 
territory of the world of high finance. These institutions 
pay interest for the funds they borrow, but aren't 
also required to pay dividends; they don't have to 
make decision based on the short-term best interest 
of absentee shareholders; and they are less prone to 
being taken over by other entities or individuals engaged 
in one of the most wasteful of waste territories: leveraged 
buy-outs. <P>

Credit unions and cooperatives also save much of the 
expense associated with advertising, which is one of 
the most egregious of waste territories. It not only 
wastes talent, time, and materials, it creates vast 
quantities of cultural pollution. Moreover, it creates 
a social norm based on the wasteful practices of over-consumption.<P>

* Buying clubs that order directly from wholesalers 
circumvent the advertising waste territory and save 
on the costs of maintaining and staffing a retail outlet. 
<P>

* Buying from small businesses saves the cost of supporting 
layers of management who often spend much of their 
time overseeing each other's work and battling other 
companies for market share. <P>

* Buying locally produced goods saves transportation 
costs and allows the buyer to know more about how the 
product effects the environment.<P>

* Communities (neighborhoods, churches, intentional 
communities, groups of friends) can reduce waste by 
sharing and passing along possessions that are no longer 
needed, by providing social insurance (agreeing to 
help each other out when in need), and by providing 
a richness to life. In comparison, the mall - today's 
surrogate community - is a sterile and wasteful alternative.<P>

These are just a few of the opportunities for reducing 
participation in waste territories, but small actions 
can make big ripples.<P>

Businesses that find creative ways to disengage themselves 
from waste territories will be in a stronger competitive 
position. <P>

Individuals who avoid waste-based consumption practices 
cut their expenses and gain greater financial independence.<P>

Individuals, communities, and businesses that work together 
to circumvent the waste territories can build whole 
economic sectors that function more sustainably, and 
are in a far better positioned to thrive into the next 
century.<P>

<H3><CENTER></CENTER>
</H3>
<H4><CENTER><I>an interview with Ivan Scheier, by Ed and Gay-wynn Cooper</I></CENTER>
</H4>
<BR>
<I>The possibilities for creativity and service through 
volunteering make it yet another reason why a life 
that is less dominated by paid work could be a rich 
and satisfying one. That was the experience of Ed and 
Gay-wynn Cooper, who last fall joined </I>IN CONTEXT<I> as 
full-time volunteers. <P>

Ed and Gay have worked as educators, writers, wellness 
consultants, change agents, and dentist and dental 
hygienist, respectively. About three years ago, as 
</I>IC <I>readers</I>,<I> they were introduced to the question, &quot;What 
is enough?&quot; (</I>IC<I> #26). This had  what they describe 
as a profound effect on their lives, leading to their 
transformation from workaholics to full-time volunteers. 
<P>

Ed and Gay's exploration into the question of how volunteering 
can be both a joyful experience and one that can make 
the world a better place led them to Ivan Scheier. 
Ivan has won a following world-wide for his work promoting 
volunteering. Currently, he is director of Voluntas: 
The Center for Creative Community, (Star Route 46 Madrid, 
NM 87010). However his title for himself, Dreamcatcher 
in Residence, gives you a better idea of the essence 
of this man.<P>

Even if you can't volunteer full-time right now, we 
think you'll enjoy getting to know Ivan.<B></I><P>

Ed: <I></B>In a nutshell, what is your definition of volunteering?</I><B><P>

Ivan: </B>One of my definitions of volunteering is doing 
more than you have to - because you want to - in a 
cause you consider good.<B><P>

Ed: <I></B>How would you describe the image of volunteering 
in the mind of the general population?</I><B><P>

Ivan: </B>Well, I think it is more honored than it used 
to be. Maybe 30 or 40 years ago it was seen as something 
your wife did to get out of the house a couple times 
a week.<P>

Now, volunteering is a kind of status symbol. In fact, 
98.4 million Americans volunteered in 1990. Within 
these ranks there are almost as many men as women, 
people of all ages, and more different ethnic groups 
than ever before. <P>

The mission of volunteering still faces prejudice in 
our culture, which holds that money is the measure 
of success in life. If you are paid $50,000 a year 
and I'm paid $25,000, your worth is twice mine - in 
two senses, both as a human being and financially. 
So when I work as a volunteer and earn nothing, the 
conclusion is that neither I nor my work is worth anything.<B><P>

Gay: <I></B>In reality both organizations and volunteers themselves 
get caught up in that image.<B></I><P>

Ivan: </B>Oh yes, you hear it all the time: &quot;I'm <I>just</I> 
a volunteer.&quot; The label doesn't help you get things 
done, particularly if you're a man. There is still 
a gender difference out there.<P>

 In order to be taken more seriously I generally call 
myself by the name of what I do: I'm on the medical 
clinic committee, or I'm &quot;Dreamcatcher in Residence&quot; 
at a think tank and retreat center.<B><P>

Gay: <I></B>Is the climate for volunteers different now? Are 
organizations seeking volunteers? Or do people still 
need to go and knock on doors and say, &quot;Can I 
volunteer for you?&quot;</I><B><P>

Ivan: </B>Well, the work you two are doing is incredible 
and rare. Most organizations are used to someone who 
comes in three hours a week and does some assigned, 
often rinky-dink stuff. I'm sorry, but there is a lot 
of that. Some organizations have rigid guidelines and 
requirements for volunteers, but most are in need of 
help and welcome anyone. <P>

So when you come along and say you want to work 30 or 
40 hours a week, this is very different. Most organizations 
do not have a model for using a high-powered person 
with a lot of experience who is basically willing to 
be &quot;staff without pay,&quot; especially if this 
level of commitment comes with an expectation of some 
participation in the decision-making process. This 
can be threatening to most organizations, and you <I>do 
</I>have to knock on doors. You tend to be more able to 
have this kind of experience in an all-volunteer organization 
or as a free-lance volunteer.<P>

I think you may get to the point where you find, like 
I did, a gap. There is no organization out there doing 
precisely what needs to be done. And, since it needs 
to be done, and you feel very deeply that you would 
like to do it and you can do it, then I think you should 
<I>just do it!</I><P>

One of the first activities at this stage is to build 
a support system. That is one of Voluntas' activities 
- being a Dream Factory. Right now, there are eight 
or 10 people who have dreams but no money. We concoct 
strategies, conspiracies to make their dreams happen. 
<B><P>

Gay: <I></B>What an interesting service to offer. I know we 
were very naive when we made the decision to be full-time 
volunteers. You are helping me see how fortunate and 
special the opportunity is that we have at </I>IN CONTEXT<I>.<B></I><P>

Ivan: </B>I do think the human service delivery system is 
challenged even by the three-hour-a-week volunteer; 
they don't fit into the usual management slots. How 
do you control workers? You give them money and orders. 
<P>

When someone is a volunteer you take away these controls. 
It's enormously challenging to the boss, to the line 
staff, to anybody in the organization. <B><P>

Gay: <I></B>On the other hand it's very freeing for the volunteers 
not to worry about losing their jobs all the time. 
Is this why you advocate all-volunteer organizations?</I><B><P>

Ivan: </B>Yes. It's in all-volunteer efforts that I've found 
risks can be taken on behalf of quality of life. Well 
in advance of big budgets and bureaucracies, undeterred 
by cautious boards, here is the cutting edge of compassionate 
enterprise, where positive change can begin to happen. 
<P>

I have always seen volunteering as something creative. 
You vote with your volunteering; you go where you think 
you can make a difference. You don't need to waste 
your energy fighting the system. <P>

I think to empower the creative spirit, to make volunteering 
for dreamers again, we've got to be forming our own 
groups. There are certainly some problems with entirely 
volunteer groups, but at least you have a chance to 
make a direct impact. <P>

I also advocate, with the Center for Personal and Planetary 
Empowerment, something I call &quot;guerrilla goodness.&quot; 
This is the business of free-lance volunteering; committing 
random acts of kindness is another way of saying it. 
That's totally new. I think we have a blind spot in 
our thinking, a belief that you can't do anything unless 
you are associated with an organization, and the bigger 
and more powerful the better. We forget, the big organization 
is likely to present its own problems with getting 
things done. So, as you surmise, I'm most interested 
in &quot;social entrepreneurs&quot; who establish their 
own programs, do the work, and then, when the time 
comes, let them die.<B><P>

Gay: <I></B>Let them die?<B></I><P>

Ivan: </B>Oh, yes, let them die as soon as they need to. 
Euthanasia of programs, that's a neglected area!<B><P>

Ed: <I></B>Are you saying that you don't feel that long-term 
volunteer organizations are necessary?</I><B><P>

Ivan: </B>No. I think organizations <I>are </I>necessary for certain 
kinds of functions and for people who prefer more structured 
environments. Lots of people are more than willing 
to help if they do not have to go out and get the whole 
project going. These people do an important job and 
so do the organizations. It's just unfortunate that 
many long-term organizations get encrusted with bureaucracy. 
I don't think we put them out of their misery as quickly 
as we should. <P>

A valuable role that volunteer organizations serve is 
that of linking in the community. This role gets overshadowed 
when the energy of the organization is going into self-preservation. 
<B><P>

Ed: <I></B>How, in your view, can we interest and challenge 
individuals who would like to come out of the closet 
and share their gifts?</I><B><P>

Ivan: </B>First of all, I think what the New Road Map Foundation 
(see page 23)<B> </B>is talking about - helping people to 
rethink their relationships to money - is critical. 
We need to get rid of the fear that &quot;If I'm not 
out there earning money I'm not worth anything.&quot; 
This doesn't have to be full-blown financial independence 
as in the New Road Map plan, just a willingness to 
spend more time doing what you value and less time 
working for the almighty dollar. <P>

The second thing is adopting what I call a <I>people </I>approach 
rather than a <I>job </I>approach. I do not go to people and 
say, &quot;We need some help with the library. Could 
you help us with this?&quot; Rather I ask, &quot;What 
would you like to see done? What do you like to do?&quot; 
<P>

I try to make volunteering as free and easy as possible. 
Let people do it <I>their</I> way! And let it be fun! You 
don't have to be martyred to be a volunteer.<B><P>

Ed: <I></B>So when we have volunteers who do what they really 
want to do, they are likely to approach their work 
in a different way.</I><B><P>

Ivan: </B>Exactly. They're volunteering for fun, for meaning 
and choice. Everything we've done with organized volunteers 
- like job descriptions, supervision, evaluation - 
says to people, &quot;You really don't have a choice. 
If you work for us, we're going to take all these choices 
away from you, and you'll be structured and controlled.&quot; 
Control is really what it's about. This may work for 
some people, but there are lots of other structures 
that are more empowering.<P>

It's also good to remember that people have the right 
to be left alone, not to participate. If they want 
to sit on their duffs in front of the TV, it's a free 
country. <B><P>

Ed: <I></B>Is it your experience that sometimes people volunteer 
for the wrong reasons?<B></I><P>

Ivan: </B>Are there really wrong reasons? If it's not pure 
altruism, is it not right? Saints are very rare. I 
think there are a lot of non-altruistic reasons, and 
they are OK. I want my kids to have a better education 
so I'll help out at the school. I'm new in town, I 
want to meet people and connect; I'll volunteer at 
the library. In South Dakota there are singles clubs 
that do volunteer projects together and help members 
to make connections. <P>

There are some reasons I would consider wrong, such 
as being a power tripper, shoving people around, displaying 
your own self importance and not really caring about 
the cause. I think it's very wrong if you're doing 
it because of a social expectation, but your heart 
isn't there. You are going to short the people you 
are serving and short yourself. <B><P>

Ed: <I></B>These suggestions are exciting. They also avoid 
resource leakage. Do you have any other suggestions 
along these lines?</I><B><P>

Ivan: </B>Ultimately, you will only be able to do what volunteers 
are willing and able to do. So why not give them a 
more direct share in setting goals in the first place? 
It's important to realize that powerful purpose isn't 
just something you hope will happen to your group. 
It must be cultivated.<P>

Try committing a random act of kindness when it's least 
expected. Here are a few ideas to get you started:<P>

* Listen deeply with rapt attention to the next child 
you encounter.<P>

* If there is a garden you pass frequently and enjoy, 
stop by one day and leave a note letting the occupants 
know how much pleasure their garden gives you.<P>

* Laugh out loud often and share your smile generously.<P>

* If you are the boss, bring your secretary a cup of 
tea in the morning.<P>

* Pass your copy of <I>IN CONTEXT</I> on to someone or donate 
it to a public library.<P>

* Create something beautiful in a place that is unexpected.<P>

* Have a party, brainstorm ideas for acts of kindness, 
and either individually or in small teams, make plans 
to carry out your ideas.<P>

&quot;To become a person who behaves in this way is 
to be twice blessed. For, in enacting these beautiful, 
spontaneous, wholly gratuitous goodnesses, you transform 
not only the world, but yourself.&quot;<I><P>

Some of these thoughts came from </I>Random Acts of Kindness<I>,

<H1><CENTER>Finding Time</CENTER>
</H1>
<H4><CENTER><I>by Tom Bender</I></CENTER>
</H4>
<BR>
When we built our home some years ago, we tried to build for eternity. We
chose materials with care and put love into their joining. It took us six
months to reach the point where we could move in.<BR>
<BR>
The next morning the house was gone, burned to a mass of smoldering, charred
wood.<BR>
<BR>
As the reality began to sink in, my first agonized thought, over and over,
was, &quot;Six months of my life, of love and labor - gone, vanished, as
if it never existed.&quot; But <I>every</I> six months of my life vanishes.
Do others leave more than a pile of charcoal at the end? What did this six
months leave me with besides charcoal? <BR>
<BR>
Occasionally it takes events as drastic as these for us to see what has
enduring value from the time passed in our lives, and also to see the time
and energy demands of our possessions. <BR>
<BR>
When I realized the things I wanted to accomplish with my life were unlikely
to bring in money, a big decision was necessary. Either I gave up my dreams
and earned a living, or lived my life differently to free time to pursue
my dreams.<BR>
<BR>
My wife and I chose the latter. We freed ourselves of a mortgage by building
our home with our own labor. We evolved a diet at once healthier, tastier,
cheaper, and less demanding on the world. We gave ourselves four hours of
freedom a day by avoiding unnecessary TV and newspapers. I eliminated commuting
by working at home. We heat with the sun and wood from our land. Our elder
son freed himself of years of &quot;education&quot; by home-schooling.<BR>
<BR>
We found the treadmill of modern living doesn't get us any farther than
simple living. And the luxuries of simple living are closer to being soul-satisfying
and life-enriching. We've invested in friends instead of stocks. We watch
the sunset and moonrise instead of TV. We make music instead of consuming
it. <BR>
<BR>
We still have had to take care of dirty baby bottoms and all the other maintenance
work of living. But those chores of everyday living return to us a deepening,
and give us unexpected nurture for new experiences. <BR>
<BR>
This is possible, however, only when we give those everyday acts our undivided
time, attention, and commitment. It doesn't happen if we view them as something
to be avoided or hurried through to get on to the <I>real</I> parts of life.
When a pile of clean clothes or a sparkling window give pleasure in both
the doing and the product, we are nurtured rather than drained. Alan Watts'
reminder often comes to mind: that getting to the end of a song is not the
goal of singing.<BR>
<BR>
What we were learning was the real meaning of <I>austerity.</I> Austerity
does not exclude richness or enjoyment. What it does do is help us avoid
things that keep us from our goals in life. <BR>
<BR>
Affluence has a real cost. Its possibilities demand impossible commitments
of time and energy. It fails to discriminate between what is wise and useful
and what is merely possible. We end up foregoing the things necessary for
a truly satisfying life to make time and space for trivia. Like a garden,
our lives need to be weeded if they are to produce a good crop.<BR>
<BR>
Our conventional world is one which splits us through the heart. We divide
our time and lives between work and leisure. But rarely do we allow our
work the leisure to be enriching. And rarely do we allow our leisure the
purpose and reward of doing things of value and benefit.<BR>
<BR>
Our concept of &quot;time&quot; has been a false one. Greed inflates its
importance to where it controls our lives. <BR>
<BR>
Wendell Berry once wrote about the beauty of an old woman crocheting - a
job she knows she will never finish - and that the joy of time spent making
something beautiful is the real product we create. We need to account for
both the inner and outer products of our work.<BR>
<BR>
Washing dishes without the pressure of time doesn't take significantly longer.
How long it takes <I>stops being important,</I> and the experience isn't
clouded by the constant pressure to be done and on to other, more important,
things.<BR>
<BR>
Some people have concluded that money is more scarce and precious than time.
They say we should go to school longer, work longer, sleep less. But where
would we find new dreams, and what would happen to those wonderful places
between sleep and wakefulness where solutions to problems so often emerge?
<BR>
<BR>
Time vanishes when we are happy and excited and immersed in what we are
doing. That is where we and our lives belong. <I><BR>

<H4><CENTER><I>by Dolores Dante, as told to Studs Terkel</I></CENTER>
</H4>
<BR>
I have to be a waitress. How else can I learn about people? How else does
the world come to me? I can't go to everyone. So they have to come to me.
<BR>
<BR>
Everyone wants to eat, everyone has hunger. And I serve them. If they've
had a bad day, I nurse them, cajole them. Maybe with coffee I give them
a little philosophy. They have cocktails, I give them political science.
<BR>
<BR>
It would be very tiring if I had to say, &quot;Would you like a cocktail.&quot;
I just rephrase it enough to make it interesting for me. That makes them
take interest. It becomes theatrical and I feel like Mata Hari and it intoxicates
me.<BR>
<BR>
People imagine a waitress couldn't think or have any kind of aspiration
other than to serve food. When somebody says to me, &quot;You're great,
how come you're <I>just </I>a waitress?&quot;<I><BR>
<BR>
Just </I>a waitress. I'd say, &quot;Why, don't you think you deserve to
be served by me?&quot; It's implying that he's not worthy, not that I'm
not worthy. It makes me irate. I don't feel lowly at all. I myself feel
sure. I don't want to change the job. I love it. <BR>
<BR>
Some don't care. When the plate is down you can hear the sound. I try not
to have that sound. I want my hands to be right when I serve. I pick up
a glass, I want it to be just right. I get to be almost Oriental in the
serving. I like it to look nice all the way. To be a waitress, it's an art.
<BR>
<BR>
I feel like a ballerina, too. I have to go between those tables, between
those chairs. Maybe that's the reason I always stayed slim. It is a certain
way I can go through a chair no one else can do. I do it with an air. If
I drop a fork, there is a certain way I pick it up. I know they can see
how delicately I do it. I'm on stage. <BR>
<BR>
I tell everyone I'm a waitress and I'm proud. <I><BR>

<H4><CENTER><I>by Ron Fox</I></CENTER>

<BR>
<I>Reprinted from </I>YO!<I> fall 1993</I><BR>
<BR>
Sharing a family meal wasn't something that happened a lot around my house.
The daily dinner time routine when I was growing up in Richmond was to come
home and find no one around but me.<BR>
<BR>
Now, after five years of living apart, I'm spending my senior year of high
school living in Gary, Indiana, with my father and sister. The thing I value
most is the supper we share.<BR>
<BR>
Every night, around 6:30, all of us - me, my father, my father's girlfriend,
her two daughters, and my sister - sit down to dinner together. Last night
we had pork chops, mashed potatoes, cabbage, and greens. We all trade off
cooking different nights. If someone can't be there, we always save him
some food. We look out for each other like that.<BR>
<BR>
Maybe this doesn't sound like such a big deal, but it's something I've never
experienced before. In Richmond the family motto was &quot;do for yourself.&quot;
My motto was &quot;eat what you can, when you can.&quot; I used to eat alone
all the time, and so did everyone else. I ate a lot of fast food.<BR>
<BR>
The only time my family would sit down at a meal together was when we'd
go to Grandma's house. Grandma's<B> </B>generation knew how it should be.
They were raised to eat with the family.<BR>
<BR>
But my parents were young and struggling. When they got home they were either
so tired they'd go right to bed, or else they'd want to go out and party.
If they did eat at home, they'd eat by themselves in their bedroom. After
my dad split, my mom had trouble holding things together. Sometimes my older
sister would bring something home from Kentucky Fried Chicken, where she
worked. Even then, we'd split up the chicken and eat alone.<BR>
<BR>
Holidays were the best part of the year because we'd eat with the whole
family. We enjoyed the different kinds of food and the warm atmosphere in
the house, and we hated for those days to end.<BR>
<BR>
For a long time I just pretended to myself that I didn't care whether I
ate alone. Now I know how good it feels to sit down every night and share
a meal with my family. It means we're taking care of each other.<I><BR>

<H1><CENTER>Balancing Time And Energy</CENTER>
</H1>
<H4><CENTER><I>by Devra Gartenstein</I></CENTER>
</H4>
<BR>
In a sense, I started my food business in order to deal with the issue of
time in my life. Fiction writing is my vocation, my passion, but to date
I haven't made a semblance of a living from it. I realized early on that
I would have to separate my means of earning a living from the work that
meant most to me. In order for my time and energy to not be exhausted by
meaningless labor, I saw that I would have to either find or create a situation
in which I could, as much as possible, define the terms of my employment.<BR>
<BR>
In retrospect it seems that I saw very little of this clearly or consciously
at the time I was laying the foundations of my business. I found myself
in a situation - working at a natural foods store - in which I could produce
several items that people wanted. I needed the extra money, and it agreed
with me to set my own hours and play music loudly while I worked.<BR>
<BR>
Soon I began wondering what it would entail to do this kind of enterprise
on a larger scale. I started investigating, applying for licenses, and marketing.
At that time I was expending more time and energy on my work than I had
when I held conventional jobs. Small businesses rarely generate enough income
initially to pay their proprietors, so I also needed a wage. When the business
first began making enough money to pay me, I could quit working for others,
but I still put in close to 50 hours a week.<BR>
<BR>
Perhaps 50 hours is a conservative estimate. I thought about my business
day and night, numbers ran through my head even when I stopped paying attention
to them. The flip side of this situation was that I also learned to work
on my writing during kitchen time, because repetitive tasks left my brain
free for other activities.<BR>
<BR>
After nearly seven years, I now give the business about 25 hours a week,
divided among kitchen production, shopping for supplies, bookkeeping and
paperwork, and occasional deliveries. There is virtually nothing in my life
for which I need to be on time (except buses). I start when I'm ready and
finish when I'm done.<BR>
<BR>
On an errand day, I like to write for a few hours in the morning, reach
a stopping point, then go shopping before I return and write some more.
If I had to show up at the commissary at noon, for example, I might finish
what I was writing at 11 but be reluctant to start something new even though
I had time, not wanting to hit my stride, then interrupt it. I'd probably
waste the remaining 45 minutes.<BR>
<BR>
I have learned to think of time and energy as inseparable considerations.
Some days, particularly when I am writing, I can accomplish as much in an
hour as I would in an afternoon under less favorable psychic circumstances.
I believe the difference lies not in how thinly I divide my overall time,
but in how I feel about my work.<I><BR>

<H1><CENTER>Reclaiming Time</CENTER>
</H1>
<H4><CENTER><I>by Amrita Boom-Blaine</I></CENTER>
</H4>
<BR>
This year I celebrated my 48th birthday, and my son turned 19. As I experience
the physical, emotional, and psychic changes that occur in menopause, and
as my sense of personal mortality deepens, there has been a shift in how
I value time. It has become important to take time alone and listen inside
every day. <BR>
<BR>
As my son becomes more independent, I have noticed waves of relief within.
Parenting has such an unrelenting time requirement. I'm tired, deep down
in my bones. I need to nurture myself for a long while, not taking care
of others, nor meeting other people's schedules and demands. Last month
my son moved in with his father; they have not lived together full-time
since he was three years old. I encouraged this transition; I miss him,
and it feels very appropriate.<BR>
<BR>
As a woman raised in the United States in the 1950s, I was taught to be
a cooperative caregiver without much consideration of my own needs. Yet
there is an insistent inner need for quiet time and it won't be quelled.
So the task at hand is to set boundaries and invite others to honor them.
There is a very firm &quot;NO!&quot; inside of me that I am learning to
voice in the face of community, business, marriage, and son all wanting
more than I have to give today. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;No,&quot; I say to friends and community, I will not answer the phone
between 8 am and noon, 1 pm and 5 pm. I will return personal calls later
in the day. And please, do not call after 8 pm. That is private, family
time. &quot;Yes,&quot; I respond to clients, I will monitor the phone and
return business calls promptly. <BR>
<BR>
I am aware of an energy exchange with my partner even while asleep. Some
nights I now choose to sleep alone, to claim more discrete space. I awaken
refreshed, aware that my dream patterns have taken different paths. Luckily
my husband understands and supports my taking this time. To paraphrase Rainer
Maria Rilke, as partners we guard the gate of the other's aloneness. <BR>
<BR>
I tell a visitor at our center that she may pick up a book at my house,
but I am not open to conversation this afternoon. This is my writing time.
She wants to visit with me. I let her know I am available during the communal
dinner, not now. My boundaries are tested five, 10, 20 times a day. If I
make an exception one day, people assume I am openly available again. How
long do I feel I need? Until I am filled enough to give again. There are
no predictions, no bargains, no promises. This is my time. <I><BR>

<BR>
Greetings! I am writing to all of you living in the future, 
who do not have time for the present. Are you spending 
all your time planning next week's schedule, thinking 
about five-year loans, 20-year college funds, 30-year 
mortgages, retirement or life insurance? Your present 
time has been reduced to minutes a day, mostly for 
biological functions and reading about the past. You 
may be, and most likely are, losing your life to <I>Temporal 
Dyslexia</I>.<P>

We at Temporal Consulting Technologies, realize that 
people who are anxious, worried, and generally depressed, 
while surrounded by friends, family and modern comforts, 
are suffering from a  common, but until recently un-diagnosed 
disease - Temporal Dyslexia. This condition may have 
transposed you into a horrible future where you are 
desperately doing battle to ensure that your future 
present will be better, or at least as good, as your 
present present that you have no time to enjoy. <P>

Only through our carefully customized programs can you 
stop transposing yourself from your inappropriate (for 
you) temporal  location to your chronologically suitable 
past, present or future.<P>

Perhaps you committed some indiscretion or suffered 
some misfortune and consequently spend all your time 
in the past not enjoying yourself. Again, Temporal 
Dyslexia.<P>

Equally problematic is a <I>current </I>unpleasantness, a relationship 
or lack thereof, a work situation that isn't working, 
etc. You are unable to focus your attention on your 
successful past or exciting future.<P>

We at Temporal Consulting Technologies can help you 
live where you should be. In days you could be living 
happily ever past, present or future, making each second 
count. Why be miserable when you can be properly present 
(past or future)? You owe it to yourself!  s<I><P>

Jeff Dienst lives with his wife and son in Lynnwood, 
WA.</I><P>

<H1><CENTER>The Pursuit Of Happiness</CENTER>
</H1>
<H4><CENTER><I>by Benjamin Hunnicutt</I></CENTER>
</H4>
<BR>
<I>The 40-hour-plus workweek has been part of the US job system for so many
years that many people think of it as a natural law. Historian Benjamin
Hunnicutt has spent years researching one company - Kellogg's - that broke
that law by cutting work hours. He talked to hundreds of workers, many of
whom recall the freedom and creativity unleashed by the extra time. Hunnicutt,
who is the author of </I>Work Without End<I>, is in the process of writing
his findings on Kellogg's into a book, which will be published by Temple
University Press.</I><BR>
<BR>
On December 1, 1930, at the start of the Great Depression, W.K. Kellogg
replaced the traditional three daily, eight-hour shifts in the Battle Creek,
Michigan, cereal plant with four six-hour shifts. From now on, W.K. declared,
his Cornflakes and Shredded Wheat would be produced by a company with a
conscience, willing to do its share to fight the depression. By adding one
entire shift, he reasoned, 30 percent more jobs would be added at the plant
- jobs desperately needed by the unemployed in the city.<BR>
<BR>
Kellogg's six-hour day was an instant success, attracting national media
coverage and the attention of Herbert Hoover's administration. The initiative
won strong support from prominent businessmen and labor leaders all over
the country, and from community leaders and workers in Battle Creek. Observers
throughout the world speculated that Kellogg's experiment offered a practical
way out of the depression, and in light of the fact that hours of labor
had been steadily declining for over a century, was almost certainly a foretaste
of things to come.<BR>
<BR>
W.K. and his lieutenants believed that the six-hour day would revolutionize
industry because the balance of the workers' lives would shift from concerns
about money and jobs to concerns about freedom. The true miracle of welfare
capitalism would thereby be revealed: expanding leisure. Under the direction
of enlightened industrialists such as W.K., the exchange of goods, services,
and labor in the free market would not have to result in mindless consumerism
or eternal exploitation of people and resources. Rather, workers would be
liberated by increasingly higher wages and shorter hours for the final freedom
promised by the Declaration of Independence - the Pursuit of Happiness.
<BR>
<BR>
Through the depression years, the six-hour day functioned as W.K. Kellogg
and Lewis J. Brown, the company president, hoped. Jobs were created as the
company payroll grew. Plant employees seemed delighted to have more time
of their own, especially so since their weekly paychecks were only a little
smaller. Workers were paid for seven hours during the first year of the
six-hour day, but beginning in the second year, total wages were raised
back to the nominal level of the eight-hour day. <BR>
<BR>
Productivity was up, both because of the introduction of new technology
and because of Kellogg's innovative approach to hours and work incentives.
In essence, the management of Kellogg's was sharing the benefits of that
increased productivity with the workers in the form of free time.
<H4><BR>
FAMILY AND COMMUNITY LIFE </H4>
We have excellent information about what workers said about shorter hours.
In 1932, the Women's Bureau of the US Department of Labor sent a research
team to Battle Creek to interview Kellogg's women workers. The team found
nearly 85 percent preferred the six-hour shift, primarily because it provided
&quot;more time for family activities and home duties and leisure&quot;
and because it helped some of the unemployed find work. <BR>
<BR>
The great majority of the Kellogg women used &quot;freedom&quot; or closely
related words when the agents asked them to compare the eight-hour and six-hour
shifts. <BR>
<BR>
The second most commonly used pattern of words had to do with control and
possession; the women spoke about &quot;my work,&quot; &quot;my own time,&quot;
&quot;time to myself,&quot; or &quot;enables.&quot; Several women told the
agents that the balance of their life seemed to be shifting from constraint/servitude
toward freedom/control. <BR>
<BR>
Interviews and surveys I conducted more recently confirm the findings of
the Women's Bureau study.<BR>
<BR>
For Susan Smith*, [*<I>These names are pseudonyms to protect the privacy
of those interviewed.</I>] one of the Kellogg employees I talked to, work
was never the central part of life. The extra time she had as a result of
the six-hour shift allowed her to get her housework out of the way and get
on to what she saw as the real part of the day: reading, walking, writing.
She was self-educated, and it was in the few hours between routine housework
and the job that she could keep the life of her mind and spirit alive, and
find time to be involved in her community. <BR>
<BR>
Many of the women found routine, repetitive housework to be a burden, but
they enjoyed canning, sewing, gardening, and other household activities
that had a sense of 19th century craftsmanship to them. <BR>
<BR>
Josephine Isley* spoke enthusiastically about canning at home during her
early days at Kellogg's, remembering it as a family project that &quot;we
all enjoyed.&quot; To her, canning wasn't work in the same way that the
job at Kellogg's was work. Certainly canning required effort - great effort
in some cases to get her sons involved. But it was a productive activity
that provided a number of important non-financial benefits; the most important
was that her family was together doing something worthwhile. After they
were recruited, Isley recalled that her &quot;sons opened up to talk freely&quot;
and that during such activities &quot;we were the most together as a family.&quot;
Because of such activities &quot;we were better parents.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
She contrasted such complex activities with the &quot;silly&quot; kinds
of leisure pastimes (TV and video games) which, together with modern jobs,
take all the time from family activities.<BR>
<BR>
George Howard* wrote that &quot;the six-hour shift let dad be with four
boys at ages when that was important.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
The shorter shift made a difference on the job as well. Roberta Babcock*
wrote &quot;I retired before they did away with the six-hour day ... but
from my observation in talking to friends who were still working, there
was a vast difference in attitudes regarding their work. They more or less
lost interest and didn't look forward to going in to work like we all did
on six hours. Then, there was a much more relaxed attitude, not the tension
that exists on eight hours. They all liked the additional money but felt
it wasn't worth the constant hassle.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Like generations of workers before them in Europe and the United States,
the Kellogg's women also saw the shorter hours as a moral act, symbolizing
their willingness to share their good fortune with others. They criticized
those who didn't support the six-hour policy as &quot;money-hungry work
hogs.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Although there is no comparable survey from the '30s for the men, there
is strong evidence that their general support was similar. In addition to
plant-wide votes taken in the 1930s and '40s in which men voted three to
one for a six-hour shift, interviews with surviving male workers support
this claim. To a man, workers who still remember the 1930s recall that there
was nearly total support at the plant, and that the few who opposed shorter
hours were branded as misfits and &quot;work hogs.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Community life was strengthened and opened as well. Although there is no
hard data on changes in the use of libraries and recreational facilities,
interviews with some 500 residents of Battle Creek who lived during this
period and a review of the 1932 women's survey indicate that there was a
strengthening of the traditional institutions that thrive when people have
free time: amateur sports, bars, clubs, churches, community service.<BR>
<BR>
The six-hour shift also represented a new opportunity to do things beyond
the traditional. There was a sense of expectation and experimentation. One
woman learned how to fly, for example. Schools were well-attended by adults
interested in personal enrichment, the arts, or getting a better job. People
would go to the city. There was a lot of discussion about this opportunity
to create something new.
<H4><BR>
A POST-WAR SHIFT</H4>
After 1938, Kellogg management soured on the short shift, and the company
began to withdraw support. This was in part because of union demands that
all workers be put on the six-hour shift; departments that had needed extra
scheduling flexibility had until then remained on an eight-hour shift. <BR>
<BR>
Also, the fixed costs associated with each worker on the payroll had increased.
Kellogg management had tried to prorate retirement pay, insurance benefits,
and other benefits, but the union had pressed for increases. <BR>
<BR>
Another factor was that Kellogg himself stepped down, turning over management
of the plant to Watson Vanderploeg, a banker from Chicago who didn't share
Kellogg's welfare capitalist philosophy.<BR>
<BR>
Complying with Franklin Roosevelt's executive order mandating a longer work
week as a wartime measure, the Kellogg plant went to three eight-hour shifts
in the early days of World War II. But prompted by the union, management
reluctantly promised to return to the six-hour day as soon as the war ended.<BR>
<BR>
After the war, management tried to convince workers to continue working
eight hours. Despite generous money incentives and company pressure, workers
voted three to one in 1945 and again in 1946 to return to the short shift.
<BR>
<BR>
Management insisted that &quot;those who want it&quot; be allowed to work
longer hours. Workers were divided by this tactic. Senior men in skilled
crafts were more interested in working longer for more money and less interested
in sharing their work. This group formed a coalition with management and
together they began to challenge the six-hour supporters. They did this
largely by trying to persuade others in the plant to join them in voting
for eight-hour days. They began to talk about &quot;necessity&quot; as an
absolute and unchanging reality, the importance of &quot;full-time work,&quot;
and the unimportance of &quot;leisure.&quot;
<H4><BR>
ROMANTICIZING WORK</H4>
Embracing the new &quot;Human Relations&quot; techniques of business management,
Kellogg's management tried to convince employees that work was the center
of life, important for its own sake. Echoing management's rhetoric, senior
male workers joined management in supporting work as an ideal, affirming
work as life's center and organizing principle. A few workers and union
leaders even joined the more loquacious managers in romanticizing &quot;The
Job&quot; and raising work to heroic and mythic proportions.<BR>
<BR>
During the depression and the 1940s, Kellogg's workers had spoken of necessity
declining as wages increased, of the possibility of a person getting &quot;enough&quot;
or &quot;too much,&quot; and of being able to &quot;share the work.&quot;
They had also spoken of their &quot;needs&quot; in relation to non-monetary
values, saying things such as, &quot;I need the extra money, but I need
the time at home more.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
But after the 1950s, the majority of the eight-hour workers abandoned the
language of freedom and control that both men and women had used for over
50 years, insisting that money was the only real job benefit. They insisted
that they never had &quot;enough&quot; to work less than full-time. Shorter
hours for less money was &quot;stupid,&quot; &quot;silly,&quot; &quot;crazy,&quot;
&quot;wasted,&quot; etc. and only for the &quot;weak girls,&quot; &quot;lazy,
sissy men,&quot; or &quot;housewives&quot; who really didn't need to work
or didn't realize the seriousness of The Job.<BR>
<BR>
This issue divided workers along gender and class lines. More and more,
leisure was feminized. Those with power and status in the community stood
to lose out if another part of life - leisure, community, family - made
competitive claims to meaning and significance in the lives of the workers,
along with claims on their time and allegiance.<BR>
<BR>
If the most important part of people's lives is outside the context of work,
who is in control? Traditionally women have had more power in the home and
in the community. So the battle over time became a power struggle between
those who wanted work to continue in its central role and those who were
claiming the importance of other parts of the culture. To a significant
degree, this division came down between sexes and classes.
<H4><BR>
THE SIX-HOUR MAVERICKS</H4>
Through the late 1950s and 1960s, more of the six-hour departments voted
to go to eight-hour shifts. But the workers in the remaining departments
closed ranks, becoming a mutually supportive and combative group. After
1960, the majority of six-hour workers were women.<BR>
<BR>
The six-hour mavericks believed they were fighting labor's historic battle
against unemployment. The local union had given up that effort on a local
level in favor of supporting politicians who claimed they would conquer
unemployment by creating more jobs at the national level. But the mavericks
still spoke about unemployment as a local problem; the unemployed were laid-off
friends, neighbors, and relatives.<BR>
<BR>
The primary reason most of the mavericks gave for their being at work in
the first place was necessity. Nonetheless, this group continued to insist
that it was possible to make &quot;enough&quot; on the short shift to live
reasonably. They also spoke of balancing the need for money and the need
for free time by limiting their work hours.<BR>
<BR>
This group also hoped that shorter hours would revitalize the home and community.
If the family spent more time at home as the industrial work day diminished,
more energy for home-making would be available, housework could be shared,
and the positive parts of home-making accentuated. The home and neighborhood,
rather than factories, shops, and stores, might then grow in importance.<BR>
<BR>
By the late 1950s, the remaining six-hour mavericks were not only fighting
a losing battle with Kellogg management and senior craftsmen, they were
facing the intrusion of mass culture. <BR>
<BR>
During the '40s and '50s, consumerism increased as a cultural force nationwide.
Workers in Battle Creek offered more resistance than others, unwilling at
first to give up their time for &quot;living&quot; to the lure of new things
to buy.<BR>
<BR>
But after the '50s, mass amusements, radio, and TV began their domination
of leisure time. Passive culture consumption began to replace the traditional
active practice and creation of culture. Why go see the women play baseball
when you can watch the Detroit Lions on TV? Why do your own canning when
you can buy canned goods at the supermarket? Why do anything in leisure
time when you can pay someone else to do it? <BR>
<BR>
As leisure lost its cultural role, emptied of activity and community and
family meaning, consumerism strengthened. After the the centrality of work
was reaffirmed and abundant leisure branded as only for &quot;silly girls,&quot;
consumerism no longer had a rival in Battle Creek. 
<H4><BR>
THE END OF THE SIX-HOUR SHIFT</H4>
In this environment, the remaining six-hour workers had little chance. Under
siege through the '60s and '70s, the group nevertheless held their position
until the issue came to a head in the summer of 1984. The company claimed
that strong competitive pressure within the cereal industry was forcing
it to make its work force more &quot;efficient.&quot; Singling out the six-hour
departments for cutbacks, Kellogg's Board of Directors threatened to relocate
most of the jobs at the plant to other cities unless all six-hour departments
voted to go to an eight-hour shift immediately. <BR>
<BR>
Pressured by the union and threatened by the company, a majority of the
six-hour workers voted on December 11, 1984, to accept the longer hours
.
<H4><BR>
A CULTURE OF WORK &amp; CONSUMERISM</H4>
Most economists and historians assume that the reason working hours have
not gotten shorter for 50 years and that we are now increasingly overworked
is because we can't afford to work less. <BR>
<BR>
The Kellogg story demonstrates that the &quot;necessity&quot; to work full-time
does not come from on high, but is the product of changes in community beliefs,
values, and culture.<BR>
<BR>
Consumerism was a strong competitor for the extra time. Moreover, as leisure
became little more than TV, its attractiveness waned.<BR>
<BR>
Class and gender interests, traditions, and allegiances also helped determine
the course of events. It was no accident that women were the strongest and
most persistent of the six-hour advocates, doggedly criticizing the work-centered
life and promoting alternative social structures, activities, and values.<BR>
<BR>
After World War II, for reasons of community status and power, Kellogg's
managers and senior male workers promoted work, trivialized leisure, and
made shorter hours into an issue strongly associated with feminine values.
Their position set them apart from six-hour women, who were looking outside
the job to the family, school, and community for meaning and satisfaction,
control, and status.<BR>
<BR>
Over 50 years, the debate in Battle Creek evolved from strong support of
&quot;less work and more life&quot; in 1930s and '40s to a reaffirmation
of work as the center of life and a rejection of increasing free time. <BR>
<BR>
This cultural change, rather than economic necessity, is the fundamental
reason why the six-hour day ended at Kellogg's. <BR>

<H2><CENTER><A NAME="NewGospel"></A>The New Economic Gospel Of Consumption</CENTER>
</H2>
<BR>
<I>Where did our culture pick up the notion that there is no such thing
as enough? That we have to work long hours our whole lives just to get by?
That we have to have the latest gadget, clothes, cars, and so on? <BR>
<BR>
Ben Hunnicutt, in his book, </I>Work Without End,<I> describes the way these
notions were consciously promoted starting in the 1920s. Consumerism was
the business world's answer to &quot;demand saturation.&quot; The idea that
people would have enough, and therefore both buy less and work less, was
not appealing to the business leaders of the day. <BR>
<BR>
The following is excerpted with permission from </I>Work Without End, <I>published
by Temple University Press.</I><BR>
<BR>
In the 1920s, work was becoming critically scarce because, as so many observers
agreed, human needs for work's products were being satisfied. At the same
time, traditional motives for working were diminishing due to the fact that
basic needs were being met. <BR>
<BR>
It's &quot;perfectly clear that the middle class American already buys more
than he needs,&quot; but &quot;unless we have a greater outlet for our goods
. . . as manufacturing efficiency increases, there will be larger groups
with too much leisure,&quot; observed business spokesperson Walter Henderson
Grimes. <BR>
<BR>
Since many Americans had achieved a standard of living above &quot;need,&quot;
economic growth seemed doomed. <BR>
<BR>
By the mid-1920s, the fears of businessmen that people had too little work
were gradually replaced by a new and vigorous optimism, which industrial
relations counselor E.S. Cowdrick called the &quot;new economic gospel of
consumption.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
The good news was that increased consumption could save economic growth
and redeem work. If existing markets were being saturated, then the reasonable
response would be to find new markets and increase consumption. <BR>
<BR>
Growth in the &quot;new era&quot; of abundance, however, seemed to be complicated
by the fact that workers did not desire new goods and services - automobiles,
chemicals, appliances, and amusements - as spontaneously as they did the
old ones - food, clothing, and shelter. <BR>
<BR>
It would be the hard work of investors, marketing experts, advertisers,
and business leaders, as well as the spending examples set by the rich,
that would promote consumption.<BR>
<BR>
With this, the business community broke its long concentration on production,
introduced the age of mass consumption, founded a new view of progress in
an abundant society, and gave life to the advertising industry.<I><BR>

<H1><CENTER>Flexible Work Options</CENTER>
</H1>
<H4><CENTER><I>by Kim Bush</I></CENTER>
</H4>
<BR>
<I>Flexible work alternatives may be the single most important factor in
allowing us to create the lives we want for ourselves and our families.
Longer work hours have robbed us of irreplaceable hours with our families,
depleted the energy we need to be fully contributing members of our community,
and drained away the time it takes to be fully informed citizens. <BR>
<BR>
While some are running out of time from overwork, others are hurting financially
and emotionally from lack of work. At least some flexible work options serve
to spread existing jobs further, creating a model for a saner, more humane
work system.<BR>
<BR>
The following article and table draw on the work of Barney Olmsted and Suzanne
Smith of New Ways to Work . Particularly helpful was their book, </I>Creating
a Flexible Workplace: How to Select and Manage Alternative Work Options,<I>
the revised edition of which will be published this fall by the American
Management Association.</I><BR>
<BR>
Hardly a month goes by without a major corporation like Xerox or IBM announcing
a layoff or downsizing. According to Barney Olmsted and Suzanne Smith, this
trend could go in one of two directions: <BR>
<BR>
Our work structure could move further into a core-ring configuration, in
which a small core of full-time employees receives most of the training,
benefits, and relative job security, while the ring - short-term contractors,
temporaries, and leased staff - have little job security, few benefits,
and receive minimal training. <BR>
<BR>
The alternative is to move toward a <I>three- way stretch</I>, an approach
that requires flexibility on the part of work organizations, employees,
and society at large. The areas of flexibility include a variety of schedule
options, on- and off-site work possibilities, and staff cross-training.
<BR>
<BR>
Which of these two directions will prevail is yet to be seen, but the options
available to both management and labor in the next few years are as diverse
as the employees who might take advantage of them. We're no longer talking
about the few determined teachers and nurses who pioneered job sharing in
the '70s and '80s. Today, entire companies in a number of fields are offering
a wide variety of options. <BR>
<BR>
Large corporations have gradually acknowledged the cost effectiveness as
well as the importance to staff morale of working cooperatively with employees
to make new working arrangements. Among the bottom line advantages they've
recognized are: 1) reduction in the cost incurred by losing an employee,
especially the costs associated with recruiting and retraining; 2) the positive
role that flexible work options play in recruiting new staff; and 3) the
capacity of a flexible work force to respond to a rapidly changing, almost
volatile, economy. In short, creating a flexible workplace may be one way
in which firms can gain an advantage over competitors in both domestic and
international markets.<BR>
<BR>
Hewlett-Packard, for example, has initiated flextime, job- and work-sharing,
as well as flexible time-off programs combining vacation and sick-leave
benefits. Pacific Bell is experimenting with allowing management-level employees
the option of telecommuting. 
<H4><BR>
FLEXIBLE WORK FOR THE 21ST CENTURY</H4>
Authors Smith and Olmsted have made flexibility a watchword by introducing
the concept of equitable flexibility or &quot;equiflex.&quot; In simplest
terms, equiflex means combining options in a way that benefits both labor
and management.<BR>
<BR>
Children's Hospital at Stanford University is an encouraging illustration
of this trend. With the help of a full-time computer-assisted dispatcher,
nurses at Children's Hospital can choose to participate in a wide variety
of flexible work programs, including a relief job-pool system, job-sharing,
a wide variety of leave options, and a compressed schedule. <BR>
<BR>
Even more encouraging is the hospital's statement of goals in offering these
options: &quot;to help the staff fit together the sometimes irregular pieces
of a modern lifestyle: family demands, professional requirements, personal
needs for decompression, variety, and even adventure.&quot;<BR>
<BR>

</H2>
<B><BR>
<I>FLEXITIME</I></B><BR>
Combines &quot;core time&quot; when all are expected to be at work and &quot;flexible
time&quot; when employees may or may not be present. Employees are usually
expected to work 40 hours/week. Variations include length of day, and starting
and quitting times.
<DL>
  <DT><B>Current Status</B>
  <DD>Available to 15.1% of the work force; 54% (up from 38% in 1988) of
US businesses have implemented it. More common with managers, professionals,
technicians, and sales staffs than manufacturing and service workers. <BR>
<BR>
  <DT><B>Examples</B>
  <DD><B>* IBM:</B> Most of IBM's domestic employees are eligible for flexitime.
Includes variable, customized and staggered work schedules.<B></B>
  <DD><B>* Auckland</B>, <B>New Zealand City Council Offices</B>: Have a
long core time, with fewer flexible hours.<BR>
<BR>
  <DT><B>Effects</B>
  <DD><B>Advantages:</B> Improves employee morale; accomodates the needs
of employees with children and other outside demands.<B></B>
  <DD><B>Disadvantage</B>: Lack of supervision during some work hours.
</DL>
<B><I><BR>
COMPRESSED WORK WEEK</I></B> <BR>
Usually a 40-hour work week is compressed into less than 5 days. The two
most popular condensed weeks are four 10-hour days, and the &quot;9-80&quot;
model, which is five 9-hour days in one week followed by four 9-hour days

  <DD><B>Disadvantages</B>: Possible reduced commitment to job by employee
and abuse by employer as way of gradually getting rid of full-time jobs.
</DL>
<B><I><BR>
LEAVE TIME</I></B><BR>
An authorized absence from work that may or may not be paid but does not
risk loss of employment rights. There are varying policies about the continuation
of benefits during the leave period, reasons for which range from family

</H1>
<H4><CENTER><I>by Kim Bush</I></CENTER>
</H4>
<BR>
<I>Not all of the industrialized world has the same balance of work and
non-work time that we do in the US. In Japan, the corporate-warrior culture
is being challenged by young people who want more from life. Meanwhile,
in Europe, there is a move afoot to reduce work hours that are already substantially
lower than those in the US. Halting the expansion of forced overtime is
about as far as US unions have taken the effort to reduce work hours, but
there are indications that the shorter work week could again become a goal
of the American labor movement. <BR>

<H2><CENTER>Running Out Of Time:<BR>
Germany And Japan</CENTER>
</H2>
<P><CENTER><I><BR>
an interview with Vivia Boe, by Kim Bush</I></CENTER>
<P><I>To find out about work time and leisure time in Germany and Japan,
we turned to the producers of </I>Running Out of Time, <I>an hour-long documentary
that examines what has come to be known as &quot;time famine&quot; in the
US. </I>Running Out of Time, <I>a production of Oregon Public Broadcasting
and KCTS-Seattle</I> <I>contrasts the long vacations and paid leaves enjoyed
by German workers with the long hours worked in Japan and the US. <BR>
<BR>
Vivia Boe is associate producer of </I>Running out of Time, <I>which will
air nationwide this fall.<BR>
<BR>
</I><B>Kim</B>: <I>What was your reason for going to Japan and Germany in
preparation for the production?<BR>
<BR>
Vivia</I>: We went to Germany to find a counterpart for the American single
mother who plays a central role in the show. In Japan we were primarily
interested in the phenomenon of<I> karoshi</I> - death from overwork - but
we also wanted to learn how their overworked society compared to ours.<B><BR>
<BR>
Kim</B>: <I>What did you turn up on your visit to Japan?<BR>
<BR>
Vivia</I>: In Japan we found out that <I>karoshi </I>is now the second leading
cause of death after cancer. There are 10,000 confirmed victims, but some
think the number may, in fact, be upwards of 30,000. <BR>
<BR>
In Tokyo we contacted the Karoshi Hotline, set up by a group of lawyers
in 1988 to help victims who were filing compensation claims with the government.
The victims of <I>karoshi </I>death range in age from 34 to 61; they really
do just drop dead after an aorta or blood vessel in the brain explodes.<I><BR>
<BR>
Karoshi</I> is the most extreme symptom of overwork, but it grows out of
the corporate-warrior culture pervasive in Japan where a man is supposed
to be a 24-hour champion for his company. In fact, there's a commercial
on TV for an energy drink with a very popular jingle: &quot;Can you battle
24 hours a day?&quot; Everyone in Japan knows it, and we were told that
some companies sing it every morning.<BR>
<BR>
Time for anything but work seems to be extremely limited. So much so that
young families don't even have time to visit their elders. An ingenious
business has developed to meet this need. &quot;Rent-A-Family&quot; sends
out actors to visit lonely parents. The company has a waiting list of 1,000
and appears to be very popular. It seems pretty bizarre, but actually these
people are providing a very important service. The old people said they
just wanted to touch the skin of a baby and that it had made their lives
different to have lunch and visit the playground with the kids who were
part of the rented family.<B><BR>
<BR>
Kim</B>: <I>Did you see signs of resistance to the corporate-warrior culture,
say, among the younger generation?</I><B><BR>
<BR>
Vivia</B>: I think that the younger workers and the wives of men who've
succumbed to <I>karoshi</I> definitely have started to turn away from it.
They seem to have reached their biological speed limit. I'm not sure how
widespread it is but there's a popular phrase among young people: &quot;My
time after five.&quot; But there's tremendous peer pressure to stay at their
desks, putting in what they call &quot;face time.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Salaried men in their 50s and 60s are the real corporate warriors; you see
them in packs drinking and not returning home until late at night, because
if you come home too early, it means something's wrong at work, and your
wife and neighbors might think you're not holding up your end. On the other
hand, younger husbands are getting home for dinner more often than once
a week. In fact, unions are promoting a shorter work week with the slogan
&quot;Let's have a Japan where families can eat dinner together.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
There are other signs that younger workers have had enough, including a
growing interest in leisure activities, evidenced by booming markets for
camping gear and other recreational products. There does seem to be a growing
feeling in Japan that people deserve some time off work, that they should
have a life of their own.<B><BR>
<BR>
Kim</B>: <I>What did you find out about the German approach to work and
leisure? Is it similar to that of the US?</I><B><BR>
<BR>
Vivia</B>: The differences are very striking. We discovered this quickly
in our interviews with Diana, a German worker in her late 20s. She's a single
mother who was born in East Germany but currently puts in a six-hour day
as a secretary/librarian with Schering, a large chemical company in Berlin.
<BR>
<BR>
She chose her company's flextime option in order to spend more time with
her little boy. The plan also entitles her to six weeks of paid vacation,
approximately 15 paid holidays and 18 days of sick leave, which she and
others use quite freely in order to have time for shopping since stores
are closed in the evenings and on Sundays and open only until noon on Saturdays.
<B><BR>
<BR>
Kim</B>: <I>What's the result of all that free time? How does Diana use
it differently from her American counterpart?</I><B><BR>
<BR>
Vivia</B>: Well, first off she has several hours with her little boy every
day, as compared to just minutes a day for Japanese and American workers.
<BR>
<BR>
Diana really did have a life outside of work; she studies languages, rides
her bicycle, travels, and goes to movies - she's a real film buff. She and
the other Germans we met seem to have created a real leisure society in
which they don't live to work, but instead work to live. Even more important
for her was that she never felt pressed, but had plenty of time for family
and friends. We never heard this in the US. Never.<B><BR>
<BR>
Kim</B>: <I>But is the German economy suffering as a result? We hear so
much about productivity, comparing Japanese, Germans, and Americans</I>...<B><BR>
<BR>
Vivia</B>: Chancellor Helmut Kohl complains about the country being run
like a giant amusement park, but what we observed was that when Germans
are at work they work very hard. In fact, the statistics are on Diana's
side: Germans are much more productive than either the Japanese or the Americans.
They don't spend their time off recuperating so that they can go back to
work on Monday, which seems to be the case in the States.<BR>

<H2><CENTER>&quot;Work Less And Everyone Works!&quot;</CENTER>
</H2>
<P><CENTER><I><BR>
by Kim Bush</I></CENTER>
<P><I>Lavorare meno. Lavorare tutti.</I> (Work less. Everyone works.) A
familiar slogan in Italian workplaces, it echoes a growing sense among Europeans
that one prescription for the region's chronic unemployment might be a shorter
work week. In government buildings and around bargaining tables, a four-day
work week has become a hot topic of negotiation. On the other hand, most
US companies remain committed to the 40-hour week plus increasing amounts
of mandatory overtime.<BR>
<BR>
Why a four-day work week in Europe? The strongest arguments grow out of
Europe's chronic unemployment problem. Since 1970, the number of jobs in
European Community countries has increased by only 7 percent, while real
economic growth totaled 73 percent.<BR>
<BR>
A French advocate of the shorter work week, economist Pierre Larrouturou
told the<I> Christian Science Monitor:</I> &quot;Under current conditions
[France] would need an annual growth rate of 5 to 6 percent to bring down
unemployment, and we can't count on that.&quot;1 Larrouturou and others
propose that France reduce its work week to 33 hours and reduce salaries
by 5 percent. They believe that such a move would result in the creation
of up to 2 million new jobs as well as a 5 percent gain in productivity.
<BR>
<BR>
The French Senate approved a measure that would promote experimentation
with a 33-hour week, but a similar plan was defeated in the National Assembly.
<BR>
<BR>
While the political debate inches forward, some companies and unions have
acted on their own to shorten the work week. Subsidiaries of US-based Hewlett-Packard
and Digital, for example, faced by the choice of major layoffs or sweeping
reorganization of work schedules, chose the latter. As a result, no employee
at Hewlett-Packard works more than a four-day week, although the plant is
in operation seven days a week. Digital offered its 4,000 employees the
choice of a four-day week with an accompanying 7 percent pay cut, and 530
employees opted for it, saving 90 jobs that otherwise would have been cut.
<BR>
<BR>
In Germany, Volkswagen recently concluded an agreement with the I.G. Metall
union for a 28.8 hour work week - a 20 percent reduction in hours - coupled
with a 10 percent cut in pay. <BR>
<BR>
BMW's Regensburg plant went to a four-day 36-hour week in 1990, but BMW
did not reduce wages since they believe their productivity gains balance
out the cost of hiring more people. Other companies in Europe, like the
pharmaceutical giant Schering, have noted similar results. <BR>
<BR>
Although the idea of a reduced work week is steadily gaining favor in many
European countries, there are those who fear its long-term consequences.
A German banker in a <I>New York Times </I>interview opined, &quot;You do
not resolve a problem by working less.&quot;2 A French middle manager worried,
&quot;You'll have people consuming less, when what we need is higher consumption
to prime the recovery.&quot;3 <BR>
<BR>
The reactions to the four-day week initiative among lower management and
rank-and-file workers are also mixed. Some are afraid that the shorter work
week is only a harbinger of continued cuts without protecting job security
or wages. <BR>
<BR>
Others welcome the change. Martine Desmond, a personnel manager for Digital
who was one of the 530 to opt for the four-day week, told <I>New York Times</I>
reporter Roger Cohen that, &quot;I am more efficient in my work, less stressed
out and speedy (off work), and have not seen my life style much affected
by the pay cut.&quot;4 
<H4><BR>
US UNIONS COOL TO SHORTER HOURS</H4>
In the US, however, talk about a shorter work week has a less urgent tone.
Some legislators, most of them members of the Congressional Black Caucus
have introduced a bill to establish a government-mandated 30-hour week.
Representative Lucien Blackwell from Philadelphia, the sponsor of the bill,
says, &quot;reducing the standard work week to 30 hours requires large corporations
to hire more employees, promotes family-friendly workplaces, and helps move
Americans off public assistance programs.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
US employers, unlike their European counterparts, pay a large part of their
employees' health benefits. To avoid paying greater benefits costs for an
expanded work force, they are more inclined to stretch the work week instead
of cutting it. The result has been increased overtime for a downsized labor
force and greater reliance on part-time and contingent labor.<BR>
<BR>
The AFL-CIO speaks for most of organized labor when it points out that just
by cutting out overtime 3 million new jobs would be created. Their official
line is simple: until the 40-hour week without forced overtime is re-established
as the national standard, there's not much point in discussing a 32-hour
week. <BR>
<BR>
But there are signs that some union leaders are rethinking their tactical
opposition to a shorter week. At the latest annual convention of the AFL-CIO
in October, Lynn Williams of the United Steelworkers of America remarked
that, the shorter work week is &quot;becoming a higher and higher item on
the agenda as we watch this alleged economic recovery unfold without creating
enough jobs.&quot;5 <BR>
<BR>
His views were echoed by Vincent R. Sombrotto of the National Association
of Letter Carriers, who told a <I>New York Times </I>reporter on October
11, 1993: &quot;They talk about retraining [as a solution for unemployment],
but retraining for what? As the population grows and we're squeezed out
of manufacturing, we have to think about how to stretch jobs to more people.&quot;6<BR>
<BR>
Some newer dissenting voices in organized labor, notably the New Directions
Movement of the United Auto Workers, have taken the debate one step further
by making a shorter work week a part of their plan to save jobs. The UAW
recently dusted off a slogan of the 1970s - &quot;seven hour day for eight
hours pay&quot; - in negotiations at the Chrysler minivan plant in St. Louis
and achieved a 35-hour week there in 1992. <BR>
<BR>
The shorter work week also has advocates outside the labor movement such
as the Society for the Reduction of Human Labor and the Shorter Work Time
Group (SWTG). The SWTG proposes a 10 Point Plan for Shorter Work-Time, which
includes a six-hour day, 30-hour week &quot;full-time&quot; standard with
no loss in pay; longer paid vacations and more creative family leave policies;
and stricter controls on overtime work. Their more general goals are to
combat overwork and workaholism, and to convince the US public that less
work rather than more is better for everyone and for the economy.<B><BR>

Our culture teaches us that time is an enemy. There 
is never enough time to get everything done. We are 
pressured by time. We begin to hate the very idea of 
time and yet we have a peaceful ideal that we keep 
hoping for. Time terrorizes us and yet we cannot escape.<P>

Our feelings reflect a powerful emotional relationship 
with time. If the images we use are at all accurate, 
the relationship is often an abusive one. The challenge 
is how to transform our relationship to time and dismantle 
the abusive patterns we've created. No amount of reading 
or theorizing will change our deep-seated attitudes 
and behaviors. But practice will.<P>

OUR TIME: OUR LIVES<P>

How we spend our time is how we spend our lives. For 
me this is a sobering thought. At times my sense of 
responsibility has translated into alternating workaholism 
and paralysis. I lose my inner compass and my ability 
to choose how I will contribute to this world. I've 
concluded that, in fact, few of us have a peaceful 
relationship with time.<P>

But where do we begin to transform this relationship? 
Most of us start by trying to &quot;get things under 
control.&quot; We use the very same emotional time 
pressure that we resent to force ourselves to get things 
done. We make lists and lists of lists. We put Post-It 
notes everywhere. We make appointments and create deadlines. 
We surround ourselves with messages screaming &quot;DO 
ME! DO ME!&quot; all in an effort to control our desires 
and behavior. <P>

But control does not work. Control is what a guard does 
to a prisoner. Control only turns joyful commitments 
into tedious obligations. This is the major fallacy 
of traditional time management systems.<P>

Time management should be a tool for reflection and 
making choices. Only if we learn from our experience 
of time do we begin to make good choices. We should 
stop using our lists to punish ourselves with everything 
we're <I>not </I>doing. This is the key insight that enables 
us to begin changing our relationship with time: that 
we should create tools for creative reflection and 
let go of our systems of control.<P>

What would such tools look like? In the GoodWorks workshop 
called &quot;Time Management for Human Beings&quot; 
we present a three-part cycle: how we really spend 
our time, what is truly important to us, and how we 
can make our commitments more effective. <P>

PART I: TIME SPENT<P>

An understanding of where our life is going, hour by 
hour, is a powerful benchmark for assessing our ability 
to make effective choices for ourselves. The primary 
tool for developing our understanding of time spent 
is the Time Log. On a piece of paper, make three column 
headings: time, activity, and interruption. Make copies 
and carry them in some convenient form from beginning 
to end of a typical day.<P>

To use the Time Log:<P>

1. Every time you take on a new activity, make an entry 
on the Time Log. You may feel foolish. It will interrupt 
your work. Do it anyway and do it for the entire day. 
Pick a happy medium in defining what constitutes a 
new activity. (Don't stop to note every pen stroke, 
but don't have only large blocks of time entered as 
a single activity.)<P>

2. Under &quot;time,&quot; enter the time you start 
the new activity, to the minute. Under &quot;activity,&quot; 
enter a brief description of what you're doing. Under 
&quot;interruption,&quot; explain why the activity 
felt like an interruption of your time, if it did. 
This last column is totally subjective.<P>

When you're done marking the Time Log, you have accomplished 
most of what it was intended for -- consciousness raising. 
Some people experience tremendous stress as they face 
how they actually spend their time. Some people are 
delighted to see how much they actually accomplish. 
<P>

The data on the Time Log is useful. Analyze the activities 
to see how much time is spent in a reactive mode, what 
accounts for interruptions, and what times of day you 
are most effective. File it away and repeat the exercise 
in a few months to follow your progress. <P>

PART II: IMPORTANCE REVEALED<P>

Most of us approach time management assuming we already 
know what we have to accomplish and we only need to 
figure out a way to get it all done. This is a delusion. 
The goal isn't to try to figure out how to do every 
good thing, but to develop our ability to choose what's 
important from among them. <P>

&quot;Important&quot; is an overused word, that often 
pressures us into guilt-ridden indecision. To say that 
everything is important is just as useless as saying 
that nothing is important. <P>

In our workshop, we present nine exercises designed 
to open people to their own priorities. In the two 
following selections the primary requirement is that 
you put reality aside and get in touch with your unadulterated 
ideals.<P>

* Exercise I - Good News: Starting tomorrow, you have 
four extra hours a day! Take five minutes to answer 
this question: What activities would you want to add?<P>

Don't get down on yourself with pessimistic predictions 
based on how you actually spend your time right now.<P>

Don't get technical. There are no restrictions on the 
four hours. They are an invitation to creativity. But 
don't accumulate the hours and give yourself extra 
days off; the point is to focus on daily life.<P>

* Exercise II - Bad News: Starting tomorrow you have 
four fewer hours a day! Take 10 minutes to answer this 
question: What would you want to cut?<P>

Use the same guidelines as the first exercise. Give 
in to your ideals and don't get too technical. This 
second exercise is difficult. It involves saying &quot;no&quot; 
to things -  something few of us are good at. But it 
is an essential complement to the first exercise. Time 
management is about making choices and there are only 
24 hours in a day. <P>

These two exercises can serve as a simple time management 
system. Do the exercises regularly and post them conspicuously. 
You'll be faced with things you would ideally like 
to add to your life and things you would like to cut 
-- an instant framework for making choices.<P>

Other self-discovery exercises are useful here: list 
20 things you like to do; describe what you would do 
in the next six months if you knew you were going to 
prison after that; design a &quot;business card&quot; 
to describe who you are. <P>

The key to success with these exercises is to incorporate 
them into a regular routine. Reflect regularly upon 
your life and then put the results where you can't 
miss them. Keep your ideals visible.<P>

PART III: COMMITMENTS MADE<P>

This is where traditional time management focuses, by 
assuming that our priorities are already set, or perhaps 
even set for us.If time management is a tool for reflection, 
just deepening our understanding of our true ideals 
and the results of our choices would work. Nevertheless, 
most of us need some tools to remind us of our commitments 
and to free our minds from worrying. I divide these 
tools into three categories: for working with tasks, 
for inner work, and for working with relationships.<P>

First, before we get intrigued by tickler files and 
to-do lists, we need to make a fundamental commitment: 
To improve our relationship with time, we must devote 
time to time management! The commitment doesn't have 
to be huge: 15 minutes each day, 45 minutes once a 
week, and an occasional longer period of introspection 
would be an excellent foundation for change. <P>

* <B>Task Tools - </B>These are the traditional physical accouterments 
of time management -- lists, file folders, notebooks, 
etc. To design our own systems, we need to be able 
to take apart the flow of tasks and activities that 
we face and make some sense of it all. <P>

Imagine a task to be a tangible thing. I use the metaphor 
of an airplane flight, with three parts: Take-Off, 
Holding-Pattern, and Landing. <P>

* Take-Off is the origin of a task -- where does it 
come from? Tasks are generated by such things as meetings, 
telephone calls, documents, plans, and your own mind. 
<P>

* Holding-Pattern is where a task goes before it gets 
done. <P>

* Landing is where a task goes to get done. This is 
where you make a commitment to do something on a particular 
day or time. This is where tasks get checked off. <P>

At take off, you need something with which to note the 
task's existence. I recommend using a single spiral 
notebook for every meeting, telephone call, and personal 
priority setting session. Mark it by date and you'll 
have a single place to look for every task that you 
might have identified. This tool is useless without 
a regular routine. You must regularly scan through 
the notebook and extract tasks for moving on to a holding 
pattern or landing.<P>

Where can a task go before it gets done? Two useful 
tools are the tickler file and the master list. A tickler 
file can be an organized way to put things off! Set 
up a file with 52 folders in it, one for every week 
of the next year. Every time you come across a task 
that can be safely ignored until some future date, 
drop a note (or the paper associated with that task) 
into the folder for the week you want to look at it. 
Of course, you must empty out the current file at the 
start of every week.<P>

A master list is a single long list for tasks not associated 
with a particular date. It's a kind of safety net; 
no matter what, a task that has been noted has some 
place to go. This is the place for all those good ideas 
that you haven't committed to, but don't want to forget. 
Again, you must have a regular routine to look at this 
list.<P>

Finally, for landing or actually completing the task 
any kind of calendar or to-do list is suitable, if 
it meets your unique needs. Only write things down 
you are planning on doing (use holding pattern tools 
to track tasks you're waiting to do later) and associate 
tasks, as much as possible, with a specific time that 
you'll do them. Make appointments with yourself that 
are just as important as appointments with others. 
<B><P>

* Inner Tools - </B>In our workshop we teach an array of 
inner tools designed to help people make effective 
commitments around time. My favorite is called One 
Thing.<P>

We lose focus easily. Our unfinished tasks call out 
to us in voices much louder than the task we are currently 
working on. <P>

Any time you feel yourself losing focus, ask yourself, 
&quot;What <I>one thing </I>am I working on right now?&quot; 
Fill your field of vision with only those items related 
to the thing you are working on at that moment. Try 
clearing your desk of reminders of other tasks.<B><P>

* Relational Tools</B> - Here's an example of a tool for 
developing your relational time management skills. 
It's called Saying No. We can only say &quot;yes&quot; 
to something by saying &quot;no&quot; to something 
else, but most of us have profound trouble saying &quot;no&quot; 
to people.<P>

One solution is to practice saying &quot;no.&quot; Practice 
in the shower, saying &quot;no&quot; over and over 
again in different ways, as though your mouth needs 
physical therapy. Practice ways of saying &quot;no&quot; 
that make you laugh, and try them out on trusted friends. 
Support others when they say &quot;no&quot; and compliment 
them loudly. <P>

MAKE A HABIT OF LEARNING:<P>

There are several things to remember as you work on 
changing your relationship with time: First, that it's 
a never-ending cycle of learning, and that cycle includes 
all three of the parts described above. Second, that 
these are tools for reflection, not control. Third, 
nothing changes until you get started. When you finish 
this article, make an appointment with yourself to 
do the Time Log, or any other exercise or tool that 
caught your interest. <P>

Finally, be willing to pay the price of change. Realize 
that you cannot do everything and that real life is 
about choices. Be willing to experience the short-term 
stress of learning and you will avoid the long-term 
stress of living a life that is untrue.<P>

<H1><CENTER>Beyond Ordinary Time</CENTER>
</H1>
<H4><CENTER><I>by Gay-wynn Cooper</I></CENTER>
</H4>
<BR>
<I>Creating a life in congruence with your deepest values is not easy and
cannot be done with the head alone. Ceremonies can help, especially as you
enter a period of transition, by drawing on your intuition, heart, and soul,
and by tapping the support of friends and family. </I>IC<I> assistant editor
Gay-wynn Cooper found self-designed ceremonies an important part of the
transitions she's made over the last 10 years.<BR>
<P><CENTER></I>&quot;When a question is posed ceremonially, <BR>
the universe responds.<I>&quot;</I></CENTER>
<P><I>
<P><CENTER>- Old Chinese proverb </I></CENTER>
<P><BR>
Ceremonies and celebrations have been with us throughout time, in all cultures.
They mark transitions - coming into the world, being given a name, getting
married, and dying, just to name a few. They also honor the changing of
the seasons in the Earth's life cycle. By taking time out of our ordinary
lives to participate in ceremonies, we open pathways to the collective unconscious
of humanity, the archetypes, the myths and the process of discovering our
unique selves.<BR>
<BR>
Self-designed ceremonies can help us focus our lives, become more intentional
about choices, and mark life transitions in a way that gives greater meaning
and richness to life. While many people find meaning in the rituals of their
religious or ethnic traditions, others are left unfulfilled by those experiences.
For such people, creating their own ceremonies may be more meaningful. <BR>
<BR>
Ceremonies don't have to be elaborate. For some, it's as simple as holding
hands for a moment before dinner or planting bulbs in the fall. The process
of ascribing intention to an action, paying deep attention, and at times
sharing the experience with others transforms a seemingly ordinary action
into the realm of the extra-ordinary, even the sacred. 
<H4><BR>
FINDING MEANING IN CEREMONY</H4>
I can no longer remember the first ritual that moved me, but a turning point
came when a friend invited my husband and me to participate in a different
kind of New Year's Eve celebration. Instead of the usual midnight alcoholic
toast, we would create a ceremony to welcome the new year. Our instructions
were to prepare by considering what had been meaningful for us in the present
year, what we wanted to let go of, and what we would desire for the new
year.<BR>
<BR>
On the 31st we gathered. Our only commonality was that we each knew the
hostess. We talked about why we had been drawn to the idea of celebrating
intentionally and how we were unsure about what a ceremony meant and what
we would be asked to do. As we talked and shared together we co-created
a ceremony that we enacted at midnight. <BR>
<BR>
Never had I experienced such a deeply moving sense of my connection to all
of humanity or felt such energy for bringing about the changes I wanted
for my life in the new year. I also felt a deep support for letting go of
an old belief that had dogged my steps for years. <BR>
<BR>
It was interesting to notice what happened for me in the new year. I had
a heightened awareness about the behaviors and attitudes associated with
my new year's &quot;resolutions.&quot; The ceremony had been a time out
from ordinary activities. It became a potent memory, a reminder that connected
me with the new action I had chosen and also with my deeper purpose for
selecting the action in the first place. <BR>
<BR>
I was no longer confined in the cage of &quot;Oh, I should ...&quot; Rather
the experience provoked a new response: &quot;Oh yes, this is what I choose;
I want to do this!&quot; <BR>
<BR>
During one part of the ceremony we each created on paper an expression of
the image of our new choice. I taped my image of change to my mirror; my
friends who had witnessed the choice became my supporters. Instead of a
feeling akin to dread, I felt empowered. Each time I chose the new action
I was connected to the deeper meaning of my life. I felt more whole.<BR>
<BR>
To our group's surprise, we began to see a number of events in our lives
as opportunities to go deeper and to connect with our greater intention.
We used ceremony to create this space. We did a ceremony of healing, forgiveness,
and courage for a woman facing the trial of a sexual abuse case in which
she was the victim. <BR>
<BR>
In the sacredness of the ceremonial circle she was able to tell her story
and be fully heard. Then we built a protective circle with our bodies to
symbolize the safety she now had, and we held her with love. It was an incredibly
painful journey for her. Being still new to this kind of intimate ceremony,
I was unprepared for the power of the experience. <BR>
<BR>
Several things about that experience stand out. One was how deeply I was
drawn into the shadow side of my own psyche, into the fear, the anger, and
the pain. I knew without a doubt how easily that could have been me as the
victim and, in a strange way, also as the abuser. <BR>
<BR>
I also remember feeling anxious at several points about whether the ceremony
was really such a good idea - whether it might make her feel more vulnerable
and separate. <BR>
<BR>
After we concluded the formal part of the ceremony and began sharing our
experiences, she reported that the concern and anxiety she had regarding
the trial had been replaced with strength and peacefulness. These weren't
just words; her peace could be seen in her body. Even more amazing was the
compassion in her heart where only anger had existed before. A transformation
had occurred far deeper than anything I could have imagined. <BR>
<BR>
This transformation touched me in a way I can only describe as spiritual.
I knew some power greater than all of us had been present, as we had requested
at the beginning of the ceremony. <BR>
<BR>
In the end there was no trial; the case was dismissed on a technicality.
For Carol it no longer mattered. She had clearly stated during the ceremony
that the purpose of the trial was to complete her own healing, and this
was indeed accomplished within the ceremony. 
<H4><BR>
RITUAL AS A PART OF LIFE</H4>
Other ceremonies followed. New circles involving varying combinations of
old and new people came together. I found myself exploring other cultures'
ceremonial ways, being particularly drawn to Native American culture and
my own Celtic roots. I began finding more of my own Self; my creativity
flowed, and life took on a new richness. <BR>
<BR>
Nevertheless, it seemed like a risky step when my husband and I began to
plan our own lives with self-designed ceremonies as an elemental part. Several
puzzle pieces began to coalesce - the attention to ceremony being one -
leading us into deeper introspection concerning what we wanted for our lives.
<BR>
<BR>
We worked together in a very people-centered dental practice. To the best
of our abilities, we were creating a holistic, supportive environment for
both the clients and our co-workers. By society's standards we were successful
at several levels. <BR>
<BR>
Despite our &quot;success,&quot; this was a time of intense change and great
soul searching for us. Ultimately we made a choice to more clearly live
our values by simplifying our lives. Our house, with pool and guest quarters,
seemed to symbolize our attachment to the material things of life. The ongoing
mortgage and maintenance was acting as a ball and chain, limiting our thoughts
of what could be possible for the future. <BR>
<BR>
So we decided to sell the house. The rightness of that decision was confirmed
as the house sold the first day it was on the market. This feeling of rightness,
however, did not fill the empty hole of sadness about leaving a beautiful
place. Taking matters in hand, we arranged a &quot;moving&quot; ceremony.<BR>
<BR>
When ceremony is to be used as a tool for creating intentional change in
your life, the planning process is often as important as the ceremony itself.
In preparation for the ceremony, my husband and I talked together about
what the house had meant to us. We discussed what we wanted for the future
and what values were motivating our change. We shared our fears, knowing
this was just a first step, and not knowing what would come next. It was
a wonderful, scary time, and we discovered much about ourselves and each
other through these talks.<BR>
<BR>
The key to the intention of the ceremony became clear. We wanted leaving
the house to symbolize our willingness to rethink our yardstick of success
and the movement into the unknown of a new lifestyle. At the same time we
wanted to honor the spirit of the house for all the joy we had known there.
<BR>
<BR>
Friends who had shared special times with us at this house joined us for
our ceremony. We shared memories of times that had been important to us;
we thanked the spirit of the house. We told the group about our reasons
for the move and about the changes we were making in our lives. We asked
for their support in our process of change and emphasized that the one thing
we did <I>not </I>want to change was our friendships. <BR>
<BR>
As we moved out of the house in darkness - to symbolize going into the darkness
of &quot;not knowing&quot; - we asked each of our friends to take a rock
from the yard and bring it with them to our new rental home. We created
a joyous musical procession through our new house, bringing light and blessings
with us. Everyone found a secret place to put a rock. We completed the evening
with a potluck dinner amid the unpacked boxes. <BR>
<BR>
At the end of the evening I felt complete. I had been able to shed the tears
that were inside me; I had felt supported in the change we were making;
I could see new possibilities as more real. Each day as I put things into
place I would find a rock sequestered away here and there and know my friends
would still be there for me. The whole time we were in the house the rocks
stayed in their chosen places. They reminded me continually of the change
I was making.
<H4><BR>
DOING IT YOURSELF!</H4>
Creating and taking part in your own ceremonies and rituals heightens the
experience. The authors of <I>Rituals for Our Times</I> agree:<BR>
<BR>
Our participation in this rich range of rituals enables us to make meaning
of our ever-changing lives. ... You will see how rituals help us to recognize
who we are and what we value and to come together in community to share
and acknowledge both the joy and pain of our existence.1<BR>
<BR>
With repeated ceremonies the framework becomes familiar. Even though each
ceremony is uniquely designed according to the intention to be expressed,
there is a pattern that can be followed and certain preparations are needed:<BR>
<UL>
  <LI><B>Planning: </B>The most important aspect of ceremony is to be clear
about your purpose. Try to state your intention simply and clearly. Even
spontaneous ceremonies require gathering your thoughts and possibly a ceremonial
item or two.<BR>
<BR>
Who or what will you ask for help, guidance, teaching, empowerment? What
quality or whose presence do you want to bring into your hearts? Many traditions
have formal invocations. These may be appropriate for you or give you guidance
in creating your own style. <BR>
<BR>
  <LI><B>People:</B> People are usually at the heart of any ceremony: those
whose transitions are being marked and others witnessing these changes.
Ask yourself, who is it important to invite and why. Consider ways of inviting
people so they will feel genuinely welcomed and comfortable. <BR>
<BR>
  <LI><B>Place:</B> Consider having the ceremony at a place that has special
significance to you. Whether the site is outdoors, in a public building,
or at your or a friend's home, make sure you can create the level of privacy
you need to avoid interruption. <BR>
<B><BR>
</B>
  <LI><B>Attire:</B> Celebrations and ceremony can be enhanced by attention
to what the participants wear. Elaborate costumes are not necessary; however,
wearing a special shawl, hat, or jewelry can heighten the awareness of the
special nature of the occasion.<BR>
<BR>
  <LI><B>Food:</B> Eating is one of the most common denominators of ceremonies,
although it is not essential. If a meal is the central activity of the celebration,
you could have a potluck at the beginning or end, or simply share a loaf
of bread.<BR>
<BR>
  <LI><B>Symbols:</B> Symbols may be either objects or actions. Some symbols
- like fire, water, and light - are universal; others may be associated
with a particular family or ethnic heritage; and still others are symbolic
because we choose to allow them to represent something important to us.
These can be objects like a rock collected from a favorite place, an animal
carving, or a drawing. <BR>
<BR>
Similarly, symbolic actions - burning objects, lighting candles, sharing
food - can have universal or ceremony-specific meaning. In either case,
sharing the meaning of symbols to be used in a ceremony helps everyone to
feel included.<BR>
<BR>
  <LI><B>The Ceremony:</B> As people arrive they need to feel welcome and
comfortable. Set the stage in order to mark the ceremony as a special time
outside of regular time. Be certain everyone understands what is to happen,
what symbols will be used, and what participation is expected. Address any
concerns before you begin.<BR>
<BR>
Start by performing some rite of purification or giving an opening invocation.
In your own way, you are calling in the sacred. Creating a circle, lighting
incense or a candle, building an altar, having a moment of silence, prayers
or group meditations, and processions are often used for this purpose.<BR>
<BR>
At the heart of the ceremony are the actions you choose to transform the
desired changes from your inner world to the outer world. These actions
seem to work best when different levels of participation are possible. For
instance, if there is to be a toast or blessing, someone may specially prepare
a presentation or poem, someone else might speak spontaneously, and yet
another might present a gift not requiring words.
</UL>
<BR>
Some suggested actions:<BR>
<UL>
  <LI>plant a seed, a tree<BR>
<BR>
  <LI>burn a photo, old shoes<BR>
<BR>
  <LI>cut a lock of hair<BR>
<BR>
  <LI>weave a web interconnecting the group with a ball of yarn<BR>
<BR>
  <LI>create a drawing, a clay sculpture, a collage of pictures from the
group<BR>
<BR>
  <LI>dance<BR>
<BR>
  <LI>share poems, tell or enact a story<BR>
<BR>
  <LI>have a heart talk or a council circle<BR>
<BR>
  <LI>make a mask<BR>
<BR>
  <LI>pray, meditate<BR>
<BR>
  <LI>have a procession<BR>
<BR>
  <LI>play musical instruments, drums, rattle, marimbas, flutes<BR>
<BR>
  <LI>give gifts.
</UL>
<BR>
Combine elements to fit the occasion. Make up other ideas. Draw on meaningful
ceremonies or objects from your own tradition if they work for you. The
possibilities are endless. <BR>
<BR>
At the end of the ceremony, an act of completion will give powerful thoughts,
feelings, and insights a form of closure. Often a song, a group hug, or
a few moments of silence is enough. Sometimes people leave directly following
this closure, but generally it is more meaningful to have a time of integration
- sitting in silence, writing in a journal, or sharing images or feelings.<BR>
<BR>
In beginning to add self-designed ceremonies to your life start with something
small. Keep it simple and plan ahead. Start in a safe place, possibly with
family, a couple of close friends, or by participating in a group that does
on-going ceremonies. <BR>
<BR>
Go for it, take a risk, have fun! Soon you'll find yourself noticing opportunities
for being more intentional about changes in your life. If you're like me,
you'll come into greater wholeness as a human being by giving voice to your
emotions, paying attention to your own changing nature, giving permission
to your body to enjoy greater freedom, and increasing the connection to
your spiritual nature.<B><BR>

<H1><CENTER>Embracing The Unknown</CENTER>
</H1>
<H4><CENTER><I>by Bernard Theroux</I></CENTER>
</H4>
<BR>
There are a lot of people trying to make sense out of their work lives these
days. Many of them are feeling called to be of service to the world in a
wide variety of fields. But they often find themselves competing with each
other for a shrinking pool of jobs that often won't allow them to implement
their new ideas anyway. So along with unemployment, we also are facing what
I call a creativity crisis in which there are a lot of people all dressed
up but with no where to go. <BR>
<BR>
What this looks like in real life is the school teacher who is burned out
with his or her inability to incorporate creative teaching strategies in
an old, established school system. Or the nurse, who loves nursing, but
is going crazy because the hospital system forces her to promote an approach
to healing that she finds inappropriate.<BR>
<BR>
As part of my work as a career counselor, I frequently meet people caught
up in this crisis. They come from all fields. Many are confused about how
to plug in, they can't see the outlet for their talents. <BR>
<BR>
If I may play with a slightly romantic model to describe what's occurring
at this time, I'd like to suggest that many people are being called to begin
making the changes required to move on with their life's purpose. Change
needs to occur in all arenas of life. Life itself is coordinating this change,
and that powerful tug you may feel to use your talents in a more effective
way, is Life giving you a sign that you are on deck.<BR>
<BR>
Imagine that the people of the Earth form part of the global immune system.
Various clusters of cells (people) throughout the system have certain functions
that serve the system as a whole. There is now a need for new forms of response,
and the signals are being sent out to the various cells. You, as a member
of this system, have your special function - your vocation - although the
next steps in following that calling may not yet be clear.<BR>
<BR>
While I was working as a career counselor in 1989, I was struggling with
my own, &quot;What do I want to be when I grow up?&quot; type of questions.
I knew well the depth of despair associated with this issue.<BR>
<BR>
That was the year, however, when I came to understand that there are cycles
of indeterminate length during which a person would not be able to know
what they were supposed to do. I myself was in such a cycle. It was not
the same as being confused or baffled by options; it was more like having
a thick, heavy blanket thrown over me. In my case, when I would look ahead,
I saw nothing, yet I knew the darkness was not empty. I now believe that
this cycle is an incubation period that allows us to mature enough to be
able to handle the responsibilities of that next step.<BR>
<BR>
As I related to this state in myself and observed it in some of the people
I was counseling, I realized that there was something sacred about this
darkness of the unknown. I felt that even if I could shine an artificial
light upon my inner sanctum, I would only disturb the seed that was germinating
there. The darkness was giving birth to something that could not be viewed
from the outside.<BR>
<BR>
Recently, Mary, an oncology nurse, shared a dream with me. She saw herself
covered with a dark gray cloak; only her feet protruded at the bottom, and
they were plastic-like and lifeless. She said the dream symbolized her inability
to see where she should go with her life and work. <BR>
<BR>
Although Mary had long worked with people who were dying, her patient load
did not allow her to spend time really getting to know the people she cared
for. She wanted to find a way to work that would allow her to have more
opportunities to connect deeply with the people she served. Mary did have
a sense of what she wanted, but the critical details of how her next step
would unfold were hidden.
<H4><BR>
MAKING PEACE WITH THE DARKNESS</H4>
Sometimes, when I meet with a group of people who are exploring these issues,
we sit quietly for a while, relaxing into the present moment. We relax our
foreheads, and allow our eyes to soften. We let our jaws sag and relax.
We breath deep into our bellies, and with the exhaled breath we let go of
our tension. As we settle into the moment we simply acknowledge the presence
of peace. We let that peace deepen, and the stillness becomes deeper and
deeper. There is so much pleasure and gratitude in contacting this ever-present
peace, that it is natural to want to share it.<BR>
<BR>
We each think of someone in our life whom we care about. We picture them
breathing easily and relaxing into this same peace. We then bring our attention
back to our own bodies and the room we're in, slowly open our eyes, and
there we are. <BR>
<BR>
Though I do believe in the value of linear approaches to problem solving
and goal setting, I have seen as much, if not more value, come from exercises
like the one above. The energy of the group changes, and there is a distinct
new potential available. <BR>
<BR>
A kind of knowing emerges when we let go of our hold on ourselves and open
to a space in which we can once again be surprised. <BR>
<BR>
The list of things that can help a person to open are endless and individual.
Listen to music, go for a walk, cry, sing, suffer, watch a movie, meditate,
pray, read, it goes on and on. A holistic clarity can emerge from this open
heart space that reflects a different kind of knowing. <BR>
<BR>
One year ago I quit my counseling job and began to devote my full attention
to teaching workshops and consulting with people to explore new ways of
understanding our relationship with work and our times. Every month I have
taken money from savings to keep the operation afloat. At this writing I
have nearly tapped out my financial reserves. I am meeting wonderful people,
and I find the workshops tremendously inspiring. More importantly, though,
the year has deepened my faith in the goodness inherent in life, even though
it has been one of my most difficult years ever. <BR>
<BR>
So, what will happen to me next? And what will Mary do? How does an improvisational
musician or dancer know what the next note or gesture will be? Does he or
she choose the next bit of expression or does it emerge from the creative
web of life itself? I am not proposing carelessness; after all, you don't
play <I>improv </I>without some foundation of skill. I am, however, pointing
to the inevitability of assuming risk. I find that in those moments when
I can relax my need to know what will happen next that I become sensitive
to this enormous web of influence. 
<H4><BR>
CO-CREATING LIFE</H4>
If you feel a passionate calling, but feel confused and stuck, have faith.
Embrace the unknown; take time for simple rituals that help restore your
faith and peace of mind. <BR>
<BR>
You may be personally experiencing the pain of loss or simply the raw fear
of an uncertain future. If this pain and fear can serve the purpose of opening
our hearts, then it will not have been suffered in vain. To allow our hearts
to open is an utterly practical act, for it allows us to feel that we are
not just acting as puny individuals. We are co-creators in the great web
of life.<BR>

<H1><CENTER>New Work, New Culture</CENTER>
</H1>
<H4><CENTER><I>An interview with Frithjof Bergmann, by Sarah van Gelder</I></CENTER>
</H4>
<BR>
<I>According to philosopher and community catalyst Frithjof Bergmann, we
are less free than we think, surrounded as we are by endless trivial choices.
We will only really be free when we have the option of doing things with
our lives that we care deeply about.<BR>
<BR>
The current job crisis, in which thousands find themselves unable to work
in their fields, is forcing many people to reconsider what they want to
do with their lives. Frithjof Bergmann started New Work to encourage that
exploration at the deepest levels and to teach the skills that will enable
people to make their dreams a reality. If many people were empowered to
make these kinds of choices, the ripple effects would be felt throughout
the culture.<BR>
<BR>
Frithjof Bergmann has worked with individuals and communities in the US,
Canada, and Germany on developing positive strategies for dealing with the
changing nature of work. He is also a professor of philosophy at the University
of Michigan, author of </I>On Being Free <I>(University of Notre Dame Press,
1988) and founder of the Center for New Work., 2200 Fuller Road, Suite 1204B,
Ann Arbor, MI 48105. <BR>
<BR>
</I><B>Sarah: </B><I>Can you tell me how the idea of New Work got started?<BR>
<BR>
</I><B>Frithjof:</B><I> </I>General Motors had announced that they would
automate in an extraordinarily thorough fashion the plant in Flint. We opened
the Center for New Work there in 1984, and the first major proposal we advanced
was that, instead of splitting Flint - half of it becoming unemployed and
the other half of it working overtime - why not let everyone work six months
in the factories? During the other six months, make it possible for the
workers to do something that they passionately wanted to do. <BR>
<BR>
This was our first opportunity to work with unions and management to see
if the idea of New Work could be turned into practice. While we weren't
able to do all we had hoped to do, we did speak to thousands of people individually
to help them discover what they seriously wanted to do. In the end, some
started small business, some went back to school, some decided they wanted
more time with their children. In one case, a woman came to realize how
much she enjoyed working with wood and went on to become a carpenter.<B><BR>
<BR>
Sarah:</B><I> How do you define New Work? </I><B><BR>
<BR>
Frithjof: </B>There are two answers: New Work represents the effort to redirect
the use of technology so that it isn't used simply to speed up the work
and in the process ruin the world - turning rivers into sewers and rain
into acid. <BR>
<BR>
The purpose of technology should be to reduce the oppressive, spirit-breaking,
dementing power of work - to use machines to do the work that is boring
and repetitive. Then human beings can do the creative, imaginative, uplifting
work. <BR>
<BR>
So New Work is simply the attempt to allow people, for at least some of
their time, to do something they passionately want to do, something they
deeply believe in.<BR>
<BR>
The other definition comes from the editorial page of <I>The New York Times:</I>
&quot;The way Americans work has to be rethought from the ground up.&quot;
We need a wholesale, integrated, organic, new construction of work, with
new instruments to make up for the shortage of jobs and to assist in the
redistribution of wealth. <B><BR>
<BR>
Sarah: </B><I>That's a pretty tall order!</I><B><BR>
<BR>
Frithjof: </B>Most people assume that the job system we have today has existed
since the Stone Age, and that it is therefore unthinkable that we could
suddenly run out of jobs. But our job system is actually only 200 years
old! <BR>
<BR>
The current job system is based on the idea that jobs redistribute wealth:
capitalists made profits, the profit was distributed when workers got paid,
and the workers again helped the capitalists to amass wealth. So it was
like rain: the profits rose to the top, but then they came down like rain
in the form of wages. <BR>
<BR>
This is now no longer the case in the same way as it was before. It is very
possible now for people to make very large sums of money without employing
anybody, either by buying whole companies in leveraged buy-outs and piecing
them out like a butchered cow, or by having factories that employ very,
very few people. <BR>
<BR>
One of the really frightful aspects of this situation is that we have something
like a third of the population working at an utterly insane pace, and on
the other side, close to half of the population is obviously underemployed.
It's crazy. <B><BR>
<BR>
Sarah:</B><I> What you're talking about goes way beyond the traditional
progressive goals of &quot;full employment.&quot; You're talking about making
work itself a wonderful meaningful experience.</I><B><BR>
<BR>
Frithjof: </B>Not only should wonderful things occur in work, but maybe
I would even put it more provocatively and say that the very best things
occur <I>only </I>in work! As examples, I'd start with people like Toni
Morrison or Martha Graham or Einstein of course, or Stravinsky, or any number
of other people, who, at 90 were still wonderfully vital and intense and
clearly performing their work with an astounding capacity.<BR>
<BR>
When one is working in a similar way to these people, it's quite common
to feel that people neglect even their intimate relationships and their
children precisely because their work is so fascinating, so absorbing, so
consuming, and so exciting; now this is what work can be at its best.<B><BR>
<BR>
Sarah:</B><I> The examples you mentioned are of people who have excelled
at the very top of their fields, and in many cases these are very creative
fields. Can work be as exciting for people who have more ordinary types
of jobs?</I><B><BR>
<BR>
Frithjof: </B>My example of course is elitist, and intentionally so, almost
to the point of wanting to irritate people so that one can then ask, &quot;How
does work become like that for everybody?&quot; <BR>
<BR>
In the great floods in Iowa this fall, there were descriptions of people
who worked with an amazing intensity all night long, lugging sandbags, in
order to stop the Mississippi and protect this or that village. This shows
that a very repetitive task, a very humble task, namely lugging sandbags
around, can become work that people do with the same enthusiasm with which
Kepler worked on his Laws - if the context is right.<B><BR>
<BR>
Sarah:</B><I> What is it that creates that level of enthusiasm?</I><B><BR>
<BR>
Frithjof: </B>Purpose is the decisive criteria. If you feel that the work
you do serves some powerful, interesting, and inspiring purpose, then it
becomes quite easy to do. <BR>
<BR>
For many car workers, for example, what makes their work a kind of affliction
is precisely that they experience it as so utterly pointless, or even worse,
as doing something that is adding to a disease. The cars they are making
are not of first-rate quality, the exhaust will poison the air, and there
is a sense that people don't really need the cars - all of that has much
more to do with making work painful than the sheer monotony of it. <BR>
<BR>
One of the most exhilarating experiences of my life was to come to the realization
that if you persist in asking people what they really want, and if you create
real alternatives, people choose to do work that helps other people, that
makes a contribution. <BR>
<BR>
The fact that people, when given a choice, want to do work with a purpose
represents a source of social energy that is the equivalent of the steam
engine. You can rethink the economy and much else about our culture if that
turns out to be true.<B><BR>
<BR>
Sarah:</B><I> What changes will be needed to get us to the point where people
could do the work they feel passionate about?</I><B><BR>
<BR>
Frithjof: </B>First, I prefer to think in evolutionary terms. Although automation
and the elimination of labor have taken on epidemic proportions, I don't
think that jobs will end. Instead, the present job structure will slowly
contract as a new structure and a new culture will gradually emerge. <BR>
<BR>
Given that, the first major step toward a New Work culture is for people
to become what we call intelligently self-providing. This approach harks
back to the sense of independence and self-reliance that was typical of
farmers, but with important differences. <BR>
<BR>
The old way of being self-providing involved back-breaking work. Actually,
the idea of high-tech self-providing grew out of my own experience growing
all of my own food and living virtually without cash. I realized that was
not what I wanted, although sometimes I think if I had had a chain saw,
I would never have gone back to teaching.<BR>
<BR>
An example of the idea of <I>high-tech</I> self-providing is that you participate
in the building of your apartment house. <BR>
<BR>
There are quite a good number of projects that I am associated with, particularly
in Detroit, in which welfare mothers, inner-city African-Americans, and
any number of people contribute their labor to upgrading and maintaining
the apartment houses in which they live. There are different arrangements,
but the upshot is that people put a certain amount of sweat equity into
the houses and in return they get part ownership.<BR>
<BR>
Along those lines, one of the ideas I've made into a kind of a symbol is
roof gardens. There is no excuse whatever for not having each roof in a
large city be a gorgeous, sumptuous garden with trees and flowers and berries
and fruit. The air would improve, and food would be more immediately available.
<B><BR>
<BR>
Sarah:</B><I> What else is different about the self-providing you're describing
compared with what we normally think of as self-reliance?<BR>
</I><B><BR>
Frithjof: </B>We are teaching the skills people need to function in modern
society - for example, how to do your shopping in a high-tech, intelligent
way. <BR>
<BR>
We envision a counseling environment in which people would be asked to stop
and think about their buying habits. Do you really want this? Are you just
buying that because you've been hypnotized into wanting that, or are you
buying it out of frustration? <BR>
<BR>
My experience working 10 years with auto workers is that they get so frustrated
in their jobs that once every four months, in a rage, they go off to the
nearest mall and fill up their pick-up truck with anything they can find.<BR>
<BR>
For the things people really do want to buy, we want to offer an opportunity
for someone sitting at a computer with minimal computer skills to be able
to answer questions about where one can buy cheaper split peas, or a couch,
or a tricycle. <BR>
<BR>
And, we are working on ways of transporting people to those cheap sources
of goods. <B><BR>
<BR>
Sarah:</B><I> You're working on alternative modes of transportation as well?</I><B><BR>
<BR>
Frithjof: </B>Yes. I participated in an endeavor in Kassel, Germany, in
which a group of people together used a fleet of very diverse vehicles from
trucks to small electric cars to motorcycles. When someone wanted to use
a vehicle, he or she would schedule it via electronic mail. <BR>
<BR>
I'm also very interested in automobiles with alternative energy sources.
What many people aren't aware of is that electric cars could be an example
of self-providing. One could make one's own electricity on one's rooftop.
<BR>
<BR>
That helps to spell out what we are thinking of as intelligent self-providing:
technology, properly used, could make people extraordinarily independent.
<B><BR>
<BR>
Sarah:</B><I> So if someone is that independent, then when they work, they
work out of choice.</I><B><BR>
<BR>
Frithjof: </B>That's part of it. It makes all the difference in the world
to feel that one is not chained to the money economy. Many people get ulcers,
even if they have a reasonably good income, because they feel perpetually
threatened. The only way not to feel threatened is to feel that, if need
be, you can make it on your own. <B><BR>
<BR>
Sarah:</B><I> What would it take for New Work to become a reality?</I><B><BR>
<BR>
Frithjof: </B>There are several parts to this. One thing we're actively
working on is to make the connection between the talent and the information
that's available in universities and the need to expand entrepreneurship
in a city context. We want to get away from bake-sale entrepreneurship.
Instead, we want to get people who have ideas to put those ideas into the
service of new city-based businesses that could then be cutting edge and
world class. <BR>
<BR>
Second, foundations could be more accessible, more dispersed and local,
so there's one every few blocks where people could present their ideas and
get funded. <BR>
<BR>
We now have very expensive programs that try to address the extremes of
human misery: from welfare programs to job training programs. We could do
much better simply by making it possible for people who urgently and often
quite desperately want to do something for their own communities, to do
it! We could get the jobs that need doing done much cheaper and on a scale
that we so far haven't even imagined. <BR>
<BR>
A third area is to help people individually to discover what it is that
they really want to do and then to help them to get their project financed.
Many people need support for that because they often don't know what they
want to do. <BR>
<BR>
Restructuring institutions is not enough. The wonderful thing that technology
could do for us is to liberate enough human energy so that we could work
with each other on an individual basis and not just an institutional basis.
<B><BR>
<BR>
Sarah:</B><I> Where would the money come from for all this?</I><B><BR>
<BR>
Frithjof: </B>One source is to insist that, when layoffs occur, money be
provided by the union and by the company cooperatively to make New Work
possible for those who lose their jobs. The money could be used to help
workers to start up businesses, for stipends, fellowships, training, all
manner of things. <BR>
<BR>
As it is, the money is a kind of war chest; it's blown on the battle between
the workers who want to hang on to their jobs and the company who wants
to get rid of them. <BR>
<BR>
The other way to pay for this type of New Work is through a gradual movement
towards a more equitable system of pay in which people are paid in accordance
with their contribution. <B><BR>
<BR>
Sarah:</B><I> Why have you chosen to do so much work with young people?</I><B><BR>
<BR>
Frithjof: </B>It was a conscious decision, growing out of my work with the
town of Kenosha, Wisconsin, where a plant closed. I came to realize that
car workers with 20 years seniority, even if they are laid off, are in incomparably
better positions than 18-year-olds who have never done any work and for
whom no work is available. <BR>
<BR>
We have now reached a point where a whole generation will grow up and find
the door shut in their faces. I feel a horrible sense of anguish and rage
about that. <BR>
<BR>
My sense of it is that we face the prospect of a rapid increase in violence
and terrorism - of which we already have plenty - that could easily escalate
toward permanent guerrilla warfare or even toward some sort of apocalyptic
war between rich and poor.<B><BR>
<BR>
Sarah:</B><I> What can New Work offer to these young people?</I><B><BR>
<BR>
Frithjof: </B>I feel that it is urgent for young people to recognize that
there is an alternative to unemployment; that we needn't be victims of a
malfunctioning job system; that we can create together an alternative work
construction.<B><BR>
<BR>
Sarah:</B><I> You've mentioned a number of areas in which your approach
and your concerns overlap those of environmentalists. But I gather there
are also some areas of difference.</I><B><BR>
<BR>
Frithjof: </B>I feel that the environmental movement is in retreat, in part
because there is frequently an impasse between the desire to, for example,
save certain trees and the need people have for the work of cutting them
down. <BR>
<BR>
You have to come to terms with the fact that jobs have become precious to
the point where people will fight for them. If you're a serious environmentalist,
you've got to do something about work. <BR>
<BR>
I've worked with lumberjacks, and usually it turns out that there are things
that they would rather do than cut down trees. Once one has discovered that
- and it takes patience and it takes time - then one can make efforts to
find those alternative sorts of work and to make them pay.<BR>
<BR>
If New Work becomes a reality, the engine that drives us into the destruction
of nature could finally be throttled and made to stop. Otherwise, as the
job crisis intensifies, the animosity towards ecological thinking will increase.
We think that all other efforts short of the complete re-construction of
work are, frankly, futile. <B><BR>
<BR>
Sarah:</B><I> Your work implies a broad cultural shift, not only a change
in work. Can you describe the changes you see emerging in a New Work culture?</I><B><BR>
<BR>
Frithjof: </B>A far greater number of people would be working at more creative,
more inventive, more autonomous work in every respect. We would bring in
technology wherever it's intelligent, economical, and sustainable in order
to free up people to do more inventive work. <BR>
<BR>
This would, we think, result in abundance. We are close to abundance now,
but keep fighting it because abundance threatens the job system. If we weren't
worried about jobs, we could automate all sorts of production and all sorts
of services; goods could become phenomenally inexpensive. <BR>
<BR>
The consumer frenzy would pale and lose its force and its addictive power,
and some kind of calm and dignity would return. If you have a chance to
do something you really want to do, that already has some effect. But if
you have learned to decide what you really want, then you don't get onto
this treadmill where you work at something you hate in order to buy something
you loathe! <BR>
<BR>
Right now, so much social energy is tied up in an unnecessary way. If all
that energy were freed, we could address the mega-social and ecological
problems, from poverty to AIDS to education to race and gender. <BR>
<BR>
There's an African proverb that says, &quot;It takes a whole tribe to educate
a single child.&quot; We could have a situation in which, from the time
you are five weeks old until you died, you could be accompanied by a hive
of mentors, by people who understand you, and people who talk to you. The
result would be a culture that is more humane, vastly more intelligent,
more cheerful, more sensuous, and more flamboyant.<BR>

<H2><CENTER>What's Happening With New Work?</CENTER>
</H2>
<BR>
Frithjof Bergmann's New Work approach is being tried in towns and cities
ranging from the former East German town of Muehlhausen to inner-city Detroit,
to Vancouver, British Columbia. <BR>
<BR>
At the moment, Detroit is a major center of activity for advocates of New
Work. From January 17th through 31st, WTVS, the Detroit public television
station, is airing a series of documentaries and forums on work options.
Frithjof was a chief consultant for the series and appears in a number of
the segments.<BR>
<BR>
Next, WTVS, in conjunction with Frithjof and other New Work advocates, will
produce a video-print curriculum to be distributed in high schools throughout
Michigan. The curriculum is aimed at helping young people prepare for the
work crisis by developing resourcefulness, entrepreneurship, self-providing
skills, and a capacity to look for their own calling. The curriculum - including
video segments - should be completed by spring. <BR>
<BR>
Other plans call for the creation of a center for New Work at a Detroit
inner-city high school. The nuts and bolts of New Work and self-providing
will be taught in a dome, which the students will help to build. <BR>
<BR>
The group is also linking up with Detroit churches and community groups
to give the kids a role in helping their community while further developing
their skills.<BR>
<BR>
In British Columbia, meanwhile, a group called New Work Associates has been
giving workshops on New Work for some years. The group has developed a study
guide based on Frithjof's approach and is working on translating the concepts
into comic book form. <BR>
<BR>
For more information on the Detroit projects and the videos contact Fritz
Williams at RD1 Box 920, Shermans Dale, PA 17090 or WTVS 7441 2nd Blvd.,
Detroit, MI 48202. Contact Anne Ironside of the New Work Associates at RR
1 U-30, Bowen Island, British Columbia, Canada, V0N IG0, for more information

<H1><CENTER>Measuring Sustainability</CENTER>
</H1>
<H4><CENTER><I>by Alan AtKisson</I></CENTER>
</H4>
<BR>
What do wild salmon runs, juvenile crime rates, and employment levels at
the world's largest airplane manufacturer have in common? As any good systems
thinker knows, the answer is &quot;everything.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
More specifically, all three are indicators - measurements of the health
of larger systems - and they are part of a report recently completed by
Sustainable Seattle, a volunteer &quot;civic forum&quot; comprised of citizens
from business, government, environmental groups, and many other sectors
of the Seattle community.<BR>
<BR>
The report, entitled 1993 Indicators of Sustainable Community examines 20
key trends over the past two decades to create a snapshot of the Seattle
area's &quot;long-term cultural, economic, and environmental health and
vitality&quot; - which is how the group defines sustainability. <BR>
<BR>
The product of nearly three years of work involving over 200 people, the
indicators were designed to answer two questions: What would a sustainable
Seattle look like? And how can we measure our progress toward that goal?<BR>
<BR>
Using indicators to measure trends in larger systems is nothing new. Two
familiar examples are the Dow Jones Industrial Average, in which 30 &quot;blue
chip&quot; stocks indicate the health of the stock market as a whole, and
the northern spotted owl, an &quot;indicator species&quot; that signals
the health of old growth forest ecosystems. <BR>
<BR>
But Sustainable Seattle, inspired by related efforts at measuring quality
of life in Jacksonville and in Oregon, and by theorists like Hazel Henderson
and Herman Daly, has taken the idea two steps further. First, it focuses
on sustainability (as opposed to quality of life); and second, it examines
the linkages between indicators and the systems they represent.<BR>
<BR>
For example, wild salmon runs are an indicator of water quality and the
health of riparian ecosystems (in addition to being intrinsically, symbolically,
and economically valuable). Salmon are also affected by electrical power
use and water consumption. Changes in the runs affects tourism and the seafood
industry. Looking at linkages expands our understanding of the reason for
a salmon run's decline and the benefits of working to maintain it.<BR>
<BR>
Salmon runs in the Seattle area are in sharp decline and in danger of extinction.
That fact not only rings environmental and economic alarm bells; it could
also reflect our cultural attitude toward living systems. Ultimately, what's
happening to Seattle's salmon may not differ that much from what's happening
to Seattle's children. Our next generation - the focus of several important
indicators - are experiencing higher levels of childhood poverty, low birthweight,
and juvenile crime. As Kentucky writer Wendell Berry notes, &quot;There
is an uncanny resemblance between our behavior toward each other and our
behavior toward the Earth.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
But not all of Sustainable Seattle's first 20 indicators (out of a projected
set of 40) bring bad news. The job market, for example, is not as dependent
on the Boeing Company and other top-ten employers as it used to be. Over
the past decade, jobs have been spreading among a more diverse set of enterprises,
creating a more resilient economic base. And the hours of paid work at the
average wage required to meet basic needs like rent, food, and clothing
has remained remarkably stable.<BR>
<BR>
Other indicators bring still more surprises. Air quality, which most citizens
would guess has been declining, has actually improved by 65 percent over
the decade. On the other hand, Seattle/King County residents are discarding
ever increasing amounts of garbage, at rates that almost outstrip the growth
in our famed recycling programs.<BR>
<BR>
Overall, the indicators show Seattle to be a city moving away from sustainability.
But measuring progress is, of course, not the same as making it. Sustainable
Seattle is using the indicators to call attention to long-term trends, and
volunteers are now designing an ambitious array of efforts to turn these
trends in the right direction and encourage citizens and policy-makers to
help make sustainability a reality.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Things have their due measure,&quot; wrote the Roman poet Horace some
2,000 years ago. &quot;There are ultimately fixed limits, beyond which,
or short of which, something must be wrong.&quot; Horace lived in an imperial
city that ignored those limits, leading to its decline and fall. We in Sustainable
Seattle are working to ensure that our city stays healthy - indeed, keeps
getting better - for a long, long time.<I><BR>

Sustainable Seattle was initiated by IN CONTEXT and Metro Center YMCA. Its
44-page report, </I>1993 Indicators of Sustainable Community<I>, is available
for $10 from Metrocenter YMCA, 909 4th Ave., Seattle, WA 98103.<BR>

mental pollution of advertising. We doubt, we laugh, we turn off. The advertisers
counter with brighter colors, louder noises, wilder images. We close down
our senses.<BR>
<BR>
Eastern Europeans had no chance to harden up before their ideological wall
fell and multinational advertisers rolled over their borders. Almost overnight,
intrusive ads sprouted everywhere. A tram line in Budapest was painted pink
and dubbed the &quot;Barbie Line.&quot; Barges began to chug back and forth
on the Danube, smack in the middle of the most scenic views of the city,
dragging chains of floating billboards.<BR>
<BR>
If you aren't toughened against that kind of hype, it can make you furious.<BR>
<BR>
So activists in Budapest bicycle around every night spray-painting billboards.
According to the InterPress Service, about 20 percent of the cigarette ads
in the city are scrawled with the word &quot;Cancer.&quot; Other ads are
covered with graffiti saying &quot;Don't be fooled,&quot; or &quot;All ads
lie.&quot; McDonald's posters are hit with a pre-printed, glued-on banner
reading &quot;Filth of the West.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
The young people responsible for this desecration call their group Anti-Ad
Action. They say that advertisements &quot;subtly brainwash you&quot; and
&quot;encourage consumerism and, as a consequence, pollution.&quot; Their
sprayed-on or glued-on commentary includes an address, so volunteers can
join them.<BR>
<BR>
Last February in the Czech Republic, 6,628 schools received a colorful leaflet
announcing a competition with the name: &quot;School and Computer - the
Basis of Life.&quot; The leaflet was from Procter &amp; Gamble, which organized
the competition in cooperation with Apple computers, under the patronage
of the Ministry of Education.<BR>
<BR>
For a school to enter, each student must collect at least 10 coupons from
P&amp;G products. The 20 schools collecting the most coupons per student
would each receive five Apple computers.<BR>
<BR>
Milan Caha, of the National Center for Environmental Education in Prague,
calculates that to participate, every student would have to buy on average
900 Czech crowns (Kc) of P&amp;G products. If all schools participated,
P&amp;G would gross at least 3 billion Kc, about 600 times the retail value
of the prize computers.<BR>
<BR>
A good, old-fashioned corporate scam, I thought, when I heard about it.
But the National Center for Environmental Education, along with other environmental
organizations, was less tolerant. It published an open letter to the Minister
of Education. It is immoral to use the schools to promote products not related
in any way to education, it said. It is even more immoral for the ministry
to promote the idea of consumption as the way to success.<BR>
<BR>
The Ministry of Education replied, after a long delay, to affirm its support
of the competition. Procter &amp; Gamble replied instantly. The company
published a defense of its project and invited the environmentalists to
its Prague office for a &quot;discussion.&quot; In the meeting, Caha tells
me, they were offered both carrots and sticks: &quot;Couldn't your organization
use a small contribution?&quot; and &quot;You'd better get some good lawyers.&quot;
A fax war followed. It continued, without producing any agreement, until
the end of the school year.<BR>
<BR>
Meanwhile, the National Center for Environmental Education approached the
schools with an alternative competition, entitled &quot;Less Consumption
- Chance for Life.&quot; It suggested that teachers and students organize
discussions about advertising, consumption, and environmental protection,
and that they send their conclusions to the school management, parents,
the Ministry of Education, and P&amp;G, with copies to the National Center.<BR>
<BR>
P&amp;G never announced how many schools entered its competition, or who
won. The National Center received letters from 62 schools.<BR>
<BR>
Two teachers in Bezno reported: &quot;We distributed materials about both
competitions and let the students decide which competition to enter. Not
one of our 176 students chose to participate in the competition promoting
high consumption of the harmful products of P&amp;G.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
A sixth-grade class from Hradec Kralove said: &quot;Our class decided not
to participate in the P&amp;G competition. We don't like polluted water,
sea, and air. We don't like that the forest around our town is dying. We
would like to contribute to saving the Earth.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
A teacher from Postolprty wrote to P&amp;G: &quot;We are sorry for your
underestimation of the work and attitudes of teachers. The P&amp;G leaflet,
which came to our school, went directly into the box for used paper. Do
you really think we are ignorant of environmental education?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
It's not easy to be a sophisticated modern consumer, but we're sending our
experts over there. They'll learn.<I><BR>

<H1><CENTER>Tree-Free Paper</CENTER>
</H1>
<H4><CENTER><I>by Lori Weston</I></CENTER>
</H4>
<BR>
With demand for paper expected to double by 2010 and the attendant impact
on the world's forests, the search is beginning for alternative sources
of paper pulp. <BR>
<BR>
The use of trees for paper is a relatively recent phenomenon. Until the
mid-19th century, cotton, hemp, straw, and other fibers were used in paper
making. <BR>
<BR>
Now, because of deforestation and the high cost of wood pulp, a number of
countries are turning back to other sources of fiber. In 1992, 45 countries
produced tree-less paper, accounting for 9 percent of the world's paper
supply. Studies have found that these plant-fiber processes are significantly
less expensive than wood-pulp paper making.<BR>
<BR>
The primary alternatives currently used in the US are hemp and kenaf (rhymes
with giraffe) plant fibers. Kenaf grows well in areas where cotton or tobacco
are cultivated. Hemp is prolific in both temperate and tropical climates.
Both grow exceedingly fast, producing a full grown plant from seed in 5-6
months, and are naturally disease-resistant. They are nitrogen fixers, and
work well in a crop rotation. Both plants produce fibers that far exceed
tree fibers in length and strength. As a result, these papers can go through
the recycling process many more times than wood-based paper without losing
quality. Hemp and kenaf papers both have a natural whiteness which can be
enhanced by hydrogen peroxide rather than chlorine bleach. <BR>
<BR>
The drawback to using kenaf, hemp and other agricultural by-products is
that they must be stored and transported seasonally, unlike wood, which
is available year round. Also, the moisture content of hemp and kenaf is
much higher than wood, and special drying systems must be developed in order
to prevent spoilage. This problem has been successfully addressed in China,
where concrete drying racks have been created for this purpose. <BR>
<BR>
It is still unclear whether tree-free paper in its current state will meet
the highest production printing standards. Hopeful indications include the
successful printing of a section of the Earth Island Journal's Summer 1993
issue on kenaf paper. Also, the US Department of Agriculture is beginning
to use kenaf paper.<BR>
<BR>
Tree-free paper is just becoming available to the North American consumer.
Kinko's Copies is exploring the viability of paper that is 50 percent hemp
and 50 percent straw. Meanwhile, you can buy a ream of kenaf paper for $14.00
from the Greenpeace Catalog, 800/916-1616, or choose from a selection of
kenaf and hemp papers from the Earthcare Paper Company, 800/347-0700. <I><BR>
<BR>
This article was based on interviews with Thomas Rhymsza, owner of KP Products;
Dave Seberg, president of C &amp; S Building Supply; Paul Stanford, owner
of Tree-free Eco Paper, and David Hackett, environmental buyer for Kinko's
USA, and information from &quot;Journal Pioneers Tree-Free Paper&quot; by
Gar Smith in Earth Island Journal, Summer 1993; &quot;Making Paper Without
Trees&quot; by Ed Ayres in World Watch, Vol. 6, No. 5.</I><BR>

<BR>
In Bangladesh, the Grameen Bank has proven that the 
poor are the best suited to assess their own needs 
and to assist in overcoming their own poverty. The 
Grameen Bank lends small amounts of money to very poor 
people while small groups of borrowers meet regularly 
to provide support and encouragment. <P>

The success of the Grameen Bank lending program has 
set development experts thinking that perhaps the model 
could be replicated on a regional scale large enough 
to make an impact on the estimated 800 million poor 
in Asia-Pacific. <P>

In 1991, Grameen adherents founded Cashpor (the Asia-Pacific 
network for credit and savings for the hardcore poor) 
to help in opening Grameen-type programs throughout 
the region and to expand existing programs. Members 
include the Grameen Bank, the Amanah Ikhtiar Malaysia 
and six other groups from East Malaysia, the Philippines, 
Indonesia and Sri Lanka. Except for one, all Cashpor 
members are low-budget,  non-governmental groups. <P>

Cashpor also receives support from the UN Development 
Programme (UNDP). &quot;In the last 15 years, there 
has been a shift in economic planning philosophy from 
a top-down to a bottom-up approach,&quot; explains 
A. Selvanathan, coordinator of the UNDP poverty alleviation 
program in the Asia-Pacific region.<P>

 Cashpor's target for the whole of Asia is 10 million 
people. &quot;That means programs will have to be scaled 
up substantially and the human resource increased dramatically,&quot; 
says David Gibbons, a founding member of Cashpor.<P>

Gibbons says loan capital is not much of a problem because 
the high repayment rates are attractive to commercial 
banks. But capacity-building funds are more difficult 
as banks do not loan funds to train staff.<P>

Cashpor is being besieged by membership applications 
from other countries. Gibbons says the group is giving 
priority to the Philippines this year and also promoting 
the replication of Grameen in Vietnam, Thailand, and 
Nepal. <I><P>

<BR>
<I>The problems with the planet are too serious to be left to adults. Young
people have a huge stake in the planet's sustainaiblity and ought to have
a say. That's the message of a group of young people from around the world
that is forming a rescue mission for Planet Earth. <BR>
<BR>
The group's first step was to republish Agenga 21 - the landmark document
that came out of the Earth Summit - to make it more reader-friendly. The
result, is a beautifully produced book entitled </I>Rescue Mission Planet
Earth<I>. <BR>
<BR>
The book is the first step in a kids-led action plan, which includes local
community councils, eco-audits of schools, Third World shops in schools
and communities, and &quot;Days of Access,&quot; in which kids will meet
with government leaders to talk about progress toward meeting Agenda 21
goals. <BR>
<BR>
The following is an excerpt from the book's introduction. It begins with
this quote by Mikhail Gorbachev: .</I><BR>
<BR>
The greatest challenge of both our time and the next century is to save
the planet from destruction. It will require changing the very foundations
of modern civilization - the relationship of humans to the environment.<BR>
<BR>
Gorbachev gives it to us straight: our job in the 21st century is to &quot;save
the planet from destruction.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
We're 28 very different young people from 21 countries but we have one thing
in common. We're tired - tired of seeing our beautiful planet polluted,
tired of senseless wars, of the poor getting poorer, of waiting for politicians
to make decisions they should have made long, long ago. <I>Rescue Mission
</I>is our wake-up call. It's a book about Agenda 21 - the agenda for the
21st Century agreed upon by our governments at the Earth Summit in Rio de
Janeiro. Never before has something like this happened: a common commitment
by 179 different nations.<BR>
<BR>
The original Agenda rambles on for 500 pages and 40 chapters about a $600
billion program to save the planet. What we've done is to put it into a
language that ordinary people can understand. OK, so you're thinking this
is another yawn-provoking document from bureaucrats with nothing better
to do. Well right, but in it, governments ask for &quot;partnership&quot;
with us. We decided to take them at their word. Sure, let's be partners,
but equal partners! <BR>
<BR>
Agenda 21 tells you what our governments have agreed to. It's a wish list,
a dream; we can help make it reality.<I><BR>

Canada Trust's slogan is &quot;thinking like the customer.&quot; They've
acted on this slogan by implementing two new programs that focus on the
environment, a concern of many of their customers. <BR>
<BR>
For the first program, EnviroLoan, Canada Trust is working with the Ontario
Green Initiatives Program in seven communities across Ontario. The program
allows customers to get loans of up to $7,500 at the prime rate for changes
in their home or workplace that reduce energy consumption. There is even
a special payment matching scheme that allows customers to make their loan
payments using savings on their monthly utility bills.<BR>
<BR>
Canada Trust has also set up a charitable, not-for-profit organization called
Friends of the Environment Foundation (FEF) whose purpose is to promote
environmental initiatives in Canadian communities. FEF matches customer
donations to &quot;green accounts&quot; up to a maximum of $2 million per
year. Customers are given the option of donating a lump sum or having monthly
donations deducted from their account. The bank also donates an additional
$5 every time an account is &quot;greened.&quot; The money is then used
to fund local projects that are screened by local advisory boards. Eligible
projects include planting trees or flora, cleaning up streams and parks,
natural pesticide research, and sponsoring environmental education programs.<BR>
<BR>
Canada Trust has established 115 FEF chapters across Canada. The foundation
has raised more than $2.8 million, which all goes toward the projects. Canada
Trust assumes the costs of managing and administrating the program.<I><BR>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><CITE>IN CONTEXT </CITE>#44, Summer 1996<BR>
&copy; <A HREF="../permiss.htm">1996 by Context Institute</A> </P>

<P><HR></P>

<P><B>From Scott London</B>:</P>

<P>Robert, I would like to respond to your futures survey. First let me
tell you how much I value your work. I'm sad that In Context is no longer
in print, I used to read it very closely. But hopefully it will now flourish
online instead.</P>

<P>I have given some thought to the four scenarios you describe. I believe
that each one is likely. In fact, I think we see movements that confirm
that all four scenarios are already being played out. I don't believe that
they are mutually exclusive. There are pockets of society that are deeply
rooted in the status quo and will continue along the &quot;more of the same&quot;
track until there is some form of catastrophe and breakdown. There are other
pockets, even whole cultures, dedicated to the third scenario (I lived for
some 15 years in Sweden which is a typical example of this approach). I
also feel there is much evidence of a transformation of consciousness taking
place around the world today. </P>

<P>What's odd is how easily people operating within these different frameworks
can coexist despite their different outlooks and convictions. Look at the
scientific community -- I think it exemplifies all the scenarios you describe.
Some scientists are deeply wedded to the status quo and see no cause for
doing things differently in the future. Others recognize impending breakdown
and are deeply concerned about it (have you seen the book &quot;The End
of Science&quot;?). Still others realize that we have to marshal all the
scientific expertise and knowledge we can in the name of survival. A small
minority of scientists realize that science has long been part of the problem,
not the solution, and are calling for a change in consciousness. As one
scientist I know puts it, we need to adopt new metaphors in science; we
need to replace the notion that the universe is built like a clockwork mechanism
to one that sees nature as a vibrant, self-organizing living system. </P>

<P>I don't know how to rate the likelihood of the four scenarios you describe.
I think they overlap and affect each other. For example, scenario four is
often directly linked with scenario two -- crisis prompts expanded consciousness.
In Sweden, I learned that the jump from scenario one to scenario three is
not always so great -- some of the most socially progressive and innovative
policies and technologies can emerge from within a status quo environment.
Even so, scenario three is unlikely without the shift of consciousness you
describe in scenario four.</P>

<P>So these things are not easily separated out. But, to give you something
to work with, I will give it a try:</P>

<P>More of the same: 4<BR>
(It is unlikely. Something has to give.)</P>

<P>Disaster and collapse: 9<BR>
(I think the coming years will see the breakdown of many unsustainable social
systems)</P>

<P>Eco-tech triumph: 5<BR>
(I wish I could be more optimistic here, but things seem to move so slowly
on this front that it will probably take much more than 20 years)</P>

<P>Transformation of consciousness: 8<BR>
(There is a groundswell of profound change taking place, and I think the
evidence is all around us, if you look in the right places)</P>

<P>I hope these thoughts are useful. I look forward to seeing what others
have to say about this subject. Thanks again for the fine work you are doing.</P>

<P>With best wishes, Scott.</P>

<P><B>From Virginia Boehm</B>:</P>

<P>More of the Same: 2 (not likely - the breakdown has gone too far)</P>

<P>Disaster/Collapse: 5  but collapse is less than total, parts of system
keep functioning relatively as usual, parts experience difficulties, and
parts break down.  Several days ago, before I'd heard of this site, I tried
to make a list of what would hang together and what would not.  I think
collapse is a better term than disaster - while there will be small scale
disasters, I just see the pain level slowly creeping up for the next 5 years
or so until there's a large enough critical mass of people willing to do
what is necessary to reconstruct a more workable society.  </P>

<P>Techno/Triumph - 1  Waiting for a techno-miracle is not wise.  Its like
waiting for a Man on Horseback, or maybe the 2nd coming (Millennium nuts
will be part of the general craziness of the next few years.)  We have collectively
created this mess, and collectively we must solve it, all taking responsibility,
not leaving it up to someone else.</P>

<P>Transformation - 3   Probably, in time this will come.  It may be brought
about by a near-collapse of much of what we now know as society.  But it
won't be the first thing to occur - rebirth, like birth itself involves
pain and there aren't a critical mass hurting bad enough - yet.</P>

<P>Hey - this is fun!  Do post the result.  :-)</P>

<P>Gini  </P>

&copy; <A HREF="../permiss.htm">1996 by Context Institute</A> </P>

<P><HR></P>

<P><B>From Betsy Barnum</B>:</P>

<P>More of the Same: I give this an 8 for the next five years, and a 4 after
that. It's clear that it is already not realistically possible to extrapolate
the future from the present and recent past; things are starting to fall
apart. &quot;The center cannot hold.&quot; However, blind and denial-ridden
people, esp. those who benefit most from the current world order, are determined
to pretend they can do this, so policies and social actions will continue
for a while to be made within this paradigm.</P>

<P>Disaster and Collapse: I fear this gets an 8 from me if the time span
is extended to 50-100 years. I think we will know within 20 years whether
this is going to be the inevitable result, but it will probably take longer
than that for the full collapse to occur. When I contemplate this outcome,
which seems all too likely as I look around and listen to the pratings of
the people who should be leading us away from this cliff, I usually think
of it as a &quot;no survivors&quot; scenario--only soil microbes, maybe
cockroaches and rats, are left.</P>

<P>Eco-Tech triumph: I give this a 4. I see some movements in this direction
now, but it is a big mistake to think that technology will clean up our
messes and save us from our own bad decisions. It is technology that has
gotten us here--it is our use of technology that has gotten us here, I should
say. Without #4 (transformation of consciousness) I don't know why we would
think we will suddenly become wise in our use of technology, when we have
shown no such wisdom so far.</P>

<P>Transformation of Consciousness: 2. It is where I put my hope, but I
think the chances are slim. To me, the transformation I hope for is what
will happen when people are able to throw off the blinding cloak of western
consciousness -- patriarchy, science-worship, disconnection from nature
and intuition, etc.--and realize themselves fully as they really are. It's
not ESP, or some transformation into beings who are different from us or
have new powers--it is merely a coming-into-ourselves in the full knowledge
of who and what we are.</P>

<P>This means, to start, a reconnection with the natural world, an awakening
to the aliveness of the earth and everything in and on it, an ability to
see every creature, including every other human being, as another embodiment
of that *love* or *life* that has been pulsing through the universe since
its birth. It does also include, as you postulated, a transcendence of our
culture's current obsession with/denial of death and our part in the birth-death-rebirth
cycles that are what really &quot;makes the world go 'round.&quot; I think
this transformation of consciousness is a process that has already begun,
and in many different ways, or from many different angles. Some of the angles
from which I see consciousness changing are ecological (to me the most complete,
or offering an opportunity to go deeper faster), feminism, liberation movements,
spiritual renewal, economic sustainability, intentional communities, the
voluntary simplicity movement, to name a few. The transformations in consciousness
that people who truly enter into these movements or new paradigms begin
to experience are multi-layered, each layer revealing another level of change,
commitment, possibility beneath it.</P>

<P>As to how this scenario might come about, I think it will happen at first
gradually (as now, almost imperceptibly in terms of the culture and the
population at large, but very noticeably to those of us who are already
making the shift), and as the numbers of people involved grow, a critical
mass will be reached at some point where the transformation will build up
speed and sweep like a wave over the rest of the people. I don't have any
example from the past to cite here, though there may be one I'm not thinking
of. I don't wish to ignore the past, yet I think that what's ahead for this
scenario to become reality is of a different order than anything that has
happened up to now, so there may not be a precedent.</P>

<P>What I do know, however, is that all the worrying we do about &quot;how
do we convince others to see things the way we now see them,&quot; as well
as the arguing over whether deep ecology is &quot;more true&quot; than,
say, ecofeminism, or whether business can or can't be transformed, and other
such internal bickering, is wasted energy. We should each and all do whatever
we feel called or led to do, whether that is chaining ourselves to bulldozers
or factory trawlers, or whether it is working in social justice movements,
or challenging conventional methods of education, health care, development
or government, or reducing our own ecological impact and living quietly
as a model to others. We need to each go about doing what we do, and trust
that the larger outcome is simply not in our hands.</P>

<P>One thing that I believe is essential to spur this transformation process
is new myths and stories to underpin the new paradigms. As Thomas Berry
says, we as a society have believed, and still largely do, in the myth of
progress and industrial growth. It is our blind devotion to the myth that
makes it so difficult for us to see how untenable it is. I think many people
are already envisioning and expressing these new stories, from Brian Swimme
and Berry and their new cosmology, to Northwest Environment Watch and its
stories of &quot;ecological wake&quot; left by everyday products we consume
in the U.S. Artists, including writers, poets, visual artists, filmmakers
and others, will be (already are) a big part of developing new stories and
myths, and I believe artists will become more and more important as the
process moves forward. In addition, however, I think that as people talk
to each other, tell each other their stories, informally, transformations
will occur as individuals spark new consciousness in each other. This I
have seen happen, and I know it will be a significant factor.</P>

<P>I think it also must be said that as the surging wave of transforming
consciousness gains momentum, there will be increasing efforts to stop it
by the few who benefit from the current social, political, economic and
cultural paradigms of patriarchy and materialism. These attempts will undoubtedly
take extreme forms, including fascist &quot;Big Brother&quot; type controls
on people's private lives, even speech and thought, and vicious assaults
on all things alternative and particularly on the arts. This, too, is already
beginning--or, perhaps merely continuing--as demonstrated by a recent effort
here in Minnesota by the medical establishment to outlaw all forms of alternative
health care by convincing the state attorney general to close down a local
naturopath for &quot;practicing medicine without a license.&quot; There
were no complaints from her patients; the AG sent in two agents posing as
patients to entrap her--and all she did was give some nutritional, homeopathic
and exercise recommendations. I think this kind of thing will get much,
much worse before the surge of transformation overwhelms such resistance--and
that will only happen if there is enough time for this more or less organic
process to take its course before ecological damage forecloses the future
for all of us. The other side of the process could be a renewal of human
consciousness and sense of purpose, and bright new possibilities for the
future of the earth, as your description of scenario 4 stated; getting there,
if the universe vouchsafes us the time, will be a dark, dangerous journey.</P>

<P>Thank you for inviting comment on this topic. It has given me a chance
to think through some of the ideas that have been simmering for a while;
and shown me where I need to clarify my thinking. I'll be looking forward
to seeing the results.</P>

&copy; <A HREF="../permiss.htm">1996 by Context Institute</A> </P>

<P><HR></P>

<P><B>From Brad Fregger</B>:</P>

<P>More of the Same: Assuming a 20 year future, I would give this scenario
an 8 on the chance that things will not be significantly different sociologically.
This is an easy one on how it might develop, things just continue with relatively
slight changes politically or socially. No more drastic changes than we
have observed over the past 20 years.</P>

<P>Within in the context of land-use planning, this is the most important
scenario of prepare for; mostly because we are much more capable of making
adequate and effective plans when we have a past with which to draw from,
it is extremely difficult to plan for situations that have never existed
before.</P>

<P>Disaster and Collapse: I would judge the chances of this happening in
the next 20 years to be less than 1. While this type of calamity has happened
in the past, the odds of another instance happening in the next 20 years
are insignificant. Not even the black plague in Europe had the kind of impact
that you are talking about here.</P>

<P>Since you are talking about a &quot;world-wide&quot; impact, I can only
envision a major natural disaster (asteroid hitting the earth, shifting
of the magnetic poles, an outbreak of an extremely effective disease that
kills 75% of the population), this is extremely unlikely. It is, of course,
very possible that this kind of impact can happen on a country-wide level
(the current situation in Russia, or any other numerous places around the
earth), so it might be important to consider what you might do under the
circumstances, should this happen within your country.</P>

<P>From a land-use planning perspective, I can't believe that it is possible
to effectively plan for this contingency. Only the most general plans can
be made, and any plans must be designed to be extremely flexible, since
nobody knows for sure what we will be up against should this happen. It's
possible, if you are paranoid enough, to plan for survival, however, I suspect
that even these plans would not, could not, plan for what actually happens.
I would not waste a lot of time considering this alternative.</P>

<P>Eco-tech Triumph: Within the next 20 years, I would give this alternative
about a 1.5 chance of happening. Basically, I have very little faith in
governments, or the average person being able to incorporate this kind of
development into their lives in ways that would be even moderately positive
to the world in general. I can imagine a way this would happen, but it would
demand an individual with the charisma of a Hitler and the morals of Christ,
and he/she would have to create a new religion based on the concepts of
a sustainable future, one where the people &quot;knew&quot; that &quot;God&quot;
was calling them to this kind of living, to this new future for humanity.</P>

<P>From a land-use perspective, I would spend more time on this than on
the previous, mostly because this kind of thinking can have a significant
impact on a local level, especially with small groups of committed people.
Additionally, any planning done along this line would probably be impactual
in the &quot;business as usual&quot; scenario, and therefore not wasted.
In fact, I would probably do my planning by looking at each element of the
plan from both alternatives.</P>

<P>Transformation of Consciousness: In the next 20 years..., &quot;no way
Jose'.&quot; This has about as much chance of happening as &quot;disaster
and collapse,&quot; a 1 on a scale of 1-10. I can't even think of a scenario
that would bring this about in the next 20 years (I guess visitors from
another world could come and use some mind stretching technology to move
us to the next level of existence, as they did with the apes in 2001, or
Christ could return, only do it this time like he did in the Book of Mormon,
and bring with him the ability and the desire to raise humanity's consciousness).</P>

<P>Planning for this eventuality would be a waste of time, not only because
of the extremely slight chance of it happening, but also because if it did,
everything we would want to do along the land-use, etc. plans, would immediately
become very easy, or we would understand clearly why they weren't possible.</P>

<P>Additional Scenarios:</P>

<P>How about a scenario where an ultra-right wing individual becomes President
of the United States. Someone who is extremely conservative politically,
socially, and theologically. This happens because of increased crime, or
massive terrorist activity in the U.S. where a nuclear bomb is detonated
in New York City. He/she then uses the might and power of the United States
to bring his/her beliefs to the rest of the world (&quot;We must do this
to assure our safety and the safety of our children's future.&quot;)</P>

<P>Or, somewhat the same, what if a conservative Muslim faction takes over
the entire middle east, uses all that oil money to build a war machine beyond
anything the world has ever seen, and then takes over the world. Remember,
this is effectively what was done when that religion began, and I feel sure
that this is the ultimate goal of the conservatives alive today. How would
this impact us? What should we prepare for? Can we prepare for this any
more than we can prepare for some of the other alternatives mentioned.</P>

<P>One final scenario would be the rise of the poor and downtrodden to power
in the United States. Essentially, a class revolution, where the middle
and upper middle classes are effectively wiped out and a new form of government
is put into place. How would this impact the rest of the world? What are
the chances of this happening? Remember that it has already happened twice
in this century, once in Russia and once in China. This fact alone makes
the chance of it happening here much greater than some of the other scenarios
you suggested.</P>

<P>Well, that's all for now. Please excuse the spelling errors, and the
fact that I didn't give it a good edit--it's essentially a mind purge, without
a lot of time being spent to hone it. I did enjoy thinking about these possibilities,
and the exercise in general.</P>

From Guy Dauncey: &quot;The project is currently undergoing a very slow
and thorough process of<BR>
environmental assessment which will take until 1998, as a condition of final
zoning approval. No residential settlement is expected until the year 2000.
Further updates will be posted here once a year.&quot;<BR>

<CITE>Creating Our Future</CITE> vision:

<P><P><strong><blockquote>"Greater Vancouver can become the first urban region in the world to
combine in one place the things to which humanity aspires on a global basis: 
a place where human activities enhance rather than degrade the natural 
environment, where the quality of the built environment approaches that 
of the natural setting, where the diversity of origins and religions is 
a source of social strength rather than strife, where people control the 
destiny of their community, and where the basics of food, clothing, 
shelter, security and useful activity are accessible to all."</blockquote></strong>

<H3>Overview</H3>

The Greater Vancouver Regional District is a partnership of the 20 municipalities and
two electoral areas that make up the metropolitan area of Greater Vancouver. One
Fraser Valley municipality (Abbotsford) outside the GVRD boundaries also
participates in its parks service.
<P>
The role of the Regional District is to deliver to the area's 1.8 million people - 
half the population of British Columbia - essential services that are regional 
rather than local in nature.
<P>
These services are provided on a regional basis for reasons of economy,
effectiveness and fairness. Yet the system is structured so that each member
municipality maintains its local autonomy. 
<P> 
The regional district concept was established by the Provincial Government in 1965; 
the first meeting of the GVRD's Board of Directors was on July 12, 1967.
<P>
There are 29 regional districts in B.C., covering virtually the entire
province.

<H2>The winds of  change</H2>
 The health system has changed dramatically since the GVRD  Hospital Planning 
 and Development Board held its first  meeting in 1967. Over the last 30 
 years, the region has  cost-shared in over $800 million for hospital 
 buildings,  renovations and equipment. This capital development has  been 
 guided by regional health plans and supported by the  GVRD Hospital Planning 
 and Development Department in its  capital funding and planning role.
 
 <P>
 
<CENTER><IMG ALIGN=left SRC="../../hospital/av_media/hosp.gif"></CENTER>
<P>
<I>The GVRD Hospital Planning and Development Department  contributed $6.2 million 
toward a new extended care  building at the Peace Arch Pavilion Hospital.  
This  building incorporates some of the newest design  philosophies and 
offers state-of-the-art features. 
</I>
<P><BR>
<BR><BR><BR>
Today, the department  continues to keep pace with  the changing health system  
and is moving from its early  role of strict capital  allocation to include  
program planning and  regional evaluation. It  understands that effective  
regional planning means  major programs, services and  equipment are maximized, 
not  duplicated.
<P>
Over the coming years, the  department's role will  continue to evolve as it  
adds value to the planning  process and assists the  Regional Health Boards 
with  their program delivery   decisions. To meet these  future challenges, 
the  department is currently  developing a strategic  plan.
As we look to the future,  this Health Planning Review  highlights activities 
within  the Acute Care,  Rehabilitation, Psychiatry,  Obstetrics and Perinatal  
subcommittees over the past  18 months.  

<P>
It also summarizes how  projected changes within the  GVRD will impact health 
 planning, and it reviews  some of the capital planning  activities and 
 associated  cost savings.  We trust you  will find this review  informative. 



<P>
<BR><BR>

<H2>Health  services 
planning -
subcommittee  
reports
 </H2>


<H4><A NAME="acute1">Acute  care</H4></A><P>

A key goal of acute  care planning is to  ensure the equitable  allocation of 
resources  within the GVRD. 
The Regional Acute Care  Bed Plan was recently  updated to incorporate  
population projections  reflected in the GVRD's  Livable Region  Strategic 
Plan. As  well, a new utilization   target of 650 bed days  per 1,000 population  
was established to  reflect the declining  use patterns 
throughout  BC.  Results indicate  that the region's bed  requirements are  
sufficient  up to the  year 2006, with the  exception of the South  
Fraser Valley. In that  area, the plan  identified a shortage  of 
approximately 100  beds by 2001.

<P>

The subcommittee also  recognizes that acute in-patient  beds are becoming 
less  important as we see  increases in day  surgery and ambulatory  care. 
A current study  in day surgery examines  required resources to  meet future 
needs and  the impact of those  programs on in-patient  beds.

 <P>
 
 <BR><BR>
<H4><A NAME="rehab1">Rehabilitation </A>
</H4>

Planning focused on  developing a more  effective means of  gathering, sharing 
and  using information for  planning rehabilitation  services. 
As a result, an  information catalogue  was compiled and  distributed. In  
addition, the  Rehabilitation  sub-committee  commissioned a survey  of 
consumers in five  rehabilitation agencies  to assess their  priorities for  
rehabilitation  outcomes. 
The most significant  finding was agreement  that the top priority  was for 
patients to  achieve a self-directed  lifestyle. Currently,  the sub-committee 
is  reviewing future   rehabilitation bed  requirements. 


<P>
<BR><BR>

<H4><A NAME="obste1">Obstetrics</A></H4> 


A report projecting  maternity bed  requirements for 2001   and 2006 was 
released.  The report factors  recent changes in  maternity care such as  
shorter hospital stays,  shifts in birth volumes  and declining cesarean  
section rates. Results  indicate that, except  for the South Fraser  Valley, 
the region's  bed requirements are  sufficient for the next  ten years. 
In other areas, a new  joint task group with  the Ministry of Health  is 
examining issues and  concepts of an  alternative birthing  model called 
Single  Room Maternity Care. 

<P>
<BR><BR>
<H4><A NAME="psyc1">Psychiatry</A></H4>

 
A key activity was the  development of a long   range plan for acute  care 
psychiatry bed  needs within the GVRD.  The plan shows a need  for additional  
psychiatric beds in all  areas except Vancouver  and the North Shore. In  
addition, a survey of  patients in the  region's psychiatry  units revealed 
seven  per cent of patient  days were used by  patients assessed as  ready for 
discharge.
<P>
<BR><BR>

<H4><A NAME="stu1">Student  projects</A></H4>

The GVRD employed two  students from the UBC  Master of Health  Administration 
Program  to work on 1996  planning projects. One  was in the area of  
Pediatric Services  Planning, which  identified available  resources for 
asthma  care and included  recommendations for  greater integration of  
asthma management. The  other project was in  the area of   Psychogeriatric  
Services Planning. It  included a profile of  problem cases and  projections 
about  future health service  needs for this group.
<P><BR><BR>

<H2>Capital  planning</H2>


<H4><A NAME="build1">Building  Program</A></H4>

It is estimated that in  1996, the GVRD Hospital  Planning and Development  
Department and the  Ministry of Health (MOH)  will have jointly funded  
$65 million for new  facilities, renovations  and equipment. While  
expenditures are  expected to be reduced  in 1997, building  additions are 
being  planned for Surrey  Memorial Hospital, 
Zion Park and Burnaby  Hospital. The GVRD  continues to work 
with MOH and the  Regional Health Boards  to determine project  
priorites and establish  plans for future capital  and program  
developments.

<P>

<BR><BR>

<H4><A NAME="reg1">Regional  Equipment  Strategy</A></H4>
To support a  regionalized approach  to health care  planning, a long term  
strategy for high cost  medical/clinical  technology, costing  more than 
$100,000, was  completed. It is  expected this strategy  will save money by  
eliminating  duplication, reducing  overheads and improving  services. 
The strategy  also calls for a new  purchasing review  process for  
acquisitions costing  more than $100,000, to   help ensure the most  
appropriate technology  is used to meet the  identified health needs  
of the population.   

<P><BR><BR>
<H2> Regional  Services  Planning</H2>



<H4><A NAME="bio1">Biomedical  waste 
and  treatment</A></H4>

A recent review of  biomedical waste  suggests industry  developments, 
such as  increased competition  for treating and  processing biomedical  
waste, has resulted in  cost reductions of  nearly 40 per cent.   
Competitors are also  providing free waste  audits which in turn  
provides hospitals with  valuable information.  The review also found  
that under current  conditions, off-site  equipment used to treat  and 
process waste is  more cost-effective  than on-site  equipment.

<P> 
<BR><BR>

<H4>
<A NAME="food1">Food  services</A></H4>

An industry study on  shared food services  recommends phasing in  group 
purchasing of  food supplies and  moving to shared  production services.  
Already some hospitals  within the GVRD have  conducted shared food  
services trials and  have achieved savings  of approx-imately  $250,000 per 
year.  Those hospitals are now  working toward shared  production services.

<P><BR><BR>

<H4><A NAME="laund1">Laundry  services</A></H4>
The Shared Laundry  Services Task Group is  recommending  relocating services  
from Vancouver  Hospital to the  Tilbury Regional  Laundry. Studies show  
that region-wide,  shared laundry  services of this  nature can result in  
savings of $1.5 to $2   million per year.

<P><BR><BR>

<H4>
<A NAME="park1">Parking</A></H4>
Annual hospital parking  revenues of  approximately $5  million are used to  
cover operating costs,  retire parking  facilities debt  service, and reduce  
taxation levels. Some  of the many activities  underway to enhance   
customer service by  creating a more  customer friendly  environment include:
<UL>
<LI>Repainting parkade  entrance areas, cashier booths  and parking equipment
<LI>Upgrading the parking  system computer program at all  sites 
<LI>Installing credit  card facilities to 	 pay parking fees. 
</UL> 
<BR><BR>

</UL>
<H4><A NAME="fact1">GVRD facts and stats</A>
</H4>
<UL>

<LI>The use of bed days for GVRD  residents 
has decreased from 817 days  per 1,000 population in 1989 to 676 days  per 1,000 population in  1995.<P> 

<LI>The GVRD operates the largest  parking 	operation in Western Canada,  with 6,268 		parking  spaces at eight hospitals.<P>
 

<LI>There are about 130 projects  in various stages  of design and construction. The smallest is  the acquisition of wheelchairs  
	at Holy Family Hospital, and  the largest is the  construction of the Vancouver Hospital Tower.

<H2>WELCOME TO THE WORKS</H2>

<H3>With any luck, this information will cause a paper cut.</H3>

<IMG SRC="../../waste/av_media/paperstk.gif">

<IMG SRC="../../waste/av_media/bin.gif">


<P>The good news is that 75% of businesses in Greater Vancouver are already 
recycling to some degree.  The bad news is that despite this, recyclable 
paper and cardboard continue to be the main materials thrown in the garbage 
by businesses.  Whether it's paper, cardboard, aluminum or whatever, we can 
all do a better job of recycling.  Businesses have told us they want help 
starting or improving their recycling programs.  'Recycling Works' can 
provide that help.


<P>
Recycling makes good business sense.  It can save money, is good for the 
environment and is definitely good for your business' image.


<P>Each person in the Greater Vancouver Regional District generates about one 
tonne of garbage a year at work alone. A tonne. The following information
outlines simple, painless ways in which your business can do more in the 
area of recycling, whether you currently have a recycling program in place 
or not. Our goal for this first phase of the 'Recycling Works Program' is 
to double the amount of paper and cardboard currently being recycled.


<P>Reaching this goal begins by following this simple voluntary<BR> 
<STRONG>Code of Practice for Businesses:</STRONG>

<P>
<B>The Greater Vancouver Sewerage and Drainage District</B> (GVS&DD) Source Control 
Program regulates and controls waste discharges to the Districts sewerage and 
drainage system, at source.  Controlling discharges at source is key to 
prevention of high contaminant levels in the sewerage and drainage works which 
could compromise worker safety and health, interfere with the operation of the
collection system and treatment works, or pass through the system into the
environment without adequate treatment. <P>

In 1990, Sewer Use Bylaw No. 164 was adopted, providing the regulatory basis to
control non-domestic discharges to the District sewerage and drainage system.
Under the Bylaw, the District is empowered to impose requirements on the direct
or indirect discharge of non-domestic waste to District facilities.  Control of
non-domestic waste can take the form of prohibition of certain types of waste,
restrictions on contaminant concentrations, reductions in contaminant loadings,
and allocations of discharge volumes. The Bylaw is administered by the
District's Source Control group, except within the City of Vancouver boundaries,
where City of Vancouver staff handle this task. 
<P>
Administratively, control of non-domestic waste is accomplished through issue,
administration, and enforcement of authorizations, permits, and codes of practice.
Education and dissemination of information concerning the impact of waste
discharges are also important elements of the GVS&DD Source Control Program.   
<P>
The GVS&DD Source Control Group, currently consisting of ten staff,  was created
in 1990 to administer the Bylaw and develop and manage the Source Control Program
as part of the sewerage and drainage services provided by the District to its member
municipalities.  From 1990 to 1995 the primary focus of the Source Control Program
has been the implementation of the waste discharge permit system and the development
of administrative procedures for compliance monitoring and enforcement.
<P>
During 1994 and early 1995 an enforcement strategy was developed.  The strategy
is intended to improve compliance performance, while ensuring a fair,
consistent, and reasonable approach.  A key component of the enforcement
strategy is the Source Control Non-Compliance List, which is intended to
serve as a strong deterrent to non-compliance, and encourage industries
using the District's sewerage works to pro-actively manage their discharges
in accordance with the terms and conditions of their permits. The Non-Compliance
List is published twice per year, in March (covering July 1 to December 31)
and October (covering January 1 to June 30).
<P>
The emphasis of  the Source Control activity in 1996 is on:  improving
discharger compliance, developing better data management tools, increasing
regulatory activity in the commercial and institutional sector, and developing
cost recovery strategies.

<H1>Air Quality FAQ</H1>

<P>

<FONT SIZE=+2>(F</FONT>requently <FONT SIZE=+2>A</FONT>sked <FONT SIZE=+2>Q</FONT>uestions<FONT SIZE=+2>)</FONT>

<DL>

<DT><B>Can I burn today?  Is burning allowed? </B>

<DD>Residential burning is under municipal jurisdiction. In

most municipalities, backyard burning is prohibited. For those

that continue to permit burning, allowable burning periods are

restricted. Contact your municipality for further information.

<DT><B>Are people allowed to burn whatever they want in their

fireplaces?</B>

<DD>GVRD Air Pollution Control Bylaw No. 603 restricts the

burning of any fuels other than wood, paper (or derivatives of

these materials) or natural gas in domestic fireplaces.  Everyone

who lights a fire contributes to smoke-caused air pollution, so

we should make sure the combustion is efficient so that it releases

the least possible amount of smoke. Use seasoned, dry wood. Don't

burn treated or coated wood. Don't burn garbage such as plastics,

paper and cardboard. Reduce waste at source, avoid overpackaging.

Recycle whenever possible. Compost your yard leaves and clippings

rather than burning them. 



<DT><B>What can be done about smoking trucks, are they being tested?</B>

<DD>The provincial government will implement its heavy duty

vehicle testing program in 1996. Contact the Ministry of Environment,

Lands and Parks for further information.

<DT><B>How do I obtain Air Quality information?</B>

<DD>The Air Quality Index is available on this site at <A

HREF="/air/bro/aqindex.html">http://www.gvrd.bc.ca/air/bro/aqindex.html</A>

on the TV Weather Network and is published in the daily newspapers.

You can also call (604) 436-6767 or 1-800-665-1118.

<DT><B>Who do I contact to complain about air pollution problems?</B>



<DD>For air pollution inquiries or complaints call the GVRD

Air Quality Department at (604) 436-6777. Ministry of Environment:

(604) 582-5200.

<DT><B>I have to use my car to commute and don't have the option

of using public transit. What else can I do to reduce air pollution?</B>

</DT><UL>

<LI>Drive Wisely, Drive Less. Take transit, ride your bike,

or walk when possible. Combine several errands into one trip,

and carpool whenever possible. 

<LI>Reduce your driving speed.<B> </B> Driving at 80 km/hour

uses 15 -20 per cent less fuel than driving at 100 km/hour. 

<LI>Commute less and during off-peak hours.<B> </B>If possible,

take advantage of technology and work at home. Discuss the possibilities

with your employer. 

<LI>Save energy. Purchase a fuel efficient vehicle. They emit

fewer pollutants and save you money. At home keep your thermostat

at 20o C during the day and turn it down at night. Insulate your

home properly.

<LI>Don't overfill your gas tank. You will force out extra

emissions or you may spill gasoline which causes air pollution

when it evaporates. 

<LI>Test any used car at AirCare for emission problems before

 purchasing.  

<LI>Reduce the use of solvents, use water base paints and buy

non-aerosol products.

<LI>Use non-gasoline powered garden tools.

<LI>Plant trees and low maintenance landscaping plants.

<LI>Educate yourself and your community about air quality.

<LI>Contact the Communications and Education department at (604)

432-6339 to obtain print materials or to book free workshops on

Air Quality issues.

<DD>HHW, old pesticides, solvents, etc.: try to use up or give
away to be used, if not then store in a safe place until facilities
are in place.


<DT><B>How do I recycle household batteries and fluorescent light
bulbs? </B>
<DD>Button batteries may be returned to jewellery, camera and electronics stores.
Currently only three areas have recycling programs for household and industrial
batteries, these are: 
<DD>District of Burnaby - call their Environmental Health Division at 
(604) 294-7390.
<DD>Township of Langley - call their Engineering Department at (604) 533-6006. 
<DD>City of Langley at (604) 530-3131.
<DD>Barring any of the above, mercury reduced, normal alkaline batteries may be 
thrown into the regular garbage.
<DD>Fluorescent lamps contain mercury and care should be taken not to break them: Nu
Life Industries Inc. of Aldergrove, B.C. (604) 857-5588 or toll free 1-800-247-6724 is a
licensed recycler of fluorescent lamps and dry cell batteries in British Columbia.


<DT><B>What is a Transfer Station? </B>
<DD>A transfer station reduces the volume of traffic necessary
for transporting residential and commercial waste away from the
municipalities. Waste is received from communities that are within
close proximity to the transfer station and screened for recyclable
material. The recyclable material is collected and sold to various
industries, wherever possible hazardous and problem wastes are
removed. The remaining residue is then compacted and hauled away
to an incinerator or landfill in larger transport vehicles. This
process provides both environmental and economical benefits to
the Greater Vancouver area.
<DT><B>Where does my garbage go? </B>
<DD>One of four disposal sites - Vancouver Landfill, Port Mann
Landfill, Cache Creek Landfill or the Burnaby Incinerator.
<DT><B>Why haul waste to Cache Creek Landfill? </B>
<DD>It is dry. In areas of high rainfall, like the Lower Mainland,
landfills tend to generate large quantities of leachate (a polluting
liquid that can seep into groundwater) and landfill gas (an odorous
gas made up mostly of carbon dioxide and methane). The Cache Creek
area is arid - producing minimal leachate and landfill gas - and
is an ideal location for a landfill.
<DD>The project included an agreement with another company to
construct a wood chip facility in Cache Creek. When refuse trailers
haul GVRD garbage to Cache Creek, the same trailers haul wood
chips back to the Lower Mainland. The landfill and chip plant
have generated 70 full-time and 10 part-time jobs in the Cache
Creek/Ashcroft area.
<DT><B>Where do I dispose of my garbage and how much does it cost?
</B>
<DD>The facilities are listed below and the cost is $69/tonne. The cost will be reduced
to $64/tonne effective July 1, 1996.

<DL>



<DT><B>When is the government going to provide alternative transportation

choices so that I can leave my car at home?</B>

<DD>While public transit is a provincial responsibility the GVRD

has been working in partnership with the government to develop

land use and transportation planning that will reduce dependence

on the private automobile. The Province recently announced its

10-year transit development plan which includes two rapid transit

lines and fast bus service. Work has already started on developing

the light rail and rapid bus facilities in the Broadway-Lougheed-Coquitlam-New

Westminster corridor and rapid bus in the Richmond corridor will

be one of the first improvements to be implemented. 

<DD>For more information about Transport 2021 Medium and Long

Range Transportation Plans contact the GVRD Strategic Planning

Department at  (604) 432-6375.

<DT><B>How fast is our population increasing?</B>

<DD>Every year, the region grows by 40,000 new residents. That

is enough to populate a city the size of New Westminster every

year. 

<DT><B>How does our growth compare to other parts of North America?</B>

<DD>Greater Vancouver is one of the top ten fastest growing metropolitan

areas in North America.

<DT><B>Where is the growth coming from?</B>

<DD>Studies show about one-third of the region's population growth

comes from people who already live here - the natural birth rate.

One-third comes from people moving here from other Canadian provinces

and territories, and one-third comes from immigration.

<DT><B>What are the benefits of implementing a regional growth

strategy?</B>

<DD>By managing growth efficiently through the <I>Livable Region

Strategic Plan</I>, air emissions will be reduced by one-third,

$2.2 billion in transportation capital spending will be saved,

and land, equivalent in size to the City of Vancouver, will be

protected from development within the <I>Green Zone</I> .

<DT><B>What is the population of the GVRD?</B>

<DD>In 1995 it was 1,819,533

<DT><B>What is the land area of GVRD?</B>

<DD>290,462.8  (hectares)

<DT><B>How will the Green Zone be protected from development?</B>

<DD>The Green Zone comprises lands owned and regulated by many

different agencies. The watershed and parks are publicly owned

and have been reserved for non-urban uses.  The Agricultural Land

Reserve (ALR) is largely privately-owned, but development within

the ALR is controlled by the regulations of the B.C. Agricultural

Land Commission, which restricts non-farm development within the

ALR. Ecological habit is protected by federal and provincial agencies.

Hazardous lands, like steep slopes along stream courses are protected

by municipal Official Community Plan and zoning bylaws. In short,

the protection of the Green Zone is a true partnership involving

local, regional, provincial and federal governments and their

agencies.

<DT><B>How does the Livable Region Strategic Plan affect downtown

Vancouver?</B>

<DD>The Plan recognizes downtown Vancouver as the primary business

centre in the region. Downtown associations are concerned about

the continued vitality of the downtown, especially in response

to the decentralization of some downtown services to the suburban

communities around the City of Vancouver.  Rather than have decentralization

spread across the region, the Livable Region Strategic Plan proposes

that, to the extent that decentralization occurs through market

trends, decentralized development should be centralized in one

of eight suburban regional centres.  Concentrating non-downtown

commercial growth in these Regional Town Centres (RTCs) helps

support the public investment facilities like rail transit and

the SeaBus.  The idea behind RTCs is to complement downtown Vancouver,

not to compete with it. The growth of housing on the downtown

peninsula, and the increase in transit accessibility to downtown

Vancouver, both help reinforce the downtown as the core of the

metropolitan region.

<DT><B>Why is it necessary to have more complete communities?</B>

<DD>When the GVRD surveyed Greater Vancouver residents, 91 per

cent said they would prefer to live and work within the same community.

 Unfortunately, this is not always possible today, because there

are some communities where there are fewer jobs in the community

than there are workers. As a consequence, these workers are forced

to commute to jobs in other communities. By pursuing a development

form that produces communities where jobs and services are close

to households, the need to travel long distances across the region

through several municipalities can be minimized. When residents

can make shorter trips, they are more likely to walk or cycle,

as opposed to driving a motor vehicle.

<H1>Drinking Water FAQ</H1>



<P>

<FONT SIZE=5>(F</FONT>requently <FONT SIZE=5>A</FONT>sked <FONT SIZE=5>Q</FONT>uestions<FONT SIZE=5>)</FONT>

<DL>

<DT>How much water is used per person, per day in the GVRD?

<DD>About 650 litres per person, per day. That includes water

used by people at home, and the water used by industries, businesses

and institutions in the GVRD.

<DT>What is the green/blue staining on bathroom fixtures, clothes

and hair?

<DD>The source of the green or blue stains is copper which is

leached from copper piping by our naturally acidic water. The

problem is most noticeable in the hot water recirculating loops

in high-rise buildings. Use a detergent (such as Tide) for laundry

as anything made of pure soap (such as Ivory Snow) will make the

staining worse as the soap precipitates the copper out of the

water. As part of the Drinking Water Treatment Program, the GVRD

hopes to implement pH and alkalinity adjustment (corrosion control)

by 1998 which will substantially reduce this problem.

<DT>How much Fluoride is in the water and do we add any?

<DD>Fluoride is not added to the water source, and the natural

level is less than 0.05 mg/L. Contact your dentist if you&iacute;re

interested in fluoride drops.

<DT>Why are my water rates so high?

<DD>Each municipality is different. The GVRD charges a wholesale

rate to each member municipality and they are individual retailers:

rates are set by the municipality. In general, residential water

rates are among the lowest in North America.

<DT>Why is our tap water cloudy?

<DD>A major source of turbidity or cloudy water is sediment that

finds its way into the water system. This is noticeable during

periods of heavy, sustained rainfall when the forces of erosion

are at a maximum in the watersheds. Also our water is very soft

and corrosion occurs within the water distribution system. Corrosion

products (such as rust) can also discolour the water.

<DT>

<DD>There are a number of conditions which can result in local

turbidity upsets including construction or pipes being changed,

high flows due to a fire or a flusher truck filling, or high flows

due to hot weather. In general, anything that may change the flow

of water and cause it to sweep particles into the water current

may result in cloudy/coloured water. Unless there is a general

problem with cloudy water, flush the tap to clear up the problem.

If this does not work, contact your municipality to flush the

main(s) feeding the residence in question.

<DT>Why is there no backup plan when the water is cloudy?

<DD>There is a plan - the Westerly Transfer when completed in

1998 will enable us to remove either the Capilano or Seymour source

( these sources have the worst histories of turbidity) from service

and supply more of the distribution system with Coquitlam water,

which is usually unaffected by turbidity events. Future implementation

of filtration for the Seymour and Capilano sources will enable

the GVRD to supply clean, clear water from these two sources,

even during the heavy fall/winter rain season.

<DT>When will water metering start? Why not now?

<DD>There are studies currently underway. It is not feasible to

implement now due to the cost which is more than $100 million.

This is a major reason for having summer sprinkling restrictions

in place, to delay the need for water metering.

<DT>Why do we have sprinkling restrictions when we have so much

water?

<DD>Several reasons: growing population; limited storage capacity;

restrictions are very minimal and are a precautionary measure

to avoid more stringent restrictions or a total ban. They help

keep the cost of water supply down.

<DT>When are the sprinkling restrictions?

</DL>



<UL>

<LI><B>June 1 - September 30</B>

<LI><B>4 a.m. - 9 a.m. &amp; 7 p.m. - 10 p.m.</B>

<LI><B>EVEN numbered addresses - Wednesday &amp; Saturday</B>

<LI><B>ODD numbered addresses - Thursday &amp; Sunday</B>

<LI><B>Can we use the sprinkler on our vegetable/flower gardens?

</B>

</UL>



<DL>

<DT>

<DD>Under normal sprinkling restrictions, only lawns are affected

and you may use a sprinkler for watering vegetables, shrubs and

flowers. If conditions become more severe, then the GVRD and your

municipality will ask that you water your flowers, vegetables,

shrubs, etc. with a hand-held hose, with a spring loaded trigger

nozzle. There is no restriction on the times for this purpose,

but the best time to water your garden is first thing in the morning,

before the sun has become too hot.

<DT>What address do we go by in a townhouse complex or trailer

park?

<DD>The actual street address should be used to determine which

days for sprinkling, NOT the unit number.

<DT>Can the sprinkler be used by children to play?

<DD>Technically, this is against the restrictions, unless it is

during your allotted hours for sprinkling, however, children's

water toys are allowed within reason.

<DT>How can I possibly water my apartment building complex within

so few hours?

<DD>This is a question for the individual municipalities (listed

in the blue pages at the back of your telephone book). Some municipalities

will provide written exemptions in these cases.

<DT>How hard is my water?

<DD>The water is very soft because it is a surface water which

means it does not pick up minerals from the soil. The hardness

of the water is in the area of 5 milligrams per litre (ppm) which

is less than half a grain.

<DT>Why does my water taste and smell like chlorine?

<DD>The GVRD is required by the BC Safe Drinking Water Regulation

to disinfect the drinking water for health and safety reasons.

At present, we chlorinate at the source to secure a residual of

0.9 mg/L free chlorine after 10 minutes contact time.

<DT>

<DD>Occasionally, (most commonly during the late summer/early

fall or during the winter when the lakes are covered with ice)

low levels of ammonia arising from natural processes can be found

in the water. The ammonia combines with chlorine to produce chloramines

which have a very chlorinous taste and odour. This is not harmful

but can be very displeasing. The problem dissipates once sustained

rainfall or spring snowmelt occurs which results in a good exchange

of water through the lake.

<DT>Where can I get my water tested?

<DD>GVRD water is tested daily for microbiological and chemical/physical

characteristics. If you want your water tested, the GVRD does

not analyse water from private residences unless requested to

do so by the municipality or health department of the residence

in question. If you feel the water is unsafe to drink and are

concerned about your health, call your local health unit.

<DT>Where can I get water, other than GVRD water, tested?

<DD>We cannot recommend private labs but look up labs under &quot;analytical

laboratories&quot; in the yellow pages. Also, the health unit

in the area in question will provide free bacteriological analyses

where health concerns exist or drinking water quality is in question.

Contact your local health unit.

<H1>Wastewater System FAQ</H1>

<P>

<FONT SIZE=+2>(F</FONT>requently <FONT SIZE=+2>A</FONT>sked <FONT SIZE=+2>Q</FONT>uestions<FONT SIZE=+2>)</FONT>

<DL>

<DT><B>What does the Sewerage &amp; Drainage department do?</B>

<DD>Our core business is the collection and treatment of the wastewater

generated by 17 member municipalities in the Greater Vancouver

Regional District.

<DT><B>When I flush the toilet or have a shower, where does my

wastewater go?</B>

<DD>After leaving your home, it flows into your municipal sewer

system which connects to one of the regional sewer collection

systems.

<DD>The GVRD is divided into four sewerage areas: Vancouver, Lulu

Island, Fraser and North Shore. The wastewater from the three

North Shore municipalities goes to the Lions Gate Wastewater Treatment

Plant; from Vancouver, part of Burnaby, University Endowment Lands,

and Sea Island in Richmond it goes to the Iona Island Wastewater

Treatment plant; from Richmond it goes to Lulu Island Wastewater

Treatment plant; and the wastewater from the remaining municipalities

such as Delta, Surrey, most of Burnaby, Port Moody, Coquitlam,

Port Coquitlam, Langley township and district, Pitt Meadows and

Maple Ridge goes to the Annacis Island Wastewater Treatment plant.

The wastewater from the Walnut Grove area in the Township of Langley

is treated at the Northwest Langley secondary treatment plant.

<DT><B>What happens to the wastewater at the treatment plant?</B>

<DD>With the exception of the Northwest Langley plant which is

a secondary plant, the Region's wastewater goes through a primary

treatment process after which it is discharged through outfalls

into the receiving waters. The Lions Gate plant discharges into

Burrard Inlet, the Iona Plant into Georgia Strait, and Lulu, Northwest

Langley and Annacis discharge into the Fraser River. Currently

the Lulu Island and Annacis plants are being upgraded to provide

secondary treatment, scheduled for completion by the end of 1998.

<DT><B>How can I get a tour of a treatment plant?</B>

<DD>Contact the GVRD's Communications &amp; Education department

(604) 432-6339.

<DT><B>Is it safe to dump paint and other chemicals into the drain

or flush them down the toilet?</B>

<DD>No, it is harmful to the wastewater treatment process and

the environment. Please call the GVRD's recycling hot line, (604)732-9253

or 1-800-667-4321 for disposal information.

<DT><B>What are Combined Sewer Overflows?</B>

<DD>In some of the Region's older wastewater piping systems, in

Vancouver, Burnaby and New Westminster, both human sewage and

rainfall runoff were put into the same pipes. However, when it

rains hard there is not enough room in the pipes to carry the

combined flow and the system has to relieve itself by overflowing

untreated wastewater into pipes that discharge directly into the

receiving waters. Sometimes the flows in combined systems are

so large that the wastewater comes out of residential and business

plumbing.

<DT><B>Who should I contact when my storm sewer or, in the case

of a combined system, the combined sewer overflows into my residence

or business?</B>

<DD>In most cases you are connected to a sewer owned by the municipality

in which you live so you should call your city hall and not the

GVRD's Sewerage &amp; Drainage Department.

<DT><B>What is Nutrifor&#153;?</B>

<DD>Nutrifor is the trademark name the GVRD has registered for

its biosolids products.

<DT><B>What are biosolids?</B>

<DD>Biosolids are produced at wastewater treatment plants from

the organic material removed during the sewage treatment process.

Biosolids can be recycled as an organic fertilizer and soil amendment.

<DT><B>Are there any heavy metals in biosolids?</B>

<DD>The GVRD source control program is very effective at removing

heavy metals from industry before they enter the sewage system.

GVRD biosolids meet agriculture standards for low heavy metals

and are routinely tested to meet these stringent standards.

<DT><B>What about bugs in biosolids?</B>

<DD>Nasty bugs, pathogens and viruses, are killed by the digestion

process at the wastewater treatment plants. Mesophilic digesters

kill 99.9 per cent of all these bad bugs. Quality control laboratories

ensure the biosolids are safe for recycling.

<DT><B>What about other toxic materials?</B>

<DD>Although we are not a very industrialized region, the GVRD

monitors all kinds of other toxic products, (including PAH's,

PCB, dioxins, furans, etc.) to ensure they are not present in

wastewater or biosolids in significant quantities. Our biosolids

do not contain toxic materials at concentrations higher than normally

found in the environment.

<DT><B>What do we do with our biosolids?</B>

<DD>The Nutrifor program recycles all of the biosolids we produce.

Nutrifor has been used to grow trees faster, produce top soil

for highway projects, fertilize farmland, reclaim mine waste rock

piles and tailings ponds, recover old landfills and prevent soil

erosion in parks.

<DT><B>How are biosolids produced?</B>

<DD>Although there are a number of different processes to make

biosolids the GVRD collects sewage sludge at wastewater treatment

facilities, digests (a microbiological and heat treatment process)

the sludge then dewaters it to produce biosolids for recycling.

<DT><B>How can I find out more about biosolids and Nutrifor?</B>

<DD>The Nutrifor hot line to the GVRD Residuals Management is

(604) 451-6185. E-mail can be sent to nutrifor@gvrd.bc.ca

<DL>
<DT><B>Q. Is Stanley Park a regional park?</B> 
<DD>A. No, Stanley Park is operated by the City of Vancouver.
For information call (604) 257-8400.
<DT><B>Q. What is the difference between provincial and regional
parks?</B> 
<DD>A. Both regional parks and provincial parks are large natural
areas that provide many outdoor recreation opportunities. Regional
parks are the largest parks that can be found in the urban areas,
and normally are visited by people from within the urban area.
There are 25 regional parks within sixty miles of downtown Vancouver;
they are located closer to the cities and towns that make up the
Lower Mainland. By contrast there are only seven provincial parks
within this same area. Provincial parks often protect natural
areas that are unique in the entire province, while regional parks
protect the landscapes that make up this particular part of the
province. For information on provincial parks call (604) 924-2200.
For information on regional parks call (604)432-6350.
<DT><B>Q. Where can I camp in regional parks?</B> 
<DD>A. You can camp along the Fraser River in Derby Reach Regional
Park, Langley Township, or at Matsqui Trail Regional Park, Abbotsford,
between March 1 and November 30. All campers must register and
pay a fee. For more information call GVRD East Area Parks office
at (604) 530-4983.
<DT><B>Q. How do I rent Minnekhada Lodge?</B> 
<DD>A. Call GVRD Parks' Bookings and Facilities office at (604)
432-6352 (between 9 a.m. and 3:30 p.m., Monday to Friday) for
rental information on Minnekhada Lodge (Minnekhada Regional Park,
Coquitlam) and many other facilities. We can also mail you a brochure
featuring information on all of our reservable facilities.
<DT><B>Q. Where do I find information on special events and interpretive
programs?</B> 
<DD>A. Call GVRD Parks' program registration office at (604) 432-6359.
We will send you our current listing of activities and/or add
your name to our mailing list to receive a program brochure three
times a year.
<DT><B>Q. In which parks can I go mountain biking or cycling?</B>

<DD>A. You are welcome to ride your mountain bike in Pacific Spirit
Regional Park (near UBC) on designated trails. For other cycling
opportunities visit Iona Beach Regional Park (Richmond) or Matsqui
Trail Regional Park (Abbotsford).
<DT><B>Q. Which parks offer hiking trails?</B> 
<DD>A. Belcarra Regional Park (Port Moody, Belcarra), Minnekhada
Regional Park (Coquitlam), Kanaka Creek Regional Park (Maple Ridge),
Capilano River Regional Park (North/West Vancouver), Crippen Regional
Park (Bowen Island), and Pacific Spirit Regional Park (near UBC).
Detailed trail information is included in park maps, available
from park kiosks.
<DT><B>Q. Where can I find information on natural history in regional
parks?</B> 
<DD>A. Some information is in park brochures, available from park
kiosks. You are also welcome to contact our interpretive specialists;
please call GVRD Parks main office at (604) 432-6350 and your
call will be directed to the appropriate specialist. If you like,
bring your questions to our two visitor centres at Burnaby Lake
Regional Park (4519 Piper Avenue, Burnaby) and Campbell Valley
Regional Park (corner of 8th Ave. and 200th St., Langley), which
are open weekends from late May to the Labour Day weekend.
<DT><B>Q. What are your parks opening and closing hours?</B> 
<DD>A. Most parks are generally open from 8 a.m. to dusk.

<H1>Creating Our Future: the CD-ROM
</H1>
<P>The CD-ROM, <CITE>Creating Our Future,</CITE> contains three interactive computer simulations 
to help the players learn more about choices they can make to improve the environment in the next 
30 years. You can purchase the CD-ROM at <A HREF="http://www.scienceworld.bc.ca">Science World</A>, 
or <A HREF="http://www.scienceworld.bc.ca/TOYS.HTML">order it from their gift shop</A>.

alt="Picture of a teen-aged girl">Help! Alice has been digitized right into a computer simulation of 
the environment in the Greater Vancouver Region, thirty years from now, in the 2020's. 
It was a strange experience for her, and a little disorienting... like stepping through the
"looking glass!"  Things are a little backwards. She thinks she actually belongs in the future
and is trapped here in our present. She wants to get home to the future, but the only way she 
can get out of the simulation is to find a way to improve the environment. Ironically, if and when she
does get out, it may indeed be the future.</P>
<P>
What kind of future will it be, though?  The one that the programmers created in the simulation
is not very nice. There is so much smog and garbage, and not enough
water, that she decided to do something about it. She has found a way to use the viewport on 
the simulator to talk to you; but only when the programmers are not around.  Additionally, she
has figured out a way for <b>you</b> to change the programmer's assumptions about human behaviour
and affect the simulation results for the future. If you do change the factors and improve the
environment, Alice can get home.  More on that later.
</P>
<P>Right now, you can use your <A HREF="/go/arch/software.html#quicktime">Quicktime player</A> to hear what 
Alice says about this.

<H2>The Environmental Simulator</H2>
<P>The simulator allows you to go through parts of a house and make decisions about things you 
find there. There is a floorplan map of the house so you can see where you are, and the viewport on 
the simulator flies you to wherever you want to go!

</P>
<P>Alice's plan for you has one problem: the simulator might detect your presence and mistake your changes
for a computer virus! The longer you take and the more wrong choices you make, the more likely it is that
the <I>Virus Detector</I> will find you. Alice will warn you, if it is getting close, by flashing the light 
in the upper left corner of the control panel.

<HR>
<H2>Now it's up to you</H2>
<P>
</P>Once you are inside the house, Alice will give you advice on how you are doing and what to do next. 
But, finding your way through the house and making the choices is up to you. The simulator will help you
see what differences your choices are making... better for you, or better for the Earth. Sometimes you
can make choices that are "Win / Win" and are better for everyone.
</P>
<P>There are three different simulations:
<OL>
<LI>Air Quality & Transportation
<LI>Drinking Water & Wastewater
<LI>Waste Reduction and Recycling
</OL>
</P>
<P>Each has its own challenges. If you don't get it right the first time, Alice will advise you on what
to do differently on your next time around.  Each time you finish going through the house, you can run
the simulation to see how your changes (if adopted by others too) will affect the future, 30 years from now.
</P>
<P><IMG ALIGN=left SRC="../av_media/simulate.gif" HSPACE=10 ALT="Simulator results showing conditions are worse">
It's not always easy, but with time, you will learn how to make a positive affect on the future. Sometimes 
it is the smallest thing, that you usually take for granted, that will make the difference. Once you see the
difference in the simulator, can you also make those changes in your daily life? Try it! In thirty years, 
the "Alice's" of this world will actually be living with your decisions of today.

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>A Statistical Profile of Greater Vancouver, Canada</H2>

<HR>

<P><I>Greater Vancouver Key Facts</I> has been prepared to provide a 

comprehensive statistical picture of Greater Vancouver. 

Key Facts is published annually in the summer.  It is available both 

<A HREF="#download"><B>electronically</B></A> and in

<H2>THE GREATER VANCOUVER METROPOLITAN AREA</H2>



<P>

The Greater Vancouver region is located at the southwest corner

of the British Columbia mainland.  The Greater Vancouver Regional

District occupies 2,930 square kilometres at the mouth of the

Fraser River.

<P>

Greater Vancouver's setting, combined with its situation as the

key coastal port for Western Canada and its history, results in

an interesting mix of large and small communities.

<P>

The metropolitan community is centered on the City of Vancouver

on the Burrard Peninsula.  The adjoining municipalities to the

east, Burnaby, New Westminster, Coquitlam, Port Coquitlam, and

Port Moody share the Burrard Peninsula.  West Vancouver, Lions

Bay, North Vancouver City and District, Belcarra and Anmore are

located on the south slope of the Coastal Mountain range separated

from the peninsular communities by Burrard Inlet.  South of the

peninsula are the municipalities of Richmond, Delta, Surrey, White

Rock, Langley City and Township.  Maple Ridge and Pitt Meadows,

located to the north, joined the Greater Vancouver Regional Distict

(GVRD) in July 1995.  These communities are separated from the

peninsula by the Fraser River.

<P>

Together, these twenty municipalities make up both the Greater

Vancouver Regional District (GVRD) and Census Metropolitan Area

(CMA). A CMA is a large urbanized core together with adjacent

urban and rural areas which have a high degree of economic and

social integration.

<H1>Creating Our Future</H1>
<H2>The Livable Region Strategic Plan</H2>
<P>
The purpose of the Livable Region Strategic Plan is to help realize the 
<A HREF="work.html#vision"> "Creating Our Future" vision</A>
 through Greater Vancouver's land use and transportation development.
<P>
The Livable Region Strategic Plan is the result of a four year public 
and intergovernmental consultation process. Early in the process, the 
public rejected a business-as-usual approach to regional growth that 
would spread population throughout the Fraser Valley. They rejected 
it because it would put development pressure on farmland, increase 
the distance between jobs and housing, cost too much for public 
services and utilities, and result in worsening air pollution from 
increased automobile use. The Strategic Plan provides a clear 
alternative that is more in keeping with the values of Creating Our
Future.


<P><A NAME="menu"></A>
The Strategic Plan, incorporating policies, targets and maps, is based upon four 
 fundamental strategies:

<LI><A HREF=" ../../planning/bro/spchoic.html">Increase Transportation Choice</A>
</UL>
<P>You may also be interested in <A HREF="/planning/bro/splanfaq.html"><B>Frequently Asked Questions</B></A> 
about GVRD Strategic Planning.
<P>
The region is expected to grow to almost three million residents by 2021, 
and the consequences would be severe if this growth follows current trends. 
Continuing the present suburban shift of jobs and housing will lead to even 
greater increases in dispersed commuting trips and to a deepening of regional 
automobile dependence.
<P>
Proposals to alter regional growth into a more compact and sustainable 
form have been offered in the GVRD's Livable Region Strategy and in the 
joint regional and provincial Transport 2021 project. They have been 
approved in principle by the GVRD Board.
<P>
These proposals stress the need to give higher priority to travel 
by walking, cycling, or public transit, and emphasize the creation 
of more complete communities, where the need for travel is reduced 
by providing work, goods and services within easy reach of local residents.

<H1>Air Quality</H1>
<P>Air is one of the most basic requirements for life. 
Without clean air, most living things cannot survive. 
And yet it's probably the natural resource we most take for granted. 
Clean air is colourless and odourless. It doesn't cost anything (yet) 
and there seems to be an abundant supply. We tend to ignore the 
presence of clean air. We only notice it when it's missing.
The documents below will give you more detail on the air quality of 
the greater Vancouver region.

<H2><A NAME="overview">Overview</A></H2>
<P>In British Columbia, we are blessed with an abundance of natural resources, 
including clean air. In the Lower Fraser Valley, where 54 per cent of the province's 
population lives, clean air is a major concern of residents and vistors. Most of
the  year, regional air quality is good. It easily meets federal objectives that have 
been established to regulate levels of air pollutants. However, at certain times 
of the year, usually in the late spring and summer, our air quality can deteriorate 
to unacceptable levels. Occasionally, the air quality problem in Lower Fraser Valley 
is one of the most serious in Canada.


<P><STRONG>Strategy</STRONG>
<BR>Coordinating air quality efforts with both the federal and provincial 
governments, and at the same time, preserving air quality without unduly 
stifling economic activity, is a challenging task, one the GVRD's 
<A HREF="../../air/bro/aqmp.html">Air Quality Management 
Plan</A> (AQMP) adopted in December, 1994 attempts to address.

<P><STRONG>Monitoring</STRONG>
<BR>Having accurate air quality measurements is an essential part of the
solution to the air quality problem. The GVRD operates one of the most 
extensive ambient <A HREF="../../air/bro/aqmeasu.html">air
quality monitoring</A>  networks in North America.  This network has provided much of the data used to identify the 
air quality issues and <A HREF="../../air/bro/aqprior.html">priorities</A>  
in the GVRD.

<P><STRONG>Sources & Solutions</STRONG>
<BR>Air pollution is a difficult problem to control. There are many 
different <A HREF="../../air/bro/aqsourc.html">sources of
emissions</A>, spread over a wide area. Large-scale  industrial operations, commercial facilities such as dry cleaners and 
gas stations, home furnaces,  fireplaces, cars,  trucks, buses - all 
contribute to air pollution. There is no one single solution to the 
problem. In fact, there are as many <A
HREF="../../air/bro/aqsolut.html">solutions  to the problem</A> as there are sources.

<P><STRONG>What Next?</STRONG>
<BR>What does the future hold for air quality in the Fraser Valley? 
What are the <A HREF="../../air/bro/aqnext.html">next
steps</A> that GVRD plans to implement in the next ten  years and beyond? In 
<A HREF="../../air/bro/aqualit.html">conclusion</A> is
this the right time for addressing  this problem or is it too late
to make a  difference? What can <A HREF="../../air/bro/aqyou.html">you</A> do to help?

<STRONG>Just how wasteful are we?</STRONG><BR>
 <IMG SRC="../medarch/waste/van_dump.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT VSPACE=15
HSPACE=15 ALT="Image of B.C. Place overflowing with garbage">
Every man, woman and child in Canada produces 1.7 kg of waste per capita per 
day. That's more than Americans or Australians, more than Europeans, almost
twice as  much as people in Japan and Sweden, and more than three times as much as the 
people in China.
<P>
In 1989, over 1.2 million tonnes of municipal waste was produced in the Greater 
Vancouver Regional District-enough to fill B.C. Place Stadium to overflowing! 
This will increase to 1.6 million tonnes by the year 2000, unless
something is done to prevent it.

<P>
<STRONG>A Time for Change</STRONG><BR>
The year 2000 is a target date set by the federal and provincial governments for a 
50 per cent reduction of waste disposal. In order to accomplish
this goal, we must  practise the 3Rs- Reduce, Reuse and Recycle. 
<P>

<STRONG>Reduce, Reuse, Recycle</STRONG><BR>
First of all, we must reduce the amount of garbage
we produce. We can do this by  practising selective shopping. We can cut out buying
unnecessary products; we  can cut down on excess packaging.
<P>
Secondly, we must reuse products. This means
where possible we must purchase  non-disposable and reusable items. We must also consider repairing what we 
already have instead of throwing it out.
<P>
Finally, we must recycle part of the waste we
generate. Traditionally, we  have viewed waste as garbage and not as
a resource.  With programs for the 
collection, processing and marketing of recyclables, we 
have the opportunity to divert much of our garbage. Materials such
as newspaper,  glass, metal and plastic can be reused to manufacture new products.
<P>
We must respond to the challenge by changing our <A
HREF="../../waste/bro/swici.html">industrial and 
commercial</A> practices, our <A HREF="../../waste/bro/swreduc.html">household</A> 
habits and, most importantly, our attitudes.

<H1>Wastewater System</H1>
<P>
Water covers more than 70 per cent of the globe's surface but only three per cent is fresh water.
This  makes fresh water one of our most precious resources. We depend on it for survival.
<P>
In using fresh water, we sometimes pollute it. Since water must be returned to the 
rivers and sea, we must first remove the pollutants. If we don't, we will end up 
with an unhealthy environment.
<P> <IMG SRC="../medarch/sewer/lgliqu.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT HSPACE=80 VSPACE=16>
This is why wastewater treatment plants are so important. They remove many of the 
pollutants in the water so we can continue to enjoy a clean, healthy environment.

<P><A NAME="dam"><STRONG>Where water comes from</STRONG> </A></P>
<P>Few of us give more than a passing thought to where our water comes from. 
Like magic, we turn on the tap countless times each day and out pours some of the
best quality drinking water of any large urban area in the world.</P>


<P>A raindrop's journey from cloud to tap is a long and complex one. By the time a
raindrop becomes one of millions to pour from your tap, it has spent more than half its 
life cycle travelling through one of Greater Vancouver's three watersheds.</P>

<P><A HREF="../../water/bro/watman.html">The Greater Vancouver Watersheds</A> are mountainous areas where the snowmelt, creeks
and streams flow to the valley bottom to three large supply lakes. Our watersheds are
within the mountains on the North Shore and north of Coquitlam.</P>

<A NAME="1dam"></A>
<P>The three mountainous watersheds - <A HREF="../../water/bro/watman.html">Capilano, Seymour and Coquitlam</A> - are protected
lands collecting and holding water for 1.8 million people. The three watersheds cover
58,500 hectares, an area the size of about 145 Stanley Parks.</P>

<P>Access to the watersheds is limited to protect the region's water supply from
human contamination. Partly because of this, a degree of mystery has evolved around
the vast tracts of forested mountains. Increasingly, people want to know where the
watersheds are, how big they are, how they function and how they are being managed.</P> 

<P>This document is intended to provide background information on the GVRD's three watersheds,
describing their key role in the overall water supply system, as well as the 
management challenges they present.</P>

Let the men from the 1900s take you back in time</A> </CENTER>
<H4>History</H4>
<P>The watersheds, as we know them today, have changed much in form and character since the
movement of ancient glaciers molded the valleys that are now such an integral part of our 
water system. Over the last 100 years humans have also left their imprint.</P>

<STRONG>Protecting your health</STRONG>
<P>The GVRD takes samples from the rivers and reservoirs of each watershed to monitor bacteria
and other characteristics. Most samples are tested in the GVRD laboratory.
In addition, hydrological monitoring is helping the GVRD to maintain a <A HREF="../../water/bro/wathel.html">high quality water supply</A>,
and to build a better understanding of the natural processes in each watershed that can affect drinking water
quality such as erosion, wildlife, forest health and the effects of forest fires.</P>

<A HREF="#top">Top of page</A>


<H4>Watershed Management</H4>
<P>The Regional District's <A HREF="../../water/bro/watman.html">watershed management</A> 
program is designed to minimize the effects of slides, soil erosion and wildfires on our drinking water quality, 
should they occur.

<P>The three watersheds are characterized by steep terrain and heavy rainfall. With protection and maintenance
of water quality as the sole objective, watershed management activities are designed to protect
against large scale and potentially damaging natural occurrences. In  this context, a range of water
quality improvement projects is undertaken including stream clearing, stream bank stabilization, removal
of fire prone trees, silviculture, <A HREF="../../water/bro/watman.html#monitoring">hydrologic monitoring,</A> forest research, 
<A HREF="../../water/bro/watman.html#fire">fire protection</A> and <A HREF="../../water/bro/watman.html#road">maintenance</A>

<H1>The Nature Legacy and Regional Parks</H1>
<P>
Vancouver's world-famous Stanley Park is a precious gem. A pearl.
<P>
With the recent addition of lands from the Lower Mainland Nature<BR>

Legacy the GVRD's parks system has grown in size to the equivalent of<BR>

28 Stanley Parks. A string of pearls adorning The Livable Region. </P><BR>

<P>
Over time, some treasures diminish. Not these. <BR>
<P>
Their wonder will last forever.
<P>
<H2> Greater Vancouver the Big Winner<BR>
in Nature Legacy Program</H2> </CENTER>
<P> 
GVRD residents already proud of their spectacular outdoor setting have even more
reason to rejoice. As of June, their amount of dedicated parkland almost quadrupled,
from about 21,000 hectares to more than 80,000 hectares.
<P>

<P>In addition to the creation of two new large provincial parks in the
Indian Arm and Pinecone-Burke Mountain areas, new regional parkland secures key
pieces of the GVRD'S Green Zone, a critical building block of its Livable Region
Strategic Plan.
<P> 
One thousand, eight hundred and ninety-two hectares, including five new regional
parks, and extensions to six existing parks, brings the total size of the impressive
GVRD park system to  11,320 hectares spread among 25 parks.
<P>
<A HREF="../medarch/todo/sumas1.jpeg"><IMG SRC="../medarch/todo/sumas1.gif" VSPACE=10 HSPACE=10 ALIGN=LEFT 
ALT="[Photo of Sumas Mnt.]"></A>
<P>
The new parkland is part of the $71.4 million Lower Mainland Nature
Legacy, a program financed by the Province of B.C., GVRD, the Federal Government and
several municipalities.
<P> 
There are many benefits to GVRD residents. New parkland has been secured in high
growth areas so that
Increasing recreation demands can be better met. Public access to waterfronts can be
improved, and threatened regional features and habitats conserved.
<P> <A HREF="../medarch/todo/pineco.jpeg"><IMG SRC="
../medarch/todo/pineco.gif" VSPACE=10 HSPACE=10 ALIGN=RIGHT ALT="[Photo of 
Burke Mountain]"></A>  
In 1994, the GVRD created the Heritage Parkland Acquisition Fund in response to
strong public support for acquiring and protecting regional wildlife and recreation
lands while affordable and still available. When the Province of B.C. initiated
Nature Legacy discussions, GVRD was ready, willing and able to join in and help
determine which critical parkland sites should be purchased.
<P> 
The properties were acquired through contributions of land and money from the
Province of B.C. (49,150 hectares), Delta, Surrey. Port Coquitlam, Coquitlam, Langley
Township, and Environment Canada. GVRD contributed $12.8 million, and also
transferred its lands at Granite Falls Regional Park to the new provincial park in
Indian Arm.
<P><A HREF="../medarch/todo/parkmap.jpeg"><IMG SRC="
../medarch/todo/parkmap.gif" VSPACE=10 HSPACE=10 ALIGN=LEFT ALT="[Photo of 
Nature Legacy Map]"></A> 
In addition, two major land gifts each worth $1 million - one at lona Beach
and one on Douglas Island - were received from Canadian Forest products.
<P>
A look at the map tells the story: from Richmond to Abbotsford, from Belcarra to
Delta, the new sites go a long way to enhancing our recreational opportunities
protecting wildlife and creating a heritage waterway.
<P>  <A HREF="../medarch/todo/pineco2.jpeg"><IMG SRC="
../medarch/todo/pineco2.gif" VSPACE=10 HSPACE=10 ALIGN=RIGHT ALT="[Photo of 
Pinecone Lake]"></A> 
The Fraser River component of the Nature Legacy is particularly impressive. Lands
were acquired at Surrey Bend, Douglas Island, Barnston Island, Don and Lion Islands,
Poplar Island, Brae Island, and Colony Farm. New lands were added to Derby Reach,
Glen Valley and lona Beach.
<P> 
Combined with provincial wildlife reserves along the Fraser, there will now be more
than 80 kilometres of riverfront for residents to explore!

The cost of most services is apportioned on a property assessment basis. The funds are collected by the municipalities in muncipal tax bills and remitted to the GVRD. Allocations for hospitals and Regional District (parks, air quality control, 9-1-1 etc.) are specifically listed on the municipal tax notice. GVRD costs for other services, like water and sewer, are included in your municipal levy.

If your 1995 residential assessment is 50% higher ($432,000) you will likely pay about 50% more in taxes; if your 1995 residential assessment is 50% lower ($144,000) you will pay about 50% less in taxes. Where no figure is shown it means the municipality does not participate in this regional service. Maple Ridge and Pitt Meadows were not full members of the GVRD at time of writing but are expected to be shortly.<P>NOTES<P>The figures vary for municipalities because of differing agreements for service provided in some communities and differences in property assessments. Property assessments are determined by the B.C. Assessment Authority. <P>Under Regional District: <BR>-	The figures for Anmore and Belcarra include the Sasamat Volunteer Fire Department<P>Under Solid Waste: <BR>-	The City of Vancouver owns and operates the Vancouver Landfill in Delta. Waste from Vancouver residents is disposed at cost and Delta residents have free disposal. The figures shown are for recycling. The City of Surrey owns and operates the Port Mann Landfill and receives a similar financial benefit.<P>Under Water:<BR>-	West Vancouver obtains some of its water supply from Eagle Lake, which is under its jurisdiction. <HR>[<A HREF="#top">Top of the page</A>][<A HREF="#inc">Next</A>]<PRE></PRE>  <H3><A NAME="inc">$16 Increase for the Average Homeowner</A>  </H3><P> The 1995 final budget for the Greater Vancouver Regional District is $319.8 million, a reduction of  $3.8 million from the provisional budget adopted by the Board of Directors in December. The final  budget is up 4.5 per cent over last year.<P>While the impact will vary from municipality to municipality the average homeowner will pay $16 more in GVRD taxes this year. Total Regional District taxes on an average home will be $291. The figure is based on a house with a 1995 assessed value of $288,000. If your assessment is higher you will in most instances pay more than this, if your assessment is lower you will in most instances pay less.<P>There are about 460,000 owners of single family homes, condos, townhouses, and duplexes in Greater Vancouver.<P>Of the $16 increase, $9 will go to the regional water system, $5 to the sewerage system, $1 to solid waste management programs, and $1 to hospital capital programs (construction and equipment). <P>The budget covers all GVRD functions including water supply, sewers, hospital construction and equipment, solid waste management, regional parks, air quality control, strategic planning, labour relations, and the 9-1-1- emergency phone service.<HR>[<A HREF="#top">Top of the page</A>][<A HREF="#dol">Next</A>]<PRE></PRE>  <H3><A NAME="dol">1995 GVRD Tax Dollar</A> </H3><H4>Where It Goes</H4> <PRE>Hospital construction/equipment					.35 cents 	 (19 cents of this is covered by Provincial grants)Sewerage							.22 centsSolid waste/recycling						.18 centsWater								.15 centsParks								.04 centsAir quality							.02 centsStrategic planning						.01 centsLabour relations						.01 centsGeneral administration						.01 cents9-1-1 emergency phone						.01 cents						Total	      $1.00</PRE><H4>Where It Comes From</H4><PRE>Member municipalities 						.77 cents(tax requisitions and user charges)Provincial Government						.19 cents(mostly hospital funding)Fees and licences						.02 centsSteam sales 							.01 cents(steam generated at Burnaby Incinerator)Surplus/Revenue							.01 cents						Total	      $1.00</PRE><HR>[<A HREF="#top">Top of the page</A>][<A HREF="#wat">Next</A>]<PRE></PRE>  <H3><A NAME="wat">GVRD Water System</A> </H3> <P><UL> <LI>One of the largest systems in North America, covering nearly 2,000 square kilometres and serving 1.8 million people.

<H1>GVRD Board of Directors 1996</H1> 

<P>

The GVRD's Board of Directors comprises elected representatives from the 22
communities in the metropolitan area.
<P>
Directors representing municipalities are appointed from their local council,
for a one-year term. In most cases the appointee is the Mayor. In the electoral
areas, which are unicorporated and do not have councils, regional Directors are
elected by the voters of the respective areas, to three-year terms.
<P>
Each municipality has one Board vote for every 20,000 of population. The most
recent Canada Census statistics are used in determining population figures. No
Director may hold more than five votes, with the result that the largest
municipalities in population - Vancouver, Surrey, Burnaby and Richmond - have
more than one Director.
<P>
The 1995 Board has 30 Directors with a total of 92 votes.
<P>

Bacteria are the primary decomposing organism, but there are many others, including fungi, actinomycetes, worms and beetles. These organisms bring about decomposition by feeding on organic material. The result is compost or humus, a dark, nutrient-rich soil conditioner.<P>While our ancestors recognized that composting was useful in building soil and growing healthy plants, they didn't know how or why it worked. Much of the how and why of composting has arisen out of the explosion of interest and research into composting over the last 50 years. This research has produced a body of information that we call the science of composting.<P>Any organic material in the natural environment will decompose over time. Composting,as a science, looks at the factors that enable decomposition to proceed more quickly and efficiently by managing or controlling these factors.   <P><H4>Organic Material</H4>Any organic material can be added to the compost. For our purposes organic material is everything growing in the backyard and most food waste, especially fruit and vegetable scraps. Weeds, leaves, plant trimmings, apple cores, tea bags and potato peels are organic. Wood and large twigs are organic, but may take too long to decompose to be of practical use in composting. Also see <AHREF="swmfc.html">Materials for Composting</A> and <A HREF="swcnr.html">Carbon/Nitrogen Ratios for Composting Materials</A>; to view this page your browser must support tables.<P><H4>Decomposing Organisms</H4>Decomposing organisms are all the micro-organisms and larger organisms involved in breaking down organic material. Bacteria are the primary decomposing micro-organism. They arrive with the organic material, and start the process by breaking down the organic material for their own food. Bacteria grow and multiply while conditions are right for them, and die off as they create conditions more favourable for others. Bacteria, actinomycetes and fungi all consume waste directly and are known as first-level decomposers (see Food Web of the Compost Pile diagram). They are assisted by larger organisms - earthworms, beetle mites, sowbugs, whiteworms, and flies - which also consume waste directly. <P>First-level decomposing micro-organisms are eaten by second-level decomposers such as springtails, mold mites, feather-winged beetles, protozoa and rotifers. Third-level decomposers eat both first and second-level decomposers and include centipedes,rove beetles, ants and predatory mites. Organisms at each level of the food web help keep populations of the lower levels in check. <H3 ALIGN=CENTER>Food Web of the Compost Pile</H3><IMG SRC="../av_media/web.gif" ALT=[image of food web]><P><H4>Micro-Organisms - Chemical Decomposers</H4><P><H4>Bacteria </H4> Bacteria are abundant. There may be millions in a gram of soil; you would need 25,000laid end to end on a ruler to make 2.54 cm (an inch). They exist on every piece of organic matter even though you can't see them. When exposed to organic tissue, bacteria "invade" - eating and digesting the tissue, breaking it down into simpler forms for other bacteria and organisms to consume. As a group, bacteria are considered to be nutritionally diverse, which means that they can eat almost anything, living or dead.    <P>Bacteria require both nitrogen and carbon that come from organic materials. The more variety, the greater likelihood they will find a blend of essential nutrients. Bacteria use carbon (C) as a source of energy and, by oxidizing carbon, generate heat and carbon dioxide (CO2). Nitrogen (N) is their main source of protein, which is needed for body building and population growth. <P>Given the proper environmental conditions, bacteria reproduce very quickly by binary fission. Their nuclei split in two and new cell walls grow crosswise over the middle of the cells. Then they do it again and again. The lifespan of one generation of bacteria is as short as 20 to 30 minutes. With sufficent food and other favourable conditions, one gram of bacteria could become .4536 kg (a pound) in three hours and the size of the earth in one and a half days. Of course, these conditions neverexist.<P>There are two types of composting processes: aerobic and anaerobic - and different species of bacteria occur in each process. Aerobic composting uses oxygen. Rapid, high-temperature composting is mostly aerobic. This is the recommended method for residential composting. <P>When there is little air and high moisture, anaerobic composting is likely to result.Anaerobic means without oxygen. In an anaerobic process fermentation results in the formation of ammonia-like substances and hydrogen sulfide, which smells like rotting eggs. The anaerobic process is not recommended for backyard composting. <P>Temperature is an important variable in composting. As temperatures rise and fall in the compost, different bacterial species will become more or less active. Psychrophilic bacteria, mesophilic bacteria and thermophilic bacteria each operate best within specific temperature ranges.<P>The psychrophiles are the first to go to work. They can work in temperatures below 0 <FONT SIZE="-2">degrees<FONT SIZE="+0"> C (as low as -18 <FONTSIZE="-2">degrees<FONT SIZE="+0"> C), but are most active around 13 <FONTSIZE="-2">degrees<FONT SIZE="+0"> C. They are a cooler temperature aerobic bacteria that burn or oxidize carbon and generate some heat. Often they generate enough heat to make conditions tolerable for the next group of bacteria called mesophiles.<P>Most decomposition work is done by mesophilic bacteria. These are the mid-range bacteria that operate in temperatures between 15 <FONT SIZE="-2">degrees<FONTSIZE="+0">  and 40 <FONT SIZE="-2">degrees<FONT SIZE="+0"> C, but thrive when temperatures are closest to 21 to 32 <FONT SIZE="-2">degrees<FONT SIZE="+0"> C. Heatgenerated as a by-product of the mesophiles' work will raise the temperature in the pile even more, creating conditions suitable for thermophilic composting.<P>The thermophiles do "hot" composting. They start to take over when temperatures reach 40 to 45 <FONT SIZE="-2">degrees<FONT SIZE="+0"> C and will continue to work intemperatures up to about 70 <FONT SIZE="-2">degrees<FONT SIZE="+0"> C when their numbers start to decline. Thermophiles work quickly and don't live long, three to five days at most. Turning the pile will provide oxygen (O2) and allow the thermophilic bacteria to continue their activity. As temperatures drop and thermophiles die off, the compost moves into a more mature stage. Mesophiles and psychrophiles, which may have been working in a reduced capacity around the cooler edges of the decomposing organic material, will become more active.    <P>    <STRONG>Actinomycetes</STRONG><BR>Actinomycetes are a higher form of bacteria, similar to fungi, and second in number to bacteria. They don't respond well to acidic conditions (below pH5) or high moisture conditions, but operate best at medium temperature areas of the compost. Actinomycetes take over during the final stages of decomposition, often producing antibiotics that inhibit bacterial growth. They are likely to work on tough organic material and give compost its pleasant, earthy smell. They are especially important in the formation of humus. They liberate carbon (C), nitrate nitrogen (NO3) and ammonium nitrate (NH4), making nutrients available to plants.<P><STRONG>Fungi</STRONG><BR> Fungi are smaller in number than bacteria or actinomycetes, but larger in body mass. Fungi are simple organisms that lack a photosynthetic pigment. The individual cells have a nucleus surrounded by a membrane and they may be linked together in long filaments. Fungi live on dead or dying material and obtain energy by breaking down organic material. Like actinomycetes, fungi are present during the early and final stages of composting, when the organic material has been changed to a more digestibleform. Of the major micro-organisms, fungi function best under acidic conditions. <P><STRONG>Macro-Organisms - Physical Decomposers</STRONG><BR>Macro-organisms are the visible organisms involved in transforming organic material into compost. They are more active in the later, mature stages of composting, when temperatures are dropping but decomposition isn't complete. Micro-organisms decomposechemically, while macro-organisms are higher up in the food chain and decompose physically - by digging, grinding, chewing, digesting, sucking and churning. <P><STRONG>Ants</STRONG><BR> - Ants are insects with six legs, a head, thorax andabdomen. Ants feed on a variety of materials in the compost. They may bring fungi and minerals such as potassium and phosphorous into the compost.<P><STRONG>Millipedes</STRONG><BR> - A millipede is thick-skinned with dark redsegments. There are many segments, each with two pairs of legs, but not the thousand that "milli"implies. They eat soft decaying vegetation. They will roll up in a ball when they are indanger.<P><STRONG>Snails and Slugs</STRONG><BR> - Snails and slugs are molluscs that travel ina creeping movement. Snails have a spiral shell with a distinct head and a foot thatis retractable. Slugs are without a shell and somewhat bullet-shaped with antennae ontheir front section. Both feed on living plant material but you find them in thecompost attacking plant debris. <P><STRONG>Nematodes</STRONG><BR> - Nematodes (round worms) are the most abundantinvertebrates in the soil. Some nematodes live on decaying organic matter, while others are predators on other nematodes, bacteria, algae, protozoa and fungal spores. There are also pest forms of nematodes that attack plant roots. <P><STRONG>Fermentation mites</STRONG><BR> - Fermentation mites, also called mold mites,are transparent-bodied creatures that feed on yeasts in fermenting masses of organic matter. These mites are able to withstand anaerobic conditions for moderate periods of time, and may be a good indicator of these conditions in the compost. They eat plant material, such as the soft tissue of leaves.<P><STRONG>Springtails</STRONG><BR> - Springtails are small insects distinguished bytheir ability to jump when disturbed. They are principally fungi-feeders, though they also eat molds and nematodes and chew on decomposing plants. They vary in colour from white to blue to black.<P><STRONG>Spiders</STRONG><BR> - Spiders are eight-legged creatures and third-levelconsumers that feed on insects and small invertebrates.<P><STRONG>Centipedes</STRONG><BR> - Centipedes are flattened and segmented with onepair of legs in each segment. They have 15 or more pairs of legs. They are third-level consumers, feeding on soil invertebrates their size or larger. This means they are unwelcome in a worm bin as they may attack and kill the worms.<P><STRONG>Sow bugs</STRONG><BR> - Sow bugs have a flat and oval body with distinctsegments and ten pairs of legs. They are first-level consumers that feed on rotting woody materials and other durable tissues like leaf veins. Pill bugs look similar to sow bugs but roll up in a ball when disturbed.  <P><STRONG>Flies</STRONG><BR> - Flies are two-winged insects that feed on almost anykind of organic material. They also act as airborne carriers of bacteria. Wherever they land, they deposit bacteria. Aerate your compost once a week to control.<P><STRONG>Whiteworms</STRONG><BR> - Whiteworms (potworms) or enchytraeids (en kee tray'id) are about an inch long. They help finish off compost by breaking particles of material down into smaller pieces.  <STRONG>Earthworms</STRONG><BR> - Earthworms are the most important of all the largerdecomposers in the compost pile. There are over 60 species of earthworms in North America. The one we most often find in compost or manure piles is the red wriggler (Eisenia foetida). They are about five cm long with alternating segments of buff and maroon. Lumbricus rubellus is another earthworm that lives in compost. They consume bacteria,fungi, protozoa and organic matter. As they digest organic material, they leave nutrient-rich castings in their path. Unlike other large decomposers, they break down material both physically and chemically. The dew worm (Lumbricus terrestris) and other species of earthworms will also visit your compost.   <P><H4>Key Factors That Affect Composting</H4>Compost variables are the factors affecting the speed of composting. The organisms that make compost need food, air and water. Provide them with a favourable balance of food, air and water and they will make compost quickly. Other variables affecting the speed of composting include temperature, surface area and volume. <P><STRONG>Food</STRONG><BR>Organic material is food for bacteria and other organisms. This organic material or food contains carbon and nitrogen. Bacteria use carbon (C) for energy and nitrogen (N) for protein to grow and reproduce. <P>Carbon and nitrogen levels vary with each organic material. Carbon-rich materials tend to be brown and dry like leaves or straw. Nitrogen-rich materials tend to be green and wet like fresh grass clippings and food waste. Another way to think about organic material's carbon/nitrogen content is to remember that fresh, juicy materialsare usually high in N and will decompose more quickly than older, drier and woodier tissues which are high in C.  <P>All organic material is composed of carbon and nitrogen. For most home composting a ratio of between 20 and 30:1 is recommended - that is 20 to 30 parts carbon to one part nitrogen. When the ratio is between 20 and 30:1, composting proceeds most efficiently. When C content rises above 30, heat production drops and the rate of composting slows. When the ratio drops below 20:1, excess nitrogen is lost to the air as ammonia and there is a rise in pH level, which may be toxic to some micro-organisms. A blend of one part carbon-rich material and one part nitrogen-rich material is a general rule in composting. <P><STRONG>Air</STRONG><BR>Proper aeration is a key environmental factor. Oxygen is required by many micro-organisms, especially aerobic bacteria. With sufficient oxygen they produce energy, grow quickly, consume more material and make nutrients available for plant growth. When oxygen is not available, aerobic bacteria die off and anaerobic bacteria take over. They will break down the material, but more slowly, and they produce an unpleasant odour.<P><STRONG>Moisture</STRONG><BR>Aerobic bacteria require water to live. A sufficient quantity of water must be provided that will lightly coat the materials to be composted. Less than 40 per cent moisture in the compost and bacterial activity slows down. More than 60 per cent and water will replace air in the pockets amidst the organic material causing aerobic bacteria to drown and anaerobic bacteria to take over. The recommended water level is between 40 and 60 per cent but the ideal percentage will also depend on the organic material's structure. Straw and wood will need more moisture than leaves, while food wastes or lawn clippings may not need any added moisture. Water forms a film of moisture on the materials, allowing the bacteria to do their work. Simply, the compost should feel as moist as a wrung-out sponge. <P><STRONG>Temperature</STRONG><BR> As temperatures rise in the compost, decomposition speeds up. As temperatures drop, composting slows down. Outside temperatures also play a role. Warmer outside temperatures in the summer months stimulate bacteria and speed up composting. Colder temperatures in the winter slow it down.  <P><STRONG>Surface Area and Particle Size</STRONG><BR> Smaller particles of organic material provide more surface area for microbes to attack and speed up composting. Material that is reduced to two inch pieces are ideal, exposing lots of area for the critters to work and allowing air spaces. <P><STRONG>Volume</STRONG><BR> Volume is a factor in retaining heat in the backyard compost bin. The more volume of material in the bin, the more self-insulating it will become in retaining the heat. For backyard composting in the Region one cubic metre is the maximum recommended volume for a compost bin. One cubic metre easily retains heat and moisture, but it is not so large that material will become too heavy and compacted, or too unwieldy for turning.<HR><P><A HREF="../../index.html"><IMG SRC="../../go/medarch/home/smhome.gif" HSPACE=15 BORDER=0></A> <A HREF="../../go/work/work.html"><IMG SRC="../../go/medarch/work/worksm.gif" HSPACE=2 BORDER=0></A><A HREF="../../go/work/solid.html"><IMG SRC="../../go/medarch/work/rdrecy.gif" HSPACE=25 BORDER=0></A><BR> [<A HREF="../../index.html">GVRD Home</A>][<A HREF="../../go/work/work.html">Working with You</A>][<A HREF="../../go/work/solid.html">Solid Waste</A>][<A HREF="swcomp1.html">Composting</A>]<BR><ADDRESS>For further information or feedback, please email us at <A HREF="mailto:webmaster@gvrd.bc.ca">webmaster@gvrd.bc.ca</A></ADDRESS> </BODY></HTML>

Material that would otherwise go out in your garbage, like food waste and leaves, can go in the compost. The wider the variety of material the better. Variety increases the chances of achieving a balance of carbon and nitrogen and widens the range of elements that will be returned to the soil. <P> <IMG SRC="../av_media/scraps.gif" ALIGN=RIGHTALT="18K image of kitchen scraps"><H4>Balancing the Mixture</H4><P>This balance of carbon and nitrogen is known as the carbon:nitrogen ratio. The carbon:nitrogen ratio describes how much carbon a material contains in relation to nitrogen. The ideal C:N ratio is approximately 20 to 30:1 (20 to 30 parts carbon to 1 part nitrogen). When bacteria are fed organic material in this ratio they grow and reproducequickly. Too much carbon and material will break down very slowly. Too much nitrogen and your nose will tell you. The compost will smell of ammonia and may turn slimy. <H4>Materials for Composting</H4><P><STRONG>Alfalfa</STRONG> - good nitrogen source.<P><STRONG>Apples</STRONG> - source of phosphorous and potash (potassium).<P><STRONG>Banana skins</STRONG> - source of phosphorous (P)  and major potassium (K),decay quickly.<P><STRONG>Beet wastes</STRONG> - source of magnesium, calcium and nitrogen<P><STRONG>Blood meal</STRONG> - good nitrogen source (12 per cent); helpful to add when materialto be composted is carbon-rich.<P><STRONG>Bone  meal</STRONG> - good nitrogen source (2-12 per cent), major phosphorous source(20-25 per cent).<P><STRONG>Citrus waste</STRONG> - minor P high in K, nutrient source.<P><STRONG>Coffee grinds</STRONG> - nutrient source for the compost or can be used asmulch.<P><STRONG>Corn cobs</STRONG> - will take a long time to break down unless finelyshredded.<P><STRONG>Food waste</STRONG> - vegetables and fruit - nitrogen-rich material, decomposefaster when they are chopped into smaller pieces. Dig into centre of material and coverwith carbon-rich material or soil. <P><STRONG>Grapes</STRONG> - stalks and leaves minor nutrient source, adds bulk promotingaeration, cut into smaller pieces.<P><STRONG>Grass clippings</STRONG> - best left on the lawn where they directly return thenutrients to the grass, excellent source of nitrogen in compost bins but be sure to mixthem with brown materials like leaves so they do not turn smelly and mat. Caution:avoid use of clippings from grass treated with pesticides until after three to fourcuts. Compost treated grass for one year before using on vegetable garden.<P><STRONG>Hair</STRONG> - good source of nitrogen, mix with other materials. Do not useif hair has been chemically treated.<P><STRONG>Hay and straw</STRONG> - high in carbon, chop or shred and wet for fastercomposting. Straw is better for air circulation as the stems are hollow and stiff.<P><STRONG>Leaves</STRONG> - an excellent free source of carbon material. Collect in thefall for use during the gardening season. Mix with nitrogen-rich material.<P><STRONG>Manures</STRONG> (horse, sheep, cow, chicken and guinea pigs) - good source ofnitrogen and other nutrients. Best to compost before use as some manures will burnplants.<P><STRONG>Mushroom manure</STRONG> - excellent soil builder, low in nutrient value.Possible source of pesticides. Check the source.<P><STRONG>Newspaper</STRONG> - best to recycle, contains no nutrients but shredded canserve as carbon material.<P><STRONG>Sawdust, wood shavings</STRONG> - good carbon-rich material for composting.Takes longer to break down.<P><STRONG>Weeds</STRONG> - good nutrient source. Best to use when green and no seedheads. Pernicious/perennial weeds should be dried before adding to compost.<P><STRONG>Wood ashes</STRONG> - excellent source of potassium. Sprinkle directly intogarden soil. <H4>Rhubarb leaves</H4><P> There are at least two points of view on the composting of rhubarb leaves. One suggests not to compost rhubarb leaves because they contain chemicals which may be toxic to organisms in the soil. <P>The other point of view suggests that the oxalic acid released by decomposition will lower pH and inhibit microbial activity, but that as long as the rhubarb leaves are mixed with other materials and as long as not too many are added at any one time, they are an acceptable composting material.<H4>Materials<FONT SIZE="+3"> NOT </FONT SIZE="+3">for Composting</H4><P><STRONG>Barbecue ashes/coal</STRONG> - contain sulfur oxides; bad for garden. There is alsoconcern with the chemicals applied to the barbecue bricks to assist ignition.<P><STRONG>Cooked food waste</STRONG> - may contain fats which will attract animals.<P><STRONG>Crab grass or other grasses with a rhizomatous root system</STRONG> - require thoroughdrying before adding 	to compost bin or they will grow again. <P><STRONG>Dairy products</STRONG> (butter, cheese, mayonnaise, salad dressing, milk, yogurt, sourcream). <P><STRONG>Dishwater</STRONG> - most dishwashing soaps contain perfumes, greases, sodium.<P><STRONG>Dog, cat feces</STRONG> - may contain disease organisms. Cat droppings may containToxoplasma gandi or Toxocara cati, a roundworm. Both can cause blindness, particularlyin children.<P><STRONG>Fats, grease, and oils</STRONG> - putrify and smell bad as they break down. <P><STRONG>Fish scraps</STRONG> - attract animals, fish scrap contains a lot of fish oil andbreaks down more slowly.<P><STRONG>Grains</STRONG> -may contain fats which give off odour in their breakdown and attractrodents or other pests. <P><STRONG>Kitty litter</STRONG> - likely to contain disease organisms.<P><STRONG>Meat, bones</STRONG> - attracts animals.<P><STRONG>Peanut butter</STRONG> - attracts pests. <P><STRONG> Weeds that have gone to seed</STRONG>  - compost unlikely to reach temperatures highenough to kill off the seed<P><STRONG>Weeds like morning glory and buttercups</STRONG> - may live on in the compost unlessthoroughly dried   <HR>[<A HREF="../../index.html">GVRD Home</A>][<A HREF="../../go/work/work.html">Working with You</A>][<A HREF="../../go/work/solid.html#menu">Solid Waste</A>][<A HREF="../../waste/bro/swcomp1.html#menu">Composting</A>][<A HREF="../../waste/bro/swbckyr.html">Backyard Composting</A>]<BR><ADDRESS>Forfurther information or feedback, please email us at <AHREF="mailto:webmaster@gvrd.bc.ca">webmaster@gvrd.bc.ca</A></ADDRESS></BODY></HTML>

Organic material breaks down over time. Making compost is a controlled or managed version of the natural process. By concentrating the activity in one place and balancing food, air and water - composting happens faster. <H4>Composting Systems</H4>There is no one best system for managing compost. Instead, there are many ways, each offering advantages and benefits. Systems can range from mulching leaves on a path to gathering a batch of organic matter for a three-week hot compost. To determine which system is most appropriate for you, consider such factors as how much time you want to devote to composting, how much garden space is available, how much organic waste you have and how much money you want to spend. <P>This section reviews practical applications of composting science information. It outlines <A HREF="swmfc.html">what to compost</A> and three composting systems: <A HREF="swcont.html">yard composting</A> in a container, <A HREF="swmulch.html">mulching</A> and composting with <A HREF="swworm.html">worms</A>.  <P>The systems and instructions are intended to be a guide. They may be followed more closely at the beginning and less closely as you learn and do more composting yourself. It's important to always remember that composting happens - that it will just take longer without management.<P><IMG SRC="../av_media/woodbox.gif" ALIGN=LEFTALT="14K image of wood composting bin"><H4>Making Compost - A Simple Summary</H4><OL><LI>	Buy or build a rodent-resistant bin.<LI>	Locate the bin on well-drained, level soil.<LI>	Use coarse organic material such as straw <BR>or prunings on the bottom few inches.<LI> 	Chop material into smallish pieces.<LI>	Add green nitrogen-rich material (moist) <BR>and brown carbon-rich material (dry).<LI>	Dig food waste in the centre and cover.<LI>	Aerate the material once a week.</OL><HR><P><A HREF="../../index.html"><IMG SRC="../../go/medarch/home/smhome.gif" HSPACE=15 BORDER=0></A> <A HREF="../../go/work/work.html"><IMG SRC="../../go/medarch/work/worksm.gif" HSPACE=2 BORDER=0></A><A HREF="../../go/work/solid.html"><IMG SRC="../../go/medarch/work/rdrecy.gif" HSPACE=25 BORDER=0></A><BR> [<A HREF="../../index.html">GVRD Home</A>][<A HREF="../../go/work/work.html">Working with You</A>][<A HREF="../../go/work/solid.html">Solid Waste</A>][<A HREF="swcomp1.html">Composting</A>]<BR><ADDRESS>For further information or feedback, please email us at <A HREF="mailto:webmaster@gvrd.bc.ca">webmaster@gvrd.bc.ca</A></ADDRESS> </BODY></HTML>

Backyard Composting in Containers</H3><P>Backyard composting in containers has changed dramatically over the past 10 years. Previousgenerations used heaps or containers largely open to the elements and neighbourhood pests.Residents weren't concerned about rodents because the combination of people, composts androdents in one area was not great enough to cause a problem. <P>That's not the current situation in the GVRD. To prevent rodents from turning your compostinto a home and food source, use a rodent-resistant container. Existing containers can bemade rodent-resistant by lining top, bottom and sides with 1.3 cm. (or less)galvanized wire mesh. Wire mesh is also called hardware cloth and is available at mostbuilding supplies stores. It is important that the compost bin have a secure base toprevent entry of rodents and a secure full lid to prevent materials becoming saturated fromthe heavy rainfall in our Region. A lid that is secured with a latch or locking device willdeter raccoons.   <P><H4>"No Fuss Method"</H4><P> This is the easiest way to do backyard composting. Drop yard wastes in the unit as they become available. Dig food waste into the centre of existing materials and cover with a layer of soil or leaves. The compost bin stores yard and kitchen waste until the materials break down. Keep adding materials and decomposition will continue. <P>This method will take from one to two years to produce finished compost. The finished compost will be near the bottom. To harvest the compost, open the container, set aside the undecomposed material and remove the finished compost. Return the unfinished material to the container.<P>Two compost bins can handle more material. Use one bin for fresh wastes while the material in the other unit is maturing for use.<P> <IMG SRC="../av_media/clipings.gif" ALIGN=RIGHTALT="21K image of person adding garden clippings to copmpost bin"><H4>"The Some Fuss Method"</H4><P> This is the system that most composters will settle on. With "Some Fuss" composting you spend more time composting in the spring, summer and fall when you are gardening. Your compost heats up intermittently, perhaps soon after adding a layer of fresh grass clippings. You turn the compost or aerate the material with an aerating tool to mix the material and make sure the composting organisms are getting enough air. <P>Your compost should be as moist as a wrung-out sponge. It's about right if you can form a ball with the material in your hand but not wring any water droplets out. If it's too wet, add dry material to absorb moisture. If it's too dry, add green, wet materials like food waste. Or, add water from the hose or watering can so that materials will be dampened gradually and thoroughly. Ideally, chop or shred everything into chunks of about two inches to increase the surface area for the organisms to work on.  <P><H4>"More Fuss"</H4><P>This system is a fast, hot, active system and requires more management. The work is "turning" or mixing the organic material . Regular turning (once a week) ensures that bacteria get the air they need to do their work. <P>This composting method is most efficiently accomplished in batches. Stockpile organic material until there is enough to fill the compost bin - usually a cubic metre (approx. 3'x3'x3'). Kitchen waste can be saved and stored in a sealed plastic garbage can with sawdust or soil to control odours and pests. Chop or shred all material to maximize surface area. Add the material in layers from two to three inches thick. Moisten layers as necessary. Alternate layers of carbon-rich material (browns) with nitrogen-rich material (greens). Fill the compost bin full with material.<P> <IMG SRC="../av_media/temp.gif" ALIGN=LEFTALT="11K image of thermometer composting bin">Within 24 hours the temperature will rise to 60 <FONT SIZE="-2">degrees<FONT SIZE="+0"> C-70 <FONT SIZE="-2">degrees<FONT SIZE="+0"> C. This is the hot composting system and you should monitor the process. These temperatures are maintained for four to seven days. When temperatures drop it is time to aerate the materials. This is done by turning the materials into the second bin. Try to get material from the top into the bottom of the unit to achieve complete destruction of weed seeds and pathogens. If you have only one unit, probe the material with an aeration tool getting the air into the mass of material.<P>This temporarily interrupts the heat cycle but the temperatures will quickly rise for another four to seven days. The material will cool. Compost managed this way should be left to mature for three months.  <HR>[<A HREF="../../index.html">GVRD Home</A>][<A HREF="../../go/work/work.html">Working with You</A>][<A HREF="../../go/work/solid.html#menu">Solid Waste</A>][<A HREF="../../waste/bro/swcomp1.html#menu">Composting</A>][<A HREF="../../waste/bro/swbckyr.html">Backyard Composting</A>]<BR><ADDRESS>For furtherinformation or feedback, please email us at <AHREF="mailto:webmaster@gvrd.bc.ca">webmaster@gvrd.bc.ca</A></ADDRESS></BODY></HTML>

A layer of organic material is added on top of the soil.

It is a very slow but efficient way of composting.  <P>Mulching has many benefits. Many gardeners mulch with organic materials to discourage weeds, to keep plant roots cool and moist, to protect plants from frost, to prevent soil erosion and compaction and to reduce the need for watering in the summer. <P>Spread the organic material on top of the soil around plants and on garden paths. Wood chips, leaves from deciduous trees and shrubs, lawn clippings and sawdust are suitable mulch materials around perennial plants. Around vegetable and annual flower gardens, it is best to use nitrogen-rich materials (green) like lawn clippings, weeds and other green garden trimmings.<P><H4>Problems and Solutions</H4>For heat loving plants, pull the mulch back from the planting bed and allow the sun to warm the soil in the Spring, before planting and re-mulching.<P>To deal with possible nitrogen shortage, add an additional source of nitrogen, such as bloodmeal or cottonmeal.<P>You may experience an increase in the snail and slug populations, especially if the weather is wet. Pull back the mulch, put the slugs into a container, freeze and add to your compost.<HR>[<A HREF="../../index.html">GVRD Home</A>][<A HREF="../../go/work/work.html">Working with You</A>][<A HREF="../../go/work/solid.html#menu">Solid Waste</A>][<A HREF="../../waste/bro/swcomp1.html#menu">Composting</A>][<A HREF="../../waste/bro/swbckyr.html">Backyard Composting</A>]<BR><ADDRESS>For further information or feedback, please email us at <A HREF="mailto:webmaster@gvrd.bc.ca">webmaster@gvrd.bc.ca</A></ADDRESS></BODY></HTML>

Add food waste and with assistance from micro-organisms, the worms will convert bedding and food waste into compost. Worm composting can be done year-round, indoors in schools, offices and homes. It is a natural method for recycling nutrients in food waste without odour. The resulting compost is a good soil conditioner for house plants, gardens and patio containers.<H3>How You Do It</H3>Buy or build a box with holes in the bottom. Fill the box with moistened bedding. Add the redworms. Pull aside some of the bedding, bury the food waste and cover it up with the bedding. Add one cup of soil or sand to provide grit for worms' digestive process. <H3>What You  Need</H3><OL><LI>a container (made of wood or plastic)<LI>worms (500-2,000 redworms)<LI>bedding (shredded newspaper, corrugated cardboard and/or leaves)<LI>food waste (fruit and vegetable waste)</OL><P><B> <IMG SRC="../av_media/wormbins.gif" ALIGN=RIGHTALT="21K image of several worm composting bins">1. The Container</B><BR>Buy or build a container or use an old dresser drawer, trunk or barrel. Wood containers are absorbent and good insulators for worms. Plastic containers do work but compost tends to get quite wet.<P>The container should be between 20 cm. and 30 cm. (8-12 inches) deep and provide .09m2 (one square foot) of surface area for every .45 kg (pound) of food waste per week (e.g., 2.72 kg [6 lbs] of waste requires a bin .6m x .9m [2 feet by 3 feet] or 2 bins .3m x .9m [1 foot by 3 feet]).<P>Depending on container's size, drill 8 to 12 holes 3mm-6mm (3/16-  1/4 ") in the bottom for aeration and drainage. A plastic bin may need more drainage - if contents get too wet, drill more holes. Raise the bin on bricks or wooden blocks for air circulation. Place a tray underneath to capture excess liquid, which can be used as liquid plant fertilizer. Some newer containers replace drainage holes in the bottom with a venting system higher in the container. This is a new idea and early test results are positive.<P>Worms like a moist, dark environment. Their bodies are 75 to 90 per cent water and worms' body surfaces must be moist for them to breathe. Cover the bin to conserve moisture and provide darkness. Indoors, place a sheet of dark plastic or burlap sacking on top of the bedding. Outdoors, use a solid lid to keep out unwanted scavengers and rain.<P>Worm bins can be located in the basement, shed, garage, balcony or kitchen counter. They need to be kept out of the hot sun, heavy rain and cold. When temperatures drop below 4 <FONT SIZE="-2">degrees<FONT SIZE="+0">  C, bins should be indoors, heated or well-insulated. The container can be heated with an electric heating cable placed in the bottom third of the container. To insulate, surround the container with (5 - 7.5cm.) rigid styrofoam. <P><B>2. The Worms</B><BR>Redworms are best suited to worm composting. They are often found in aged manure, compost heaps, and piles of leaves. They are also known as red wiggler, brandling and manure worms. Their official names are Eisenia foetida and Lumbricus rubellus. Redworms are best suited for composting because they thrive on organic material, such as food waste. Dew-worms, on the other hand, are better suited to life in the soil and shouldn't be used in a worm bin. <P>You can get your worms from a compost bin, purchase them or find a horse stable or farmer with an aged manure pile. The Compost Hotline (604) (736-2250) or Compost Demonstration Gardens can help you find local sources of red wigglers.<P>For one pound per day of food waste, you'll need two pounds of worms (roughly 2,000). If you are unable to get this many worms at the start, reduce the amount of food waste until the population increases. And the population will increase. Redworms mature sexually in 60-90 days and can then produce cocoons which take 21 days to hatch baby worms. Once they start breeding they can deposit two to three cocoons per week with two baby worms in each cocoon. The limits on their reproduction include availability of food and room to move and breed. So worm populations don't usually exceed the size of the container.<P> <IMG SRC="../av_media/wrmpaper.gif" ALIGN=RIGHTALT="25K image of shredded bedding material"><B>3. The Bedding</B><BR>Provide damp bedding. Suitable bedding material includes shredded newspaper and cardboard, shredded fall leaves, chopped-up straw and other dead plants, seaweed, sawdust, dried grass clippings, aged manure and peat moss. Peat moss is quite acidic and should be well soaked and combined with other bedding material. Vary the bedding in the bin to provide more nutrients for the worms and to create a richer compost. Two handfuls of sand or soil will provide the necessary grit for worms' digestion of food.<P>Fill the bin with a mixture of damp bedding so the overall moisture level is like a "wrung-out sponge." Lift the bedding gently to create air spaces. This maintains aerobic activity, helps control odours and gives the worms freer movement.<P><B>4. The Food Waste</B><BR>Your worms will eat food scraps such as fruit and vegetable peels, pulverized egg shells, tea bags and coffee grounds. To avoid potential rodent problems do not compost meats, dairy products, oily foods or grains. No glass, plastic or tin foil. <P>Pull aside the bedding, bury the food waste deep and then cover it up with the bedding again. Divide the bin into three or four imaginary sections (larger bin, more sections) and bury successive loads in different locations in the bin. Keeping a chart of burial sites can be helpful. Weekly food waste will help determine the size of bin and number of worms you'll need. Collect food waste in a container and weigh it. Do this for two weeks to get an estimate of average food waste. Your bin should provide one square foot of surface area for every pound of food waste per week. And you will need two pounds of worms for every pound of food waste per day.    <P><H3>Harvesting Your Compost</H3>After six weeks, the bedding will be noticeably darker with worm castings. After two and a half months have passed, there will still be some of the original bedding visible in the bin plus brown and earthy-looking worm castings. Although food waste is being added regularly, the bedding volume will gradually decrease. As more bedding is converted into castings the worms will begin to suffer. It is time to decide whether you want to do "some fuss" or "more fuss"  worm composting.<P><B>"Some Fuss" Harvesting</B><BR>  Some fuss  worm composting involves moving the finished compost over to one side of the bin, placing new bedding in the space created, and placing food waste in the new bedding. The worms will gradually move over to the fresh bedding and food waste, and the finished compost can be harvested. Fill the space created with new damp bedding. <P><B>"More Fuss" Maintenance</B><BR> If you want to use all of the compost at once, dump the bin's entire contents onto a large plastic sheet and make piles of material. Use sunshine or a hundred watt light bulb to drive the worms to the bottom of the piles. Worms don't like bright light because the single cells on the epidermis (skin) react to light. Scoop off the tops of each pile until all you have left is the worms. Most children love to help! Watch out for the tiny, lemon-shaped worm cocoons that contain the baby worms. Mix a little of the finished compost in with the new bedding of the next bin.<P><H3>Show a Little Respect</H3>We must act responsibly if we take worms out of their natural environment and place them in containers. They are living creatures with their own unique needs, so it is important to create and maintain a healthy habitat for them to do their work. If you supply the right ingredients and care, your worms will thrive and make compost for you. <P><H3>Common Problems</H3><P><B>Unpleasant Odours</B><BR> Unpleasant odours may waft from your bin when it is overloaded with food waste. If this occurs, gently stir up the contents to allow more air in. Stop adding food waste until the worms and micro-organisms have broken down what food is already in the bin. Check the drainage holes to make sure they are not blocked and drill more holes if needed. If the moisture level seems right, the bedding may be too acidic from citrus peels and other acidic foods. Adjust by adding a little dolomite lime and cutting down on acidic wastes.<P><B>Fruit Flies</B><BR>Fruit flies aren't harmful, but they are a nuisance, and a very common problem with worm bins. Discourage fruit flies by always burying the food wastes and not overloading the bin. Keep a plastic sheet, piece of old carpet or a lid on the compost's surface in the bin. Mary Appelhof, author of Worms Eat My Garbage, acknowledges that she hasn't found the perfect solution to fruit flies. Adding a spider or two helps reduce fruit flies. If flies persist, move the bin to a location where flies will not be bothersome.<HR>[<A HREF="../../index.html">GVRD Home</A>][<A HREF="../../go/work/work.html">Working with You</A>][<A HREF="../../go/work/solid.html#menu">Solid Waste</A>][<A HREF="../../waste/bro/swcomp1.html#menu">Composting</A>]<BR><ADDRESS>For further information or feedback, please email us at <A HREF="mailto:webmaster@gvrd.bc.ca">webmaster@gvrd.bc.ca</A></ADDRESS></BODY></HTML>

Located in bedrock, this small but deep lake provides important secondary water storage.</P><HR><P><A HREF="../../index.html"><IMG SRC="../../go/medarch/home/smhome.gif" HSPACE=15 BORDER=0></A><A HREF="../../go/work/work.html"><IMG SRC="../../go/medarch/work/worksm.gif" HSPACE=2 BORDER=0></A><A HREF="../../go/work/water.html#menu"><IMG SRC="../../go/medarch/water/rdwat.gif" HSPACE=25 BORDER=0></A><BR>[<A HREF="../../index.html">GVRD Home</A>][<A HREF="../../go/work/work.html">Working with You</A>][<A HREF="../../go/work/water.html#menu">Water System</A>][<A HREF="watfact.html#menu">Water Facts</A>]<BR><ADDRESS>For further information or feedback, please email us at <A HREF="mailto:webmaster@gvrd.bc.ca">webmaster@gvrd.bc.ca</A></ADDRESS></BODY><!-- Modified by: A.Bains September 22 1995 -->  <!-- end include --> </HTML>

The site includes a 25 squaremetre organic garden, a wide variety of rodent-resistant compost units, a Compost Hotline for telephone inquires, an indoor meeting room, a model balcony garden and a solar greenhouse. This site has become a centre for both research and information on home composting in the Province.<IMG SRC="../av_media/cityfarm.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><P>Because of the concerns of Regional Environmental Health Officers, all the bins in the garden are rodent-resistant, a design specification which hadn't been considered before. Staff members hired on a Federal Employment and Immigration Job Development Program reviewed manufactured bins from around the world, including models from Germany, Holland, England, the United States and across Canada.  At least 10 local companies  developed bins as well and these became available commercially by the summer of 1990.<P>Staff not only helped design some of the bins, but were also responsible for testing them continuously.  Large volumes of yard and food waste were processed and the merits and faults of each unit were noted.  The public was taught what wastes to mix and which method of composting worked best based on the discoveries made by the garden staff.<P>The finished compost was used in the large vegetable, fruit, herb and flower beds by both the employees and eager volunteers who were responsible for garden maintenance. Hundreds of visitors touring the demonstration site asked as many questions about gardening as they did about composting, and were inspired to make their own compost by the beauty and taste of the plants they saw.<P>Callers from across the country asked Hotline operators a variety of general questions, such as which bin to buy, how to make compost, and what went wrong with their compost pile.  Some callers had more specific questions, such as whether or not to add walnut leaves or barbecue coals, or whether a compost "starter" was helpful.  Our cordless phone allowed staff to work in the garden and still answer calls.<P>Good composting practices were promoted to thousands more people via television, radio, newspapers, magazines, and educational videos.  CBC TV's "Down To Earth" shot four separate programs from the garden which were broadcast nationally.  Staff developed a slide show presentation which they used when speaking to groups who couldn't get to the garden.  Brochures, newsletters and information sheets were also sent out on request as part of our outreach program.<P>Classes of school children came with containers and shredded newspapers to learn the secrets of worm composting.  After a one hour class and some donated red wiggler worms, they were ready to return to their schools and begin composting some of their lunch scraps.<P>The Demonstration Garden staff was able to help government agencies, community organizations and manufacturers develop educational programs and products to further benefit the public.  In recognition of this work they were awarded the 'Recycler of the Year Award' by the Greater Vancouver Regional District for 1990.<HR>[<A HREF="../../index.html>GVRD Home</A>][<A HREF="../../go/work/work.html">Working with You</A>][<A HREF="../../go/work/solid.html#menu">Solid Waste</A>][<A HREF="../../waste/bro/swcomp1.html#menu">Composting</A>][<A HREF="../../waste/bro/swcomp2.html">Gardens List</A>]<BR><ADDRESS>For further information or feedback, please email us at <A HREF="mailto:webmaster@gvrd.bc.ca">webmaster@gvrd.bc.ca</A></ADDRESS></BODY></HTML>

<H3>Compost Demonstration Gardens</H3>
<P>To help educate would-be compost enthusiasts, the Greater Vancouver Regional 
District and many of its member municipalities have created compost demonstration 
gardens that show visitors a number of different compost bins in action. Many of 
the gardens have people on hand to answer questions, and there are signs explaining 
the composting process. As well, a few of the gardens offer workshops or tours for 
school children, residents and community groups.

The GVRD in co-operation with the British Columbia Ministry of Environment, Lands and Parks and the City of Burnaby created the first government actively staffed Compost Demonstration Garden.<P> <IMG SRC="../av_media/gvrdgar1.gif" ALIGN=LEFT>Designed as a typical residential backyard, the garden's purpose is to promote the advantages and possibilities of home composting and educate residents on how to compost in their own backyard or compost with worms in apartments.  The garden is open seven (7) days a week from March until the end of October.<P>Emphasizing the need to reduce the 30 per cent organic portion of the waste stream, the Demonstration Garden offers workshops to schools and the general public and conducts group tours. Visitor response has been overwhelming as evidenced by the 8000 residents who visited the garden during the 1991 season. Residents visit the garden to find out the how, why, when and where of composting; to inquire on specific problems experienced with the process; and to view the results of using compost.<P>Assistance is provided to the public to help make the most effective choice of available rodent-resistant containers.  The results from compost bin trials provide valuable public information.  Practical trials of the compost bins include:  the weighing of carbon-rich and nitrogen-rich materials; temperature monitoring; aeration; the percentage reduction; the analysis of the quantity and quality of the compost produced. Information is also provided to the municipal recycling co-ordinators.<P>Benefits of composting are promoted through workshops that teach the basic techniques of composting. Over 38 workshops have been held. Taxpayers are made aware of money saved by reducing their waste at source, the value of compost produced and the additional savings in not purchasing fertilizers or amendments.<P> <IMG SRC="../av_media/gvrdgar2.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT>Workshops for children bring the message of how to compost in apartments, classrooms or a backyard by practical activities where children learn from hands-on participation. Over 1300 children have visited the garden and many return with their parents to see how their plants growing in compost are progressing.<P>By providing displays and workshops at community outreach events we are able to contact thousands of individuals who have never considered composting as a means of waste reduction.<P>Evaluation of the education program is by direct written feedback from teachers and residents. The increasing demand for information and popular response to subsidized bin distribution programs gives indication of the willingness of residents to play a vital role in waste reduction. About 45,000 compost bins have been distributed in the Region.<P>Compost education is only one of the initiatives undertaken by the GVRD to promote regional waste reduction goals. The GVRD Compost Demonstration Garden is one of eight in the Region. Our common goal is composting which provides an economical means of reducing the waste stream by returning organic material to the soil and being part of the natural cycle of life.<HR>[<A HREF="../../index.html>GVRD Home</A>][<A HREF="../../go/work/work.html">Working with You</A>][<A HREF="../../go/work/solid.html#menu">Solid Waste</A>][<A HREF="../../waste/bro/swcomp1.html#menu">Composting</A>][<A HREF="../../waste/bro/swcomp2.html">Gardens List</A>]<BR><ADDRESS>For further information or feedback, please email us at <A HREF="mailto:webmaster@gvrd.bc.ca">webmaster@gvrd.bc.ca</A></ADDRESS></BODY></HTML>

This is a facility which combines the concepts of waste reduction through recycling and backyard composting in one location.<P>The goal for this facility is to reduce the residential waste stream by three per cent.<P>The purpose of the Recycling Depot and Compost Garden is to provide recycling opportunities and an educational demonstration facility for backyard composting.<P> <IMG SRC="../av_media/richmond.gif" ALIGN=LEFT>The Compost Garden is a demonstration of how backyard composting can benefit the soil and enhance lawns and gardens.  Different types of compost bins are displayed to help residents select a compost bin appropriate for their yard.  Workshops for both adults and children are offered at the garden.<P>Adults can learn about backyard composting from an expert on the subject, and children will be able to learn how composting with worms can effectively reduce garbage.<P>The Compost Demonstration Garden will also serve to support the backyard compost bin distribution programs which the City has undertaken.  Residents who want to learn more about composting can visit the Compost Garden to get tips on composting. The Depot accepts yard waste - leaves, grass clippings, brush and branches up to 10 centimetres in diameter, plants, flowers and sod.<HR>[<A HREF="../../index.html>GVRD Home</A>][<A HREF="../../go/work/work.html">Working with You</A>][<A HREF="../../go/work/solid.html#menu">Solid Waste</A>][<A HREF="../../waste/bro/swcomp1.html#menu">Composting</A>][<A HREF="../../waste/bro/swcomp2.html">Gardens List</A>]<BR><ADDRESS>For further information or feedback, please email us at <A HREF="mailto:webmaster@gvrd.bc.ca">webmaster@gvrd.bc.ca</A></ADDRESS></BODY></HTML>

The discovery was passed down to succeeding generations. Composting, that perfectly natural process that just happens, became something our ancestors learned to use. <P>One of the earliest references to compost use in agriculture appears on a set of clay tablets from the Akkadian Empire in the Mesopotamian Valley 1,000 years before Moses. The Romans knew about compost, the Greeks and the tribes of Israel both had a word for it. There are references to it in the Bible and Talmud.<P>There are also references to composting in medieval church texts and Renaissance literature. William Caxton, a 15th century printer, spelled it 'compostyng.' Hamlet advises, "do not spread the compost on the weeds, to make them ranker."<P>The Chinese systematically applied the principles of composting. Crop wastes were laid on roads and pathways to be crushed by passing carts and then returned to the fields with human and animal manure. <P>In New England in the 19th century, Stephen Hoyt and Sons used 220,000 fish in one season of compost-making. Their method: spread a layer of "muck" (marsh and swamp mud) one third of a metre thick, then a layer of fish, then a layer of muck and so on. They combined 10 to 12 loads of muck to every load of fish until the pile reached a height of 1.8 metres. Then they turned the pile until composting was complete.<P>The early 20th century, and especially the post Second World War period, can be described as ushering in a new "scientific" method of farming. Scientific farming called for the application of nutrient-rich chemical fertilizers. Combinations of muck and dead fish didn't look very effective beside a bag of chemical fertilizer. For farmers in many areas of the world, the new chemical fertilizers replaced compost.<P>Sir Albert Howard, a British government agronomist, went to India in 1905. He stayed for 29 years and experimented with different ways to make compost before settling on the Indore Method. This method calls for three parts plant material to one part manure, with materials spread in layers and turned during decomposition. <P>Publication of Sir Howard's book, An Agricultural Testament (1943), generated renewed interest in organic methods of agriculture and gardening. Howard's work and the research it has promoted has earned him recognition as the modern-day father of the organic method. J. I. Rodale, in North America, carried Howard's work further. He established the Farming  Research Centre and Organic Gardening magazine. Now, organic methods in gardening and  farming are becoming increasingly popular. Even farmers who rely on expensive fertilizers recognize compost's value for plant growth and restoring depleted and lifeless soil. <HR><P><A HREF="../../index.html"><IMG SRC="../../go/medarch/home/smhome.gif" HSPACE=15 BORDER=0></A> <A HREF="../../go/work/work.html"><IMG SRC="../../go/medarch/work/worksm.gif" HSPACE=2 BORDER=0></A><A HREF="../../go/work/solid.html"><IMG SRC="../../go/medarch/work/rdrecy.gif" HSPACE=25 BORDER=0></A><BR> [<A HREF="../../index.html">GVRD Home</A>][<A HREF="../../go/work/work.html">Working with You</A>][<A HREF="../../go/work/solid.html">Solid Waste</A>][<A HREF="swcomp1.html">Composting</A>]<BR><ADDRESS>For further information or feedback, please email us at <A HREF="mailto:webmaster@gvrd.bc.ca">webmaster@gvrd.bc.ca</A></ADDRESS> </BODY></HTML>

The next stage is wishing you had more of it. Your compost should be ready for use anytime between four months and two years from when you began composting. You know you have finished compost when it is dark in colour, crumbly but not powdered and smells earthy. These are indications that the compost has stabilized - or matured - and that the original raw organic material has been converted into nutrient-rich humus. If you wish, a simple pH test kit can give you an indication of maturity. Finished compost is in the neutral range.<P> <IMG SRC="../av_media/finished.gif" ALIGN=LEFTALT="18K image of person removing finished compost from the bottom of the composting bin">Compost is classified as a soil conditioner rather than a fertilizer. To be classified as a fertilizer it would have to have higher levels of nitrogen, potassium and phosphorous. Finished compost does add these elements, and others, but tends to release them over a longer period of time than chemical fertilizers.<P>As well, compost adds organic material to the soil, increases permeability of clay soils and increases water-holding capacity of sandy soils, promotes root growth and creates spaces for air and water. <P> <IMG SRC="../av_media/sift.gif" ALIGN=RIGHTALT="18K image of person screening finished compost">Finished compost is usually found at or near the bottom and centre of the compost bin. For many applications it is desirable to screen the compost through a one-half-inch mesh before using it. Material that doesn't fall through the screen can be thrown back into the bin for further composting or used as mulch.<P>The early spring is the best time to add large volumes of compost to the garden. It can be dug into the top six inches of the soil. By mixing the organic matter with the slowly warming earth, it supplies nourishment just in time for planting. Screened compost can be used with an equal volume of soil and sand for a seedling mixture. Use it straight up for a top dressing on potted plants and patio container gardens. For containers and hanging baskets use one third compost, one third potting soil and one third vermiculite or perlite. <H4>Ways to Use Compost</H4><B>Top Dressing</B><BR>Top dressing is placing compost on the soil around the bottoms of flowers, vegetables, shrubs, and trees, leaving the stem free for air to circulate. With larger trees, the compost can be placed on top of the soil six inches from the tree's trunk to just beyond the drip line. Aerate the lawn in the spring by pulling cores (machine or hand tool) then rake 5 cm of screened compost over the lawn surface. <P><B>Mulching</B><BR>Mulching is similar to top dressing. The compost or other organic material is placed on the soil to finish breaking down. Aside from adding organic material, mulching helps retain moisture in the soil, smothers weeds and inhibits soil compaction. Be sure to remove weeds before mulching. Grass clippings left on the lawn as a mulch will help retain moisture and provide nutrients. <P><B>Transplanting</B><BR>Dig a hole twice the size of the root ball, mix compost with an equal part of topsoil and fill in around the root ball, tamping the mixture just enough to eliminate air pockets. Water gently. <P><B>Compost Tea</B><BR>Fill a cloth bag with a litre of compost. Tie the bag and soak in a garbage can full of water. Let it steep overnight and pour the "tea" into the soil for your plants. If you let the compost steep longer than overnight, the water may need to be diluted  before pouring.<HR><P><A HREF="../../index.html"><IMG SRC="../../go/medarch/home/smhome.gif" HSPACE=15 BORDER=0></A> <A HREF="../../go/work/work.html"><IMG SRC="../../go/medarch/work/worksm.gif" HSPACE=2 BORDER=0></A><A HREF="../../go/work/solid.html"><IMG SRC="../../go/medarch/work/rdrecy.gif" HSPACE=25 BORDER=0></A><BR> [<A HREF="../../index.html">GVRD Home</A>][<A HREF="../../go/work/work.html">Working with You</A>][<A HREF="../../go/work/solid.html">Solid Waste</A>][<A HREF="swcomp1.html">Composting</A>]<BR><ADDRESS>For further information or feedback, please email us at <A HREF="mailto:webmaster@gvrd.bc.ca">webmaster@gvrd.bc.ca</A></ADDRESS> </BODY></HTML>

<H1>Nutrifor&#153;</H1>

<P>
Every day the GVRD's five wastewater treatment plants produce about 200 tonnes of 
biosolids.
<CENTER><IMG SRC="../av_media/nutrifor.gif">
<P><FONT SIZE=-1>The longer needles in this image show plant growth after Nutrifor 
enhancement.</FONT></CENTER> 
<P>
Decades of research and development have proven that biosolids are
highly efficient slow-release soil conditioners and enhancers that add many valuable
nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus to the soil. The GVRD has registered its 
biosolids with the trademark Nutrifor, which is increasingly in demand to restore 
depleted soils in B.C. Over the past four years, the GVRD and a variety of partners 
have been demonstrating its environmental benefits on agricultural land, reclaimed 
mines, and landfills, highway margins, forests and even parkland.  
<P>
Nutrifor has made a dramatic difference. Trees at fertilized forest sites are healthy 
and grow faster, while plants and grass grow vigorously on sites treated with the GVRD's 
biosolids. 
<P>
Recycling biosolids just makes sense: returning organic matter and nutrients to the
earth. Successful commercial development of Nutrifor has the potential to become a
source of revenue for the GVRD, demonstrating the enduring value of the old adage, waste
not, want not.

<title>SEASONAL TO INTERANNUAL PREDICTION RESEARCH</title>
</head>

<h1>Diagnostic Studies of Seasonal Climate Anomalies</h1>
<hr>
<h2>Accomplishments FY95</h2>

Over the past year, CDC scientists have conducted extensive research on
mid-latitude atmosphere-ocean interactions, and interactions between the
ocean surface and deeper ocean layers.  Data analyses and upper ocean model
simulations indicate that, over parts of the extratropical oceans,
temperature anomalies form at the sea surface, penetrate into the ocean,
and then return to the surface. This 
<a href=/cdc/overview/9596/reemerge.mech.caption.html><em>recurrence mechanism</em></a> 
occurs when
thermal anomalies created by surface fluxes in one winter can remain
undisturbed in the summer seasonal thermocline and then be re-entrained
into the surface layer in the following winter. Thermal anomalies created
at the surface can also move into the permanent thermocline.  Upper ocean
data from the central north Pacific indicates that abnormally cold water
first created at the surface in the mid 1970's moved downward in pulses,
reaching depths of 400m ~2 years later. At longer time scales, some of the
cold water flowed southward following the mean circulation in the
subtropical gyre.  Thus, subsurface data may be an excellent way to detect
low frequency climate signals and to validate hypotheses of the upper ocean
circulation.
<p>

<a href=/cdc/overview/9596/reemerge.mech.caption.html>Illustration of the 
recurrence (re-emergence) mechanism</a>
<p>
A variety of model simulations were performed in order to study the
processes which influence midlatitude SSTs. A very long simulation in which
a mixed layer ocean model was driven by stochastic atmospheric forcing
indicated that, in addition to surface fluxes, entrainment plays an
important role in the ocean heat budget during summmer and fall.
Entrainment directly influences SSTs via the heat flux through the base of
the mixed layer, and indirectly affects SSTs by controlling the depth over
which the fluxes at the top and base of the mixed layer are distributed. A
grid of mixed layer models in the North Atlantic was able to simulate SST
variability on interannual (less than ~15 years) time scales reasonably
well when forced with observed surface flux anomalies and when coupled to
an atmospheric GCM.  Compared to a control run with specified
climatological SSTs, the coupled run also had more power at low
frequencies, due to a reduction in thermal damping and by effects related
to the recurrence mechanism.
<p>
As part of the GFDL-University consortium project, CDC and CIRES
scientists have been documenting the basic climate and climate variability
of the latest version of the GFDL GCM.  The model simulated well the North
Pacific jet, and was able to reproduce the observed mid-winter minimum in
storm activity over the North Pacific.  A detailed examination of the
model's surface flux fields has been initiated that will include
comparisons of the GFDL fluxes with corresponding fields obtained from the
NCEP Reanalysis data set.
<p>
The development of a dynamically consistent diabatic heating dataset for
1985-94 has been completed. A separate dataset of dynamically consistent
200 mb divergence fields for 1980-93 has also been generated. These
datasets were obtained by making minimal adjustments to the operational NCEP
and ECMWF wind analyses so that they satisfied the vorticity and mass
budgets. The heating fields were derived as a balance requirement in the
heat budget.


<h2>Plans FY96</h2>
<ul>
<li>Process subsurface ocean temperature records and then perform diagnostic
studies on interannual and decadal climate signals. Subsurface storage of
thermal anomalies in the seasonal thermocline can lead to the recurrence of
wintertime SST anomalies, while thermal changes in the upper main
thermocline provide a means of tracking low frequency climate variability.
<p>
<li>Perform atmosphere-ocean model experiments to assess the importance of
midlatitude air-sea interaction in the North Atlantic on climate
variability. Sea surface temperature patterns may influence both the local
atmospheric circulation and conditions downstream over Europe and thus be
important for climate prediction.
<p>
<li>Document the mean climate and climate variability in the current
version of the GFDL GCM. Both a printed and World Wide Web -accessible
version of an atlas of climate statistics from a 17-year model simulation
are being developed and will be made available to the public.
<p>
<li>Examine the atmosphere-ocean fluxes of heat, momentum, and fresh water
obtained from from the 17-year GFDL GCM run and compare the results to
estimates from the NCEP Reanalyses.
<p>
<li>Construct a dynamically consistent heating and divergent wind data set
following procedures described above with the NCEP reanalyses. These
dynamically consistent datasets will be used in the diagnosis of the
seasonal forecast skill of the NCEP model and in fundamental low-frequency
variability research.

 Severe large-scale weather and climate events, such as 
major floods, droughts, heat waves, and cold waves, affect all 
parts of the United States, often with large social and economic 
impacts.  Over the past year, severe drought has plagued 
portions of the southern and western U.S., with estimated agricultural 
losses in Texas alone reported at greater than $1B.  During 
the same period, much of the East has suffered from recurrent 
periods of heavy precipitation, at times bringing severe flooding.  
In just one month, February, a major cold-air outbreak 
covering more than half of the country and flooding over parts 
of the Pacific Northwest and eastern U.S. resulted in significant 
loss of life and property damages in excess of several hundred 
million dollars.  Questions of basic interest to the public, are 
"Why?" -  that is, can we identify the causes for these extreme 
events, and "Where and When?" - can such events be predicted and, 
if so, at what time range?  Research in NOAA is 
actively addressing these questions.

<P>
<B> Identifying Causes of Extreme Events </B>
<P>

        Extreme weather phenomena range from localized flash 
floods that can occur in minutes to droughts which persist for 
decades or longer and affect large parts of continents. This 
range reflects the equally wide array of processes that 
contribute to, and link together, weather and climate variability.  
One of the fundamental tasks of diagnostic meteorology is to identify 
the primary processes responsible for particular forms of 
this variability. <P>

      Over the past year, two of the most prominent and economically
significant U.S. weather stories have been the drought 
over the Southwest and the excessive precipitation over parts of 
the East.  As indicated by Dr. Ropelewski of the CPC, both the 
drought in the Southwest and the excessive rainfall in the East 
are related to certain unusual features of the jet stream.  Extending 
back as far as last fall, important features for U.S weather 
have included an unusually strong and persistent high pressure 
ridge over the Southwest and a somewhat weaker (and more 
variable) low pressure trough in the East (Figure 1).  The high 
pressure ridge had several effects on weather over the Southwest,
including a tendency to divert Pacific storm systems well 
to the north of the region, to oppose inflow of moisture from the 
Gulf of Mexico, and to produce descending air motions near 
and to the east of the high pressure center.  <P>

      All of these factors suppress precipitation over the region, 
and it is therefore reasonable to consider this persistent ridge as 
the primary direct, or immediate, cause of the Southwest 
drought.  In contrast, although a trough in the East favors storm 
development and moisture transport into the region, the links to 
the observed excessive precipitation are more complex. Several 
distinct phenomena have contributed to the recurrent heavy precipitation,
including large-scale storm systems, often with 
heavy snowfall (predominantly winter), a nearly stationary 
frontal boundary (predominantly spring) and, most recently, a 
hurricane. <P>

<H1>NOAA Climate Diagnostics Center: 
<em>Advancing Understanding And Predictions of Climate Variability</em>
</h1>
<HR>
<h3>Boulder, Colorado</h3>
<h3>Randall Dole, Director</h3>
<HR>
The Climate Diagnostics Center (<b>CDC</b>), previously the 
Climate Research Division of the ERL Climate
Monitoring and Diagnostics Laboratory (<b>CMDL</b>), was
formed in 1993 to identify the nature and causes for climate 
variations on time scales ranging from months to centuries.  
The ultimate goal of this work is to develop the ability to 
predict important climate variations on these time scales.  
Short-term climate variations of interest include major 
droughts and floods over the continental U.S., and the 
global anomalies associated with El Ni&ntilde;o-Southern Oscillation 
(ENSO).  These events attract extreme public interest, 
and often have enormous social and economic consequences.  
On longer time scales, basic research goals include 
identifying the causes for decadal to centennial 
climate variations, and separating natural variability 
from anthropogenically induced climate changes in 
order to provide an improved scientific basis for public 
planning and policy decisions.  CDC has made considerable 
progress toward these goals through a coordinated program 
of diagnostic and modeling studies aimed at significantly 
advancing understanding and predictions of climate variability.

<p>
<h2>
PROJECT GOALS AND METHODOLOGY:
</h2>
Specific goals of major subprojects within the Center 
include: 
<ol>
<li>identifying key processes contributing to extreme short-term climate events, including major droughts and floods; 
<li>advancing understanding and predictions of ENSO; 
<li>developing new diagnostic techniques to better determine fundamental atmospheric quantities, such as diabatic heating; 
<li>improving monitoring and descriptions of climate variability with both surface and satellite data; 
<li>diagnosing general circulation and operational prediction model data to identify primary areas where model improvements are needed; 
<li>identifying major patterns of climate variability on decadal and longer time scales; and 
<li>investigating the role of air-sea interactions in modulating longer-term variability.
</ol>
Scientists at CDC employ a broad array of methods to achieve 
these goals, including observational diagnostic analyses, 
simple modeling studies, and analyses of forecast experiments 
obtained from sophisticated models of the atmosphere and 
oceans.  CDC studies increasingly involve comparisons of 
observational and model data, an activity essential for 
improving current research and prediction models.
<p>

<a name="data"><h2>DATA MANAGEMENT
AND DATA SET DEVELOPMENT</h2></a>

CDC
is at the forefront of data management activities in NOAA,
using new technologies and techniques to store, access,
process and display data.  
Although much of our data is used in-house,
our future plans include increased data
distribution to all interested researchers.
Most of these data are from
observational systems, but some are generated by numerical
models of the atmosphere and ocean.  Comparison of model
data with observations is important in validating existing
models and helping to develop more reliable models for
future research.<p>

Major climate data set development projects at CDC include 
the 
<a href=/coads/>Comprehensive Ocean-Atmosphere Data Set</a> 
(<b>COADS</b>)
and the 
<a href=http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/gcps/gcps.html>Global Climate 
Perspectives System</a> (<b>GCPS</b>), 
which are both collaborative projects with the 
<a href="http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/ncdc.html">
National Climatic Data Center</a> (<b>NCDC</b>).
These high-quality data sets significantly 
improve NOAA's capabilities for monitoring climatic trends, 
e.g., in surface temperatures and precipitation. 
The COADS project is a
cooperative effort between CDC and the 
<a href="http://cires.colorado.edu">
Cooperative Institute for Research in
Environmental Sciences</a> (<b>CIRES</b>), the 
<a href ="http://www.ucar.edu/metapage.html">
National Center for Atmospheric Research</a> (<b>NCAR</b>), 
and NCDC.
COADS Release 1a data
now provide a 1980-93 extension beyond the 
original COADS Release 1 1854-1979
period, and COADS Release 1b observational data, 
to be completed in 1996, will
provide an update for the approximate period 1946-79.

<p> 
CDC also manages large observational and model 
data sets that are frequently used in climate research 
studies within and outside CDC, including the National
Centers for Environmental Predication (NCEP)/NCAR 
reanalysis data set which, 
upon completion, will have a volume of approximately 1.2 
terabytes.  
(COADS Release 1a and 1b data are also key 
components of the Reanalysis data input).
CDC's data management group is also a leader 
in developing new techniques to simplify access to and 
display of climate data for the larger scientific community.  
The CDC data holdings may be browsed via the World Wide Web 
interface to the 
<A HREF="/cgi-bin/CDCData.pl">CDC data archives</a>.  
For further information 
on how to access CDC's research data sets, contact 
<em>cdcdata@cdc.noaa.gov</em>.<p>

CDC is currently participating in
the formation of a cooperative data distribution
system. This system is intended to be a first step in
cooperative data management between CDC and other 
groups which are active in data management and/or use the data
in question.  This system 
will strive to provide unique data
sets, for example, COADS, NMC reanalysis, ocean analysis,
possibly TOGA-TAO, and model data. <p>

<h2>RESULTS AND ACCOMPLISHMENTS:</h2>
Some significant results and accomplishments of the 
subprojects are listed below.
<ul>
<li>An observational study examined the processes 
contributing to the evolution of the extreme heat
 wave/droughts in the midwestern U.S. in 1980 and 
1988.  The results showed that these extreme events 
evolved in two stages, with the first or development 
stage being forced from sources over the Pacific, 
and the second stage due mainly to anomalous boundary 
conditions (primarily reductions in soil moisture) 
in the drought regions.  This suggests that, once 
established, major heat wave/droughts tend to be 
self-perpetuating.  Another implication of this 
study is that, in order to properly simulate or 
predict long-term droughts, it will be necessary 
for models to properly incorporate the effects of 
land surface processes.<p>

     Drought of 1988:  Illustration of the surface heat balance over the
northern Plains during the evolution of the major 1988 summer heat wave --
drought.  Through June, surface evaporation rates (shown by LH) were near
normal, indicating that other processes were responsible for the
initiation of the heat wave -- drought.  By July, however, evaporation
rates had dropped to levels much below normal, and were compensated
largely by increases in sensible heating (SH).<p>
</font>

<li>Several investigations considered various 
aspects of ENSO.  One study identified the 
climatic impacts of ENSO through observational 
analyses of El Ni&ntilde;o or "warm events" 
and 23 La Ni&ntilde;a or "cold events."  The results 
showed that, during the December through February 
period following the development of a warm event, 
a large fraction of the global tropics experiences 
above normal temperatures.  Above normal temperatures 
also dominate Alaska, the northern midwestern states, 
and most of Canada, while anomalously cold conditions 
occur in the southeastern United States. Nearly equal 
and opposite signals are seen for cold events.  During 
winter, warm event precipitation is enhanced over the 
southeastern U.S. and southern South America, while 
much of Australia, southern Africa and the Amazon suffer 
precipitation deficits.  Identification of such 
relationships aids long-range weather forecasts, 
since El Ni&ntilde;o is relatively predictable up 
to a year in advance.<p>

color scale at the bottom of the plot, and are based on a 1951-1980
climatology.<p>
</font>

<li>A major research focus at CDC is on improving predictive 
skill on seasonal and longer time scales. One study 
evaluated the seasonal predictive skill of two nearly 
identical versions of the National Meteorological Center's 
climate model.  Skill was evaluated by the model's ability 
to produce, on average, seasonal circulation patterns over
 North America.  Although the two models had identical sea 
surface temperatures, one was significantly better for 
predicting seasonal temperature anomalies.  These results 
indicate that biases in current climate models can significantly 
degrade forecast quality and reliability, and suggest 
that further gains in seasonal forecast skill are likely 
through continued development of climate models.<p>

<img align=BOTTOM src="http://www.cdc.noaa.gov/cdc/overview/fig6_small.gif">
Figure 6. This is a link to the larger version of this image.</a><br>
     The top panel shows the composite North American land temperature
anomaly during the winter season for the 7 strong El Ni&ntilde;o events
since 1950.  On average, most of North America is anomalously warm during
El Ni&ntilde;o.  The largest departures occur across Canada and the
northern tier of the United States.  A small region over the southeast
United States tends to be slightly colder than normal during El
Ni&ntilde;o winters.  The lower panel shows the composite North American
land temperatureanomaly during the winter season as simulated by a climate
model.  The climate model has been forced with the ocean surface
temperatures observed during El Ni&ntilde;o.  Note that the climate model
is capable of reproducing the essential features of the observed weather
anomalies, and suggests that such models can provide useful forecast
information.<p>
</font>

<li>In another study, a simple empirical dynamical model 
of ENSO was developed whose predictive skill at lead times 
of up to a year is comparable to that of comprehensive 
global coupled ocean-atmosphere models.  In addition to 
providing tropical sea surface temperature (SST) forecasts, 
this simple model is being used to elucidate the basic 
mechanisms of tropical SST evolution and to diagnose errors 
in the more complicated coupled models.<p>

through Spring 1996.  Forecasts are based upon Spring 1995 initial
conditions, and are derived from a simple model developed at CDC.  Contour
interval is 0.2 degrees Centigrade.<p>
</font>

<li>The ultimate cause of atmospheric motions is spatial 
variations in heating and, therefore, determining the 
location and intensity of atmospheric heat sources is a 
fundamental problem in meteorology.  Scientists at CDC 
have developed a new method for estimating atmospheric 
heat sources that provides very encouraging results, 
and are now preparing a global heating dataset for widespread 
dissemination.  This dataset should prove extremely useful 
for verifying climate models and satellite-derived estimates 
of precipitation, and consequently improving our ability 
to monitor climate variability and detect climate changes.<p>

<li>In studies with <a href="http://www.cdc.noaa.gov/~climsat/">satellite 
data</a>, CDC scientists have actively participated in the 
Global Energy and Water Cycle Experiment (<b>GEWEX</b>).  
As part of this work, they have developed a new technique 
to improve estimates of the variability of atmospheric water 
vapor in space and time.  Their analyses show that during the 
1982-83 major ENSO event air in the tropical upper troposphere 
became warmer, as expected, but also drier, implying a 
negative feedback effect from water vapor in the global 
warming sense.  This contradicts the IPCC consensus view 
that the upper tropospheric water vapor feedback is always 
large and positive, and emphasizes the importance of such 
analyses in studies of climate and global change.<p>

<img align=BOTTOM src="http://www.cdc.noaa.gov/cdc/overview/fig8_small.gif">
Figure 8. This is a link to the larger version of this image.</a><br>
     Thirteen years of HIRS channel 12 data from the NOAA polar orbiter
satellites is shown for the winter (DJF) and summer (JJA) seasons.  HIRS
channel 12 data are used to observe upper tropospheric water vapor (UTWV). 
Low temperatures indicate a relatively wet upper troposphere and high
temperatures indicate a dry upper troposphere.  A well-defined seasonal
shift in UTWV occurs in subtropical regions (10N-30N and 10S-30S) with the
most significant changes occurring in monsoon regions such as Central
America and India.  These data will play a significant role in
understanding the global hydrologic cycle and assessing climate issues
such as greenhouse warming since no other dataset provides a greater
observational sample of UTWV.<p>
</font>

<li>Several studies at CDC have considered various aspects 
of longer term climate variability.  Of particular interest 
is the role of air-sea interactions in climate and climate 
change.  Decadal and longer term variations have been documented 
in winds and sea surface temperature (SST) variability over the 
North Atlantic, and thermal variations in the upper 500 m of the
 North Pacific have been described since 1970.  The latter study 
identified relationships between the cooling trend observed in 
mid-Pacific SST's from the 1970's to late 1980's and temperature 
anomalies in the deeper ocean.  Another study showed how sea 
surface temperature anomalies that formed near the surface in 
winter could remain intact below surface during summer, and then 
reappear at the surface the following winter, thereby potentially 
influencing interannual climate variability.<p>

<h2>FUTURE WORK:</h2>
Future work at CDC will extend the research activities 
described above, in direct support of three primary NOAA 
Strategic Plan goals:  Advancing Short-Term Forecast and 
Warning Services, Implementing Seasonal to Interannual Forecasts, 
and Predicting Decadal to Centennial Climate Changes.<p>

Studies of extreme events will examine the relationships between 
extreme events and ENSO, the roles of different physical 
processes in producing severe droughts and floods, and the 
potential predictability of extreme events.  Process studies 
will continue on ENSO and air-sea interactions, along with 
collaborative studies with the NMC Coupled Model project to 
improve seasonal to interannual climate predictions.  Long-term 
variability studies will examine further the processes contributing 
to decadal variability of the atmosphere-ocean system, as well 
as decadal to century variability in precipitation and other 
climate measures.  An important objective in future work at CDC 
will be to identify and clarify the linkages between climate 
variability on different time scales; for example, how ENSO 
influences the occurrence and duration of an extreme event such 
as a major drought or flood, and the relationships between 
ENSO and decadal-to-centennial variability.<p>

The GFDL-University Consortium began in 1990 as 
a collaborative effort between the 
<a href="http://www.gfdl.gov/">Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Lab</a>
(GFDL), other <a href="http://www.noaa.gov/">NOAA</a> 
centers including the 
<a href="http://www.cdc.noaa.gov/">Climate Diagnostics Center,</a> and 
several universities.  The purpose of the consortium is to design and 
analyze a series of general circulation model (GCM) simulations to 
increase the understanding of the maintenance of regional climates and 
the atmospheric response to sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies and 
other perturbations in the lower boundary. <p>

<font size=3>Plot the NCEP daily analysis data, OLR, and Reynolds SST data. Data coverage is 
from 1980 to the present. You have the option of averaging the last n days. Beware that the more days are averaged, the longer the plot will take.  Climatology is based on a 5 day running mean of the annual cycle (based on 1979-1995). Anomalies are formed by subtracting this daily climatology<p>

<h1>CDC Map Room</h1>
<hr>
<b>These products are not guaranteed to be
updated on a regular basis.  They are intended to
serve as examples of our ongoing work.  Please contact
Klaus Weickmann (<i>kmw@cdc.noaa.gov</i>) for more
information on the CDC maproom.</b>
<hr>
The CDC Map Room consists of a mix of short-term 
operational weather products
available from the National Meteorological Center 
(e.g., via Unidata) and
long-term research-oriented climate products 
produced from a variety of in-house
data sets.  The Map Room is part of CDC's real time 
climate monitoring project
whose major goals are:
<ol>
<li>Disseminate global climate products depicting 
slow oscillations of the climate
system (~>30 days).
<li>Interpret the current state of the climate system using
El Ni&ntilde;o/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) as a framework. 
<li>Produce experimental predictions of important variables
describing the slow
climate oscillations (e.g., Pacific/Indian Ocean 
sea surface temperatures,
tropical convection, etc.).  
<li>Transfer useful monitoring and forecasting 
products to NMC's Climate Analysis
Center for public dissemination.  
</ol>
The experimental climate effort involves mostly global datasets but there is
also a regional component that focuses on the evolving climate over the
Americas, including circulation, precipitation, storm tracks, etc.  The initial
set of products available for viewing illustrates some preliminary ideas under
(1) above.<p>

Note- I am often asked for help in obtaining data. While I'm happy to try
to help, there is a substantial collection of data available from the 
<A HREF="http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/">National Climate Data Center (NCDC) </A>including monthly and daily data for
various sites throughout the US. State climatologists and regional climate centers (listed in the FAQ below) would be helpful 
for the type of questions I usually get asked. (I have put together a list of <a href="climatecenters.html">state climate centers that have web pages</a> ).  Also, the <A HREF="http://www.ucar.edu/dss/faq/">meteorological FAQ</a> maintained at 
NCAR by Ilana Stern is a great source of info and has most of the 
available meteorological data in the world listed.  
<p>
Sources of data for this Boulder page include NCDC, NOAA Cooperative site 
daily observations, the National Storm Data Report, the National Resource
Conservations Service, , daily
data for 1948-1990 provided by Klaus Wolter (CDC) and the Colorado climate center and summaries of daily data for the last 100 years listed in the Colorado Daily prepared by Bill Callihan. More data (especially ANY wind data) is always welcome!!

 <P>
Predictions of Nino 3 SSTA (green solid line) using linear inverse modeling procedure discussed in Penland and Magorian (1993: J. Climate, 6, 1067-1076), along with verification field (solid red line).  Dashed lines indicate one standard deviation error bars appropriate to a stable linear system driven by stochastic forcing. SST anomaly data have been provided by NCEP, courtesy of R. W. Reynolds.  Anomalies were calculated relative to the standard 1950-1979 COADS climatology and projected onto 20 leading EOFs both for the training and verification periods.

Forecasts of SST anomalies projected onto 20 leading EOF's, based on September-October-November 1996 initial conditions. SST anomalies have been calculated relative to the standard 1950-1979 COADS climatology both for the training period (COADS data: 1950-1984) and for these forecasts.  SST data used in these forecasts have been provided by NCEP, courtesy of R. W. Reynolds. Prediction by linear inverse modeling is described in Penland and Magorian (1993: J. Climate, 6, 1067-1076).  Contour interval is 0.2 degrees C.

Observed and Simulated lead/lag correlations at weather station P in the
North Pacific (50N, 145W) between temperature anomalies in the base layer,
45-55 m in August, and temperature anomalies in 5 m increments for the
previous and following 8 months. The simulated field is obtained from a 
500 year simulation in which a mixed layer ocean model forced by a 
statistical model of atmospheric conditions at OWS P. <P>

The re-emergence mechanism is indicated by the relatively high 
correlation values that extend in a "U" shape from the surface layer in 
spring to the summer seasonal thermocline and returning to the surface in 
winter.  At P the descending branch appears to be stronger than the

     A more difficult, but crucial, question is: what were the 
causes for the observed jet stream variations?  Present 
interpretations should be regarded as preliminary, but at 
this point there 
is substantial evidence that variations in the jet stream and 
associated drought conditions over the Southwest were due in part 
to abnormally cold sea surface temperatures over the central 
and eastern equatorial Pacific, called a La Nia (or cold) event.  
La Nia is basically the flip side of El Nio, which is 
characterized by abnormally warm waters over the same area. <P>

       Evidence supporting the La Nia - Southwest drought 
connection includes: observational studies of the relationships 
between El Nio,  La Nia and precipitation variability (an 
example is given in the next section); diagnostic studies showing 
the relationships between estimated changes in tropical 
precipitation patterns and corresponding changes in the 
midlatitude jet stream;  and experiments with the NOAA National 
Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) coupled 
ocean-atmosphere prediction model indicating that sea surface 
temperature conditions as observed over the past year are likely to 
be associated with suppressed rainfall over the Southwest and 
Southern Plains.  It therefore appears likely that La Nia was an 
important contributing factor to the Southwest drought, 
although it should not be considered as the sole cause. <P>

       The situation in the East is again more complex, due in part 
to the more variable weather patterns and associated precipitation
systems, as well as the less systematic influence of La Nia 
on this region. One important influence on the East's weather 
mentioned by Dr. Ropelewski was the unusual intensity and 
persistence of a particular large-scale flow pattern called the 
"North Atlantic Oscillation", or NAO. The NAO is especially 
important in accounting for temperature variability over the 
Northern Hemisphere.  It is also closely linked to changes in 
storm tracks over the Atlantic and adjacent regions, including 
the U.S. east coast, and to snow-cover variability over North 
America and Europe.  It has the peculiar property that it usually 
displays relatively little persistence from month-to-month - 
indeed, its persistence from last fall through this spring was 
very unusual - but has a somewhat higher tendency to recur 
from one winter to the next.  Although we suspect that this 
recurrence property is related to sea-surface temperature 
variability, most likely over the North Atlantic, a definite link has 
yet to be established. <P>

<P>
<B> Potential Predictability of Extreme Events </B>
<P>

       Extreme event prediction at extended range (beyond several 
days) is an emerging area of research within NOAA, and is 
complementary to NOAA's current efforts in such areas as 
severe thunderstorm, tornado and hurricane predictions.  A 
basic goal of this research is to identify regions and time 
periods where the risk of extreme events is significantly increased 
(or decreased). <P>

       In considering problems in weather and climate prediction, 
it is vital to recognize that weather is governed by chaotic 
dynamics, so that small differences in initial states, the "flap of 
a butterfly's wings" in the words of Edward Lorenz, can eventually 
lead to large differences in the atmosphere's behavior.  As a 
consequence, the ability to predict the precise sequence of 
weather events is intrinsically limited.  Tentative estimates 
place an average upper bound for skillful weather prediction at 
a few weeks, but exceptions extending beyond this range can be 
found. <P>

      But does this mean that beyond some time period, say a 
month, all hope for useful predictions is lost?   Emphatically 
not, if instead of attempting to predict the precise sequence of 
events (today will be fair, tomorrow rainy, etc.), the goal is 
changed to attempting to predict the relative likelihood of various 
kinds of events.  At the heart of climate prediction, then, is 
the problem of determining how the probability distributions of 
various quantities, such as temperature and precipitation, will 
change given an initial atmospheric state and interactions with 
other components of the climate system, such as sea surface 
temperatures, soil moisture, ice and snow cover, vegetation, and 
- in some cases - even us (anthropogenic effects). <P>

     Figure 2 is a schematic diagram illustrating how a simple 
shift in a probability distribution can influence the relative 
likelihood of various outcomes.  We might imagine the shift as 
reflecting the effect of some condition, such as La Nia, on the 
precipitation over a region, say, the Southwest.  What is striking 
in this figure is that even a relatively modest shift in the mean 
can have a substantial impact on the probabilities at the tails of 
the distribution - the "extreme events".  In particular, extreme 
events on one side of the distribution become much more likely, 
while those on the other side become much less likely. <P>

<CENTER>
<IMG ALT="" SRC="dole2.gif">

<P> <CENTER> <B> Figure 2 </B> </CENTER> <P>

      As extreme events often have the greatest societal effects, 
this shift in probabilities has potentially important implications, 
and any foreknowledge of such a shift would have potentially 
useful applications.  <P>

       It must be emphasized that various physical effects enter 
into the fray, either increasing or decreasing the likelihood of 
extreme events.   Such "feedback" effects are important 
considerations in identifying possible climate trends, as described by 
Dr. Karl of NCDC, and in the possibility of experiencing 
"climate surprises", as discussed by Dr. Overpeck of NGDC.  In 
general, then, the climate prediction problem is much more 
complex than forecasting a simple shift - we really need to 
predict the shape of the whole distribution.  <P>

  So, how do we do this?  There are two major approaches: 
first, through analysis of past behavior (an empirical approach) 
and, second, through application of numerical forecasting 
models employing a relatively new technique called ensemble 
predictions.  <P>

      Figure 3 illustrates how the first approach can be used to 
estimate the effects of La Nia and El Nio events on very dry 
vs. very wet winters in the Southwest.  The particular example 
is for Texas, which experienced a severe drought last winter. 
The results are derived from observational data over the period 
1895-1995, and "very dry" and "very wet" are defined, respectively, 
as the top twenty driest and wettest winters during this 
period. <P>

<CENTER>
<IMG ALT="" SRC="dole3.gif">
</CENTER> 
<P> <CENTER> <B> Figure 3 </B> </CENTER> <P>

       It is clear from this figure that La Nia and El Nio events 
significantly influence the relative likelihood of very wet vs. 
very dry winters in Texas.  In particular, during La Nia, as 
occurred last year, very dry winters are relatively much more 
likely, and very wet winters are less likely (indeed, in this 
analysis no very wet winters occurred in conjunction with La Nia 
events, although this does not rule out the possibility that such a 
concurrence may happen at some time).  Roughly the reverse 
situation holds during El Nio years, with an increased risk of 
very wet winters and reduced risk of very dry winters.  It should 
be noted that the occurrence of La Nia does not guarantee a 
very dry winter - again, other factors are involved - but it 
does shift the probability distribution in such a way as to make 
its occurrence, and therefore a possible drought, more likely.  <P>

      An alternative approach to estimating shifts in probability 
distributions is through ensemble predictions. One of the 
disadvantages of empirical techniques is that the data sample size is 
much smaller than desirable for many purposes, including the 
estimation of extreme event risks.  Computer forecast models 
that can simulate atmospheric behavior provide one possibility 
for overcoming this small sample problem (another way, which 
is to wait several hundred years for sufficient data, seems less 
appealing).   <P>

      The ensemble prediction approach is essentially a version of 
a "Monte Carlo" strategy.   Think of  nature as loading  the 
"weather dice"  each season, and  the problem  being to estimate 
how the dice are loaded, before the dice are actually rolled.  The 
basis of ensemble predictions is to run prediction models many 
times from slightly different initial conditions, and then to 
estimate the probability distributions from the outcomes of the 
different model runs.  The choice of different initial conditions 
reflects both the incomplete nature of climate observations and 
the fact that the atmosphere's evolution is very sensitive to these 
uncertainties.  <P>

      For the experimental seasonal predictions with the NCEP 
model mentioned earlier, ensemble forecasts consisting of nine 
model runs (out to two seasons in advance) are performed 
monthly.  Ultimately, predictions so derived will be blended 
with current statistical-empirical methods for seasonal forecasting.  
For shorter periods (out to two weeks), ensemble forecasts 
from seventeen separate model runs are performed daily.  <P>

      Although research is still in its early stages, preliminary 
results are encouraging and indicate that ensemble predictions 
may be useful in increasing the lead times for alerting the public 
and decision makers of possible risks of severe large-scale 
weather events.  This increased lead time should be useful in 
reducing human and economic losses due to high impact 
weather, such as the U.S. has experienced this past year.  <P>

<p>The Satellite Climate Research Group uses data from various 
environmental satellites in studies of seasonal to interannual climate 
variability.  Topic areas of interest include studies of air-sea
interaction including transfers of heat, momentum, and water; studies 
of the global hydrological cycle including water vapor and 
precipitation; and studies of the Earth's radiation budget.

PACS - PanAmerican Climate Studies program.</a>
The goal of this NOAA project is to improve the skill of operational
seasonal to interannual climate prediction over the Americas.  We are
investigating radiative and hydrological processes over the eastern
tropical Pacific and the Americas using a combination of satellite
data sets over several spectral bands.

<h2 align=center> A Study of Hydrological Processes in the PACS Region Using Multispectral
Satellite Observations </h2>

Investigators:  <A HREF="http://www.cdc.noaa.gov/~bates">John Bates</A>,
                <A HREF="http://www.cdc.noaa.gov/~wkb">Wesley Berg</A>, and
                <A HREF="http://www.cdc.noaa.gov/~qy">Qian Ye</A> <br>
Program: <a href="http://tao.atmos.washington.edu/pacs/">PanAmerican Climate Studies</a>

<P>
Understanding the role of hydrological processes, and rainfall in particular,
on short-term climate variability in the PACS regions is critical to improving
models and the subsequent climate prediction efforts.  Due to the lack of
in-situ observations over the east Pacific, however, the hydrology of this
region and the dynamics of moisture transport between the east Pacific and the
Americas is poorly understood.  The pilot field observation program planned
over the east Pacific intertropical convergence zone for September 1997 will
provide an excellent basis for studying in detail the hydrology of this region,
especially for investigating interactions within the marine boundary.  Although
the field campaign will provide valuable information for studying small-scale
processes and for validating satellite retrievals, concurrent satellite
observations are needed to understand the large-scale dynamics and the
resulting interactions with hydrological processes over the continents.
<P>
Accurately determining rainfall along the east Pacific ITCZ has been
identified as a priority for the PACS program due to its importance in
influencing seasonally-varying precipitation over the American continents.
As shown in <A HREF="images/figure1.gif">Figure 1</A>, however,
differences between rainfall processes
in this region and the west Pacific have resulted in widely varying
estimates from currently available satellite retrieval techniques.
We hypothesize that the convection within the east Pacific ITCZ is controlled
largely by two processes: 1) low-level moisture transport converging into
the ITCZ, and 2) subsidence and drying of the upper troposphere above the
ITCZ.  These processes are unique to the east Pacific ITCZ and have
given rise to the large discrepancies in estimates of precipitation and
hence latent heat release and resultant seasonal to interannual circulation
anomalies.  We propose, therefore, to study the impact of low-level moisture
transport and upper level moisture variability on precipitation within the
east Pacific ITCZ using a variety of satellite remote sensing data combined
with in-situ observations to be taken by the PACS field program.
<P>
A number of satellite data sets are currently available which will be used
to investigate our hypothesis as well as to identify features of interest
and provide a basis climatology for the field campaign.  The satellite data
sets will include rainfall, cloud liquid water, integrated water vapor, and
ice scattering information from SSM/I, cloud top temperature from OLR
measurements, and vertical water vapor information from both the SSM/T2
moisture sounder and HIRS.  In addition, we will investigate the use of
SSM/T2 data for estimating cloud liquid water and rainfall over the continents
for warm rain situations which cannot be identified from a scattering signature
using SSM/I.  Measurements from the field program will be used to validate the
satellite retrievals and to study related small-scale physical processes.
Finally, comparisons between the satellite retrieved fields and model analysis
will be performed to identify deficiencies in the models.

<h1 align=center>Ocean Winds</h1>

<h2 align=center>Observation and modeling studies of surface wind speed and direction using microwave emission and backscatter from the ocean surface</h2>

Principal Investigator:  <a href="/~bates/">Dr. John J. Bates</a>
<br>

Institution:  NOAA/ERL Climate Diagnostics Center

<p>
<h3>Abstract</h3>
The ultimate goal of this research is the production of a
global ocean surface wind climatology using satellite passive and active
microwave data for use in climate monitoring and modeling.  This will be
accomplished by improving our understanding of the physics of the
radiative transfer, conducting comparisons of the remote sensing data
with in situ observations, and by analysis of the time/space scales of
variability captured by the remotely sensed data.  These results will
then be applied to the implementation of a two-dimensional variational
assimilation scheme to obtain an optimum objective analysis of ocean
wind.
<p>
<h3>Results</h3>
Wind speed and direction retrievals from the ERS-1
scatterometer show algorithms tuned using meteorological model wind
fields have significant biases versus algorithms that are tuned using
independent in situ buoy observations.  We have ported the 2-dimensional
variational assimilation method (VAM) of Dr. R. Atlas of NASA GSFC to
our system and are evaluating the impact of our ERS-1 scatterometer
algorithm on the method.  We plan to use the VAM in the future to
assimilate SSM/I radiance data for wind speed and direction.  We have
been evaluating the evidence for a wind direction signal in SSM/I data
using buoy wind matches, empirical techniques, and matches with the
ERS-1 scatterometer.  Results to date are mixed; there is a wind
direction signal which we have extracted using neural network
techniques, but we have not had success reproducing the empirical
results of Wentz.

GAME <A HREF="images/game.gif"> (map) </a>
is a subprogram under  <A HREF="http://www.cais.net/gewex/gewex.html">
the Global Energy and Water Experiment (GEWEX) </a>
as a WCRP sponsored international program to study the water
and energy balance of Asian monsoon in particulr. One of the essential
scientific requirements for GAME is to understand the physical bases of
the seasonal forecast of the Asian monsoon, and to improve the models
for predicting and assessing the regional hydro-meteorological conditions
and water resources of monsoon Asia under the anthropogenic as well as
natural climate changes.
<P>
GAME is focused on atmosphere-land interaction and proposed to
do six regional experiments over
<ul>
  <LI>    the equatorial rain forest region of southeast Asia
       
  <LI>    tropical monsoon region in south and southeast Asia

  <LI>    subtropical and midlatitude humid region of East Asia

</ul>
<P>
Cooperated with scientists from the LSSR, Peking University, People's Republic of
China, our study is focus on the study of intraseasonal and interannual 
variations over the GAME region, HUBEX and QXPMEX regions in particular, by using
multispectral satellite observations and NMC global grid analysis data stored in 
house. Another project we involve with Chinese scientists is
<A HREF="http://www.cdc.noaa.gov/~qy/SCSMEX/intro.html">
the South China Sea Monsoon Experiment (SCSMEX) </a> 
which will start in 1997 and coincide with the GAME's regional experiment.
The SCSMEX is highly complementary
to GAME in providing information on the early onset of the Asian monsoon over
the oceanic region in the SCS and therefore provides a more complete description
of the Asia monsoon coupled atmosphere-ocea-land system.
<P>
As the first step, we are working on <A HREF="http://www.cdc.noaa.gov/~qy/SCSMEX/scsmex_study.html"> the study of climatological features
in the South China Sea region during summer monsoon onset </a> by using NMC global

<H1 align=center>GEWEX Water Vapor Project (GVaP) </H1>

Principle Investigator: John J. Bates<br>
Program: <a href="http://www.cais.net/gewex/gvap.html">GVaP</a>,
<a href="http://www.cais.net/gewex/gewex.html">Global Energy and Water Cycle Experiment (GEWEX)</a>

<H2>Introduction</H2>

The GEWEX Water Vapor Project (GVaP) has been proposed to address
the fundamental problem in the basic understanding of the role water
vapor plays in moist atmospheric processes.  Water vapor is an
integral constituent in determining the radiative transfer through the
atmosphere.  It is the most significant greenhouse gas, thus it plays
a vital role in regulating global climate.  Water vapor also plays a
major role in several atmospheric processes such as cloud formation,
precipitation, and evaporation.  Therefore, a more complete
description of the global distribution of water vapor at all time and
spatial scales is considered necessary to better understand these
processes.

<P>

<H2>GVaP Scientific Objectives</H2>
The four central scientific objectives of GVaP (from <A HREF="gvapref.html">
Starr and Melfi, 1991 </A>) are

<OL>
<LI>To develop and apply algorithms to obtain an accurate global
climatology of the horizontal and vertical distribution of atmospheric
water vapor.
<LI>To develop and improve techniques to provide high vertical
resolution global measurements of water vapor from satellites.
<LI>To improve knowledge of water vapor and its variability in
relation to key hydrologic processes by establishing a long-term
climatology of the vertical distribution of atmospheric water vapor at
selected sites and by conducting regional field campaigns in diverse
climatological regimes.
<LI>To promote basic research contributing to an improved
understanding of the role of atmospheric water vapor and its
variability in meteorologicy, hydrology, and climatology.
</OL>

<P>

<B><H2>Current and Future GVaP Projects at CDC</H2>
</B>

Current GVaP projects include developing a 16 year climatology
(1981-1993) of upper tropospheric water vapor using HIRS data from the
NOAA-series satellites.  This research first requires the
intercalibration of HIRS brightness temperatures between all NOAA
satellites.  <A HREF="gvapref.html"> Bates et al. (1996) </A> describe
an intercalibration procedure for the HIRS channel 12 brightness
temperatures and show how these brightness temperatures can be used to
describe qualitatively the interannual variability of upper
tropospheric water vapor. The method developed by <A
HREF="gvapref.html"> Stephens et al. (1996) </A> has been used to
derive upper tropospheric relative humidity and water vapor burden
from the HIRS data.  This research is considered vital since recent
studies investigating the reliablity of water vapor measurements made
by radiosonde data have shown that those measurements are generally
erroneous.  Also, given the relatively poor spatial sampling by the
radiosonde network, HIRS data can provide a more complete data set of
water vapor globally.

A comprehensive comparison will be conducted between the HIRS derived
water vapor and methods developed by other investigators.  The following
table describes many of the datasets we will use in our comparison

<h2 align=center> Production and Analysis of a TOVS Radiance Data Set </h2>

Investigator:  <A HREF="http://www.cdc.noaa.gov/~bates">John Bates</A><br>
Program:  <a href="http://xtreme.gsfc.nasa.gov/pathfinder/">NASA</a> / <a href="http://pegasus.nesdis.noaa.gov/pathfinder.html">NOAA</a> Pathfinder<br>

<p>
Atmospheric water vapor is the most important greenhouse gas.  Water vapor
absorbs Earth emitted infrared radiation and remits this radiation at a lower
temperature.  Thus, in the climate system, water vapor acts as a moderating
influence on the planetary atmosphere.  In numerical model simulations of
anthropogenic climate change, water vapor is a significant positive feedback
mechanism enhancing the initial warming by anthropogenic gases by up to a
factor of two.  The radiative effects of upper tropospheric water vapor,
however, can compensate the radiative effects of changes in total column
water vapor and mitigate the strong water vapor feedback.  Analysis of TOVS
operational clear column water vapor brightness temperature data shown that,
in the present climate, changes in upper tropospheric water vapor can lead
to a net drying of the tropical upper troposphere, or a negative water vapor
feedback.  If this is the case, then model simulations of global warming
substantially overestimate the amount of warming likely to occur from
anthropogenic greenhouse gases.
<p>
On seasonal to interannual time scales there has been little progress in
prediction of large-scale atmospheric circulation changes that accompany
changes in surface forcing such as ENSO warm events and soil moisture
feedback.  We believe this is due to a lack of understanding of the response
of the hydrological cycle to such boundary forcing.  Analysis of a TOVS
radiance data set will help us better understand the changes in the
atmospheric hydrological cycle that result from changes in boundary forcing
on seasonal to interannual time scales.
<p>
The TOVS operational clear column radiance data set used for the studies to
date have several limitations for climate and global change studies.  First,
the operational processing algorithm has changed over time so that
discontinuities occur in the data set.  Second, the coating on the first
four HIRS/2 instruments suffered from a serious signal variation between
8-9.5 microns due to scan angle dependent polarization absorption losses.
Finally, the pre-launch calibration of the HIRS/2 water vapor channels is
uncertain because the calibration was not performed in a vacuum, but in an
open laboratory with an uncertain amount of water vapor in the path.  All
three of these problems must be carefully addresses to make the TOVS
Pathfinder data set useful for climate and global change research.
<p>
<h3>Results from prior research</h3>
Analysis of the adjusted anomaly time series shows the water vapor anomalies
in the tropics and subtropics (Figure 1).  Comparison of these data with
outgoing longwave radiation and sea surface temperature anomalies reveals that
both convection and increased upper tropospheric moisture occur over anomalously
warm water.  The development and movement of deep convection and increased
upper tropospheric moisture can clearly be traced during El Nino/Southern
Oscillation warm events (Figure 1).
<p>
Figure 1 shows HIRS12 anomaly time-longitude sections for three latitude
strips; 30-10N (Fig. 1a), 10N - 10S (Fig. 1b), and 10 - 30S (Fig. 1c).  In the
northern subtropics (Fig. 1a) the majority of the variability is centered
at 135W and extends from about 180 to 90W.  Variability near 135W at these
latitudes is generally out of phase with variability at 135W in the deep
tropics (Fig. 1b).  Thus, during the strong 1982/83 warm event, HIRS12 is
anomalously low (moist) in the tropics, but anomalously high (dry) in the
northern subtropics.  In the southern subtropics (Fig. 1c), the major
variability is found between 90E and 90W.  Again, this variability is
generally out of phase with variability in the tropics (Fig. 1b) but shows
propagation of anomalies to the northern subtropics, which shows standing
variability near 135W.

<h3>MISSION</h3>
</a>
The mission of the Climate Diagnostics Center
(CDC) is to identify the nature and causes for climate
variations on 
<a href=timeline.gif>time scales</a> ranging from a month to
centuries.
<p>
<center>
<a href=timeline.gif>
<img src=timeline_tiny.gif alt="Image of the CDC Research Timeline: Months to Centuries"></a>
</center>
<p>
<a name=nino>
The goal of this work is to</a>
develop the ability to predict important climate variations
on these time scales.  Short-term climate variations of
interest include major droughts and floods over the
continental U.S., and the global anomalies associated with
El Ni&ntilde;o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO).  These events
attract great public interest, and often have enormous
social and economic consequences.  On longer time scales,
basic research goals include identifying the causes for
decadal to centennial climate variations, and separating
natural variability from anthropogenically induced
climate changes in order to provide an improved scientific
basis for public planning and policy decisions.  CDC has
made considerable progress toward these goals through
a coordinated program of diagnostic and modeling
studies aimed at significantly advancing understanding
and predictions of climate variability.
<p>
<a name=goals>
<h3>GOALS</h3>
</a>
Specific goals of major subprojects within the Center include: 
<ul>
<li>Identifying key processes contributing to extreme
short-term climate events, including major droughts
and floods
  
<li>Advancing understanding and predictions of
ENSO
  
<li>Developing new diagnostic techniques to better
determine fundamental atmospheric quantities, such
as diabatic heating
  
<li>Improving monitoring and descriptions of climate
variability utilizing both surface and satellite data
  
<li>Diagnosing general circulation and operational
prediction model data to identify primary areas
where model improvements are needed
  
<li>Identifying major patterns of climate variability
on decadal and longer time scales
  
<li>Investigating the role of air-sea interactions in
modulating decadal-to-centennial variability.
  
</ul>  
Scientists at CDC employ a broad array of methods to
achieve these goals, including observational diagnostic
analyses, simple modeling studies, and analyses of
forecast experiments obtained from sophisticated models
of the atmosphere and oceans.  CDC studies increasingly
involve comparisons of observational and model data, an
activity essential for improving current research and
prediction models. 
This is one example of the more
general and fundamental 
<a href=flow_chart.gif>role that diagnostic studies
play</a> in linking together various disciplines, 
including observations and monitoring, theoretical research,
modeling, predictions, and, ultimately, applications.

<h3>DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS</h3>
</a>
Major climate data set development projects at CDC
include the Comprehensive Ocean-Atmosphere Data Set
(<strong>COADS</strong>) and the Global Climate Perspectives System
(<strong>GCPS</strong>). Both are collaborative projects with the
<a href="http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/">National Climatic 
Data Center</a>.
The COADS project also
includes extensive cooperation with the 
<a href="http://http.ucar.edu/metapage.html">National
Center for Atmospheric Research</a> and the
<a href="http://cires.colorado.edu">
Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental
Sciences (<strong>CIRES</strong>)</a>.  
These high-quality data
sets significantly improve NOAA's capabilities for
monitoring climatic trends, particularly in surface
temperatures and precipitation.  In addition, CDC
manages large observational and model data sets that are
frequently used in climate research studies within and
outside CDC, including the National 
Center for Environmental Prediction (NCEP)
reanalysis data set which, upon
completion, will have a volume of approximately 1.2
terabytes.  CDC's data management group is also a
leader in developing new techniques to simplify access to
and display of climate data for the larger scientific
community.  The CDC data holdings may be browsed via
the World Wide Web interface to the 
<A HREF="/cgi-bin/CDCData.pl">CDC data archives</a>.

data sets, contact

<h3>RESULTS AND ACCOMPLISHMENTS</h3>
</a>
Some significant results and accomplishments 
are listed below:
<ul>
<li>An observational study examined the processes
contributing to the evolution of the extreme heat
wave-droughts in the Midwestern U.S. in 1980 and
1988.  The results showed that these extreme events
evolved in two stages, with the first or development
stage being forced from sources over the Pacific, and
the second stage due mainly to anomalous boundary
conditions (primarily reductions in soil moisture) in
the drought regions.  This suggests that, once
established, major heat wave-droughts tend to be
self-perpetuating (see the
<a href="/cdc/overview/fig3.html">
surface heat balance</a> illustration below).  
Another implication of this
study is that, in order to properly simulate or predict
long-term droughts, it will be necessary for
atmospheric prediction models to properly
incorporate the effects of land surface processes.

<p> 
<li>
<a name=enso>Several investigations considered various aspects
of ENSO. </a> One study identified the climatic impacts
of ENSO through observational analyses of 25 El
Ni&ntilde;o or "warm events" and 23 La Ni&ntilde;a or "cold
events."  The results showed that, during the
December through February period following the
development of a warm event, a large fraction of the
global tropics experiences above normal
temperatures.  Above normal temperatures also
dominate Alaska, the northern Midwestern states, and
most of Canada, while anomalously cold conditions
occur in the southeastern United States.  Nearly equal
and opposite signals are seen for cold events.  During
winter, warm event precipitation is enhanced over the
southeastern U.S. and southern South America, while
much of Australia, southern Africa and the Amazon
suffer precipitation deficits (the the
<a href="/cdc/overview/fig4.html">temperature</a>
and <a href="/cdc/overview/fig5.html">precipitation</a> anomaly
illustrations below).  Identification of
such relationships aids long-range weather forecasts,
since El Ni&ntilde;o is relatively predictable up to a year in
advance.

<p>             
<li>A major research goal at CDC is to improve
predictive skill on seasonal and longer time scales.
One study evaluated the seasonal predictive skill of
two nearly identical versions of the National
Meteorological Center's climate model.  Skill was
evaluated by the model's ability to produce, on
average, seasonal circulation patterns over North
America (see the
<a href=/cdc/overview/fig6.html>composite anomaly</a>
illustrations below).  Although the two models had
identical sea surface temperatures, one was
significantly better for predicting seasonal
temperature anomalies.  These results indicate that
biases in current climate models can significantly
degrade forecast quality and reliability, and suggest
that further gains in seasonal forecast skill are likely
through continued development of climate models.

<a href="/cdc/overview/fig6.html">

alt=""></a>
<a href="/cdc/overview/fig6.html">Composite temperature anomalies</a>
<p>                  
<li>In another study, a simple empirical dynamical
model of ENSO was developed that has predictive
skill at lead times of up to a year comparable to that
of comprehensive global coupled ocean-atmosphere
models.  In addition to providing tropical sea
surface temperature (SST) forecasts, this simple model
is being used to elucidate the basic mechanisms of
tropical SST evolution and to diagnose errors in the
more complicated coupled models.

</a>
<p>             
<li>The ultimate cause of atmospheric motions is
spatial variations in heating and, therefore,
determining the location and intensity of atmospheric
heat sources is a fundamental problem in
meteorology.  Scientists at CDC have developed a
new method for estimating atmospheric heat sources
that provides very encouraging results, and are now
preparing a global heating data set for widespread
dissemination.  This data set should prove extremely
useful for verifying climate models and
satellite-derived estimates of precipitation, and
consequently improving our ability to monitor climate
variability and detect climate changes.
<p>
<li>In studies with 
<a href="/~climsat/">satellite data</a>, CDC scientists have
actively participated in the Global Energy and Water
Cycle Experiment (<strong>GEWEX</strong>).  As part of this work,
they have developed a new technique to improve
estimates of the  spatial and temporal variability of
atmospheric water vapor.  Their analyses show that
during the 1982-83 major ENSO event air in the
tropical upper troposphere became warmer, as
expected, but also drier, implying a negative feedback
effect from water vapor in the global warming sense.  
This differs from the IPCC consensus view
that the upper tropospheric water vapor feedback is
always large and positive, and emphasizes the
importance of such analyses in studies of climate and
global change.

</a>

<p>             
<li>Several studies at CDC have considered various
aspects of longer term climate variability.  Of
particular interest is the role of air-sea interactions in
climate and climate change.  Decadal and longer term
variations have been documented in winds and sea
surface temperature (SST) variability over the North
Atlantic, and thermal variations in the upper 500 m of
the North Pacific have been described since 1970 (see
figure below).  The latter study identified relationships between
the cooling trend observed in mid-Pacific SST's from
the 1970's to late 1980's and temperature anomalies in
the deeper ocean.  Another study showed how sea
surface temperature anomalies that formed near the
surface in winter could remain intact below surface
during summer, and then reappear at the surface the
following winter, thereby potentially influencing
interannual climate variability.

<h3>FUTURE WORK</h3>
</a>             
Future work at CDC will extend the research
activities described above, in direct support of three
primary NOAA Strategic Plan goals:  Advancing
Short-Term Forecast and Warning Services, Implementing
Seasonal to Interannual Forecasts, and Predicting Decadal
to Centennial Climate Changes.
<p> 
Studies of extreme events will examine the
relationships between these events and ENSO, the roles of
different physical processes in producing severe droughts
and floods, and the potential predictability of extreme
events.  Process studies will continue on ENSO and
air-sea interactions, along with collaborative studies with
the NCEP Coupled Model project to improve seasonal to
interannual climate predictions.  Long-term variability
studies will examine further the processes contributing to
decadal variability of the atmosphere-ocean system, as
well as decadal to centennial variability in precipitation
and other climate measures.  An important objective in
future work at CDC will be to identify and clarify the
linkages between climate variability on different time
scales; for example, how ENSO influences the occurrence
and duration of an extreme event such as a major drought
or flood, and the relationships between ENSO and
decadal-to-centennial variability.

<h2>ADVANCE SHORT-TERM WARNING AND FORECAST SERVICES</h2>
<dl>
<dt>
<h3>OBJECTIVE: Enhance Observations and Predictions</h3>
<dd>
<img src=/cdc_images/blueball.gif alt="o">
<em><strong>Performance Measure:</strong></em>  
Assess the utility of the NCEP ensemble forecasting system to predict
the skill of ensemble means and the utility of probabilistic forecasts
obtained from the ensemble, particularly for extreme events.
<p>
<img src=/cdc_images/greenball.gif alt="o">
<em><strong>Milestone:</strong></em>  
Verification scores and statistical tests will be computed for the
preceding year of ensemble forecasts.  (Q2, J. Whitaker)

<h2>IMPLEMENT SEASONAL TO INTERANNUAL CLIMATE FORECASTS</h2>
<dl>
<dt>
<h3>OBJECTIVE: Conduct Research For Improved Climate Predictions
</h3>
<dd>
<img src=/cdc_images/blueball.gif alt="o">
<em><strong>Performance Measure:</strong></em>  
Assess the global climate system's response to the El 
Ni&ntilde;o/Southern Oscillation (ENSO).
<p>
<img src=/cdc_images/greenball.gif alt="o">
<em><strong>Milestone:</strong></em>  
Perform a suite of modeling studies to evaluate physical and
dynamical response to the El-Ni&ntilde;o/Southern Oscillation.  The paradigm of the
climate signal associated with ENSO is of a linear response with anomalies
during the warm El Ni&ntilde;o phase opposite those during the cold 
La Ni&ntilde;a phase.
Emerging observational evidence suggests appreciable non-linearities.
(Q3, M. Hoerling, P. Sardeshmukh)
<p>
<img src=/cdc_images/blueball.gif alt="o">
<em><strong>Performance Measure:</strong></em>  
Determine the sensitivity of the North American climate to details of
tropical Pacific SST forcing.
<p>
<img src=/cdc_images/greenball.gif alt="o">
<em><strong>Milestone:</strong></em>  
Execute a hierarchy of atmospheric GCM simulations using progressive
degradations of tropical SST anomaly patterns.  The analysis will establish
the practical importance of forecasting the details of that SST forcing in
coupled climate models.
(Q4, M. Hoerling, P. Sardeshmukh)
<p>
<img src=/cdc_images/blueball.gif alt="o">
<em><strong>Performance Measure:</strong></em>  
Create a simple model of extra tropical low frequency (LF) variability
using a parameterization of high frequency (HF) synoptic eddy variability.
<p>
<img src=/cdc_images/greenball.gif alt="o">
<em><strong>Milestone:</strong></em>  
Quantify how the modeled LF variability is modified when the HF eddy
flux parameterization is included, as opposed to parameterizing the HF eddy
fluxes as stochastic noise, and assess the degree to which the modeled LF
variability resembles that observed.  (Q2, J. Whitaker)
<p>
<img src=/cdc_images/blueball.gif alt="o">
<em><strong>Performance Measure:</strong></em>  
Document the mean variability of surface fluxes in the GFDL atmospheric
general circulation model (GCM).

<em><strong>Milestone:</strong></em>  
Diagnose the variability of air-sea heat fluxes, an important source
of energy for both the atmosphere and ocean, from synoptic (weekly) to
interannual time scales.  (Q2, M. Alexander)

<img src=/cdc_images/blueball.gif alt="o">
<em><strong>Performance Measure:</strong></em>  
Process subsurface ocean temperature records and examine them for
winter-to-winter reemergence of SST anomalies.
<p>
<img src=/cdc_images/greenball.gif alt="o">
<em><strong>Milestone:</strong></em>  
Examine the extent to which thermal anomalies, created during winter
in the relatively deep ocean mixed layer, remain intact in the summer
seasonal thermocline and then re-emerge at the surface in the following
winter in the North Atlantic and North Pacific ocean basins.  
(Q4, M. Alexander)

<em><strong>Performance Measure:</strong></em>  
Convene a meeting of U. S. participants in the international GEWEX Water
Vapor Project (GVaP).

<img src=/cdc_images/greenball.gif alt="o">
<em><strong>Milestone:</strong></em>  
Convene a meeting at the AMS 1997 annual meeting to discuss how and
whether a new hypothesis of the climatic effect of atmospheric water vapor
should be a major focus of a U.S. GVaP effort.  This U.S. GVaP meeting will
be a follow-up to the international GVaP meeting to take place in Geneva in
November 1996. 	(Q2, J. Bates)
<p>
<img src=/cdc_images/blueball.gif alt="o">
<em><strong>Performance Measure:</strong></em>  
Assess and suggest improvements to the tropical water cycle of the
atmospheric model component of NCEP's atmosphere-ocean forecast system.
<p>
<img src=/cdc_images/greenball.gif alt="o">
<em><strong>Milestone:</strong></em>  
Rigorously assess the atmospheric component of the NECP
atmosphere-ocean forecast system by simulating the observed seasonal and
interannual variability of the atmospheric hydrological cycle.  A particular
emphasis will be placed on assessing and improving the ability of the
atmospheric model to accurately simulate the observed variability of upper
tropospheric water vapor.  (Q4, J. Bates)

<h1>CDC Personal Home Pages: Suggestions and Guidelines</h1>
<hr>
Essentially, a <i>home page</i> is the multimedia, hypertext analog
of the <b>.plan</b> file used by the <code>finger(1)</code> program.
Currently, the CDC personal home pages follow a curriculum vitae
format. <p>
<h2>To create a home page for yourself:</h2>
<OL>
<LI> Create a directory named <b>public_html</b> in your home
directory (.i.e <b>~<em>user</em>/public_html</b>).  This directory will contain
all your hypertext documents written in 
<A HREF="http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/General/Internet/WWW/HTMLPrimer.html">HTML</A>. 
<p>
<ul>
<li> <i>Make sure the directory is executable and readable by the group and
others (i.e. <code>drwxr-xr-x</code>).</i>  <p>
</ul>

<LI> In this <b>~<em>user</em>/public_html</b> directory, create a file called
<b>index.shtml</b>.  The contents of this file will be your home page.
If this is to be the page linked from the 
<a href=/cdc/people.shtml>CDC Staff page,</a> then 
it should roughly follow a vitae or resume format.
Additionally, it should not contain your photograph.
Look at <a href="people.shtml">other home 
pages</a> for examples and ideas.
You may also wish to review the 
<a href=http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/Provider/Style/>Style Guide</a>
portion of the 
<a href=http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/>World Wide Web Consortium</a>
Web pages, as well as the Web style guide articles produced by
the <a href=http://www.htmlhelp.com/>Web Design Group</a>.
<p>
<ul>
<li> <i>Make sure this file (and all others you reference) is readable by the
group and others (i.e. <code>-rw-r--r--</code>).</i> <p>
</ul>

<li>If you have publications which you would like to include in
<strong>both</strong> your personal web page as well as the 
<a href="/cgi-bin/sort_pubs?pub_file_list">CDC publications list</a>,
do the following:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Create a file called 
<em>pubs.html</em> in your public_html directory.
The contents of this file should look like this:
<blockquote>
&lt;html&gt;<br>
&lt;head&gt;<br>
&lt;title&gt;&lt;/title&gt;<br>
&lt;/head&gt;<br>
&lt;body&gt;<br>
&lt;ul&gt;<br>
&lt;li&gt;<em>first publication entry</em> &lt;p&gt;<br>
&lt;li&gt;<em>second publication entry</em> &lt;p&gt;<br>
&lt;li&gt;<em>etc.</em> &lt;p&gt;<br>
&lt;/ul&gt;<br>
&lt;/body&gt;<br>
&lt;/html&gt;<br>
</blockquote>
The <em>publication entries</em> should follow the 
<a href=ams.refs.html>format</a>
recommended by the American Meteorological Society.
<p>
<li>In your <em>index.shtml</em> file,
identify the point at which you'd like to show your
publications. At this location, 
add the following line to your <em>index.shtml</em> file:
<blockquote>
&lt;!--#include file="pubs.html"--&gt;
</blockquote>
<li>Notify 
<a href="http://www.cdc.noaa.gov/~jac/">Julia Collins</a>
that your publications are ready to be included in the
<a href="/cgi-bin/sort_pubs?pub_file_list">CDC publications list</a>.
</ul>
<p>
<LI> The 
<A HREF="http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/demoweb/url-primer.html">URL</A>
for your home page will be simply
<b>http://www.cdc.noaa.gov/~<i>user/</i></b>. For example,
for the user <b>jac</b>, the proper url is
<b>http://www.cdc.noaa.gov/~jac/</b>.
<p>

<li>Notify <a href="http://www.cdc.noaa.gov/~jac/">Julia Collins
</a> when your home page is ready.<p>
</OL>

<H2>Technical Information</H2>

Our server has the following default behavior: when a
<A HREF="http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/demoweb/url-primer.html">URL</A>
references a directory (as opposed to a file), our server looks for
the file <b>index.shtml</b>. <p>

<H3> Mike Alexander's Research Summary (February, 1996) </H3>
<P>
<p>
Over the past few years I have participated in studies that have
focused on midlatitude atmosphere-ocean interaction and interactions
between the surface and deeper layers in the ocean.  As the ocean evolves
much more slowly than the atmosphere, a better understanding of these
interactions may lead to improved seasonal and longer forecasts of the
climate system.  In addition, it is important to understand processes that
influence the physical state of the upper ocean, which has a strong affect
on marine organisms from phytoplankton to salmon.  I've found that in
studying midlatitude air-sea interaction, I've embarked on a career that
often involves looking for small signals among a lot of noise. 
<P>
<p>
When I first joined the Climate Diagnostic Center at CIRES about five
years ago I was finishing a series of studies that examined the
development of sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies in the North
Pacific Ocean during El Ni&ntildeo events in the tropical Pacific. 
Previous observational studies indicated that the central North Pacific
tended to be colder and the eastern Pacific warmer than normal during El
Ni&ntildeo events.  How did these anomalies form?  The hypothesis I tested
was that the atmosphere would act as a bridge between the tropical and
midlatitude parts of the ocean: warm SSTs in the tropical Pacific
associated with El Ni&ntildeo could alter the atmospheric circulation in
midlatitudes, which in turn, could force the cold central/warm east SST
anomaly pattern to form in the North Pacific.  The experiment design
consisted of an atmospheric general circulation model (GCM) that was
attached to a model of the North Pacific Ocean but was forced by
prescribed warm SSTs representative of El Ni&ntildeo conditions in the
tropical Pacific. These model experiments appeared to confirm this
hypothesis:  SST anomalies developed in the North Pacific Ocean model
which resembled those in the real world during El Ni&ntildeo events.  
<P>
<p>
	In the second part of the experiment, SST anomalies that developed
in the North Pacific were allowed to feed back upon the overlying
atmosphere.  The results suggested that the North Pacific SST anomalies
tended to damp the response to the tropical SSTs.  However, the true impact
of the North Pacific was unclear due to the high degree of variability
among five similar model experiments. 
<P>
<p>
During my first year at CIRES I became intrigued by a pair of articles
from the early 1970's by Jerome Namias and Robert Born who noted a
tendency for midlatitude SST anomalies to recur from one winter to the
next without persisting through the intervening summer.  They speculated
that temperature anomalies that form at the surface and extend over the
relatively deep ocean mixed layer in winter, could remain intact in the
summer seasonal thermocline, a strongly stratified and thus stable layer. 
The anomalies could then re-emerge at the surface when the mixed layer
again deepened by entraining water from below during the following fall
and winter.  In complimentary studies Clara Deser, Cecile Penland and I
examined this <A HREF= "reemerge.mech.gif"> &quotre-emergence
mechanism&quot</A> using both subsurface temperature data and mixed layer
model simulations at Ocean Weather Stations in the North Atlantic and
North Pacific.  Ocean modeling experiments indicated that entrainment
plays an important role in the ocean heat budget by regulating the mixed
layer depth in addition to controlling the heat flux through the base of
the mixed layer. Lead-lag correlations showed that temperature anomalies
beneath the mixed layer in summer were associated with the temperature
anomalies in the mixed layer in the previous winter/spring and following
fall/winter but are unrelated or weakly opposed to the temperature
anomalies in the mixed layer in summer, These results supported the
re-emergence mechanism and opened the possibility that thermal anomalies
stored within the upper ocean may return to the surface and influence the
atmospheric circulation in subsequent seasons. <P>
<p>
In a recent examination of upper ocean observations Clara, Mike Timlin and
I found that abnormally cold water first created at the surface in the
central North Pacific during the mid 1970's, propagated down into the
ocean, reaching depths of 400 m about 2 years later.  Over a period of 15
years this cold water moved slowly down and southward with time following
the general circulation of the North Pacific ocean.  This work was very
exciting as it is one of the first observational studies to show the
evolution of subsurface ocean temperature anomalies and because it
supports recent theories of how water enters and flows within the
permanent thermocline. 
<P>
<p>
For the past ~2 years I have participated in a cooperative research
project between several Universities and NOAA's Geophysical Fluid Dynamics
Lab (GFDL).  As part of that project, James Scott and I have developed an
atlas of atmospheric fields using a recent GFDL GCM simulation and along
with Julia Collins have made the atlas available on the World Wide Web. 
The atlas includes standard fields such as the mean and standard deviation
of precipitation and more unique analyses such as the model's
representation of the 30-60 day wave in the tropics and the mid-winter
minimum in storm activity over the North Pacific Ocean.  Please contact me
(maa@cdc.noaa.gov) if you are interested in the print atlas; the Web
version is located at "http://www.cdc.noaa.gov/gfdl/". 
<P>
<p>
	In future work, I plan to use observations and models to study
air-sea interactions on different time scales and processes which cause
ocean temperature anomalies to develop and evolve.  I also plan to work
closely with Joshua, my one-year-old son, who is a big signal among a lot
of noise.

My primary research focuses on the application of remote sensing technology
to the estimation of atmospheric and ocean surface parameters for the study
of climate variability and global change.  Current research projects involve
the study of climate-scale hydrological processes using data from
satellite-based passive microwave radiometers and other satellite data
sources.

<h1>Henry F. Diaz</h1>

<hr>

Henry F. Diaz is a research climatologist in the Climate Diagnostics Center of
the Environmental Research Laboratories of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration (NOAA), U.S. Department of Commerce.  He received his B.S. degree
in Meteorology (1971) from The Florida State University, his M.S. in Atmospheric
Science (1974)  from the University of Miami, and his Ph.D. in Geography
(Climatology) (1985) from the University of Colorado at Boulder. He has worked
for various units of the Environmental Research Laboratories in Boulder during
the past 15 years in a variety of climate research and climate impacts issues,
particularly, on the impact of climatic variation on water resources of the
western United States.<p>

Dr. Diaz is a Fellow of the Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental
Sciences (CIRES) of the University of Colorado (Boulder), and Adjunct Associate
Professor in the Department of Geography at CU-Boulder. He has published
extensively in the scientific literature about the nature of climatic
variability on regional to global spatial scales, and ranging from interannual
climatic variability to century-scale fluctuations. He is also a recognized
expert on the El Ni&ntilde;o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon and has
written several journal articles on teleconnection features of ENSO, as well as
coedited a book titled El Ni&ntilde;o: Historical and Paleoclimatic Aspects of
the Southern Oscillation, published by Cambridge University Press (1992).<p>

	John provides support for the research of Dr. Brant Liebmann and Dr.
Harry Hendon. He retreives, filters and otherwise prepares data, runs various
statistical analyses and prepares plots for both publication and presentation.
In addition, he runs a version of the Cane and Ghent Pacific Basin model and
helps to debug and run a version of the Baroclinic Chi Problem correction of
the NCEP reanalysis.
<p>
	John uses primarily Fortran and the NCAR Graphics package for analyzing
data and creating plots, but also uses IDL, Matlab and Kaliedagraph for 
visualization.

<img alt="o" src="http://www.cdc.noaa.gov/~dlj/images/blueball.gif">
My latest project is the TOVS Pathfinder study where we are re-calibrating and
cloud clearing all of the HIRS 1b dataset (1979-current).
<BR>

<img alt="o" src="http://www.cdc.noaa.gov/~dlj/images/blueball.gif">
I am conducting research on the distribution and variability
of global water vapor as a part of the GEWEX water vapor project (<A
HREF="http://www.cdc.noaa.gov/~dlj/gvap.html">GVaP</A>,).
This research includes deriving upper tropospheric water vapor using a
16-year climatology of intercalibrated HIRS data from the NOAA-6
through NOAA-12 satellites.  Other related research includes performing
comparisons between six different global water vapor data sets in
order to assess the differences between these different data sets.
<BR>

<img alt="o" src="http://www.cdc.noaa.gov/~dlj/images/blueball.gif">
I am comparing water vapor data from The Atmospheric Model
Intercomparison Project (<A
HREF="http://www-pcmdi.llnl.gov/phillips/AMIP.html">AMIP</A>) to
SMMR precipitable water data and upper tropospheric humidity data
derived from HIRS channel 12 data.

<BR><BR>

<img alt="o" src="http://www.cdc.noaa.gov/~dlj/images/blueball.gif">
The focus of my graduate research was on analyzing a climatology of
four years of precipitable water derived from SSM/I observations.  I
analyzed both temporal and spatial variablitity of precipitable water
over the global oceans.  I also described the global relationship
between SST and precipitable water.  Other research included comparing
precipitable water derived from SSM/I and TOVS.

Andy's research interests have lead him to a study of atmospheric
processes on both the meso- and global- space scales.
Research for the Masters Degree lead him to understand some of the
difficulties inherent in applying simple two-dimensional
frontal models to real-world (i.e., three-dimensional)
situations.  These difficulties have, to some extent, been
addressed by application of the 
<A HREF="/~afl/abstracts/thesis.html"> psi-vector technique </A>
to diagnose 3-D frontal circulations. Andy had the opportunity of
working with an oceanographer at NASA/GSFC.  This opportunity taught him to
appreciate the synergistic role of the 
<A HREF="/~afl/abstracts/schopf_loughe.html"> ocean-atmosphere system </A>.  
Now he is studying the predictability of general
circulation models which are run in both "reanalysis" and
"forecast" modes.  The reanalysis runs are interesting
because of the long time period over which they provide
consistent, analyzable data, but the ensemble prediction runs
offer a view to the future of numerical weather prediction.

Research Summary for Brian Mapes
<p>
Atmospheric tropical convection is the overall theme of this research.
Satellite data give a climatological overview of tropical convection,
with space and time resolution sufficiently fine to resolve the
individual cloud clusters.  Doppler radar and other meteorological
data from field experiments are used to ascertain relevant details
of the internal structure of particular precipitating cloud systems,
most notably the vertical profile of the heating rate.  Results from
these data analyses are idealized and fed into simple analytic and
numerical models, in order to clarify the detailed mechanisms
by which convective cloud heating drives tropical circulations
at spatial scales from mesoscale to planetary.

My background is in Physics (University of Florida), Meteorology (University of Washington), and
Oceanography (Jet Propulsion Laboratory).  I became interested in systems administration around
the time Unix workstations first became popular (circa 1987).  I found that I enjoyed configuring 
computer systems to better serve the needs of the scientists with whom I worked.  About the same
time, I also became interested in the problems associated with the analysis and display of large, 
cumbersome geophysical data sets, so I wrote my own rather primitive data visualization package 
for use on a Sun 3/60.  These two interests, systems management and data management, have been 
the focus of my professional activities ever since.
<p>
I now serve as CDC's Director of Computing and Network Services, with overall responsibility 
for the provision of state-of-the-art computational and network facilities in support
of CDC's scientific mission.  As a Department of Commerce appointed Contracting Officer, 
I also act as the chief procurement official for the majority of CDC's computer-related purchases.  
I am the technical supervisor of the computer systems support staff and have considerable
expertise in systems integration and long range planning.  I collaborate with the broader NOAA 
community on many technical issues through my participation on the ERL Technical Committee on 
Computing Resources and the NOAA-Boulder Network Working Group.  
<p>
In the area of data management, I helped create CDC's Climate Research Data Center, which has
evolved over the years into our on-line data service available through the Web.  I am the 
technical supervisor of CDC's data management group, which includes our Webmaster and individuals
associated with the ingest and redistribution of the NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis data set.  I am active 
in the American Meteorological Society's annual IIPS (data management) conference and also serve 
as the OAR representative to the ESDIM Program, which helps coordinate NOAA's agency-wide data 
management strategy.  For my efforts to promote use of the Web throughout the agency, I was named 
"OAR Employee of the Year" for 1995.

<br>
Currently, my research at CDC is focused in these areas:
<br><br>
<li> <strong> Storm track dynamics.</strong> <br><br>

"Storm tracks" are geographically localized regions of high-frequency, synoptic-scale eddy activity, such as those observed off the East coasts of Asia and North America in winter.  Since arriving at CDC, I have been studying the sensitivity of storm tracks to various aspects of the large-scale, low-frequency flow in which they are imbedded. <a href="/~jsw/Abstracts/jsw+rmd1.abstract.html">Whitaker and Dole </a> (1995, <i> J. Atmos. Sci. </i>, 889-907) examined the role of large-scale zonal variations of baroclinicity, horizontal deformation, and uniform translation in the organization of storm tracks in an idealized model. <a href="/~jsw/Abstracts/jsw+pds1.abstract.html">Whitaker and Sardeshmukh </a> (1997, <i> J. Atmos. Sci. </i>, to appear) used a two-level quasi-geostrophic model linearized about the observed 400 and 800 mb wintertime flow and forced with Gaussian white noise to simulate the statistics of observed synoptic-scale transient eddies. The
model not only produced realistic eddy <A HREF="/~jsw/presentations/JSW+PDS1talk.9606/slide5.gif">streamfunction
variance</A> maxima in the Pacific and Atlantic storm tracks , but also
variations in their <A HREF="/~jsw/presentations/JSW+PDS1talk.9606/slide15.gif">relative
strengths</A> through the fall, winter and spring seasons. The model was
also successful in producing realistic distributions of the associated
eddy <A HREF="/~jsw/presentations/JSW+PDS1talk.9606/slide7.gif">vorticity</A>
and <A HREF="/~jsw/presentations/JSW+PDS1talk.9606/slide8.gif">heat </A> fluxes.  
<br><br>
<li><strong> Feedback between high-frequency (synoptic scale) and low-frequency (planetary scale) motions. </strong><br><br>

Low-frequency, large-scale motions in the extratropics are sustained, in part, through fluxes of heat and momentum by high-frequency, synoptic-scale eddies.  Since the low-frequency motions also act to organize synoptic eddies into storm tracks, the interaction between the two scales of motion is quite nonlinear.  We are using the storm track model described by  <a href="/~jsw/Abstracts/jsw+pds1.abstract.html">Whitaker and Sardeshmukh </a> to investigate what large scale flow patterns are most
effective in organizing transient eddy fluxes of heat and momentum which
act to <I>reinforce</I> the large scale flow pattern itself. Ultimately,
we hope to use the storm track model as a basis for the parameterization of high-frequency
transient eddies in a reduced model of large-scale, low-frequency variability
in the atmosphere.
<br><br>
<li><strong> Ensemble prediction.</strong> <br><br>

For lead times beyond a few days, numerical weather prediction should be thought of in probabilistic, instead of deterministic terms.  That is, the focus shifts from producing a single weather map (reflecting the future state of the atmosphere given the initial state), to producing an array of weather maps (reflecting a range of possible future states given a range of equally likely initial states).  The diversity of possible future states is a function of forecast lead time and the errors in the observing system (i.e. the diversity of equally likely initial states). Ensemble prediction is an attempt to calculate the range of possible future states by performing multiple numerical predictions starting from a range of different (ideally, equally likely) initial states. At CDC, we have been obtaining and archiving ensemble predictions produced by <a href="http://www.ncep.noaa.gov">NCEP</a> (the National Centers for Environmental Prediction).  A detailed <a href = "http://sgi62.wwb.noaa.gov:8080/ens/ens_info.html">description</a> of NCEP's ensemble forecasting scheme is available on the web. An active area of research at CDC involves studying how to extract useful information from these data, particularly relating to the problem of how to forecast <a href = "/cdc/overview/extreme">extreme short-term climate anomalies</a> more than a week in advance.  Real time <a href = "/~map/maproom/ENS/ens.html">ensemble forecast products</a> are produced from the NCEP ensemble data here at CDC.  In addition to studies involving the operational NCEP ensemble data, we are investigating alternative strategies for ensemble prediction using idealized models.  Among the questions we are trying to answer with simple models are; 1) what is the optimal way to create initial states for ensemble prediction?, 2) what is the effect of model errors (as opposed to initial condition errors)?, and 3) how can we extract the most useful information from the ensemble? (particularly at long forecast leads when the "signal to noise" ratio is small).

<hr>
<h2>Acknowledgments</h2>


The GCM used in this study was developed by 
the Climate Dynamics Group at the Geophysical 
Fluid Dynamics Laboratory, headed by Syukuro 
Manabe. Peter Phillips performed the R30S14 GCM 
simulation and also provided the model documentation 
and output. We are grateful to Isaac Held and 
Gabriel Lau for their careful review and many 
suggestions for improving the Atlas. We would 
also like to thank Jeff Whitaker and Mark 
Borges for their comments.
<p>
The printed atlas was developed as part of the 
GFDL-University Consortium project, which
is sponsored by the Office of Global Programs 
at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

<h2>Introduction</h2>

An atlas of the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics 
Laboratory (GFDL) Rhomboidal 30 with 14 Sigma 
Levels (R30SI4) general circulation model (GCM) 
is made available in order to facilitate the 
intercomparison of the climate and variability 
of the model with observations and other modeling 
studies. Our goal is to reveal some of the model's 
strengths and weaknesses, providing a benchmark for 
future experiments with the GFDL model.
<p>
The R30S14 version of the GFDL GCM is a global, 
spectral, primitive equation model. There are 14 
unequally spaced sigma levels in the vertical (from 0.9967 
to 0.015) and a rhomboidal truncation at wave number 30, 
yielding a horizontal grid spacing of approximately 
3.75&#176; 
of longitude and 2.225&#176; 
of latitude. The model has seasonally 
varying insolation, sea surface temperature (SST) and sea ice, 
but the values are fixed for each day. The SSTs and sea 
ice vary according to long-term observed climatologies 
and the same cycle is repeated for each year in this 17 
year integration. The spectral representation of the 
orography has been improved by smoothing out some of 
the artificial ripples in the field that are generated 
by the spectral transformation. This model also features 
gravity wave drag and predicted clouds. Stratiform clouds 
form and large scale precipitation begins when the relative 
humidity exceeds 100%. Subgrid scale precipitation is 
parameterized by moist convective adjustment. The surface 
temperature over land is calculated assuming there is 
no heat storage in the ground. Soil moisture is predicted 
using the bucket method, in which the ground can absorb 
up to 15 cm of rainfall before runoff begins (Manabe, 1969). 
Standard bulk aerodynamic formula are used to calculate 
the surface wind stress and sensible and latent heat 
fluxes using a constant transfer coefficient of 1x10e-3 
over the oceans and 3x10e-3 over land. More details 
on the GFDL GCM can be found in Gordon and Stern (I982), 
Manabe and Hahn (I981) and Lau (1981)

<h2>Data Analysis</h2>
The seasonal mean statistics for 
December-January-February (DJF), March-April-May (MAM), 
June-July-August (JJA), and September-October-November (SON), 
are calculated from 16 years of daily output from the GFDL R30S14 
model run. Data from the model's sigma surfaces are 
interpolated to pressure levels: the temperature and wind 
fields are interpolated linearly, while specific humidity 
is interpolated logarithmically to pressure surfaces. In the 
model's cloud cover scheme, there is no fractional cloudiness; 
a grid point at a given sigma level is either clear or 
completely overcast. The fractional cloudiness shown in 
the atlas is a measure of the number of days in the season 
where cloud cover is present. For the layer average 
fractional cloudiness, the entire layer, made up of 2-3 
levels, is considered overcast if one of the levels is 
overcast. Diabatic heating is calculated from the latent 
heat release associated with condensation, absorbed 
radiation, vertical diffusion and the convective adjustment 
process; both the clouds and diabatic heating are shown 
on sigma surfaces. The mass weighted diabatic heating is 
obtained by summing the diabatic heating rate over the 
14 model layers.
<p>
Variability in the model is diagnosed using interannual 
standard deviations
calculated from the equation: 
<blockquote>
<center>
<img src=eq1.gif alt="Equation 1">
</center>
</blockquote>
Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) analysis 
(Kutzbach, 1979) is used to objectively identify the 
dominant modes of 500mb height variability over the 
Northern Hemisphere. The first two EOFS, calculated 
using covariances rather than correlations, are presented.
<p>
The zonal average vertical cross-sections are 
constructed from data interpolated to 8 pressure 
levels (1000, 850, 700, 500, 300, 250, 200, and 100 mb), 
except for the vertical cross-sections of cloud cover, 
mass-stream function and diabatic heating, which are 
constructed from the original 14 sigma levels in the 
model. The meridional mass-stream function is 
caculated following Peixoto and Oort
(1992): 
<blockquote>
<center>
<img src=eq2.gif alt="Meridional mass-stream function">
</center>
</blockquote>
A solution 
for the function is then found by vertically integrating 
this equation starting at the top of the atmosphere, 
where <strong>W</strong> = 0. The transient meridional momentum, heat 
and moisture fluxes are derived from the model 
output using the following equations: 
<blockquote>
<center>
<img src=eq3.gif alt="Equation 3">
</center>
</blockquote>
These quantities are calculated daily and then the 
seasonal and zonal means are constructed from 
the daily values.
<p>
Time filtering of certain variables is 
performed using a Lanczos filter (Justice, 1976; 
Duchon, 1979), with half power weights at 3-10 days 
to isolate synoptic times, and 20-I00 days to 
examine the Madden and Julian Oscillation 
(Madden and Julian, 1971). The 3-10 day filter 
is also used to examine the seasonal cycle of 
the North Pacific and North Atlantic storm tracks 
following Nakamura (1992). We used 121 weights, 
which translated to a data loss of 60 days at the 
beginning and end of the 17 year time series. The 
filtering is performed on daily anomalies (relative 
to the long-term monthly mean) and the total 
standard deviation or mean of these filtered 
anomalies are then calculated (except in the case 
of Figs 113 and 114 in the printed 
atlas, where the time series of the 
time filtered anomalies are shown) . Only model 
years 2-16 are used in the standard deviation 
calculations, since model years 1 and 17 are 
truncated by the filtering process. For 
filtered covariance statistics, each individual 
variable (i.e. v') is filtered before computing 
the covariances. A few variables, such as the 
precipitation and vertical velocity, are spatially 
smoothed using a nine point filter in order to 
emphasize large scale features.  The filter 
weights the central point, the four adjacent 
points, and the four corner points by a ratio 
of 1:0.5:0.3.

 	  above those of the control.
</ul>
	  
<li>Data format: IEEE, not packed.
<li>Dataset size: ~1.6 GB for each integration
<li>See <em>R30L9_idealized_with_zonal_ssts_doc</em> for details.

<DT><B>Total Seasonal Means</B><A NAME="Means"> </A>
<DD> Seasonal means are calculated by averaging the 4 times daily data for
January 1979 to December 1995  over all years (Feb 29 is not used) for each of the four seasons. Seasons are defined as Mar-Apr-May, Jun-Jul-Aug, Sep-Oct-Nov and Dec-Jan-Feb. Thus,
each season is averaged for 9 full years:<br>

points below the surface.<p>
<dt><B>Seasonal Yearly Means</B><A NAME="Yearseas"> </A>
<dd>Seasonal means are calculated by averaging the 4 times daily data for each of 4 seasons of each year from March 1985 to Feb 1993 (Feb 29 is not used). Seasons are defined as Mar-Apr-May, Jun-Jul-Aug, Sep-Oct-Nov and Dec-Jan-Feb. There are a total of 36 seasonal values for each file:<br>

<center><img src="eqn2.gif"><br></center>
<p>
<DT><B>Seasonal Transient Flux Means</B><A NAME="nonfiltflux"> </A>
<DD> Seasonal transient fluxes are calculated by averaging the 4 times daily data for
March 1985 to Feb 1993  over all years (Feb 29 is not used) for each of the four seasons the quantity x'y' where x' is the difference from the total seasonal
mean X and y' is the difference from the total seasonal mean Y. Seasons are defined as Mar-Apr-May, Jun-Jul-Aug, Sep-Oct-Nov and Dec-Jan-Feb. Thus,
each season is averaged for 9 full years.<br>
<center><img src="eqn5.gif"><br></center><p>
<DT><B>Monthly Means</B><A NAME="Monmean"> </A>
<DD> Monthly means are calculated by averaging the 4 times daily data for
March 1985 to Feb 1993  over all years (Feb 29 is not used) for each month.
Eight full years go into each month.<p>
<dt><B>Interannual standard deviation</B><A NAME="Inter"> </A>
<dd>Values for each season are calculated by summing over the squared difference between each years' seasonal mean and the total seasonal mean for each gridpoint. That is:<br><center>
<img src="eqn3.gif"><p></center>
<dt><B>Total standard deviation</B><A NAME="Intra"> </A>
<dd>Values for each month are calculated by summing the squared difference between the value averaged for one day and the monthly mean for that year for all years.  That is:<br><center>
<img src="eqn4.gif"><p>
</center>
<dt><B>Diurnal Cycle by Month</B><A NAME="diurn"> </A>
<dd>Values for each of the 4 times (0z,6z,12z,18z) are averaged over all
years for each month for each separate level. A total mean is calculated 
for each month and the anomalies from these means for the 0z,6z,12z and 18z 
means are stored. Four months are presented in the atlas; January, April, 
July and October.<p>
<dt><B>EOF's of monthly anomalies for the Norther Hemisphere</B><A NAME="eof"> </A>
<dd>EOF's for each month were calculated from 17 years of anomaly data. Data for
the Northern Hemisphere ONLY was used and a cosine weighting was applied to correct
for the decrease in longitude spacing with latitude.  EOF's were calculated separately
for each level. What is plotted is the correlation between the principal component
time series and the data at each grid point for the entire globe. The correlations 
were "corrected" to match the sign of the 1000mb level so that vertical plots could be 
made. However, there is no guarantee that the first EOF of one level will match the 
first EOF's of the other levels. In most cases, though, the correlation is quite high;
especially in winter.

NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis Data<p> 

<b>Detailed description:</b>
The NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis project is using a state-of-the-art analysis/forecast system
to perform data assimilation using past data from 1958 to the present.<p>
<p>

This document describes NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis data that is currently
available on-line at CDC (this is not all of the data generated by the
Reanalysis).  Additional files will be periodically added.<p>

<b>Important!</b>  If you acquire NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis data products from
CDC, we ask that you acknowledge ("NCAR/NCEP Reanalysis data provided
through the NOAA Climate Diagnostics Center
(http://www.cdc.noaa.gov/)."  CDC in any publications where the data
were used.  We would also appreciate receiving a copy of any papers
published using this data.  Your cooperation will help CDC to justify
keeping the NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis freely available online in the
future.  Thank you!

<p>
<i>Please</i> read the <strong><a href="reanalysis/problems.shtml">problem list</a></strong> before using the data.

<title>NMC Reanalysis - netCDF file descriptions and sizes</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>NMC Reanalysis - netCDF file descriptions and sizes</h1>

This document describes the proposed file names for the various
datasets within the NMC Reanalysis.  The estimated sizes for these
datasets are also included, with totals for possible implementation
scenarios.  Not all of these datasets or all the variables within them
will necessarily be converted to netCDF or put online.<p>

For each data file, the first part of the file will be identical to
the variable name inside the file.  In general, each file will contain
one year of data ("YY" in the file name) for one variable.  For
monthly means and covariances, the files generally will contain all
the years currently available.  The current status of which of these
files are created and where they are stored is not described here.<p>

<h2>At CDC:</h2>
We have finished processing 1979-1995
for the pressure level, tropopause, surface, surface gauss, other gauss
 and spectral data.  
All of these data are now available on-line.

The CDC Map Room Weather Page is designed to provide
a quick and easy reference point for current forecast
products available from the National Centers for Environmental 
Prediction (NCEP).   Currently, the products available
on this page are being developed with the use of
data being provided through NCEP.  The products 
are primarily being produced with the use of
<A HREF="http://grads.iges.org/grads/"> GrADS</A> and 
<A HREF="http://www.rsinc.com/idl/"> IDL</A>.

<HR SIZE=3>
<B><img alt="warn" src="/~map/caution.tiny.gif">It is possible that we may be
dropping from the Unidata IDD network in the coming days.  This will be causing
some changes in some of the products that we provide.  This will be most
noticeable in the 'Current Weather Products' section.  The biggest change
will be to plots containing surface data such as analysis plots.  If we do
in fact drop the data feed, we will do our best to provide replacement links
for the products that are affected.  We do get much of our data from NCEP, so
model runs such as the MRF, ETA, and AVN will not change.  Also, our coverage
of the NCEP Ensemble Data Forecasts will continue as always.</B>

The CDC Map Room Climate Page is designed for easy access
to products useful for monitoring weekly to annual fluctuations
of global and regional climate.  There are three primary data 
sources for these products: 1) final atmospheric analyses from
the National Meteorological Center (NMC), 2) outgoing longwave
radiation and other satellite data from NESDIS and 3) weekly
SST and ocean analyses from the Coupled Model Project at NMC.
The graphic output from these data are currently being produced 
with the use of the NCAR Graphics, IDL, and GEMPAK software 
packages.  A paragraph descibing the scientific framework for 
the project can be accessed by
