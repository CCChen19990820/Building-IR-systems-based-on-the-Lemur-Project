<!--INFOLINE--><b>Harriet Harman sends  son to selective grant maintained school </b><br><br><br><b><h2>22 January  1996</h2></b><br><h2> Harriet's right to choose, but her reasons are all wrong   </h2>
<br><b>Leading article</b> <br><br><br>      <p>There is a simple test to guage the quality of state schools: do they generate a conflict  for progressive politicians between their loyalty to their party's principles and their loyalty  to their children's best interests? Clearly, for Conservative ministers there is no such  conflict. At the last count only 12 out of 55 children of Cabinet ministers had gone to state  schools. Worse still, at secondary level only three out of 23 Cabinet ministers had used a  state secondary for their children. Labour is different. Virtually all Labour MPs use state  schools. But that is not enough. Within the state system there are schools which Labour  opposed: opted-out grant-maintained schools which the party initially opposed but would now  allow to continue without their perks; and grammar schools based on selection at 11, which  Labour has long opposed. Hence, as Tony Blair and Harriet Harman have found to their cost,  selecting the politically-incorrect school creates enormous political fuss. Ms Harman was  already under a cloud for choosing the same grant-maintained school - the London Oratory - as  Tony Blair for one of her children. Now she is in even worse odour for sending her next child  to an even more incorrect school: a highly selective boys' grammar in Kent. <p> <p>Ms Harman  has defended her decision on the grounds that the primary school which her son in Dulwich  attends sends many of its pupils to this grammar school. Clearly her 11-year-old son has an  academic bent. He was one of 700 applicants and finished in the top 90. In the words of Ms  Harman: "Any child in Southwark can apply, many go and admission is irrespective of money or  who their parents are." Moreover, she claims there has long been a tradition "for parents in  inner London to send their children to schools in outer London boroughs". There will be some  sympathy for Ms Harman's dilemma: should she really have to tell her son he can't go to the  same school as his classmates because this would harm her political reputation? Won't she get  more public approval by putting her son's interests before her political interests in refusing  to send her son to the local sink school? But it is not that easy. Ms Harman is a leading  shadow minister in a party committed to ending selection at 11. This pledge is repeated  unequivocally at several points in the party's white paper, Diversity And Excellence, published  last year, and was reinforced by her shadow cabinet colleague, David Blunkett, at the last  Labour conference: "Read my lips. No selection, either by examination or interview under a  Labour government." <p>  <p>Within the party, Ms Harman's decision is causing a furore. The chairman of  the parliamentary party's education committee has resigned. Shadow ministers are furious. Where  Ms Harman has gone wrong is in not being blunt enough about the state of education in  Southwark. Her nearest secondary schools have abysmal education records: in one, a mere six per  cent achieve five GCSEs at grades A to C (the old GCE passmark) and in the other only 11 per  cent. What Ms Harman should quote is Diversity And Excellence: "We will not tolerate failure,  nor will we condone incompetence." She might even quote her leader at the launch of this  document: "Labour will sweep away the second rate... and root out under-achievement in our  schools." So rather than talking about the traditional school travel routes, which are  questionable, Ms Harman should be more honest and simply say she will not send her children to  the local schools until they achieve excellence. <p> <p> <p> <p> <br><br><center><TABLE  border=0><tr> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif"  ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td  width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td  width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td  width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr> <td align=left  valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td> <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A  HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td> <td align=right  valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td> </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Rebecca Smithers</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>Labour was thrown into turmoil last night by shadow health secretary Harriet Harman's decision to send her son to a selective grant-maintained grammar school. Her move prompted the chairman of the parliamentary party's education committee to resign.  <p>  <p>Despite the party's attempts to maintain unity over the issue, several shadow cabinet members broke ranks to tell the Guardian that they were furious with Ms Harman because her decision to send her 11-year son, Joe, to St Olave's School in Orpington, Kent, flies in the face of Labour education policy.  <p>  <p>"I am shocked and disappointed. This is all about the selfishness of the middle classes," said one, saying Ms Harman would be hauled over the coals at Wednesday's shadow cabinet meeting.  <p>  <p>David Blunkett, Labour's education spokesman, emphasised that the decision was a personal one and that the party's opposition to selection was unchanged. But he is known to be furious that the row has effectively sabotaged his intended attack on the Nursery Education and Grant Maintained Schools bill, which receives its second reading in the Commons today. "Harriet has done all the damage but it is David who is left to pick up the pieces," said another shadow cabinet member.  <p>  <p>The shadow transport secretary, Clare Short, warned Ms Harman that she would have to answer to her constituents over her choice.  <p>  <p>Backbenchers expressed their anger, and Gerald Steinberg, MP for the city of Durham, who has chaired the Labour education commitee for three years, told the Guardian he could no longer continue in the post after such a slap in the face.  <p>  <p>In his letter of resignation to the parliamentary party's chairman, Doug Hoyle, which he will send by fax today, he writes: "As no senior member of the party has felt it necessary to condemn her actions, it is left to lowly me to express my disgust and outrage at what she has done.  <p>  <p>"As a very senior member of the Labour Party, her action is both hypocritical and in my view against Labour party education policy. Only in the last fortnight have we vociferously attacked the Tories for allowing increasing numbers of children to be selected by examination to schools. How on earth can we take such a stance and then find a very senior member of the party ignoring our policy?"  <p>  <p>The party's education policy paper, Diversity and Excellence, last year spelt out the opposition to selection and the 11-plus no fewer than six times. At the party's conference Mr Blunkett made a pledge: "No selection either by examination or by interview under a Labour government." Yesterday he said Labour was committed to ending selection at the remaining 160 grammar schools where the local authority and parents agreed. Ballots of parents, including those with children at feeder schools, would be held, though details have not been worked out.  <p>  <p>Ms Harman, the MP for Peckham who lives in Southwark, south-east London, refused to comment on her decision. She has let it be known that the school is open to all children in the borough and others in her son's class would be going there.  <p>  <p>Ms Harman, married to Jack Dromey, a senior Transport and General Workers' Union official, sends her elder son, Harry, to the London Oratory, the grant-maintained school chosen by Tony Blair for his son.  <p>  <p>Ken Livingstone, MP for Brent East, told LWT's Crosstalk programme that he thought it was "a major error of judgment on Harriet's part because the Labour Party is quite clear that there should be no selection". Tony Banks, another left winger, said: "If the local schools are not good enough for them, they're not good enough for anybody."  <p>  <p>The Liberal Democrat leader, Paddy Ashdown, said on BBC1's Breakfast with Frost: "A politician has to ensure that what they do and what they say matches up."  <p>  <p>A poll published today for a teachers' union indicating that more than half of people questioned were in favour of a return to grammar schools, secondary moderns and the 11-plus, suggests that Ms Harman's decision may do less damage than some in the party fear.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Patrick Wintour</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>The Labour leader, Tony Blair, put his authority on the line last night when he backed Harriet Harman, his isolated health spokeswoman, despite calls from senior members of the shadow cabinet for her to be sacked over her decision to send her son to a selective grammar school.  <p>  <p>After a day spent locked at home, with rumours of her resignation mounting at Westminster, Ms Harman met Mr Blair last night in his office before going on Channel 4 News to insist her decision was taken in the interests of her son and did not compromise the party's decades-long opposition to selection. Against a storm of criticism from within her party, Ms Harman said: "I am not going to be resigning. I don't think my position is untenable. I know our choice has been controversial, but we had to make the right decision in the interests of our child, and I think most parents up and down the country would have done exactly the same thing."  <p>  <p>She added: "Our party's policy remains opposed to selection. I support that. This was a personal choice for us and we made it in the circumstances as they are now. We would have been less than human if we had done anything else."  <p>  <p>She insisted the grant-maintained St Olave's School in Orpington, Kent, to which she is sending her second son Joe, was a state school, even though children were selected by entrance exam.  <p>  <p>She said: "We do not think the way to improve the education system is by a return to the 11-plus, creaming off 25 per cent and writing off 75 per cent." Tory sources, however, pointed out that the school was so successful precisely because it was based on selection at 11, making her position absurd.  <p>  <p>In the Commons, the Labour front bench unequivocally reaffirmed its opposition to selection, but Gillian Shephard, the Education Secretary, claimed Labour's education policies, one of the centre-pieces of its pitch in the coming election, were in "total disarray".  <p>  <p>Some senior shadow cabinet members last night remained dissatisfied with Ms Harman's explanations and were privately urging her dismissal, even though that has been ruled out. The row could cause long-term damage for Labour if the Tory charge of Labour hypocrisy over equality sticks.  <p>  <p>Gerry Steinberg, the Durham MP who quit his post as Labour's backbench education committee chairman on Sunday, said he had "resigned because the action taken by Harriet Harman is in direct contradiction to Labour's policy on comprehensive education and somebody had to make a stand". Writing in the Guardian, the Labour whip Peter Hain argued: "Selection is a mechanism for perpetuating the old class divide which has prevented Britain creating a decent educational system with high standards for all. But that won't be achieved unless the professional classes, MPs included, send their children to local comprehensives as well."  <p>  <p>Former shadow minister Ann Clwyd echoed the criticism, saying: "On this particular issue, she is wrong."  <p>  <p>Mr Blair was told of Ms Harman's decision to send her son to a grammar school after it had been taken. He believes her behaviour does not represent a breach of party policy in that Labour does not propose shutting grammar schools without ballots of local communities.  <p>  <p>In the Commons, David Blunkett, the shadow education secretary, said: "Every parent in every community, whether they are a Member of Parliament or not, should have the right to exercise a preference for their child to go to the school of their choice. That preference should not be blocked by any mechanism that prevents a child entering that school, either on his prior attainment at the age of 11 or on the interview of his parents by a head that then excludes that child because the parents don't match a particular set of criteria."  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Patrick Wintour</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>At the start of this term my husband Jack and I, like tens of thousands of parents up and down the country, had a child due to  transfer from junior to secondary school. We had to make a choice about where he was to go. Living in an inner-city area of London, we  were not in the situation familiar to someone living in a small town with one school. There was never a certainty about one school; there  was always a choice.  <p>  <p>The choice I am referring to is not the Tory choice, but one resulting from the fact that the Inner London Education Area covered a  huge area stretching from Hounslow to Tower Hamlets. Secondly, there has always been a tradition of inner-city kids going to  outer-London boroughs, as well as going across London. These are well-established patterns, reflected in the fact that the majority of  children born in my borough of Southwark are educated outside the borough. Many of them go to Lewisham or to other local boroughs.  That was the context in which Jack and I sat down to make a decision about our son Joe, just like tens of thousands of other parents  around the country - knowing our child, knowing his needs, knowing the local schools. That is what parents do, all parents. They make  decisions in the best interests of their children. That is the iron law of parenting. It is a basic human instinct.  <p>  <p>I do not favour selection. I fully support Labour's plans, set out by our education spokesman David Blunkett. I would prefer the school  not to be selective and would be happy if it ceased to be selective - although I accept that this would be a decision for the parents as a  whole. I fully understand why people feel so strongly about my decision; I feared it would be controversial, though it was not easy to  predict that choosing the right school for our child would cause this storm.  <p>  <p>People accuse me of being a hypocrite or of operating double standards. But Labour did not create the system in which we as parents  are making our choice. It is the miserable system that the Tories have left us with. Many parents are dissatisfied with this system. It  confronts them with difficult choices - and that is why so many parents are looking to Labour to change the system. What we did as  parents was make a choice in the context of the system as it is - but Labour does not seek power to run the system as it is. Labour  needs to get into government to change the education system. I am not saying that I have put my interests as a parent above the  interests of my party. There are two distinct interests. There are decisions that you take when in government and there are decisions  that you take in the here and now as a parent.  <p>  <p>Nothing I have done leaves me out of line with Labour education policy. Nor should it be seen as a stalking horse for a policy change. It  is about our making a decision as parents for our child.  <p>  <p>David Blunkett is patently committed to improving educational opportunities for everyone. He, like me, believes that an education  system which creams off 25 per cent of children and writes off 75 per cent is not the way to provide educational excellence and  opportunity for everyone. David has set out the most important programme for Labour in government to raise standards in all our  schools, so that every child, no matter where they go to school, can get an excellent education. His whole programme of action is  designed to improve standards in the bulk of schools which are not grammar schools, including reducing class sizes by abolishing the  Assisted Places Scheme. I also support him in saying, in relation to the 160 or so historic grammar schools, that there will not be a  change of admissions policy without the consent of the parents and prospective parents in a ballot. I do not want an extension of  grammar schools; I am opposed to returning to the 11-plus. It is a contradiction in terms to say that you want excellence and  opportunity for all, and you then write off 75 per cent.  <p>  <p>Some people claim that I am damaging the interests of Southwark children, or creating social division by not sending my son to the  local comprehensive; but I believe passionately that you cannot use one child as a piece of social engineering. Nor should one child be  turned into a symbol. I am not prepared for my son to be turned into a proxy for the Labour manifesto. It is simply not right to use your  child for political purposes or to advance your political career. It is right to make the proper choice for your child - a choice that is  available on equal terms for all children in Southwark, many of whom can and do go to this school. Moreover, St Olave's, the grammar  school to which my son is going, is a state school. There has been huge controversy over what what I have done. People feel so  passionately about the chances for their children; people also feel passionately about the need for Labour to improve educational  standards.  <p>  <p>Some people argue I could have avoided this problem by sending our second son to the Oratory, the grant-maintained school to which  we sent out first son. It is not unusual for children not to go the same school. Sometimes there is a choice that suits the whole family,  and sometimes there is a choice that suits one but not the other. That is not to imply a criticism of any school. It is just sometimes that  one school is right for one child and not for another. Schools are different; children are different. As a parent you have to put the two  together. That is the same story for hundreds of thousands of parents.  <p>  <p>It is also suggested I could have avoided this problem perhaps if I had moved out of the area and out of my constituency  borough. Some people who own their own home do move to be closer to better schools. I do not criticise them for doing this, but they  should not have to do it. All schools should be good enough and it's unfair on those who cannot afford to move.  <p>  <p>Finally, I have to say I had a flood of correspondence, some wrongly fearing that this is the start of a change in our policy to  selection; and some, very movingly, saying that, like you, we had to make a difficult choice and we understand what you are doing.  <p>  <p>I want to do three things with my life. I want to be a good mother to my children. I want to be a good representative to my  constituents. I want to be part of a government that changes Britian for the better. There is no contradiction between that, and that  there must not be. For that reason, I will not be resigning.  <p>  <p>Harriet Harman is Labour's health spokeswoman.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Maxwell brothers cleared of fraud</b><br><br><br><b><h2>20 January 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Leave justice to  judges  </h2>
<br><b>Leading article</b>  <br><br><br>      <p>Robert Maxwell was innocent OK? Not quite. But in the famous phrase of Pandora Maxwell, the jury in the nine-month trial of her  husband and brother-in-law returned yesterday to tell the Serious Fraud Office to "piss off". The two youngest sons of the rogue  publisher were both found not guilty at the end of the trial stemming from the missing millions of Maxwell pension money. So were two  co-defendants, one live and one dead. The late Robert Maxwell, included as a co-defendant on one of two charges, was implicitly  exonerated. George Staple, director of the SFO, was philosophical: "The criminal justice system has functioned in the way it is designed  to do so."  <p>  <p>Not quite your honour.  <p>  <p>The strategy in this latest trial was clear enough. After a succession of disastrous failures to achieve a conviction in complex City  frauds, the SFO re-ordered its approach.  <p>  <p>This time the charges could not have been more simple. Just two charges based on one common law offence of conspiracy to defraud  involving two sets of assets: one bundle of &#163;100m shares and another of &#163;22m.  <p>  <p>Kevin, the younger son, was linked to Robert on one charge, a move which seemed certain to send him down. Indeed, defence lawyers  strove - in lengthy arguments in the absence of the jury - to have the trial halted because Robert Maxwell's name was "synonymous  with fraud". Yet still the jury returned a not guilty verdict.  <p>  <p>Does this mean Roskill was right? It is now 10 years since the Roskill Committee proposed special tribunals for complex city fraud.  Instead of trial by jury there would be a judge with two expert assessors in perhaps a dozen cases out of the 5,000 frauds a year. In  principle this has been supported in these columns. Mr Justice Henry, who presided over both Guinness trials, has rightly called for  quicker and cheaper fraud trials. Yet it is three and a half years since the Maxwell brothers were arrested. The legal and court costs  since then are almost as shameful as the missing &#163;400m from the Maxwell pension funds. Total cost of the trial and investigation  is estimated at &#163;30m.  <p>  <p>The Maxwell case was not quick but it was meant to be simple. Predictably, the lawyers were able to make sure even the simple  charges were complicated. The jury was told about tax avoidance schemes, devised by a former Inland Revenue officer, that were so  complex that several QCs were called to explain them. They heard about massive sums regularly switched, borrowed, and transferred  between a labyrinth of companies in the Maxwell empire. And yet, our city reporter at the trial remains sympathetic to the jury's  verdict. It is not enough to draft simple charges. They also have to be proved: that there was a dishonest agreement to defraud. The  prosecution argued that the shares belonged to the investment company which administered the Maxwell Group's multi-million pound  pension schemes and were not for Maxwell to trade or pledge; the Maxwell brothers claimed they had been transferred to the Robert  Maxwell Group, a private side of the Maxwell empire, and were available to be traded.  <p>  <p>Maxwell looks like a case of a jury understanding the issues but being unconvinced by the Crown's arguments. They took the trial  seriously, put their job before their personal lives, retired for 11 days and even asked to sit on Saturday. What the SFO needs to do is  reassess its strategy. This prosecution was neither simple nor quick. Is this inevitable? Were its court tactics right? Will defence  lawyers always be able to muddy the simplest of indictments? Would a Roskill-style tribunal, able to handle complex charges, have been  fairer?  <p>  <p>Last year's review of the SFO rejected the idea of merging it with the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS). That was right. The CPS is  making enough mistakes without taking on major fraud. Last year the SFO was handling 50 active cases involving &#163;5bn in fraud.  <p>  <p>All 33,000 Maxwell pensioners have recently been promised that their long-term future is secure but no one should forget the  liquidator's comments: "I have never come across a case that involved so much suffering."   <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Maxwell brothers cleared of fraud</b><br><br><br><b><h2>20 January 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Maxwells cleared of fraud</h2><h3>Tears  of relief but pensioners 'torment' goes on  </h2>
  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Dan Atkinson</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>The future of the Serious Fraud Office was last night being called into question after the dramatic acquittal at the Old Bailey of the  Maxwell brothers, at the end of a 131-day trial which cost the public more than &#163;25m.  <p>  <p>Kevin and Ian Maxwell, sons of the publishing tycoon Robert Maxwell, were cleared in unanimous verdicts after 11 days' deliberation  by the jury of conspiring to defraud pension funds. Financial adviser Larry Trachtenberg was also acquitted. Despite the aquittals, eight  further charges remain under consideration.  <p>  <p>The Serious Fraud Office, which is responsible for investigating and prosecuting financial fraud, masterminded the &#163;11m investigation into the Maxwells' affairs. It is now the target of heavy criticism for what was seen as a four-year fiasco resulting in  charges which could not be made to stand up in court.  <p>  <p>MPs last night tabled Commons questions about the SFO's role following a string of high-profile failures to secure convictions.  Questions were also being asked about jury trials serious fraud cases.  <p>  <p>After the jury announced their verdict, to gasps in the courtroom, Kevin Maxwell rushed across and shook hands with all 12  members. His brother sobbed with relief.  <p>  <p>In emotional scenes outside the court, the Maxwell brothers hugged each other and expressed their delight and relief at the verdicts.  Ian Maxwell said: "I have much in my heart that I will keep for myself and my family. I would like also to pay tribute to that family and  to my lawyers who have been a constant source of strength and pride to me, as has my brother." Kevin Maxwell said: "I gave evidence  in this trial over a period of 21 days and, in his summing-up, the judge said he thought no jury had had a better opportunity of assessing  the honesty of the witness than in my case. Anyone who wishes to discover my attitude to the events leading to the collapse of my  father's group has only to read a transcript of my evidence. I have nothing to add to it."  <p>  <p>The acquittals in effect extended to Robert Maxwell himself. The controversial tycoon was named as co-conspirator with Kevin on  one charge, and his son's acquittal effectively means the publisher's first hearing before a British criminal court resulted in a not-guilty  verdict. The case leaves 32,000 pensioners asking who was responsible for the loss of &#163;440m from their pension funds and  where the unrecovered cash went. "We have a right to know who inflicted mental torment on thousands of pensioners for the past four  years," a spokesman for the pensioners said. Minutes after the verdict, at 2.15pm, Liberal Democrat MP Alex Carlile demanded a  statement from Attorney-General Sir Nicholas Lyell to "explain how the disastrous decision to prosecute (the Maxwells) at enormous  public expense was taken, and to take responsibility for that disastrous decision." He added: "This long experiment with the SFO has  proved to be costly and there is clear evidence that there has been no improvement in the prosecutorial decision-making process as a  result.  <p>  <p>"The time has now come for financial irregularities to be subject to much more rigorous regulation. Prosecution is a very blunt  instrument in such cases."  <p>  <p>Labour's City spokesman Alistair Darling said: "In view of the failure of this trial and others in the past, we now need urgently to  review the way City crimes are prosecuted and in particular the role of the SFO." Paul Boateng, Labour's spokesman on legal affairs,  said: "This is a grave and potentially fatal setback for the Serious Fraud Office that calls into question the future of that institution.  <p>  <p>"There must now be a serious question mark as to whether a fundamental overhaul should now take place of the process of bringing  to justice those responsible for City fraud."  <p>  <p>But George Staple, the director of the SFO, insisted the outcome of the case would not damage the organisation's future. "It was a  prosecution that had to be brought. We must respect the jury's decision. I would not see it as a waste of taxpayers' money."  <p>  <p>He added: "It is our job to conduct a thorough investigation. That has happened in this case. The jury considered the matter for many  days and have reached a verdict. The criminal justice system has functioned in the way it is designed to." There would be no internal  inquiry, he said. In the courtroom, immediately after the verdicts, the Crown applied for and was granted a seven-day moratorium  during which to consider whether any of the remaining charges in the Maxwell affair should proceed to trial. Kevin is named in some of  the outstanding charges.  <p>  <p>Alun Jones QC, Kevin's barrister and the undoubted star of the case, told Lord Justice Phillips, presiding, that "it would be...  oppressive to seek to try him again at vast public expense". The verdict showed, said Mr Jones, that the defendants "acted honestly at  the worst moments of the group's history".  <p>  <p>Kevin spent 21 days in the witness box, describing his father as a bully; Ian and Mr Trachtenberg did not give evidence.  <p>  <p>The case arose in the wake of Robert Maxwell's death, reported on 5 November 1991, when it emerged that a shortfall of more than  &#163;400m existed in Maxwell group pension funds.  <p>  <p>Two charges were at issue. In the first, Kevin, aged 36, was accused of conspiring with his father between 3 July and 6 November  1991, to defraud the trustees and beneficiaries of Bishopsgate Investment Management (BIM), a Maxwell pension-fund company, by  dishonestly misusing &#163;100m, the value of pension-fund shares in Israeli printing-equipment company Scitex.  <p>  <p>On the second charge, Kevin, Ian, aged 39, and Mr Trachtenberg, aged 42, were accused of conspiring together between 5 November  and 21 November 1991, to defraud BIM's trustees and beneficiaries by misusing shares worth &#163;22m as collateral for  Maxwell-company loans.  <p>  <p>Crown QC Alan Suckling told the jury no person could honestly have believed it to have been in the interests of pensioners - given  that the debt-laden Maxwell empire was tottering into bankruptcy - to use their assets in this way. The actions, therefore, had been  dishonest.  <p>  <p>In defence, Mr Jones suggested the Maxwell empire had always been one group, that assets had routinely been shifted around, and  that Kevin had acted properly in trying to protect the family interests from a hellish recession.   <p>  <p><b>The main Serious Fraud Office failures</b>   <p>  <p>1994: Acquittal of George Walker, former head of the Brent Walker group of &#163;164m fraud charges.   <p>1993: Charges against Polly Peck boss Asil Nadir for alleged &#163;500m fraud left on file after he fled country.  <p>1993: Outrage when Roger Levitt sentenced to 180 hours community service for &#163;58m fraud.  <p>1992: Guinness II. Case against Lord Spens and Roger Seelig involving &#163;10.5m fraud charges collapses.  <p>1992: County NatWest &#163;140m insider dealing convictions over turned on appeal.  <p>  <p>Trial lasted 131 days.  <p>  <p>Total costs are &#163;25m plus, possibly the most expensive fraud trial to date, although the Guinness appeals are still running.  And estimates for the Blue Arrow trial range from &#163;9m to &#163;40m.  <p>  <p>Legal aid bill tops &#163;10m. The SFO employed four barristers, including two QCs. Kevin Maxwell was represented by a QC and  two junior counsel, Ian Maxwell and Larry Trachtenberg had one QC and a junior counsel apiece. Kevin spent 21 days (four weeks) in the  witness box.  <p>  <p>Jury of seven women and five men deliberated for 48 hours over eight days and spent 11 nights in a secret hotel. The longest  retirement in jury history.   <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Clare Dyer</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>Kevin Maxwell last night accused the Serious Fraud Office of taking "a political decision tinged with vendetta" in going ahead with a  second trial over the collapse of his late father's publishing empire.  <p>  <p>"This is a political decision by Conservatives who won't be there to pick up the pieces when I am acquitted again," he said.  <p>  <p>He was "absolutely amazed" to learn that he would face another trial which could take another two years to reach a verdict.  <p>  <p>"My attitude is very mixed because on the one hand I take great heart from what happened last week. I didn't go to northern Cyprus,  I gave evidence and I was found to be honest.  <p>  <p>"But I feel now I'm entering into the realms of Kafka. It's a horrendous feeling of having been acquitted and the acquittal counting for  nothing." He vowed to get to the bottom of how the prosecution decision was reached. "We are not going to let this go. We want to know  who made this decision and how they came to it."  <p>  <p>His lawyers would write to the Attorney-General, Sir Nicholas Lyell, he said. "We want an answer. If we're not satisfied and if  we're allowed to, we will go for judicial review."  <p>  <p>The 36-year-old whose wife, Pandora, is expecting her sixth child, said he was "absolutely shocked" to read the press coverage of  his acquittal, which saw it as a failure of the jury system.  <p>  <p>'This was a very impressive jury. I was upset that it counted for nothing. The jury were alert, some even took notes in shorthand.  There were 75 or 76 questions asked by the jury, questions that went to the facts. "I have nothing but admiration for the jury. I was  there because I was charged. They were there because they were doing their civic duty." He pointed out that he was still on legal aid and  predicted that the second trial - without the cost of the investigation which is included in the &#163;25m bill for the first trial - would  cost &#163;10m for the defence and &#163;5m for the Serious Fraud Office.  <p>  <p>"How do they defend the expenditure of money? What new facts are going to come out about the collapse and the roles of the  individuals? We have stood trial, we have given evidence on the most sensitive issues." Mr Maxwell said he had doubted before the first  trial that he could get a fair hearing. "I still think it will be even harder to get a fair trial in this one. My father is still indicted as a  co-conspirator. How are we going to find another group of jurors who say they never heard of him? How much can the state take out of  an individual? How much more do they want - to deprive me of my liberty not now but in two years?" The idea of expert assessors  trying fraud cases filled him with horror. "Who do they want to do it?

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Mitchell Report published</b><br><br><br><b><h2>20 January 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Ulster peace may hinge on senator</h2><h3>Hopes of  an Irish settlement could soon crumble if the Mitchell commission's report on Wednesday gets it wrong  </h2>
  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>David Sharrock</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>John Bruton, the Irish prime minister, yesterday urged all parties, and his own and the British government, to accept the Mitchell  report on illegal weapons when it is published next Wednesday, nearly a week later than planned.  <p>  <p>Mr Bruton's plea was a recognition that not everybody will be happy with the report's findings, and that next week could be crucial  to a real peace in Northern Ireland, nearly 17 months after the IRA declared its ceasefire. Senator George Mitchell, President Clinton's  special envoy to Ireland, understands better than anyone that if he gets it wrong on Wednesday the peace process could soon unravel.  But he warned this week after meeting John Major at Downing Street that success is not guaranteed - saying "only the parties can break  the impasse".  <p>  <p>Mr Mitchell - assisted by General John de Chastelain, the Canadian chief of defence staff, and Harri Holkeri, ex-prime minister of  Finland - has impressed the parties from whom he has been taking submissions. "He asked incisive, perceptive questions," said one  participant in the commission's hearings.  <p>  <p>Mr Mitchell is further hampered in finding agreement among Northern Ireland's factions by the narrow remit to which he is working.  He has been asked, in effect, to square the circle which lies between the Government's insistence that the IRA gives up some arms  before talks begin, and Sinn Fein's insistence on no preconditions.  <p>  <p>Achieving this in isolation of the broader political picture seems impossible, which may be why Downing Street briefed journalists  last week that Mr Mitchell was looking at proposals first mooted by Ian Paisley, the Democratic Unionist Party leader, but more widely  promoted by Ulster Unionist Party leader David Trimble, for an election to a convention, assembly or 'body'. Mr Mitchell denied the  newspaper reports, saying this went beyond the boundaries of his task.  <p>  <p>However, the rumours that an election will take place have refused to go away, even after the leaders of Northern Irish nationalism  John Hume of the SDLP and Sinn Fein's Gerry Adams rejected the idea last weekend. Meanwhile Fianna Fail, the main Irish opposition  party, reportedly told Mr Mitchell there must be concessions to Sinn Fein or the IRA would go back to war. Mr Mitchell is alleged to  have said if this was the case, then it proved the unionists' case.  <p>  <p>So what can the 'three wise men' possibly devise to keep the peace process on course?  <p>  <p>The majority opinion is that it will serve up another portion of Ulster fudge, the diet which has kept the peace going for so long with  so little resolved. The problem is that the ground to be fudged has narrowed so greatly and the moment is fast approaching when hard  decisions can no longer be delayed.  <p>  <p>From the outset it has seemed highly unlikely Mr Mitchell will endorse the Government's demand for a token IRA arms surrender  before talks begin - even though a Belfast Telegraph opinion poll this week showed eight out of 10 people believed the paramilitaries  should hand over their weapons first. Mr Trimble has suggested an alternative road to the table via an election of some description, and  has accepted Sinn Fein's proposals for 'DIY' decommissioning. In order to keep Mr Trimble on board, the Mitchell commission may  conclude that if a weapons handover at this stage is unrealisable then the election proposal must be taken seriously. Mr Mitchell's  problem is then to convince Sinn Fein that they can live with this.  <p>  <p>For that reason there is fevered speculation about an 'electoral index' or 'party plebiscite', with participants in the all-party talks  submitting themselves to a poll to establish their respective levels of public support - or perhaps determine the number of  representatives each group is allowed. That kind of fudge would apparently satisfy both unionists and nationalists. However, that would  have done nothing about the issue Mr Mitchell was first invited to solve. It is understood that one paper he has been pointed towards  discusses a phased decommissioning, whereby all-party talks would first begin, but the paramilitaries would be expected to dispose of  their armaments in incremental steps. At what point the first 'payment' is made is of crucial importance and would require all Mr  Mitchell's cunning to resolve.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p><b>Who wants what</b>  <p>  <p>Dick Spring, Irish deputy prime minister:  <br>All-party talks as soon as possible. Believes paramilitaries must decommission, but no longer insists this must be before talks. Is  sceptical of "deeply flawed" Unionist proposals for elected assembly/convention.   <p>  <p>Ian Paisley, Democratic Unionist Party leader:  <br>Elected Ulster convention at which he is prepared to "shout" at Sinn Fein across the chamber. Vows never to negotiate with Sinn Fein.  Sees no role for Dublin in Northern Ireland.  <p>  <p>John Hume, SDLP leader:  <br>All-party talks without further delay. Says decommissioning of paramilitary weapons has already taken place; the guns will only  bark again if there is no progress. Opposed in public to Unionist proposals for new assembly, believing it is intended to thwart all-Ireland  dimension in any future settlement.  <p>  <p>Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland Secretary:  <br>Publicly insists the IRA and loyalists must hand in some weapons before talks, but in private is prepared to accept whatever  proposals will ensure that Unionists will talk to Sinn Fein. Interested in an assembly if it will bring David Trimble along.  <p>  <p>Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein president:  <br>Rejects any IRA disarmament until a political settlement has been agreed, ie at the end of the process. His party accepts the principle  of decommissioning, saying the IRA might destroy weapons and permit independent verification. Rejects unionist proposals for a new  assembly.   <p>  <P>David Ervine, leader of Progressive Unionist Party, political wing of the Ulster Volunteer Force:  <br>All-party talks with no preconditions on arms, but notes that loyalist paramilitaries have made a "no first strike" pledge and would  hand over weapons if the IRA did. Interested by idea of an elected assembly, if large enough to guarantee loyalist representation.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Mitchell Report  published</b><br><br><br><b><h2>25 January 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Reactions from fury to support  </h2>
  </b><br><b>Leading article</b>      <p><p>The brevity of a statement issued by Gerry Adams said it all. In his reaction  to the Mitchell Report "John Major has effectively dumped the twin-track process," he said. <p> <p>"He is  quite clearly acting in bad faith by swapping one precondition to all-party talks for another. John Major  has now adopted an entirely Unionist agenda in an attempt to buy Unionist votes in Westminster." <p>  <p>Off-stage, senior republicans were first stunned then furious at the 'stunt' pulled by Mr Major. The  twin-track approach of an independent body on arms and preliminary political dialogue had been sold to  them as a means of commencing negotiations by the end of February. <p> <p>Now that deadline has been  pushed right back into an indefinite future. "He's just swapped one precondition for another, dumped the  twin-track, dumped a target date," said a senior source. <p> <p>"What Major did today did not contribute  in any way to building the trust and confidence that he's supposed to be looking for," said another. In a  mood which seemed close to despair, the party was last night facing a return to the drawing board - and  the danger of being accused by their hardline critics of naivety. <p> <p><b>Unionists</b> <p> <p>It was a  good day for David Trimble, who started it by expressing disappointment over the failure of the Mitchell  Commission to solve the impasse in the peace process, but ended it with his view that an elected body was  the only way forward seemingly endorsed by Mr Major. <p> <p>"In view of the refusal of Sinn Fein/IRA to  make the necessary moves with regard to weapons, we regard it as the only way forward," Mr Trimble told  the House of Commons. <p> <p>Earlier his colleague, Ken Maginnis, gave the Mitchell Report a cautious  welcome, which gave rise to speculation that the Unionists have come out of yesterday's developments in  an even stronger position than they had hoped for. <p> <p>But the Irish Government's softly-softly  response is contingent upon Mr Trimble's meeting them for talks, something which he has so far refused to  do. <p> <p>It is likely that unless he is prepared, and quickly, to accept an invitation from the Irish  foreign minister, Dick Spring - who has already expressed his view that an election is a 'flawed' plan - for  a meeting then even their limited support will be lost. <p> <p> <p> <p><b>Opposition</b> <p> <p>Tony  Blair and Paddy Ashdown voiced immediate Opposition support for the Mitchell Report and for John Major's  formula for side-stepping the weapons stalemate with an elected assembly. But Mr Blair also hinted that  if the premier's options did not work he should try others. <p> <p>Insisting that the issues involved  "should transcend normal party politics", the Labour leader stressed the importance of  'confidence-building' measures and offered help in passing speedy legislation to create an assembly. Mr  Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, praised the courage of all involved, and proposed a special amnesty  for stocks of Semtex. Labour's Northern Ireland spokesman, Mo Mowlam, supports an assembly if it proves  an effective means of ending the deadlock, though Hammersmith MP Clive Soley voiced nationalist fears  that it would mean a return to "structures that have failed in the past" and Tony Benn insisted that the  peace process in South Africa and Palestine had not required prior arms decommissioning. <p>  <p><b>SDLP</b> <p> <p>The bitterest exchanges in the Commons yesterday reflected John Hume's memories of  being a member of three failed assemblies in Northern Ireland and his openly-voiced suspicion that Mr  Major was trying to buy time and buy Unionist votes to keep his government afloat. <p> <p>His deputy in  the mainly Catholic Social and Democratic Labour Party, Seamus Mallon, was less caustic but warned that  Mr Major had ignored the main thrust of the Mitchell Report - that talks and decommissioning should  proceed side-by-side. <p> <p>Both were angry last night, but senior Tories were cheered by their refusal  to rule out the assembly completely. "Give them 72 hours", said one. There were Tory cries of "cheap"  when Mr Hume obliquely taunted Mr Major with risking innocent lives by this tactic and went on to remind  MPs that the Mitchell Commission had not positively endorsed the idea of an assembly, which was "outside  its remit". <p> <p> <p> <p> <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td  width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif"  ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td  width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif"  ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td  width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr> <td align=left valign=middle  width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td> <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Mitchell Report published</b><br><br><br><b><h2>25 January 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Breaking the deadlock</h2>  <h3>Senator Mitchell has produced a valuable report  </h2>
<br><b>Leading article</b>  <br><br><br>      <p>Impasse, what impasse? Last year the differences over weapons decommissioning in Northern Ireland seemed to have become intractable going  on irreconcilable. Yesterday, within hours of the publication of the Mitchell report, they seemed to just blow away. By yesterday  evening fresh clouds were beginning to gather, but the change of mood and the new spirit of optimism were unmistakable. By proposing a  series of tough conditions for all parties entering future political talks, and by floating the possibility of an election to precede those  talks, Senator Mitchell and his colleagues have done exactly what was required of them. They have got the deadlocked parties off the  decommissioning hook they had been on for so long.  <p>  <p>It would be wrong, however, to see the Mitchell report as merely a tactical contrivance. It also casts a genuinely fresh eye on the  old problems. It sets out a coherent and pragmatic way of moving to proper talks by emphasising that the participants must sign up to  six principled commitments. It lists a series of clear steps by which decommissioning can take place alongside the talks process. It  underlines other important truths that any reasonable participant ought to accept, including a recognition of the need for an amnesty and  for further action on prisoners, as well as a rebuttal of Sinn Fein's mischievous attempt to treat paramilitary and security force  weaponry as equivalent. All this confirms the wisdom of inviting an international perspective to be brought into the Northern Ireland  negotiations. Those who created the international body have done well.  <p>  <p>The most immediate and grateful beneficiary of this process was undoubtedly the British government. Until yesterday, Britain was  tied to the mast by Sir Patrick Mayhew's Washington speech last year, the third condition of which required a beginning to weapons  decommissioning before Sinn Fein and its loyalist equivalents could enter all-party political talks. For months, 'Washington Three' had  been London's irreducible condition for progress. Yesterday there was very little mention of Washington Three during a long and  consensual hour of exchanges in the Commons. John Major seized on the brief 56th paragraph of the Mitchell report to propose that  pre-negotiation elections can be a credible alternative route for the paramilitaries to reach the conference table. Conservative  backbenchers who as recently as yesterday morning had claimed that Washington Three was non-negotiable suddenly went quiet. When it  came to it, the Conservatives clearly preferred progress to preconditions.  <p>  <p>But we are not out of the wood yet. The satisfied all-party mood at Westminster is not as hegemonic as it may appear. Even  yesterday it was somewhat punctured by the SDLP's allegations that the government has chosen David Trimble's preferred solutions  largely in order to secure Unionist support in the Commons. Sinn Fein's initial welcome for Mitchell also grew more guarded after Mr  Major's statements. There is a danger that nationalist and republican opinion, suspicious of the implications and consequences of an  election which will confirm their minority status in Northern Ireland, will dig in against this approach. Any election will be a credibility  contest in the Catholic north between the SDLP and Sinn Fein, with much at stake for both parties. Southern Irish politicians who  welcomed the report yesterday may find that the way that it has been accepted in London carries a sting in the tail for their longterm  aspirations. The Mitchell report has freed up the peace process, but it may also contain the seeds of future confrontations.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Sarah Cook marries Turkish waiter</b><br><br><br><b><h2>23 January 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Inquiry call as girl, 13, 'marries'  waiter after holiday romance  </h2>
  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Alan Watkins</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>Police and social services launched an investigation last night after the parents of a 13-year-old Essex girl said they had allowed her  to go through a marriage ceremony in Turkey with a man she met during a family holiday. All the county care agencies expressed their  concern over the welfare of Sarah Cook from Braintree who is said to be living with the family of Musa Komeagae, an 18-year-old  unemployed waiter.  <p>  <p>A spokesman for Essex county council said it was meeting the family yesterday afternoon. "Obviously the girl's welfare is the main  concern. We want to help as much as we can."  <p>  <p>But the Turkish authorities threw doubt over the issue by saying that the ceremony was little more than a religious blessing with no  validity either in Turkey or Britain.  <p>  <p>A spokesman at the Turkish embassy in London said that because of the age of the girl the ceremony was not valid. "Our  understanding is that this was a purely religious ceremony. This does not constitute a valid marriage. There may have been a  misunderstanding by the parents of this girl but the ceremony they attended amounts only to a church blessing of the relationship. It is  not a legal union and they are not married by Turkish law."  <p>  <p>The embassy said that a girl of at least 14 is permitted to marry, subject to the approval of an independent judge and written  approval from parent or guardian. Children aged 15 to 18 are not allowed to marry without permission from a parent.  <p>  <p>Essex police warned the family that they were taking legal advice to see whether any British law had been contravened and the  director of Essex social services, Mike Leadbetter, said he was "deeply shocked" to learn that the girl apparently had parental approval.  <p>  <p>In their account to the Sun, Sarah's parents, Jackie, aged 39, and Adrian, 42, a welder, told how Sarah met Musa when she was only  12 during a holiday at the resort of Alanya last June. When Sarah returned to school she showed her friends a diamond engagement ring  that Musa had given to her. She was "so love sick" that she stayed away from school for six weeks and ran up a &#163;1,500 phone  bill calling Musa up to five times a day. In October she persuaded them to let her fly to Turkey on her own for six weeks. They had flown  out for the ceremony.  <p>  <p>According to the Sun Mrs Cook said: "I don't care what people think about her marrying because she is loved and happy. We speak to  her regularly by telephone and would never let any harm come to her. We are not irresponsible parents."  <p>  <p>At least some of the social agencies had known about the situation since late last year but felt themselves powerless. The county  education authority has been sending school books to Sarah, living in the remote township of Kahramanmaras, to persuade her to  continue her education.  <p>  <p>Teachers and staff at the Tabor high school became alarmed when Sarah failed to return to school in September. The head teacher,  Richard Snelling, said: "She is only a 13-year-old child and I would not describe her as particularly mature."  <p>  <p>Mr Leadbetter said: "It appears that, as the relationship apparently has the approval of her mother and father, there is little we can  do. We have sought advice from the Foreign Office but all the indications are that unless the parents were to complain about the  situation we are unable to act."  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Chris Nuttall</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>The marriage of 13-year-old Sarah Cook, from Essex, to an unemployed Turkish waiter appeared doomed last night, following the arrest of her husband who faces up to five years in prison.  <p>  <p>Musa Komeagac, who married Sarah in a Muslim ceremony in Turkey two weeks ago, was due to appear before a court today where he will be formally charged under rape laws.  <p>  <p>Mr Komeagac, aged 18, was arrested yesterday in the town of Kahramanmaras, in south-eastern Turkey. He was held in custody overnight.  <p>  <p>The couple, whose wedding was attended by Sarah's parents, met last June while the Cook family were on holiday. The pair yesterday made statements to the state prosecutor after the Turkish authorities intervened. As Sarah arrived at the police station, wearing a traditional Muslim headscarf, she said: "I used to think I was an ugly girl when I was in Britain. Now I feel I'm beautiful because I'm being loved."  <p>  <p>Mr Komeagac's lawyer, Selim Surmen, is to appeal to a higher court for his client's release. "Sarah has said she will love Musa until death. There is no force used in this relationship."  <p>  <p>A rape conviction would mean at least five years in jail. Mr Komeagac could face the lesser charge of having sex with a minor.  <p>  <p>It is illegal to get married before the age of 16 in Turkey, although marriages of girls aged 12 or 13 are still common in rural areas. It is also illegal to have a Muslim wedding ceremony without a civil ceremony being held first.  <p>  <p>Sarah's parents, Jackie and Adrian Cook, from Braintree, Essex, insisted she had found far greater happiness than if she had stayed in Britain, during an hour-long meeting with senior social services officers at Braintree. Last night they left their home to fly to Turkey to meet their daughter.   <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Clinton defends Hillary over Whitewater accusations</b><br><br><br><b><h2>24 January 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Exploiting the Hillary factor</h2><h3>Mrs Clinton will be a liability in the presidential battle  </h2>
  <br><b>Leading article</b><br><br><br>      <p>Deride Hillary Clinton, admire her, relish or deplore personal innuendo about her: America's first lady arouses strong views. Hillary  Clinton was being demonised long before the summons to testify before a federal grand jury about her part in the arcane Whitewater  saga. The unprecedented decision to subpoena her for a hearing on Friday overshadowed President Clinton's State of the Union speech  delivered last night as the first shot in his, as yet undeclared, re-election campaign. Clinton can be in no doubt that his wife will be a  major liability in the Presidential battle. <p>  <p>The Whitewater affair and its ramifications have long dogged both the Clintons. Their honesty  as well as their financial dealings and personal relationships have been questioned. They have not helped themselves by their tardiness in  answering for their actions, and by the mysterious disappearance and reappearance of key documents. Hillary is now catching most of  the flak. A Special Prosecutor, Kenneth Starr was appointed and is behind the grand jury's subpoena to Mrs Clinton.  <p>  <p>Unsurprisingly, the Republicans are not prepared to leave matters to the Special Prosecutor. The Republican chairman of the Senate's  Whitewater Committee has just announced that he intends to continue his investigation indefinitely. At a disadvantage against President  Clinton in the budget debate and saddled with Senator Dole as their leading Presidential candidate, the Republicans want to exploit the  Hillary factor to the full. Just how far they can go will depend on the Grand Jury's reaction to her on Friday. If her testimony goes  against her, then Bill Clinton's record as President will count for little, and the Republicans will enter the campaign with an advantage  they do not deserve.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Clinton defends Hillary over Whitewater accusations</b><br><br><br><b><h2>26 January 1996</h2></b><br><h2>"Dump Dole" call  finds support</h2><h3>Clinton's setpiece address makes his ratings soar  </h2>
  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Martin Walker</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>A wave of alarm about their front-runner Senator Bob Dole's increasingly questionable chance of capturing the White House this  November has seized the Republican Party in the wake of President Clinton's state of the union triumph on Tuesday.  <p>  <p>"Bob Dole cannot and will not beat Bill Clinton," said Senator Phil Gramm of Texas, one of Mr Dole's main rivals for the Republican  presidential nomination.  <p>  <p>ABC-TV reported an unprecedented 75 per cent approval rating for Mr Clinton's address.  His performance was followed by what even the Republican talkshow host Rush Limbaugh called "a lacklustre reply" by Mr Dole.  <p>  <p>With opinion polls already showing Mr Dole losing to Mr Clinton by a 10-point margin, Mr Limbaugh spoke for many in the party  yesterday when he said: "The Republicans ought to be able to beat those unindicted co-conspirators Bill and Hillary Clinton with  absolutely anybody", adding: "They just gotta find him."  <p>  <p>Mr Dole's opinion poll leads of 30-40 percentage points in the Republican nomination race in the first caucus state, Iowa, and the  first primary state, New Hampshire, have dropped to low single figures.  Although still the best-funded and best-organised candidate in the race, with the endorsement of most of the party hierarchy, Mr  Dole is now running 10 points behind the challenger Steve Forbes in Arizona.  <p>  <p>The sniping at Mr Dole from his presidential rivals was predictable, but still wounding.  "Bob Dole lost the battle of ideas," said the rightwing firebrand Pat Buchanan.  "Bob Dole sounded like what he is: just another Washington politican," said Mr Forbes.  <p>  <p>The gathering strength of a 'Dump Dole' movement was palpable at the Republican national committee's fundraising event on  Wednesday night, when more than 3,500 wealthy donors rose to cheer the candidate that never was, retired General Colin Powell.  <p>  <p>"Run, Colin, Run," they chanted, despite his firm decision not to stand for any office this year. They also cheered Speaker Newt  Gingrich, another non-candidate for the presidency. He gave the keynote speech to the dinner, which raised funds for this year's  congressional campaigns.  Tickets were $1,000 a head, which should have netted $3.5m.  But the lure of special titles and special access and lunches with Mr Gingrich and Mr Powell brought the total to $16,340,000.  <p>  <p>Mr Clinton's poll ratings have soared after each state of the union address. With Hillary Clinton due to appear before a grand jury  today to answer some sharp questions on Whitewater, it was a political boost the president sorely needed.  <p>  <p>Last night the White House and Republican congressmen reached an agreement to keep the government working for another six weeks,  averting a third shutdown tomorrow.  <p>  <p>"I think we have a bargain," the House appropriations committee chairman, Bob Livingston, said. He said the White House had  approved their plan to eliminate some minor programmes but keep others funded.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>David Ward</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>A warehouse worker said yesterday he was paid just &#163;5 after working a 47-hour, five-night week  loading goods destined for Sainsbury supermarkets. "I went to my bank three days before Christmas  expecting that about &#163;170 had been paid into my account," said the man who lives in Rochdale,  Greater Manchester, and does not wish to be named. "But I found only a fiver had been put in."  <p>  <p>The Greater Manchester low pay unit has taken up his case and aims to secure any money owed him and  to highlight contract problems facing workers who find jobs through employment agencies.  <p>  <p>The man was hired by the Leeds agency ASC Staffing Ltd on behalf of XL Logistics, a transport  company used by Sainsbury for two weeks to deliver goods to stores during the busy pre-Christmas  period. He was trained for a week and then worked two five-night weeks but took a night off to attend his  pub soccer team's Christmas party. He claims he had told the agency of the long-standing engagement.  <p>  <p>When he failed to report for work, ASC invoked clause eight of the contract: "Should you fail to  turn up for any assignment without giving reasonable notice... your remuneration will be reduced to  &#163;1 per day for any work carried out previously and not yet paid, irrespective of hours worked."  "I was fuming.

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Tamil Tigers massacre in Colombo</b><br><br><br><b><h2>1 February 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Tiger  massacre in Colombo</h2><h3>Tamil separatists blamed for devastating retaliation against army gains  </h2>
  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Suzanne Goldenberg</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>Although Tiger officials at their offices in London disclaimed knowledge of the blast, government  officials in the Sri Lankan capital said the suicide bomb - which follows the capture in December of  the rebel mini-state in the northern Jaffna peninsula - bore the guerrillas' hallmark. "It has to be (the Tamil Tigers)," Brigadier Sarath Munasinghe, the military's spokesman, said.  "Who else would have done a thing like this?"   <p>  <p>Doctors at Colombo's general hospital said 55 people were killed outright in the suicide attack, but one private radio station put the death toll at 91.  More than 100 of those admitted to hospital were seriously injured. The health minister, AHM Fowzie,  told reporters: "I believe the death toll could rise as there are still many bodies trapped in the  rubble."   <p>  <p>The explosion - the most powerful in a bloody 12-year war - occurred on a busy morning  outside the central bank in Colombo's financial district. A military official said three people jumped  from a moving truck and began firing at random. The truck, believed to be carrying about 400lb of  explosives, careered into a gate at the bank's entrance.  <p>  <p>Police arrested two men trying to flee but said they believed others died in the blast.  <p>  <p>The governor of the central bank, AS Jayewardene, said on television that 40 of its employees were  killed.  <p>  <p>Witnesses described a scene that looked like the aftermath of an earthquake, with an 8ft crater at  its centre. "It was like a dozen towering infernos," said a local journalist. The explosion seriously damaged  eight buildings in the financial district. It occurred at about 10.45am local time, and was felt up to  three miles away.  <p>  <p>Clouds of black smoke and flame spewed from nearby office blocks as hundreds of dazed and wounded  people fled. Witnesses said windows and ceilings came crashing down, lifts plummeted to the ground and  gaping holes were punched in walls. The wounded clung for support to walls and railings, which quickly became red with blood. "There was blood all over over the place," said a witness, Dion Schoorman. "People were stopping  buses and loading them with wounded to take them to hospital."  <p>  <p>Helicopters dropped water to douse the fires, while firemen rescued stranded office workers from  roofs.  <p>  <p>Yesterday's attack occurred in one of the most highly guarded areas in the capital - already a city  under siege. The presidential secretariat, the foreign ministry and naval headquarters are just a few  hundred yards away. Two nearby hotels were severely damaged in the blast, and several tourists were  reportedly injured, belying government claims that the island is again safe.  <p>  <p>There had already been fears for the safety of the Australian cricket team, who are due to play Sri  Lanka in Colombo in their opening World Cup match on 17 February. They are considering forfeiting the  game. Their coach Bobby Simpson asked: "Who wants to be around when bombs are going off?" <p>  <p>In Colombo  only the strip of coastal road fronting the residence of President Chandrika Kumaratunga is more  heavily guarded than the district hit yesterday, and the blast underscores her vulnerability. The bomb is certain to affect the government's efforts to win support from the majority Sinhalese  community for peace proposals.  <p>  <p>It is clear that Sri Lanka's authorities can no longer protect the capital, even while the military  has been mopping up the remaining eastern pockets under Tiger control. Two weeks ago, the government put its peace plan before parliament. It proposes devolving power to  the regions.  <p>  <p>The government said yesterday's attack was intended to enrage hardliners among the majority  Sinhalese community who have been opposing any concession to the Tamil minority. The Tigers have  rejected the package. "It is unfortunate that it comes at a time when the government has so  emphatically placed before the country, and is seeking to arrive at a consensus on, the devolution of  power to redress Tamil grievances," said Ravinath Aryasinghe, a foreign ministry spokesman.  <p>  <p>At the weekend, President Kumaratunga repeated her argument, by now familiar, that the crisis is  political and ethnic in nature - and not merely terrorism that can be fought with force. But  yesterday's attack gives the upper hand to Sinhalese hawks.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>David Beresford</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>South Africa is to demand the return of five human heads discovered in Britain's Natural History Museum.  The preserved heads, complete with original skin and glass eyeballs, are thought to be the remains of Khoisan people killed by British troops in the 19th century.  <p>  <p>The museum has indicated that it is not prepared to surrender them for reburial. But a South African minister, Brigitte Mabanda, says she will fight for their return.  South Africa is seeking the return of remains of indigenous people held in Europe as souvenirs.  <p>  <p>Pretoria asked France this week to hand over the pickled corpse of the 'Hottentot Venus', Saartjie Bartman, kept at the Musee de l'Homme in Paris. And Nicholas Gcaleka, a chief and witchdoctor, is on his way to Scotland, with the blessing of President Mandela, in search of the head of King Hintsa, an ancestor killed by British troops 160 years ago, which he suspects is being held as a trophy.  <p>  <p>The five heads at the Natural History Museum were found in cardboard boxes in a back room by a Cape Town artist, Pippa Skotnes, while preparing an exhibition on the Khoisan people.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

 <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Patrick Wintour</b><br><br>      <p> <p>Arthur Scargill's nascent Socialist Labour Party appeared close to still-born last night  after it narrowly avoided losing its deposit in the Hemsworth by-election, polling less than  5.5 per cent in one of Yorkshire's strongest mining areas. <p> <p>Labour, cutting the overall  government majority in the Commons to four, retained the seat with an impressive 71.92 per cent  share of the vote, an increase of one per cent on its share in the general election. The  Conservatives remained in second place with the Liberal Democrat third. The turnout of 39.5 per  cent was one of the lowest for a recent by-election, reflecting voter apathy, the cold and the  brevity of the campaign. A defiant Mr Scargill, president of the National Union of Mineworkers  and agent in the campaign, claimed the result was a remarkable success for his fledgling party.  <p> <p>He said: "To describe this result as miserable is deplorable. To nearly equal the  Liberal Democrats when we did not launch the party until May is remarkable. Five per cent is  excellent. We did not lose our deposit. A century ago Keir Hardie lost his deposit and went on  to form a mass party and the rest is history." <p> <p>In the 1992 general election, Labour won  the rock-solid seat with a 22,075 majority taking 70.8 per cent of the vote. Last night its  majority of 13,875 was described by the shadow chief whip, Donald Dewar, as excellent. The  overall swing was 5.4 per cent from Conservative to Labour. <p> <p>Labour described the  performance of the Socialist Labour Party as derisory and proof that Mr Scargill was a  pinprick. Although 35-year-old Brenda Nixon, a locally popular member of Women Against Pit  Closures, had stood as the new party's candidate, Mr Scargill acted as agent, grabbing all the  publicity in the process. <p> <p>As part of a co-ordinated decision to tackle the Harriet  Harman affair head-on - in which she suffered a deluge of criticism for sending her son to a  selective grammar school - Mr Blair last night issued a ferocious assault on "the nightmare of  a fifth Tory term". Accusing the Tories of descending into the gutter, he claimed the real  hypocrite in British politics was not Ms Harman, but a Tory government that said one thing  before an election and did another afterwards. <p> <p>He said: "It was not an 11-year-old boy  that had cost people their jobs, their homes and their businesses. It was not an 11-year-old  boy who had raised taxes - it was a 17-year-old government." <p> <p>Speaking in west London, he  said: "Britain is not safe with the Tories. Jobs are not safe. The health service is not safe.  Our children's future is not safe. The fifth term is the danger." <p> <p>He asked: "Will you be  paying to see a doctor? Will your child be taught in a class of 100? Will you all be trapped in  negative equity? Will you all need private security for your street, your home, your office?"  Mr Blair said when the Tories were effectively mounting an entire election strategy on the back  of the schooling of the child of a Labour MP, "you know you are dealing with unscrupulous and  desperate people who want the campaign in the gutter, and who have no qualms about being in the  gutter." <p> <p>Brian Mawhinney, the Conservative Party chairman, described Mr Blair's remarks  as the hysterical speech of a man starting to crack. But John Prescott, the deputy Labour  leader, said the Hemsworth result revealed the depth of unpopularity of the Conservative  government. The victorious candidate hailed his increased majority as an endorsement of Blair's  leadership. "Hemsworth now stands totally behind Tony Blair's drive to modernise Britain.  Hemsworth has tonight spoken for the nation." John Major was yesterday freed from any lingering  speculation of a direct challenge to his leadership before the next general election when the  Tory backbench 1922 committee agreed to ban any such challenge. <p> <p>Explaining the decision  to suspend the rules allowing a leadership election every autumn, Sir Marcus Fox said: "At the  moment a review of the rules is taking place but because of the consultations necessary, this  would take a considerable amount of time. The uncertainty involved was not acceptable." <p> <p>  <p> <p> <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td  width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td  width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td  width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td  width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr> <td  align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td> <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A  HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td> <td align=right  valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td> </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>David Ward</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>The new Labour (or New Labour) MP for Hemworth yesterday grasped a bottle of HP sauce and shook a  large metaphorical dollop of the brown stuff all over Arthur Scargill.  <p>  <p>Jon Trickett, still relishing his 72 per cent share of the vote, had turned up for a victory  breakfast with his wife Sarah and party workers at the council offices (a former convent) in South  Kirkby, West Yorkshire. As a forkful of scrambled egg hurtled into his mouth, his boot went into the  founder of the Socialist Labour Party, whose candidate Brenda Nixon polled just under 2,000 votes.  <p>  <p>"Everywhere you went in the campaign, it was Scargill," he recalled. "I don't think we heard Mrs  Nixon speak until yesterday. This was Arthur Scargill's show and he ought to have stood. But he lacked  the moral courage to stand and be associated with that kind of defeat. I think it was a disgraceful  performance on his part."  <p>  <p>Ms Nixon said the rules of the National Union of Mineworkers prevented Mr Scargill from standing  for Parliament. She also rubbed Mr Trickett's nose in his grilled tomato by reminding him that Labour  had predicted she would come last and lose her deposit. "I don't think Mr Scargill was my mouthpiece at all," she said. "But because of who he is, he is  bound to attract a lot of attention. When I did speak, what I said often went unreported."  <p>  <p>Mr Trickett reached for another slice of toast and went on the marmalade offensive. "Almost everyone I met had been or was related to someone who had been a member of the NUM. Mr  Scargill touched the lives of many of those people. He was going round on the stump introducing  himself as the union's president. But none of that appeal to traditional loyalties made a ha'p'orth of  difference to people who were determined to vote Labour and did so."   <P>  <p>This view was broadly echoed a couple of miles away in South Elmsall, where the removal men were loading Labour's triumphant  photocopier into a van and the Lib Dems across the road were unsticking their David Ridgway posters at  the end of a campaign which itself had come unstuck. The shops they occupied will rejoin many others  in the town waiting for tenants.  <p>  <p>In the market (3lb of conference pears for 50p; selected steam puddings 55p), one visitor took a  hard line. "I don't believe in Arthur's policies - I'd sooner support the Greens, who believe in what  they say. He's just feathering his own nest."  <p>  <p>But some, including Colin Mears, a traditional Labour voter with a shopping bag, were prepared to  be generous. "Arthur's making his way through life. He was unlucky with the miners' strike and lost because the  Notts miners worked. Let the man do what he wants. It's up to him and I think he's all right. If it  was tight and I fancied his policies more than the Labour man, he'd get my vote." His friend Sammy  Davies, invalided out of the pits when he was 53, was equally kind. Of course the SLP was right to  field a candidate. "The more there are, the better the selection," he said.  <p>  <p>Back in the former convent, as catering staff fed the media gloriously greasy Old Labour bacon  sandwiches, Mr Trickett recalled a warm gesture from an opponent. A fringe candidate had abandoned his own interest and urged voters to support Labour. He followed  Mr Trickett with a small red carpet, casting it before his feet at photo opportunities, bellowing at  Mr Trickett: "You are a god!"

  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Seumas Milne</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>More than half the Rail Maritime and Transport Union's national executive have joined Arthur  Scargill's embryonic Socialist Labour Party, raising the possibility that the 68,000-strong RMT could  eventually disaffiliate from Labour in protest against the direction taken by Tony Blair. Seven out of  12 RMT executive members have signed up to the party, with one of the union's two assistant general  secretaries, Bob Crow.  <p>  <p>The party, which is due to have its official founding congress in May, won five per cent of the  vote at the recent Hemworth by-election. The defection of the majority of the RMT's activist leadership  will embarrass Labour's deputy leader, John Prescott, who is an RMT-sponsored MP, and the union's  general secretary, Jimmy Knapp, who remains strongly committed to Labour. There is likely to be a move  at the RMT's annual conference this summer to dissociate the union from new Labour, while stopping  short of an immediate call for disaffiliation.  <p>  <p>The combination of Labour's refusal to commit itself to the renationalisation of rail and the abandonment of its Clause 4 commitment to common ownership -  which is still written into the RMT constitution - has led to particular discontent among RMT  activists. Rail privatisation poses a serious threat to the RMT, which staged the 1994 signalworkers' strikes  and led last year's stoppages on the London Underground.  <p>  <p>"New Labour no longer represents the interests of rail workers or supports the goals set out in our  constitution," a prominent executive member said yesterday. "In the longer term, unless a Labour  government delivers on rail renationalisation, we are bound to reconsider our historic affiliation."  Labour loyalists said yesterday that they would try and flush out the SLP supporters at the union's  conference and commit them to backing the Labour Party. But an attempt to do that at the end of last  year was rejected by two to one by conference delegates.  <p>  <p>In another sign of the potential difficulties raised for unions by the formation of the SLP, a  Transport and General Workers' Union branch in London this week voted to affiliate to the new party.  But a TGWU spokesman said it would be contrary to the terms of the union's national affiliation to  Labour, if not directly ruled out by the TGWU's own constitution. The SLP's initial crop of recruits  has been concentrated among union activists, with the public service union Unison, the building  workers' union Ucatt, the Communication Workers' Union and the TGWU most heavily represented. Its  founding group is holding a series of rallies around the country and a members' conference - at which  the new party's policy positions will start to be agreed - is planned for 2 March in London.   <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

  <br><br>      <p>An obsessive pigeon feeder was jailed for 56 days yesterday for repeatedly breaching court orders  by distributing mounds of bread around her south London home.  <p>  <p>Mr Justice Butterfield said at the High Court he was quite satisfied Jean Knowlson, aged 68, had  wholly disregarded an injunction aimed at stopping her behaviour on an almost daily basis. "In my  judgement, no warning, no advice, no threat, is capable of deterring her from continuing to behave in  total disregard of the orders of this court, and, in so doing, to cause grave environmental problems,  considerable distress and potential danger to members of the public."  <p>  <p>Mrs Knowlson listened impassively as the judge said there was no evidence of any mental illness. He  had heard that she was getting through as many as 100 loaves a week and scattering bread "ankle-deep",  often at night, around her home in South Norwood, and other nearby places.  <p>  <p>Mrs Knowlson was sent to Holloway Prison for 28 days last July but freed after four days when she  apologised for her contempt of court and agreed not to distribute bread anywhere in Croydon borough.  She told the court then that she could not resist feeding the pigeons when she "looked at their little  faces".  <p>  <p>Mr Justice Butterfield said yesterday he committed Mrs Knowlson "with great regret", but her  conduct had been "anti-social, dangerous and wholly unjustifiable".  <p>  <p>Mrs Knowlson's counsel, Mark Whalan, said her conduct was obsessive but she had tried to curb the  amount of bread she left on pathways, cutting down from 40 handfuls down both sides to 20 handfuls  down one side.   <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Spaceman Steve Bennett launches sugar-powered rocket</b><br><br><br><b><h2>3 February  1996</h2></b><br><h2>Take a pound of sugar, a DIY kit, 17 years of jokes and misfires and the sky's  the limit  </h2>
  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>John Ezard</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>Britain's DIY spaceman Steve Bennett trounced sceptics and vindicated years of lonely struggle when  his sugar-powered rocket, Starchaser II, soared 1,890 feet up yesterday over the Northumberland moors.  <p>  <p>It did not reach 3,000 feet as he had planned. "My computer projections must have gone astray", he  said. But it sent his reputation into orbit and set a record as the largest airworthy home-made rocket  built in Europe. Putting a rocket into orbit is Mr Bennett's next project. His triumph follows 17  years of misfires and jokes. Even his wife Adrienne used to tell onlookers at his launches, echoing  Corporal Jones in 'Dad's Army', "Don't panic. If the rocket's parachute should fail, keep watching it  and run as fast as you can".  <p>  <p>Now the way is clear for Mr Bennett, a 31-year-old laboratory technician from Dukinfield, Greater  Manchester, who tests toothpastes and soap powders, to aim at becoming the second designer to send a  British rocket into orbit. He is in an international race with amateurs striving to put their craft  the 50 miles into space which are needed to reach orbit. To do this he will build a new rocket,  Starchaser III. His eventual ambition is to launch himself into space. "The sky is very much the limit. I want to launch Starchaser III within 12 months. I am feeling  very confident," he said.  <p>  <p>In his two dozen rocket launches so far, Mr Bennett has spurned the liquid oxygen fuel often used  by amateur rocketeers. All he will disclose about his own is that it is "sugar mixed with other  chemicals"'. His sponsors for the last year - the sugar multinational Tate and Lyle, were delighted  yesterday at his proof of their old marketing slogan Out Of Sweetness Comes Forth Strength.  <p>  <p>The 21ft Starchaser II was cheered as it rose from a pad in a glow of fire against the snow-covered  hills round Otterburn military training area before vanishing into clouds. Then it split into two  pieces which parachuted back to earth. The flight was to test propulsion systems, parachutes and  on-board computers.  <p>  <p>Mr Bennett, who was inspired by the Thunderbird puppets, had to abort his last launch attempt. He  said, "I'm over the moon with the launch, it went brilliantly. I've spent a lot of blood, time and  sweat on this. Some of my rivals' rockets are more sophisticated - but they don't get them back like I  do."  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p><b>NASA</b>  <p>  <p>Employees: 20,624  <br>Budget: $13bn  <br>Fuel: aluminium perchlorate  <br>Altitude reached: typically 180 miles or lower earth orbit.   <br>People put into space: 200+  <p>  <p><b>Mr Bennett</b>  <p>  <p>Employees: one (Steve Bennett)  <br>Budget: several thousand pounds  <br>Fuel: weedkiller, sugar  <br>Altitude reached: 1,890ft  <br>People put into space: none  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b> Threats to Paddy Ashdown as his car is bombed</b><br><br><br><b><h2>3 February  1996</h2></b><br><h2>Campaign of fear hits Ashdown</h2><h3>Threats against Lib Dem leader erupt into arson   </h2>
  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Geoffrey Gibbs</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>Surveillance on Paddy Ashdown's home is to be stepped up after a concerted campaign of threats  against his property culminated in a firebomb attack yesterday which destroyed his car.  <p>  <p>Police last night arrested three men, aged 18, 19 and 21, in connection with the attack. All three  are from Yeovil, in Mr Ashdown's constituency. The attack took place at the Liberal Democrat leader's  home in the Somerset village of Norton sub Hamdon. It emerged before the arrests were made that  anonymous telephone threats had been made to Mr Ashdown's property and London office in the past few  weeks.  <p>  <p>Police chiefs had discussed with the Yeovil MP measures to tighten security. Surveillance on his  property had been quietly increased.  <p>  <p>Mr Ashdown had himself taken a threatening call from a man in December. There were no threats to  his life, but the calls were being taken very seriously and the MP's protection was a high priority,  said Superintendent Ted Allen, the district commander at Yeovil.  <p>  <p>Mr Ashdown has played a much publicised role in exposing a spate of racist attacks on the tiny  ethnic community in Yeovil, which is the third largest town in Somerset. But police yesterday were  playing down suggestions that the "despicable" attack which destroyed the MP's H-registered Vauxhall  Senator was racially motivated.  <p>  <p>Last month Mr Ashdown's car window was smashed with a stone in what is believed to have been a  linked attack.  <p>  <p>Mr Allen said: "There is no evidence of a racial motive whatsoever. It is impossible to say what  the motive was, but we are keeping an open mind." Mr Ashdown had not asked for protection, Mr Allen  said. But the superintendent added: "It is something I am concerned about. We have spoken about that  and that will be ongoing."  <p>  <p>Shrugging off the latest incident, Mr Ashdown insisted on business as usual yesterday afternoon  when he honoured a commitment to visit a local junior school. He declined to comment on the possible motives for the arson. "No one was hurt, but obviously we  were shaken and now I am just determined to get on with my job," he said.  <p>  <p>In December, during a late night fact-finding tour of the town with a local priest on behalf of the  newly formed Partnership Against Racial Harassment in Somerset, a knife was allegedly drawn against  the MP only yards from his constituency offices.  <p>  <p>At its launch, the campaign group said: "We note with anger that this national evil of racism  exists in our community and has been perpetrated by people in our community. "We do not believe that Yeovil is worse than other towns in this respect. But we know that this is  an evil that must be stamped on early and vigorously."  <p>  <p>It called on the community to unite against racism and called upon "the people of our community to  join us in taking whatever action is necessary to stamp out this evil in our midst".  <p>  <p>Police said they would be investigating a number of fire-related incidents in Yeovil in recent  months. Last October, the town centre offices of the Western Gazette newspaper suffered &#163;100,000  damage in a firebomb attack. A threatening telephone call had been made to the newspaper, which had  highlighted racial attacks in the town.  <p>  <p>Mr Ashdown and his wife, Jane, were woken by police at about 4am after neighbours called emergency  services to the blazing car, which was parked in an open building not far from their thatched cottage.  The building was severely damaged. Two men were were seen by officers on a routine patrol a few hours before the attack.  <p>  <p>* A man, aged 51, has been charged with affray and possessing an offensive weapon in relation to  the incident in December involving Mr Ashdown. He is due to appear in court next week.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Geoffrey Gibbs</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>Liberal Democrats fear their leader, Paddy Ashdown, will become the object of a smear campaign when  he appears as a prosecution witness in a court case in his Yeovil constituency this week.  <p>  <p>The MP, whose car was destroyed in a firebomb attack at his home in the Somerset village of Norton  sub Hamdon early on Friday, is said to have been warned that allegations concerning a massage parlour  close to Liberal Democrat headquarters in Yeovil could be made in court.  <p>  <p>Mr Ashdown, who has played a leading role in fighting racism in Yeovil, is expected to be called as  a witness in the case of a man alleged to have threatened him with a knife in the town centre last  November. The hearing before Yeovil magistrates on Thursday and Friday is to decide whether the man,  aged 51, who is charged with affray and possessing an offensive weapon, should face a jury trial.  <p>  <p>Witnesses can give evidence under oath and be cross-examined during the proceedings. It is feared  that elements antagonistic to Mr Ashdown's tough stand on racism could seek to take advantage of the  court hearing to blacken his reputation.  <p>  <p>Two years ago, the City Girl massage parlour was closed by the council because of planning  irregularities. Its owner was later jailed for six months for living off immoral earnings.  <p>  <p>Three men, aged 18, 19, and 21, were arrested on Friday in a Yeovil suburb in connection with the  attack on Mr Ashdown's H-registered Vauxhall Senator. They have been released on police bail pending  further investigations. Somerset police say there is no evidence of a racial motive for the arson and  an earlier incident in which Mr Ashdown's car window was smashed with a stone. Police protection for  Mr Ahsdown and his wife, Jane, and security measures at Liberal Democrat party offices in Yeovil are  understood to have been stepped up.  <p>  <p>Mr Ashdown, who has previously resisted police cover, is thought to have agreed to the measures  because of fears over his wife's security. It was disclosed last week that the arson followed  anonymous telephone threats to the MP's home and London office.  <p>  <p>Party officials and Mr Ashdown have refused to comment on the possible motive for the arson, or on  reports that smears will be aimed at him during the court hearing.  <p>  <p>Yesterday he returned to the fight against racism by calling for national racial attack squads to  combat increased racial intolerance.   <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Keith Harper</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>Plans for one of the first privately-run rail companies to start operating tomorrow were in doubt  last night after an investigation was launched into allegations that a senior member of the company  was involved in defrauding London Underground.  <p>  <p>Rail sources confirmed that the Association of Train-Operating Companies and the British Railways  Board were examining allegations that LTS Rail, the franchise holders on the London, Tilbury and  Southend line, had been involved in issuing tickets from Fenchurch Street station and then re-issuing  them on the same day at Upminster, which LTS shares with London Underground. London Underground is alleged to have been losing up to &#163;30,000 a month as a result.  <p>  <p>John Welsby, chairman of the British Railways Board, has been informed of the discrepancy, which  came to light earlier this week as LTS prepared to take over commuter services on the newly privatised  line. Last night, LTS officials were unable to confirm whether the company was in a position to be able  to start running the service from 2am tomorrow as scheduled.  <p>  <p>LTS Rail's managing director, Chris Kinchin-Smith said in a statement: "The board was made aware on  Friday of allegations. "The Board is co-operating with the British Railways inquiry into the allegations and until this  inquiry is completed it wouldn't be appropriate to comment further."  <p>  <p>Two other private operators are joining LTS on other parts of British Rail's old system; they are  Stagecoach, which will run trains between Waterloo and the West Country, and Great Western trains,  operating between Paddington and Cornwall, and South Wales.  <p>  <p>* Selling the whole of Railtrack, the state-owned track and signalling authority, would hamper  Labour's plan to expand the rail network as a public service, Brian Wilson, shadow transport minister,  said last night. As the Government prepares to speed up the privatisation of both the track and train  operators, Mr Wilson said that without public ownership a Labour government "would be hamstrung in its  determination to expand and develop the role of the railways".  <p>  <p>He was unable to give a commitment to renationalise Railtrack if the Government went ahead with the  sale of 100 per cent of the company in May as planned, but advised investors to steer clear of this  "high-risk" flotation. His comments underline the difficulties Labour would have in finding the  &#163;2bn-plus that the party would need to buy back Railtrack once it had been transferred to  the private sector.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Keith Harper</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>The alleged scam to defraud London Underground revolves around 'all zone travelcards' sold by the  train operating companies, writes Keith Harper. The tickets were issued from Fenchurch Street station  for use on the London, Tilbury and Southend line.   <p>  <p>LTS, as the dominant user of this station, takes 78  per cent of ticket revenue while London Underground takes 22 per cent. But the tickets were not sold  at Fenchurch Street. They were transferred to Upminster, where LTS also shares operations with LU, and  sold there. At Upminster, LTS normally takes only 52 per cent of revenue with LU taking 48 per cent.  It is believed LU lost out on &#163;45,000 over six weeks, with LTS benefiting from the higher  proportion of the revenue from Fenchurch Street ticket 'sales'.  <p>  <p>The tickets do not bear any station name, and the discrepancy was discovered in a random internal  audit carried out by BR for the Association of Train Operating Companies.  <p>  <p>Railway sources said last night that it could happen in other parts of the network, but the system  would always expose fraudulent behaviour.   <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Keith Harper</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>Four members of the ticketing staff on the London, Tilbury and Southend (LTS) line were yesterday suspended by British Rail pending further inquiries into allegations of fraud on the issuing of tickets which has cost London Transport up to &#163;45,000 in lost revenue.  <p>  <p>The suspensions were carried out as a precautionary measure while BR continues its inquiries. Three staff are at Southend, and a fourth is based at Fenchurch Street, London, where the ticket fraud emanated. BR has already carried out a systematic examination of possible frauds at other London stations and has discovered a minor problem at Walthamstow station, where 30 tickets have aroused suspicions.  <p>  <p>BR's inquiry is being conducted alongside an inquiry by the Rail Regulator, John Swift. The Government last night was still hoping it will be completed in time for Enterprise Rail, the private operator of the LTS line, to start operations next month.  <p>  <p>Enterprise Rail's financial backers, including the venture capital groups 3i and the Gresham Trust, are awaiting the inquiry's outcome before deciding if they should withdraw support.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Keith Harper</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>The private company which had been selected to run the London, Tilbury and Southend railway line  was last night told it had lost the franchise following allegations of ticket fraud.  <p>  <p>Enterprise Rail, the company that should have been running the line from last Sunday, was not  expected to meet the necessary conditions for the transfer from British Rail, the franchise director,  Roger Salmon, said. He would not be completing the franchise agreement, he added. He invited rival  companies that had applied to take over the route to re-tender - and told LTS Rail not to try again.  <p>  <p>The collapse of the bid is a considerable embarrassment to the Government. Brian Wilson, Labour  transport spokesman, said it was a disaster. "The Government is hell-bent on damaging an industry  which needs to be kept intact."  <p>  <p>Enterprise Rail's managing director, Christopher Kinchen-Smith, and its finance director, Roger  Turner, who headed the management buy-out bid, are not implicated in the allegations and are returning  to BR's headquarters for other work. BR is continuing its investigation into allegations which have led to the resignation of the  company's commercial director and the suspension of four members of the staff.  <p>  <p>Mr Salmon may have to wait for the outcome of BR's report and a similar inquiry being conducted by  the railway regulator, John Swift, before making a new appointment from the short list of bidders.  Ministers hope a new company could be operating the LTS line within a month. The most likely are the bus operator Prism, and the Canadian-owned GB Railways. For the moment, a  senior LTS official, David Burton, has been appointed caretaker head of the operation.  <p>  <p>The collapse of the bid will create caution among several leading capital-venture companies, who  until yesterday were supporting Enterprise Rail. The fraud allegations involve about &#163;45,000 in  ticket money, which should have gone to London Transport, but allegedly found its way to LTS.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Ofsted report reveals nearly half schools in England are failing their pupils  </b><br><br><br><b><h2>5 February 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Ofsted head renews attack on teachers  </h2>
  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Donald Macleod</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>Chris Woodhead, HM Chief Inspector of Schools, will today renew his attack on teachers over poor  education standards when he publishes his annual report.  <p>  <p>But Labour and the teacher unions will seize on evidence of worsening school facilities and book  shortages found by inspectors, and seek to highlight the potential loss of 8,000 more teaching jobs as  a result of the pay settlement to be announced this week.  <p>  <p>The annual report of the Office for Standards in Education will target primary schools for failing  to instil basic literacy and numeracy. Last year inspectors judged a quarter of lessons for five- to  seven-year-olds to be unsatisfactory, rising to one-in-three among teachers of eight- to 11-year-olds.  <p>  <p>But today's report will show some improvement in the number of unsatisfactory primary school  lessons.  <p>  <p>Ofsted's concern about reading and basic maths appeared to be borne out by this year's Key Stage 2  tests, when only half of 11-year-olds reached the expected levels.  <p>  <p>Mr Woodhead is mounting a robust defence of his inspection methods, which teachers have criticised  as negative and "hit-and-run". In tomorrow's Education Guardian he will accuse teachers of being "naive in the extreme" for  believing self-evaluation by schools could replace external inspection. Without Ofsted the public  would be blissfully ignorant of the state of the schools. "Critics in the National Union of Teachers may not like the message of my annual report, that bad  teaching cannot be excused as we work urgently to bring the standard of the poorer schools up to the  level of the best," he said.  <p>  <p>Ofsted inspectors have found increasing resources problems in schools, with half of secondary  schools suffering book shortages and one-in-four with inadequate accommodation, which was hampering  the delivery of the national curriculum.  <p>  <p>David Blunkett, Labour's education spokesman, said: "The issue of resources looks like being  highlighted in the week of the teachers' pay award. Concerns about books and accommodation will need  to be addressed by central government. Ofsted will need to have a look at the effect of funding  settlements on this year and next year in schools."  <p>  <p>He said primary school standards needed a clearer focus and Labour was proposing continuous  assessment, with all pupils set individual targets to work towards. Mr Woodhead has insisted there is no evidence of a link between large classes and achievement.  <p>  <p>Labour says local authorities face a &#163;288m shortfall this year, although ministers insist  there has been a 4.5 per cent increase in money for education and schools should be able to cope. Even if the expected 3.8 per cent pay settlement for teachers is phased over 18 months, many  authorities say they will have to shed teaching posts at a time when pupil numbers are rising.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Ofsted  report reveals nearly half of schools in England are failing their pupils  </b><br><br><br><b><h2>6 February 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Variations in teaching standards  "unacceptable" </h2>
 <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>John Carvel</b><br><br>      <p> <p>Half the primary schools and two-fifths of secondary schools are failing to teach  children to a satisfactory standard, the Office for Standards in Education said yesterday in  its annual report on the condition of schooling in England. "While teachers secure satisfactory  standards of achievement in the majority of lessons observed by inspectors, there are  unacceptably wide variations between what is achieved by different schools," said Chris  Woodhead, the chief inspector. <p> <p>"The most successful secondary schools achieve GCSE  results twice as good as others in similar socio-economic circumstances and six times better  than those achieved by the least successful in less favoured areas." Although there was not yet  comparable data for primary schools, there was little reason to suppose the picture was not  similar in that sector. Some of the problem schools identified in previous years' inspections  were starting to make progress, but there was serious cause for concern about the performance  of schools serving disadvantaged areas. <p> <p>"Such schools can face huge problems. Disruptive  pupil behaviour may be exacerbated by inadequate parental support. It can be very difficult to  recruit and retain good teachers. Secondary schools often receive pupils with very low levels  of literacy", the report said. <p> <p>Teachers' low expectations of pupils could reinforce the  low expectations of education in the communities served by these schools. "It need not be so.  Some schools serving extremely deprived areas achieve very good standards. This is because they  are invariably led by men and women of exceptional ability." <p> <p>Mr Woodhead identified  three problem areas: <p> <p>Literacy: Urgent action was needed at many schools to tackle  mediocre and poor standards, especially at Key Stage 2 (age eight-11). In reading, the  teaching of phonic skills was "too rarely an established part of a well-structured programme  for all pupils". <p> <p>Numeracy: Primary schools spent a lot of time on number work, but with  disappointing results. In some schools time was "dissipated in too much individual work at the  expense of mental arithmetic and the discussion of number problems". <p> <p>Teaching quality:  Over recent years inspectors established a "worryingly persistent" slowing of pupils' progress  at ages seven and eight. "This dip in performance is strongly associated with a fall in the  quality of teaching". Schools should be more vigilant in tracking pupils' progress and  monitoring the teaching they receive. <p> <p>Standards in the early years of secondary school  were also too low, due to inadequate curriculum liaison with the primary schools and a tendency  to deploy "the least well-qualified or least experienced teachers" at this age level. <p>  <p>The Ofsted report, drawing conclusions from more than 4,000 inspections, praised more than  200 schools for their outstanding success or pace of improvement. <p> <p>Mr Woodhead complained  of the "consistently weak teaching of a small minority of teachers whose performance damages  the education of many children and undermines the work of their colleagues". It was in nobody's  interest for such teachers to remain in the profession. <p> <p>Even the better teachers needed  to improve their methods, given shortcomings in nearly half the primary schools and just over a  third of secondary schools. Doctrinaire commitment to a particular style of teaching was not as  effective as a balanced approach. <p> <p>Although the Ofsted report stressed the scope for  improvement within a school's existing budget, it provided some ammunition for opposition  parties calling for extra resources. Shortage of books adversely affected work in a quarter of  secondary schools and one in seven primaries. Ofsted would investigate these "disturbing"  figures to establish the reasons for variations between subjects, schools and geographical  areas. <p> <p>A fifth of secondary schools and one in seven primaries also had accommodation  problems, such as cramped classrooms, limited playgrounds or non-existent art, technology or  science facilities. "Teachers who lack proper resources or who work in poor buildings  experience problems which at best frustrate and at worst defeat their best efforts to do a  decent job," the report said. <p> <p>It noted a growing gap between the achievement at GCSE of  girls and boys. Girls' success was particularly marked in areas of urban disadvantage. Boys  from African Caribbean communities continued to underachieve. Educational provision at  independent schools was mixed. "At one extreme both quality and standards are excellent; at the  other there are schools giving serious cause for concern", the report said. <p> <p> <p> <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td  width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td  width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td  width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td  width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr> <td  align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td> <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A  HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td> <td align=right  valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td> </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Ofsted report reveals nearly half schools in England are failing their pupils </b><br><br><br><b><h2>6 February 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Tough targets  </h2>
  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Gillian Shephard</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>Yesterday's annual report by HM's Chief Inspector of Schools highlighted the best and worst aspects of what is happening in our classrooms. We should all be delighted that the report was able to identify 203 excellent, good or improving schools. But the report also shows that we have a long way to go. None of us can ignore its findings.  <p>  <p>Overall standards of pupil achievement need to be raised in half our primary schools, and two fifths of our secondary schools; one lesson in five at key stages 2 and 3 is unsatisfactory.  <p>  <p>The Government has put in place measures to raise standards and these are starting to have an effect. But I intend to do more. Ofsted will work to a new and sharper-focused inspection framework from this April and inspectors will report to the head where they find examples of excellent or very poor teaching. Inspectors will give special attention to weak schools, and revisit them. The Teacher Training Agency is working to improve the quality of initial teacher training, drawing on Ofsted inspection reports that are now being published, and defining national priorities for in-service training.  <p>  <p>One of our top priorities has to be the concern about literacy and numeracy among primary pupils. That is why we will be setting up 20 literacy and numeracy centres to improve teaching. That means setting clear and ambitious targets and choosing the most effective teaching methods to deliver them. We shall introduce baseline assessment of pupils at five and, in the longer term, we shall move towards the publication of value-added information. It has been announced that the testing and assessment arrangements will be refined; in particular, calculators will be banned from one of the maths tests for 11-year-olds this year, and we are looking at how mental arithmetic can be tested.  <p>  <p>The TTA, Ofsted and School Curriculum and Assessment Authority will organise a series of seminars in March on improving the quality of teaching. These are some of the things the Government is doing. But schools, heads, teachers, governors, LEAs and teacher trainers are also involved. Schools should set targets for their own improvement. Heads carry the responsibility for leading their schools to meet these targets. Teachers have to deliver them. The messages in the report are ones which every teacher should think long and hard about. Governors can ensure that their schools have a clear strategy for improvement. LEAs and teacher trainers can offer support services to schools to bring those improvements about. Parents need to be informed about how much progress is being made. The publication of performance tables for secondary schools has been a great success in giving that information to parents and in enabling schools to set their own targets. There was a high rate of participation in tests at 11 this year.  <p>  <p>The SCAA has carried out a thoroughgoing review of assessment and testing and made excellent proposals for changes to consolidate and strengthen the arrangements this year. So I have every confidence that the 1996 results will provide a solid basis for producing high quality performance tables for 11-year-olds, and my Department will be making the necessary preparations to enable us to do so.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>John Carvel</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>The Government is to claw back &#163;12.8m from the Office for Standards in Education (Ofsted) after it failed to attract enough bids from privatised teams of  inspectors to complete the planned programme of primary school visits, Labour claimed yesterday.  <p>  <p>According to information extracted by Stephen Byers, the Labour education spokesman, the cash limit  for the current financial year is being cut by 13 per cent to &#163;85.2m and the money returned to  the Treasury without any prospect of a carry-over.  <p>  <p>Chris Woodhead, the chief inspector, reported earlier this month on a "worryingly persistent"  slowing of children's performance in the middle years of primary school, contributing to inadequate  progress in maths and English which was reflected in disappointing marks in tests at 11. Gillian  Shephard, the Education Secretary, said inspection by external teams organised by Ofsted could  identify failing schools and provide a stimulus to others to improve their performance.  <p>  <p>The Government wanted Ofsted to inspect the 20,000 primary schools in England over a four-year  cycle starting in September 1994. Approved inspection teams were invited to tender against each other  to keep costs down through competition. Ofsted found, however, that registered inspectors did not  muster teams in sufficient numbers to take up the available contracts.   <p>  <p>"At the present rate of inspection some primary schools will not have their first inspection until after the millennium", Mr  Byers said. "The Government was faced with the stark choice of clawing money back from Ofsted to  provide savings for the Treasury, or using the resources to get back on course with the four-year  programme. "This latest revelation shows just how far behind the programme is. Ministers wanted to hide the  truth, but now they must accept the real difficulty they have in improving standards in primary  schools," he said.  <p>  <p>A spokeswoman for Ofsted acknowledged: "The primary and special school market has not gone as  quickly as we had hoped." But the budget for the next financial year would be maintained at the  substantially higher level of &#163;117.8m, allowing an increase in the volume of inspections of  primary schools.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Harriet Harman and choice of school</b><br><br><br><b><h2>7 February 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Voters  back Harman in school row  </h2>
  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Martin Linton</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>Conservative hopes of rebuilding the party's popularity on the back of Harriet Harman's decision to  send her son to a grammar school appear to be dashed today by a Guardian poll, the first to appear  since the controversy broke two weeks ago, showing that most voters think her choice was the right  one.  <p>  <p>Respondents in ICM's poll said by a majority of 50 to 38 per cent that she was right. Among Labour  voters the majority was 52-36.  <p>  <p>People also said - by a bigger majority, of 56 to 34 per cent - that she would have been wrong to  resign from Labour's front bench over the issue. The poll, eagerly awaited at Westminster by all  political parties, will steady Labour nerves and prove a huge disappointment to ministers, many of  whom had claimed that the Harman controversy had finally breached Tony Blair's defences.  <p>  <p>The issue had lifted the morale of Tory backbenchers, who were convinced that the Central Office  slogan 'Labour says one thing and does another' had a popular resonance.  <p>  <p>Despite their support for Ms Harman, voters believe by a much larger majority that all state  secondary schools should be comprehensives, the poll shows. This is supported by 65 per cent and  opposed by only 27. Even among Conservatives there is a 50-45 majority.  <p>  <p>Voters also believe that in general Labour politicians should send their children to  comprehensives, not to grammar or private schools. In Ms Harman's case, they appear to have accepted  her argument that she was acting in the situation as she found it.  <p>  <p>This helps to explain why the affair has inflicted only a small dent in Labour's popularity,  bringing it down from 48 per cent in December and January to 47 per cent in February.  <p>  <p>The Conservatives are up five points from 26 to 31 per cent, but this is mainly at the expense of  the Liberal Democrats and only brings them back to their rating before Emma Nicholson's defection.  <p>  <p>Labour's adjusted lead of 16 points is not significantly different from its 17-point lead in four  out of the last seven months. On an unadjusted basis the lead is 25 points - again, little different  from the 24 points in December.  <p>  <p>The most plausible explanation is that Ms Nicholson's defection caused a temporary dip in Tory  fortunes in January but Ms Harman made almost no difference in February.  <p>  <p>ICM's respondents were asked: Given that Labour is opposed to selective education, do you think  Harriet Harman was right or wrong to let her son go to a grammar school that selects only high-ability  children?

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Harriet Harman and choice of school</b><br><br><br><b><h2>9 February 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Labour in  new school furore  </h2>
  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>David Hencke</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>A Labour MP yesterday rekindled the embarrassing row over choice in education for Tony Blair by  confirming he had sent his two children to public schools because he was not satisfied with their  progress in the state system. Roger Godsiff, MP for Birmingham Small Heath, said yesterday: "The  education of my children is more important than whether it is a politically correct or incorrect  decision to send them there."  <p>  <p>His support for the private sector came as Brian Wilson, Labour's transport spokesman, was quoted  in the Glasgow Herald as saying "public schools produce more social cripples than any organisation  known to man." This comment caused a row at Prime Minister's question time when Mr Wilson's column was  read out by Sir Malcolm Thornton, Conservative MP for Crosby.   <p>  <p>The disclosure of Mr Godsiff's decision also follows the furore over Harriet Harman, Labour's health spokeswoman, sending her son to a grammar  school. Mr Godsiff, an 11-plus failure who was educated at a comprehensive, said he had sent his  children, Anthony and Carrie, to a primary school in Lewisham, south London, where he has continued to  live since winning the Birmingham seat in 1992.  <p>  <p>"Their progress deteriorated after their headmaster retired," said Mr Godsiff, a 49-year-old former  union official. "I tried to find an alternative state school for both, but it proved very difficult.  "Ultimately I decided to exercise my right as a parent to move them where they could get the education  I wanted them to have. I pay the fees out of my own pocket."  <p>  <p>His son goes to Colfe's School, an independent school whose fees are &#163;4,500 a year. His  daughter goes to Blackheath high school, an independent school with a similar fee level. He is keen on  single sex schools for both. Andrew Hargreaves, Conservative MP for Birmingham Hall Green, said: "I do  not blame Mr Godsiff for exercising his parental choice, but his party would deny others the same  opportunity. "It is a grotesque double standard."  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Welfare spending to be slashed by a quarter</b><br><br><br><b><h2>7 February  1996</h2></b><br><h2>Clarke tries to square cuts and welfare  </h2>
  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Michael White</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>The Chancellor, Kenneth Clarke, yesterday laid out his most trenchant defence yet of a fair but  efficient welfare state - free at the point of use - which Tory Britain will be able to finance  because of its growing economic success. He claimed it was possible to square the circle between New Right pressure for lower taxes and One  Nation Tory support for comprehensive health, education and welfare services, provided the  Government's commitment to "an enterprise economy" delivers the goods.  <p>  <p>In a speech which discreetly taunted Thatcherite MPs with the spectre of "riots on the streets" if  welfare cuts are made too quickly, the Chancellor insisted that he and John Major shared his own  declared objective "to reduce spending below 40 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP)". After weeks  in which he has been accused of dragging his heels against radical demands for far deeper cuts - and a  GNP share of 35 per cent or less on US or Asian lines - he said: "There is no limit that need be set  at this stage on how far further down this road we will go."  <p>  <p>Despite his reputation as what Labour's Chris Smith dubbed the Cabinet's "last One Nation Tory" Mr  Clarke's speech at the London School of Economics's Centre for Economic Performance yesterday was not  intended to pick a fight with the right. He brushed aside claims of splits and suggestions that he is  being marginalised, and even praised the drive by Social Security Secretary, Peter Lilley, to trim  &#163;5bn a year off the &#163;80bn social security budget by 1999. Mr Clarke stressed: "Big  government is out - limited government is in."  <p>  <p>It prompted Mr Smith, shadow social security spokesman, to accuse Mr Clarke of "rewriting history"  in ignoring the degree of job and home insecurity created by Tory policies. Since 1979 they had  doubled the number of people dependent on the state from one in 12 to one in six, Mr Smith said. But  the Chancellor was unrepentent in making his familiar Middle England appeal that flexible, free market  economics require "fewer snakes and more ladders" for families wanting to make a decent living.  <p>  <p>"People need to be reassured more than ever before that, through thick and thin, their health will  be looked after, their children educated, and a safety net provided for their old age and periods of  involuntary unemployment. In this way a strong welfare state can complement, not hinder, more flexible  markets by reducing fear of change and opposition to it," he said.  <p>  <p>At the same time he warned that the welfare state could not be allowed to expand "unimpeded" or at  the pace it had in the Seventies. Then public spending's share of GDP peaked at 47.25 per cent, compared  with 45.5 per cent at the peak of the early Eighties recession, 43.5 per cent in the Nineties recession and 42  per cent this year. The trend was now down, he insisted: "Our aim is to leave our children a welfare system which works  and which they can afford."  <p>  <p>But to avoid the welfare network becoming "unaffordable and inadequate at the same time" it was  imperative to contain spending on social security, health and education, the former health and  education secretary said. Rightwingers will not be appeased by what amounts to a defence of the status  quo, while Labour is flirting with radical reforms of its own. Mr Smith praised the Chancellor's  "laudable" wish to retain a strong welfare system even if government policies had tripled income  support costs to over &#163;16bn.  <p>  <p>"Instead of rewriting the past he would have been better employed looking at how we can build a  real welfare state for the future," he said.   <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Immigration tribunal says Jayaram Khadka should be allowed to stay in GB </b><br><br><br><b><h2>8  February 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Nepalese boy 'can stay with millionaire'  </h2>
  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>John Mullin</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>A Nepalese boy brought to Britain by a businessman who treated him as his son and made him heir to  his &#163;2.5m fortune should be allowed to stay, an immigration appeals tribunal said yesterday. It ruled there were exceptional  compassionate circumstances which allowed Jayaram Khadka, 19, to remain and strongly recommended that  a deportation order be rescinded.  <p>  <p>But the recommendation, following a hearing last month, carries no legal force, and Michael Howard,  the Home Secretary, is free to send him back to Nepal. Only in a minority of cases after a tribunal recommendation does the Home Secretary change his  mind, although a Home Office spokesman conceded the case was extremely unusual.  <p>  <p>Richard Morley, 42, a former naval officer who made his fortune from information technology,  brought Jayaram to Britain to fulfil a pledge he made to the boy's father in 1984. The father, a  policeman who suffered a heart condition, had run for three days to raise the alarm after Mr Morley  suffered a collapsed lung while climbing in the Himalayas.  <p>  <p>As a reward, Mr Morley agreed to look after his son should his illness overcome him, and brought  Jayaram, virtually destitute, to Britain in 1990 following his father's death two years earlier.  <p>  <p>But there was a mix-up over his age, and Jayaram entered the country on a passport which showed him  to be four years older than he was, and the Home Office has so far insisted that means he must be sent  back.  <p>  <p>Mr Morley, who has educated Jayaram at his home, yesterday repeated his pledge to leave Britain  with Jayaram should the Home Office deport him. Jayaram has lived at Clearwell Castle in the Forest of  Dean with Mr Morley in an unorthodox family relationship, with three other men, two women and another  boy. Mr Morley has rejected suggestions of any improper or homosexual relationships among the group,  who live together after contracting into what he calls The Family.  <p>  <p>The tribunal said they had been impressed by the evidence they had heard from family members,  including Ford exective Martin Jones, 31, and Helen Thomas, 40, Mr Morley's girlfriend. "We have no reason to think that any aspect of the community is other than that which was laid  before us, a community made up of persons who have decided they wish to live together and to commit  themselves to each other." The tribunal agreed with Mr Morley's argument that Jayaram had never been,  nor ever would be, a charge on public funds. "We were impressed by Mr Khadka's evidence and the way he gave it. We think that the life he would  live in Nepal, having had the experience of the family life he has had in this country, would be  traumatic for him."   <p>  <p>Mr Morley said: "It has been a great victory for justice, but there is still  concern over whether the Government will follow the recommendations." Jayaram said: "To have to leave  suddenly and go to a place where people might not understand me would be a very traumatic time for me.  I would be isolated from my family and people whom I trust 100 per cent." The Home Office said it  would study the ruling.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Lord Brocket gets five years for car fraud</b><br><br><br><b><h2>10 February  1996</h2></b><br><h2>Baron friend of Prince gets five years for car fraud</h2>
<h3>Classic Ferraris and  Maserati were crushed for 4.5m insurance  </h3>  <br>By<b>John Mullin</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>Lord Brocket, a sporting friend of the Prince of Wales, last night began a five-year sentence for  his role in a &#163;4.5m classic car fraud. He embarked upon the scam when he ran into financial  troubles, but his estranged wife blew the whistle on him.  <p>  <p>Lord Brocket, aged 43, had pleaded guilty to conspiracy to defraud at Luton crown court last month.  He was on &#163;30,000 bail pending pre-sentence reports, but had been warned he faced a custodial  sentence. He showed no emotion as he was taken to the cells yesterday.   <p>  <p>Brocket, charged under his family name Charles Ronald George Nall-Cain, made insurance claims on four cars which disappeared from  his Hertfordshire estate in May 1991. Their crushed remains were later discovered on the estate and in  a London lock-up.   <p>  <p>Judge Daniel Rodwell QC criticised Brocket for enlisting two estate employees help  in the fraud. Mark Caswell, aged 40, and Stephen Gwyther, aged 41, were each given 21-month jail  terms, suspended for two years. The judge said: "To use the pressure and power he had to make men of  previously good record take part in a criminal operation is quite disgraceful."   <p>  <p>Desmond de Silva QC, representing Brocket, said his client had acted out of panic. He had found himself in financial crisis  in 1990 because of the costs involved in developing the family seat. His collection of classic cars,  once worth &#163;20m, was depreciating, and his eight-year marriage to Isabell Lorenzo, then suffering  drug problems, was falling apart. But the judge said: "It's one of the most long-lasting panic  attacks I have ever heard put forward before me. It stems from October 1990 to July 1994." Brocket,  the third Baron of Brocket, inherited the family's 1,400-acre Brocket Hall estate near Welwyn Garden  City when he was 15. After leaving Eton, he joined the army and served as an officer in the 14/20  Royal Hussars. He had failed to develop it as an up-market conference centre, although it was the  venue for several meetings of European ministers during Britain's presidency of the European Union in  1991.  <p>  <p>Brocket Hall has seen scandal before, if not criminal activity. In the last century, Lady Caroline  Lamb was served up naked in a soup tureen before Melbourne's cabinet. Palmerston was found dead on a  billiard table, apparently after an assignation with a maid.  <p>  <p>Brocket reacted coolly after the disappearance of three vintage Ferraris and a Maserati. As  enthusiasts compared it to the loss of four Picassos, Brocket said: "I am left looking like a complete  idiot."  <p>  <p>He filed a &#163;4.5m insurance claim, almost matching the &#163;5m debts of his company, Brocket Hall Ltd. He had reinsured his collection of 50 cars weeks earlier.  <p>  <p>His wife alerted the family, but was ignored at first because of her drug problem.  <p>  <p>When the insurers, Lloyd's of London and General Accident, refused to pay up, Brocket began legal  proceedings. But he dropped them four weeks before the scheduled start of the case in November 1994,  and both sides agreed to pay their own costs of &#163;500,000. Detectives began an investigation a  year ago.  <p>  <p>His wife divorced him this year, citing her husband's unreasonable behaviour. She wants to start a  new life with their children, heir Alexander, aged 11, Antalya, eight, and four-year-old William, in  Puerto Rico. Brocket wants them to stay in Britain.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>US makes bid in nuclear sell-off</b><br><br><br><b><h2>10 February 1996</h2></b><br><h2>MPs damn nuclear sell-off</h2><h3>Proceeds could be less than 2.9bn cost of Sizewell B - Cut-price offer to finance tax cuts feared  </h2>
  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Chris Barrie</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>MPs are to demand that the Government withdraw the country's newest nuclear power station, Sizewell B, from the controversial nuclear privatisation this summer for fear that the sell-off of the industry will raise less than it cost to build this one &#163;2.9bn reactor.  <p>  <p>The recommendation is included in a draft report by the Commons Trade and Industry Select Committee, a copy of which has been seen by the Guardian. The devastating report expresses concern that the Government is rushing into a cut-price privatisation and may squander the proceeds on tax cuts. It comes as ministers are in final talks with the industry over the financial structure of the sale, expected to raise no more than &#163;2.5bn. The draft also calls into serious question many of the Government's assumptions about the financing of the industry's multi-billion bill for cleaning up stations and dealing with nuclear waste.  <p>  <p>The Government, and particularly Michael Heseltine, the Deputy Prime Minister, comes under direct fire for misleading the public over the privatisation plans.  <p>  <p>Mr Heseltine pledged that the sell-off would lead to an eight per cent cut in electricity bills but the committee reckons that the savings are more likely to be 5 per cent because the nuclear levy - a surcharge on all electricity bills - will not expire this year as the Deputy Prime Minister promised. It also warns that the Government's decision to make no special provision for funding the clean-up of elderly Magnox reactors, which are to remain state-owned, could threaten other public sector investments, like schools and hospitals, when the nuclear bill falls due.  <p>  <p>MPs were due to publish their findings next Wednesday, but the financial complexities of the Government's second attempt to sell off nuclear power may delay publication until nearer the end of the month.  <p>  <p>The final shape of the report could yet be altered in last-minute haggling by MPs on the influential backbench committee, and there is still thought to be a chance that they will fail to agree a unanimous stance. Twelve days ago Ian Lang, the trade and industry secretary, rejected a suggestion from his Labour shadow, Margaret Beckett, that the sell-off be suspended until the committee had issued its report. Among the report's most sensitive conclusions are that Sizewell B, the most modern atomic station with only nine months' operating experience, be withdrawn from the sale, kept in state hands, and run under licence by British Energy.  <p>  <p>The draft says that it would be "unsatisfactory" if the reactor were sold for significantly less than its value in order to achieve a sale by a particular date.  <p>  <p>Although the Government has set up plans for a special ring-fenced fund to save up cash to pay for the decommissioning of those reactors being privatised and dealing with their fuel, the MPs suggest the fund may not cover all the &#163;10.5bn costs.  <p>  <p>The report says that the uncovered costs could render the privatised reactors uneconomic, and in such an event the liabilities would fall on the future taxpayers. The MPs want the fund to be extended, or sensitive fuel reprocessing contracts to be renegotiated.  <p>  <p>The report calls on the Government to reverse its policy of refusing to establish a similar segregated fund to cover a further &#163;14.3bn of clean-up costs for the Magnox reactors.  <p>  <p>Without such a guarantee, money for decommissioning could be spent on tax cuts or diverted to other public spending needs such as schools and hospitals.  <p>  <p>MPs are particularly alarmed that the Government is pressing ahead with the sell-off without having put in place a strategy for dealing with radioactive waste.  <p>  <p>The cost of its tentative proposals to to build a dump at Sellafield in Cumbria were uncertain and, were they to collapse, the likelihood would be that the bill would rise sharply. The report believes this could be biggest area of risk for potential investors.  <p>  <p>Ministers are also criticised for claiming that they could cut the clean-up costs of the old Magnox reactors by &#163;900m.  <p>  <p>The report says there is no evidence that this was "anything more than an informed guess". The committee insists that all liabilities - including a &#163;4bn bill for reprocessing fuel already used by reactors -  <p>  <p>should be made the responsibility of the new private company and not the taxpayer.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b> NHS set to fund surrogate birth</b><br><br><br><b><h2>13 February 1996</h2></b><br><h2>NHS set to fund surrogate birth  </h2>
  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Chris Mihill</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>The first birth to a surrogate mother funded by the NHS could follow discussions between a health authority and a test tube baby clinic over the help to be given to an infertile couple.  <p>  <p>Previous surrogacy arrangements - where a woman bears a child for an infertile couple - have been private. It is not yet known whether the health authority would restrict funding to in vitro fertilisation treatment, or if it would pay the expenses of the surrogate mother.  <p>  <p>John Parsons, head of the Assisted Conception Unit at King's College Hospital, south London, yesterday revealed that his clinic had been told by a health authority that it would meet the cost of a surrogate pregancy, although detailed discussions were continuing.  <p>  <p>Mr Parsons declined to give details of the couple who wanted the baby or the prospective surrogate mother. He also refused to identify the health authority, although it is believed to be in the south of the country. The treatment involves taking eggs and sperm from the would-be parents, mixing them in a laboratory and implanting them in the surrogate mother. IVF costs about &#163;2,000 per course of treatment.  <p>  <p>Expenses for a surrogate mother would normally include loss of earnings, travel costs and clothing. Most surrogate mothers receive between &#163;7,000 and &#163;10,000.  <p>  <p>The anouncement came as the British Medical Association issued revised guidance to doctors, saying they should help patients involved in surrogate pregnancies, as counselling about the possible pitfalls would lessen the chances of arrangements going wrong.  <p>  <p>Mr Parsons said he believed that surrogate pregnancies should be available on the NHS as a last resort for infertile couples.  <p>  <p>His unit received four or five requests a year for IVF treatment for surrogate pregancies. Each case was decided by the hospitals ethics committee, after the couple and the surrogate mother had undergone psychological assessment and counselling.  <p>  <p>Tim Hedgley, chairman of Issue, the fertility pressure group, said last night: "I think it is very good news. It is very forward thinking of the health authority. The authority is paying to alleviate stress and suffering in an infertile couple."  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Frank Warren banned as company director for seven years</b><br><br><br><b><h2>14 February  1996</h2></b><br><h2>Warren banned by DTI</h2><h3>Seven-year suspension follows inquiry into London Arena   </h2>
  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>John Duncan</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>Frank Warren has been banned as a company director for seven years in the High Court following a  four-year Department of Trade and Industry investigation into the financial collapse of the London  Arena in Docklands. Warren did not contest the order and agreed that seven years was an appropriate  ban after the judge, Mr Justice Blackburne, read out a statement of agreed facts.  <p>  <p>Warren had sought a month's adjournment for the case, such as was granted on Monday in a similar  DTI case involving the England football coach Terry Venables, but that request was refused.  <p>  <p>The charges against Warren are some of the most serious that can be levelled against a company  director. Among other things they relate to trading while his company Arena Developments (Europe) Ltd  was insolvent; failure to comply with the requirements of the Companies Act as to the filing of annual  returns and accounts; failure to maintain and preserve accounting records; and defaults in the  submission of VAT returns.  <p>  <p>Warren emphasised that he had not conceded that he had traded while insolvent, but could not afford  the time to fight the DTI. "Obviously I'm very disappointed," said Warren from his promotion at the  York Hall in east London last night. "We wanted the delay because the DTI only found 165 boxes of  evidence that were in their care just before Christmas and this is about the busiest time of my  business life."  <p>  <p>Warren's solicitors earlier issued a statement on his behalf. "It's important to remember that  these were civil proceedings and not criminal. There's no suggestion of any criminal wrongdoing," said  Stephen Davies of Park Nelson Thompson Quarrell.  <p>  <p>"He's working a 16-hour day at the moment. He is involved in big promotions with all his top boxers  and is contractually committed to attending various events and press conferences. "If he had fought the court decision he would have been required to be in court probably for two or  three weeks and that would have meant he would have been in breach of these obligations. He could have  been sued or lost a large amount of money. He couldn't afford to jeopardise all this by spending time  on legal proceedings."  <p>  <p>Warren has not been a company director since 1991 and thus none of his current business interests -  Frank Warren Promotions or The Sports Network - will be affected. Warren's client list includes Naseem  Hamed and Frank Bruno, both currently training for world title defences.  <p>  <p>The judgement is the latest lurch in a roller-coaster career that saw Warren bounce back from being  shot in November 1989. The attack put him in hospital and left him with half a lung missing.  <p>  <p>After the shooting, which occurred around the time that the London Arena was opened, Warren's  empire, based very much around his own consummate dealmaking, was left staring at &#163;30m of debts.  Warren has since made a comeback worthy of any of the boxing greats, paying back a large chunk of the  money owed, according to reports.  <p>  <p>The case against Warren goes back to the 1991 collapse of the London Arena, a sporting and  entertainment complex in which Warren had a 70 per cent stake. After its 1989 opening the venue ran into problems and was forced to call in the receivers in 1991  with debts of &#163;20m. The venue reopened in 1994.  <p>  <p>One of life's fighters, though he never boxed, Warren left school at 15 and worked as a porter in  Smithfield meat market before setting up his first business venture, renting out vending machines to  pubs. He began promoting after being talked into investing in one fight.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Take That split up</b><br><br><br><b><h2>14 February 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Take this</h2><h3>Since Robbie  Williams left the top boy band last summer he has spent a six-figure sum trying to become his own man   </h3>  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Alex Bellos</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>It was perhaps no coincidence that Take That announced their split at the same time as the Academy  Award nominations were revealed in LA. In terms of back-slapping and cringeing self-indulgence,  yesterday's press conference in Manchester was on a par with the most nauseous Oscar acceptance  speech. Until, that is, a brave journalist mentioned Robbie Williams... Did the panel realise it  was their ex-colleague's birthday? The chirpy banter suddenly became nervous laughter. The tension was  especially revealing as only seconds before, Gary, Mark, Jason and Howard had been lingering on what  great friends they are and were... For a moment the cracks in Take That's carefully crafted image  were there for all to see.  <p>  <p>Robbie is the one man who knows what it is like to leave Take That. He was sacked last summer "for  having an opinion", he believes - for breaking the strict rules that kept the boys in line so the  machine could make its millions. This meant no unofficial snaps, no girlfriends in public and, for a  while, no smoking.  <p>  <p>Robbie's story opens the lid on what it is really like to be part of a boy band. Robbie, a genial  22-year-old, says subtle mind games were used to play on the band members' insecurities so that they  would stick together. He was made to feel useless. "I genuinely believed that I couldn't sing," he  says now, "that I had no talent, I couldn't dance, I had no say and I had no confidence. (Take That)  was always Gary. There was only one person being managed. When it came to being a person, being in  Take That was just total Fantasy Towers."  <p>  <p>The other members, he claims, simply wanted to keep their heads down, make the money and deal with  the emotional issues later. "They were living this formula and I just couldn't do it because I was  becoming a young man. I wanted to live how I wanted to live."   <p>  <p>The final straw was last year's Glastonbury festival last June, at which his antics earned him the tabloid tag Drugs Daft Robbie. He  won the respect of a new community of fans - ravers - but was immediately sacked from Take That. Since  then he has not wanted to speak to the boys. "At the time they sacked me I had to deal with the press  by myself. I had to become a normal person by myself. No one rang me up. It was out of the frying pan  and into the fire."  <p>  <p>The eight months since then have been taken up with a protracted legal battle with his record  company BMG, which will reach the High Court on 26 February. A clause in his contract says he must  stay on the label. His lawyers will be arguing that, as he wants to leave, this amounts to an unfair  restraint of trade.  <p>  <p>Robbie's departure from Take That has only pushed his cred rating higher. The tabloids and the  public seemed to identify with his carefree nature. He was asked to present Channel 4's Big Breakfast  in the autumn, which he did for a short stint. Since then he has been too busy preparing for his case  to concentrate on anything else. He has spent almost all his six-figure earnings on lawyers and can't  afford to buy his own house. He has turned down offers from the tabloids offering &#163;250,000 for  his story and from promoters wanting him to star in a West End musical. All the major record labels  are reportedly queueing up to sign him if he wins the case. He is aware that the odds are stacked  against him - almost every member of a boy band, with the exception of George Michael who has become a  friend, has failed to have a successful solo career.   <p>  <p>He is also aware that he is no musical genius. "I am not a self-contained man like, say, George Michael. He can go into his own studios and write his  own songs. I need help with mine. Obviously there is a shelf life for an artist of my ilk. The sooner  I do something the better."  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b> MoD compensation to pregnant women discharged from forces to exceed 55m </b><br><br><br><b><h2>14  February 1996</h2></b><br><h2>MoD pregnancy sacking awards near 55m  </h2>
  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>David Hencke</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>Compensation paid to pregnant women discharged from the armed forces will exceed &#163;55m and the  total number claiming will reach 5,150, according to documents listing every award made by the Ministry of Defence. Lists of more than  5,000 awards have been deposited in the House of Commons library following a demand for the  information from David Clark, Labour's defence spokesman. Nicholas Soames, the Armed Forces Minister,  declined to answer his parliamentary question seeking information on the figures to avoid publication  in Hansard.  <p>  <p>The figures disclose that 30 women have been paid more than &#163;100,000 each. They exclude the  highest award, of &#163;350,000, to Josephine Green, a former Royal Navy nurse, who has not yet been  paid. The awards followed a European Court ruling that the MoD had unfairly discharged women because they  became pregnant. The ruling led to a change in MoD policy in 1990.  <p>  <p>The MoD admits that 5,150 women have had legitimate claims for unfair dismissal between 1978 and  1990. The documents show that 5,027 claims have been settled, costing &#163;54,896,254.12. Another 123  cases remain. The largest number of claims have come from former army personnel - 1,972 cases,  including 16 women receiving more than &#163;100,000. The RAF has had 1,908 cases, with 12 people  receiving more than &#163;100,000. The navy has had 1,147 cases, with four receiving more than  &#163;100,000. Some awards have been strongly contested, including the &#163;150,000 paid to Catherine  Birtwistle, of Burton in Lonsdale, North Yorkshire, who resigned from the now disbanded Women's Royal  Army Corps in 1981, and had earlier rejected an MoD offer of just over &#163;2,000.  <p>  <p>Mrs Birtwistle, aged 47, who now has three children, joined the corps in 1973 when regulations  demanded that pregnant women should leave the service. When she resigned, she had reached the rank of  major. She is now a major in the Territorial Army and second-in-command of the officer training corps  at the University of Liverpool. She was awarded the &#163;150,000 at an industrial tribunal in  Manchester.  <p>  <p>The lists of awards also disclose a growing demand from women to return to military service after  having children. Ninety-seven women returned to the Royal Navy in 1995 compared with one in 1991,  while 186 returned to the RAF in 1995 compared with 48 in 1993. Those who took maternity leave in the  army increased from three in 1990 to 256 in 1994.  <p>  <p>Mr Clark said last night: "This huge bill for compensation is a complete waste of taxpayers' money  for a ridiculous policy that never should have been implemented. Given that the ministry is already  strapped for cash, it shows what a mess the ministry has got itself in."  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

  <br><br>      <p>A clean-up operation began last night after an estimated 6,000 tonnes of crude oil leaked from the  Sea Empress supertanker, which ran aground off Milford Haven, west Wales. Texaco, the oil company,  said the vessel had been taken off rocks.  <p>  <p>The company's emergency co-ordinator, Phil Thompson, said the Sea Empress was heading for the  Texaco refinery at Milford Haven. Initial unconfirmed reports suggested a defect in the ship's  steering system was to blame. "It is not owned by Texaco but the oil was heading for a Texaco berth.  Some of the tanks have been damaged and there has been a spillage of oil, but we don't know how much.  Emergency procedures have been put into place, involving our pollution team and the local port  authority and the Oil Spill Response team."  <p>  <p>Coastguards said no injuries had been reported among the 28-strong Russian crew, all of whom were  staying on board.

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Oil tanker Sea Empress founders on rocks off Milford Haven</b><br><br><br><b><h2>17 February  1996</h2></b><br><h2>Disaster alert after oil spill</h2><h3>Tugs fight to stop slick from tanker polluting  wildlife reserves  </h3>  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Owen Bowcott</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>A team of four ocean-going tugs was last night battling to keep the stricken Liberian-registered  tanker Sea Empress afloat as oil slicks broken up by high winds threatened wildlife reserves on the  coast of west Wales.   <p>  <p>The tugs were due to be reinforced early today by several other vessels directed  to the scene of the emergency. And by midnight it had become clear that the extent of the pollution  was much worse than had been earlier thought, with estimates of the amount of light crude oil washed  ashore being put at between four and six thousand tonnes. Worst affected were local beaches in and  around the Milford Haven estuary.  <p>  <p>Seven marine pollution control planes sprayed detergent on to a five-mile slick, which was drifting  eastwards. Two teams of divers assessed the vessel's damaged pump room and holed cargo tanks.  <p>  <p>Plans were underway for a smaller 30,000-tonne tanker, Star Bergen, to be brought alongside to  transfer some of the remaining cargo before the Sea Empress was moved into harbour.  <p>  <p>The grounding of the ship beneath St Ann's Head, the second accident in almost exactly the same  spot in the last four months, immediately prompted calls for an inquiry into shipping safety  standards.  <p>  <p>The vessel has no protective outer hull and was manned by a Russian crew working under a foreign  flag of convenience.  <p>  <p>The incident began at 8pm on Thursday when the 147,000-tonne Sea Empress, managed by Glasgow  company Acomarit (UK) Ltd and carrying a local pilot, approached the entrance to Milford Haven in  order to discharge its cargo of North Sea oil at the Texaco refinery.  <p>  <p>The reasons for the accident, in which 6,000 tonnes of oil spilled into the sea, were not clear  last night. The engines and steering gear were reported to have been working until it ran aground.  <p>  <p>Along one stretch of freshwater beach, the slurp of oil sludge smothering the rocks almost drowned  out the roar of the waves. Lying at the mouth of the estuary, the low hull of the Sea Empress was  wallowing in the swell. Teams of Texaco refinery workers spent all day trying to mop up the black  slime which coated the shoreline at Angle Bay and Freshwater. Clean-up teams used generator-powered  cleaners to suck the largest concentration of oil off the beaches, and sheets of gauze to soak up  slicks that had already contaminated the beaches.  <p>  <p>"It's a terrible sight, and once its got on to the rocks there's nothing you can do unless you wash  it back into the water," said one worker. At Angle Bay the noticeboard in the car park declared that  the area was a Site of Special Scientific Interest, "because of the national importance of its geology  and marine wildlife". There was no sign of the cormorants, choughs, puffins or grey seals promised on  the map of local beauty spots. "Potentially, it's disastrous," said Max Wallace at the Friends of the  Earth's office in Wales. "We need to have an inquiry into the radar system which controls the approach  to the port."  <p>  <p>Numast, the National Union of Marine, Aviation and Shipping Transport Officers, said the problem  was partly due to the number of ships working under foreign flags of convenience which were not  subject to sufficient inspection. "We need well-trained and competent people," said a spokesman. John  Brechin, the manager of the shipping company, said: "It's too early to determine the cause of the  accident but we are working closely with the authorities to find out what happened."  <p>  <p>Sir George Young, the Transport Secretary, flew by helicopter over the stranded vessel and was  shown the main oil slick from the air. After a briefing by harbour officials and the anti-pollution  team, Sir George said all available equipment was being brought into the battle.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Oil tanker Sea Empress founders on rocks off Milford Haven</b><br><br><br><b><h2>20 February  1996</h2></b><br><h2>Rare starfish caught in fallout over spill from tanker  </h2>
  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Owen Bowcott</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>A colony of 3,000 rare green rockpool starfish has been wiped out by crude oil leaking from the  holed tanker Sea Empress, according to wildlife groups in West Wales.  <p>  <p>Conservationists and government agencies were yesterday disputing the extent of environmental  damage to the shoreline of the Pembrokeshire National Park caused by oil from the stricken tanker,  which ran aground on Thursday on rocks at the entrance of the Milford Haven estuary.  <p>  <p>The Dyfed Wild Life Trust mourned the destruction of habitats in West Angle Bay at the mouth of the  estuary. The inlet had been "one of the best teaching sites in the whole of the British Isles for  future marine biologists", said Robin Crump, a trust official.  <p>  <p>The green rockpool starfish, the size of a 50p piece, may never re-colonise the bay. Unlike other  starfish, this variety - Latin name Asterina phylactica - does not have a free-swimming stage but  broods its eggs clinging to the rocks. The bay is one of only seven sites where the starfish has been  recorded in British waters.  <p>  <p>The World Wide Fund for Nature has voiced fear that other rare marine invertebrates, such as soft  corals, jewel anemones, sea fans and sea gooseberries, could suffer from oil coating the sea bed.  Wildlife groups said they believed porpoises and dolphins could also be at risk. But Malcolm Smith of  the Countryside Council for Wales, said environmental damage might not be as extensive as initially  suspected. A survey of Milford Haven found 13,000 sea birds, of which only 43 were oiled. "I do not think that we can be sure yet that the whole population of the green rockpool starfish  has been entirely killed off. We just don't know," he said.  <p>  <p>As for the seals, marine mammals do not have feathers to preen and were far less likely to ingest  oil than birds. Although the damage to the sea bird sanctuaries on Skomer and Skokholm could be  extremely serious, the oil slicks were of a light crude grade, being broken up rapidly by high winds  that have hindered the salvage operation.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Oil tanker Sea Empress founders on rocks off Milford Haven</b><br><br><br><b><h2>22 February  1996</h2></b><br><h2>Extent of oil pollution makes spill drop in ocean  </h2>
  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Tim Radford</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>The oil that oozed from the shattered hull of the Sea Empress aground off Milford Haven spread like  a black hazard to wildlife. But, marine biologists pointed out yesterday, even 50,000 tonnes of North  Sea crude would be literally a drop in the ocean compared with the global assault on the environment  by human use of oil.  <p>  <p>One estimate puts the continuous, chronic poisoning of the environment by hydrocarbon pollution at  2.35 million tonnes a year. According to a US National Science Foundation study, only two per cent  comes from the hulls of tankers or spills at oil rigs.  <p>  <p>Eleven per cent comes from natural sources - tar sands and oil seeps - 13 per cent from the  atmosphere, 24 per cent from all forms of transport and an astonishing 50 per cent slithers down the  drains and rivers and into the sea from cities and industries.  <p>  <p>"Because it is a chronic input and not visible, like oil spills, it hasn't been noticed before,"  said Dr John Widdows, of the Plymouth Marine Laboratory, who has been working on ways to measure the  effect of contamination. "But actually the oil entering the environment from oil spills and tanker  operations is only about two per cent of the global input. So you have to put it into perspective."  <p>  <p>But each menacing slick - from the Torrey Canyon in 1967 off Lands End, the Amoco Cadiz off Ushant  in 1978, the Exxon Valdez in Alaska in 1989, the Braer off Shetland in 1993 - sets off alarms.  <p>  <p>Dr Widdows said: "There is the obvious effect in the smothering and killing of marine life. But  when you have cleared that up, there are less visible effects. The oil is mixed into the water column  and accumulated to quite high concentrations into the body tissues of animals, and these obviously  have sublethal toxic effects."  <p>  <p>But each case is different. The destruction depends on the kind and quantity of oil spilled, the  time of year of the accident, the weather, the temperature, the wind direction, the environment, the  mix of local wildlife and even the way humans react. "In terms of the clean-up operation, we have  learned from the past that it is much better to leave it to nature than do a bulldozing job," he said.  "There are some beaches and some areas where you want to use detergents. But a rocky shore is very  difficult to clean up." A light crude oil from the North Sea is likely to surrender quickly its more  volatile toxins once exposed to air, sea and motion. What remains will be quickly subject to attack by  microbes.  <p>  <p>But other processes will also be at work. Crabs, bivalves and fish will also be concentrating  quantities of poisons in their tissues: some of these will be more toxic than the original poisons.  <p>  <p>The lesson of most of the major oil spills in temperate waters was that it took around 10 years for  wildlife to recover. "It really depends on the time of year the spill occurs, and what effect it has on the algae," Dr  Widdows said. "It's very complex: you can't predict precisely."  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Edward Pilkington</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>Environmentalists say the Sea Empress disaster could not have occurred at a worse time. Birds  wintering along the Pembrokeshire coastline near the spillage such as red-throated divers, have yet to  fly north, while birds which spend the summer in the area are about to arrive in the region. Up to one  million seabirds are expected in the next few weeks, attracted by the rich food source brought by the  Gulf stream.  <p>  <p>Particularly at risk are the 33,000 pairs of gannets now inhabiting the second largest gannet  colony in the world on Grassholm, a small island west of Skomer, which was surrounded yesterday by a  thin film of oil. In the latest count, 545 birds had been sighted with signs of oil pollution, mainly  along the Milford Haven estuary.  <p>  <p>The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds said even a relatively thin layer of oil on the  water's surface could still kill birds if they ingested it while preening.  <p>  <p>Booms are now being used for the first time to contain the slick, having been frustrated earlier by  poor weather. The booms will be used to catch the oil and pull it out to sea. It will be a high-risk venture that  could backfire - birds sheltering on the island could be frightened off the rocks and into the  polluted water, with fatal consequences.  <p>  <p>An optimistic estimate is that all these clean-up missions will recover 10 per cent of the oil,  leaving at least 60,000 tonnes still at sea.   <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Oil tanker Sea Empress founders on rocks off Milford Haven</b><br><br><br><b><h2>27 February  1996</h2></b><br><h2>Welsh oil spill 'is being played down'  </h2>
  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Paul Brown</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>The oil spill off Milford Haven was far larger and more damaging to wildlife than the authorities  in Wales have admitted and casualties were mounting hourly, the RSPCA said yesterday.  <p>  <p>Stephen Mulholland, head of the RSPCA in Wales, said briefings by officials were "either naive or  designed to mislead". He said: "Since the Sea Empress ran aground over a week ago, some authorities  have routinely played down the scale of the impact of the disaster in carefully stage-managed press  briefings."  <p>  <p>He did not accept the claims that half the leaked oil had evaporated, that very few large  concentrations of oil remained at sea, or that the story was now "good news". In fact the number of  wildlife casualties was rising. At Milford Haven alone 1,300 birds had been brought in for treatment,  including 15 oiled swans. More than 2,500 birds are estimated to have died. "It is already clear that  the spill is substantially larger than so far stated by the authorities and that its effects will be  considerably greater than any present official predictions," he said.  <p>  <p>The National Trust, which owns 95 miles of coast in Wales, joined the criticism and said "a major  crisis is now unfolding before our eyes" as reports came in of a number of new beaches being oiled as  the wind shifted. Worst hit was the Freshwater West beach which in places yesterday was a foot deep in  oil. Because of the change in the wind, Carmarthen Bay was now being badly affected by oil for the  first time.  <p>  <p>There were also 300 dead birds at Stackpole on the western fringe and oil was being funnelled into  the rest of the bay by the wind.  <p>  <p>The worst hit species so far is the common scoter, a small black duck which winters in Carmarthen  Bay. In the last three days 872 oiled ducks have been picked up for treatment, about a fifth of the  population. A new treatment centre for birds is being opened by the RSPCA in Milford Haven today because its  existing facilities at West Hatch in Somerset are overwhelmed.  <p>  <p>Other species taking significant casualties are guillemots, with 500 currently being treated and  red throated divers. About 30 seals were seen swimming in oil off the Skomer Island bird sanctuary.  <p>  <p>So far no oil has come ashore in north Devon, although there have been reports of around 40 oiled  birds found on the mainland beaches. Lundy island, 12 miles off north Devon, Britain's only marine  nature reserve is the nesting ground for thousands of sea birds, which have started to return to its  steep cliffs to breed.  <p>  <p>Conservationists on Lundy were last night bracing themselves for a change in weather conditions  which they fear could drive oil from the Sea Empress back towards the island, and increase the number  of oiled birds.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Oil tanker Sea Empress founders on rocks off Milford Haven</b><br><br><br><b><h2>28 February  1996</h2></b><br><h2>Oil from tanker keeps fishing boats in port</h2><h3>Fishermen and merchants set up group  to fight for compensation  </h3>  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Paul Brown</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>Fishing in the extensive shellfish grounds off Milford Haven, Dyfed, has been temporarily abandoned  because of oil contamination from the tanker Sea Empress. Nearly 300 fishermen and fish merchants meeting in Milford Haven voted to keep their boats in  harbour and set up an action group to draw up demands for compensation. The industry was worth &#163;7m a year before the spill, but foreign customers have cancelled  orders for crabs, lobsters and wet fish in the aftermath of widespread pollution off Pembrokeshire.  <p>  <p>The Government is expected to announce details soon of an official fishing exclusion zone in the  polluted area after studying reports from scientists. Trawler skipper David Bray, local secretary of  the Welsh Coastal Inshore Fishermen's Association, said: "We must try to keep public confidence in our  industry and in the quality of catches. In the meantime our members have no income and little prospect  of any. It is vital that compensation payments are arranged as quickly as possible."  <p>  <p>Madeline Moore runs a small family firm, Oneida, which buys winkles, lobsters, spider crabs and  prawns from fishermen and ships them live to the Continent. She said: "I don't think people understand  how serious this is. People keep saying they hope it will be alright, but it's not going to be." She  has contacted fishing groups affected by the Braer oil spill in Shetland in 1993 and has not been  heartened by their message. It took three months for fish to be allowed back on the market, 18 months  for most kinds of shellfish to be deemed clean, and prawns are still affected. Conservationists  demanded a full public inquiry. The Government's proposed inquiry by departmental marine accident  investigators was dismissed as inadequate.  <p>  <p>Much of the Pembrokeshire Coast National Park is heavily polluted by oil, with some wildlife rescue  services predicting that the eventual death toll of seabirds could reach 50,000 - the worst  environmental disaster since the Torrey Canyon wreck in 1967.  <p>  <p>The Council for National Parks said the initial refusal to allow the damaged Sea Empress into  Milford Haven may have been a crucial factor in subsequent pollution.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Scott Inquiry report published</b><br><br><br><b><h2>16 February 1996</h2></b><br><h2>The Scott  Report - Unsound advice and inadequate briefings</h2><h3>Report reserves some of its harshest strictures for  the civil servants</h2>  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Clare Dyer</b><br><br>      Sir Brian Unwin, head of Customs and Excise, told the inquiry he decided to pursue the case despite  being given "storm signals" by senior civil servants. They hinted that he would be entering "highly  delicate territory". Sir Richard accepts the decision to prosecute was made independently of  government ministers, who would have preferred to let the matter drop. But Customs and Excise is  critised for adopting a stance too closely aligned to the Government.  <p>  <p>The report notes that on 6 November 1992, a day after Alan Clark completed the evidence that led to  the trial's collapse, Sir Brian called a meeting with Alan Moses QC, Customs' senior prosecuting  counsel, to discuss dropping charges against the defendants. Mr Moses told the meeting that Customs  had executed the policy of clamping down on companies suspected of exporting arms to Iraq "in its role  as enforcement agents for the Government's export licence policy".  <p>  <p>Mr Moses comes in for criticism over his application to trial judge Brian Sweeney to have  information withheld from the defence under PII certificates. These "gagging orders" were signed by  five government ministers. Mr Moses said in pre-trial hearings that he had read the documents which the Government wished to  keep secret. He concluded they did not assist the defence "in relation to any foreseeable issue".  <p>  <p>But Sir Richard calls Mr Moses's advice "fundamentally unsound" and "flawed". He continues: "The  value of the documents to the defendants in preparing to cross-examine government officials and  ministers . . . seems to me so obvious as to be hardly worth stating."  <p>  <p>But the report says Mr Moses was inadequately briefed by Customs. It blames Andrew Leithead, an  assistant Treasury Solicitor in charge of litigation for the Department of Trade and Industry.  <p>  <p>Mr Leithead played a key role in briefing Mr Moses to resist disclosure of the documents covered by  PII certificates. Sir Richard criticises the instructions as "inadequate". They omitted to mention  Michael Heseltine's reluctance to sign his certificate. Mr Heseltine had asked that his misgivings be  passed on to the judge.  <p>  <p>Mr Leithead is also criticised for advising two DTI officials to alter their witness statements.  Sentences in the statement by Anthony Steadman, head of the DTI's export licensing bureau at the time,  showing the department suspected the machine tools were being used for military purposes, were  deleted. Mr Leithead said in evidence that he was "merely suggesting to Mr Steadman what the correct  position would be".  <p>  <p>The report says: "It is clear that... Mr Leithead had no knowledge of the facts and matters with  which the statement was dealing... I do not doubt Mr Leithead's good intentions but it was, in the  circumstances, dangerous for him to take it upon himself to suggest alterations to the statement." Mr  Steadman is said to have misled, perhaps inadvertently, officials at the Foreign Office and Ministry  of Defence. His role centres on confusion over three 1988 export licences for machine tools. The end  use for the equipment was never established.  <p>  <p>But Eric Beston, a civil servant at the DTI export licensing bureau, is attacked over his evidence  at the trial. Sir Richard says his evidence "was not frank", and was designed to protect officials and  ministers. Sir Richard records Mr Beston's comments on his report's conclusions. "In retrospect, I  should have given more time to re-examining events and re-reading original papers. But it was never my  intention to give anything other than frank evidence."  <p>  <p>The report largely exonerates the ministers who signed the PII certificates. Malcolm Rifkind, then  defence secretary, unlike colleague Peter Lilley, then a minister at the Department of Trade and  Industry, at least read the information on which the certificates were based. He told the inquiry that  he "did not regard himself as having a discretion to decline to claim PII for documents which fell  within the 'advice to ministers' class." Mr Lilley was worried he might compromise security.  <p>  <p>Kenneth Clarke, then home secretary, gave permission for a Security Service officer to give  evidence anonymously, a decision which conflicted with the Attorney General's assertion that ministers  were under a duty to assert PII. The purpose was to rebut the defence that the Government knew of the  activities of Paul Henderson, of Matrix Churchill.  <p>  <p>Sir Richard says: "A witness statement of an intelligence officer was prepared and served on the  defence, without ministerial or judicial approval, because it suited the prosecution and  notwithstanding the fact that the contents of the statement fell within a class of information the  disclosure of which would, according to the responsible minister, be contrary to the public interest."  <p>  <p>Michael Heseltine, then trade and industry secretary, is exonerated for his role in signing a PII  certificate, and Sir Richard records his doubts over the need for the certificate.  <p>  <p>As foreign secretary, Sir Geoffrey (now Lord) Howe gave his name to the Howe guidelines on arms  trade with foreign countries. These were the guidelines the Government was accused of changing without  informing Parliament, relaxing controls on trade with Iraq.  <p>  <p>Along with Mr Waldegrave, he sent letters to MPs assuring them the policy had not changed. Sir  Richard says: "The statement in the letters that 'The Government have not changed their policy on  defence sales to Iraq or Iran' was untrue." Lord Howe had not been informed of junior ministers'  (including William Waldegrave's) agreement on the new formulation. But he knew that a broad relaxation  of policy had been agreed.  <p>  <p>Lady Thatcher, prime minister until 1990, told the enquiry she was in charge of policy, not  administration: "I was on the big issue." The report gives her a clean bill of health, saying she was  not kept informed. Sir Richard found explanations by Lord Howe and Mr Waldegrave about the absence of  communication to the prime minister "unconvincing".  <p>  <p>Some of the most daming criticism is saved for Rob Young, now one of the three top civil servants  in the Foreign Office. He recommended rejection of a request from David Steel, then the Liberal  Democrats' foreign affairs spokesman, for a list of exports to Iran and Iraq. Mr Young was head of the  Foreign Office's Middle East Department between 1987 and 1990. Mr Young argued that "to publish a list  would expose the Government to further pressure both at home and abroad." Sir Richard says: "The  avoidance of domestic criticism is... an unacceptable reason for witholding from Parliament  information about the activities of government."  <p>  <p>Mr Young is also criticised for providing what Sir Richard calls an "incomplete and misleading"  parliamentary answer for Foreign Office minister Lord Glenarthur in April 1989. Sir Richard's comments  are ambiguous: "I accept the sincerity of Mr Young's perception that there was 'no change in policy'  but I do not accept that his perception was correct or that his analysis of the result of what was  done and agreed in the period September 1988 to April/May 1989 is accurate."  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b> IRA bomb explodes near Aldwych</b><br><br><br><b><h2>19 February 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Bomb blasts  West End  </h2>
  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Sally Weale</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>Scotland Yard received no warning of the explosion which happened at 10.38pm on a 171 bus near  theatreland, prompting speculation among security sources that it may have been an IRA "own goal".  There were unconfirmed reports that up to three people may have been killed.  <p>  <p>The IRA normally gives a coded warning, which is known to police beforehand, raising suspicions  that the bombers may have been travelling to a target when the device exploded by accident. The  alternative is that the IRA could have returned to an earlier, more savage style of operation. Six  people were take to St Thomas's Hospital, three with "significant" head injuries. A further two  casualties were taken to University College Hospital where one middle-aged man was "serious but  stable" in intensive care. A younger man was admitted with minor cuts.  <p>  <p>Last night's blast was the second incident in London in three days, raising fresh fears of a return  to a full-scale campaign of terrorist violence on the mainland. On Thursday police made safe an IRA device believed to contain 11lbs of Semtex explosives which had  been left in a telephone box less than a mile from last night's explosion. On 9 February two people  were killed in the Docklands blast.  <p>  <p>The bus was just turning into the Aldwych off the Strand when a blast ripped through it, tearing it  apart. Early reports suggested a taxi driver crashed into the wreckage. The area was sealed off amid  fears of a second device. David Williams, an accident-and-emergency consultant at St Thomas's  hospital, said: "We have taken six casualties, five men and one lady, all relatively young adults,  three with significant head injuries." The three most seriously injured had been on the bus while two  had been in cars ahead of the scene of the explosion. Doctor Williams said all those that had arrived  at St Thomas's were "very deeply shocked".  <p>  <p>The most seriously injured man had "significant facial injuries with arterial bleeding".  <p>  <p>Witness Paul Rowan, aged 31, said: "There was tangled metal and glass everywhere. I could see one  woman lying face down on the ground about 20 yards away. "I was unable to see her face, but there was blood all over the back of her head, and she looked  really seriously injured. People were putting coats over her to keep her warm in the rain, but then we  were moved back."   <p>  <p>A barrister, Bernard Devlin, aged 40, was working in his chambers in the Inner  Temple when the explosion rocked the building. "It was like loud thunder and at first I thought that's  all it was. But then sirens started wailing and it was clear the IRA were back in London."  <p>  <p>Anthony Yates, aged 26, said: "I was walking down the road and I saw a big white flash in the sky.  I looked and then I saw a double-decker bus but there was nothing left of it, it was blown to pieces. "There were three people at least dead. When the bomb went off, a taxi drove into the bus. The  NatWest bank outside is badly hit. The bus driver and the taxi driver both looked dead. There's a guy  lying outside the bus saying 'my legs, my legs'. "There was another guy with blood coming from his jaw. I ran round to help people and saw him lying  down in the road. There was a lot of glass everywhere. It's a complete mess up there."  <p>  <p>The Irish government last night condemned those responsible for the bombing. A statement issued in  Dublin said: "The Taoiseach and Tanaiste and all members of the Government are deeply shocked by this  appalling outrage." The news of the attack will increase the political pressure on John Major to  abandon any hope of bringing Sinn Fein and the other political parties, notably the Unionists, back  together for talks. Hard-line Conservative backbenchers are bound to press for more stringent security  measures and a full-scale ostracisation of the Sinn Fein.  <p>  <p>After the Docklands bomb, in which two people died, Mr Major said there would be no more  ministerial contact with the Sinn Fein until the ceasefire had been restored. However, he spoke of  taking more risks for peace and the strong underlying message was that Sinn Fein still had a chance to  be brought into the talks process.  <p>  <p>Mr Major is due to meet the SDLP leader, John Hume, today to discuss Mr Hume's proposal for a  referendum north and south of the Irish border on opposition to violence and the need for all-party  talks. Mr Major is due tomorrow to meet the leader of the Ulster Unionists, David Trimble.   <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>IRA ceasefire ends as two are killed in Docklands bomb</b><br><br><br><b><h2>  19 February 1996</h2></b><br><h2> IRA Docklands bomb smashes ceasefire</h2><h3>Major attacks "appalling outrage"  </h2>
  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>John Mullin</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>The 17-month IRA ceasefire came to a bloody end at 7.01pm last night with a blast that rocked east London, injured more than 100 people, one critically, and thrust Northern Ireland back into political ferment.  <p>  <p>After one hour of shock and hectic checking with the security forces who, like the Government, were taken "completely by surprise", Prime Minister John Major attacked the bombing as "an appalling outrage". He called upon Sinn Fein and the IRA to condemn unequivocally those who planted the bomb near South Quay railway station on the Isle of Dogs.  <p>  <p>The Sinn Fein president, Gerry Adams, said he was saddened and appeared to accept that the IRA ceasefire had ended, saying he regretted that "an unprecedented opportunity for peace has foundered on the refusal of the British government and Unionist leaders to enter into dialogue and substantive negotiations."  <p>  <p>Mr Adams appealed for calm, and also hinted at a split by saying Sinn Fein's peace strategy remains the main function of the party and his personal priority.  <p>  <p>In Washington, adminstration officials revealed that the Sinn Fein leader had warned President Bill Clinton's national security adviser, Anthony Lake, less than an hour before the explosion that an IRA return to violence was imminent.  <p>  <p>"He had indications that there was going to be a bomb blast and he felt it was legitimate enough that he wanted to give a heads-up to Anthony Lake," an official said. He gave no indication of how long the two men had spoken, nor of the exact time of the telephone call.  <p>  <p>The belatedness of Mr Adams' call suggested that the Sinn Fein leader had not known about the definite end of the ceasefire for long. It is possible he only learned about it around the time of the first warning given to the Irish television station, RTE, one hour before the blast.  <p>  <p>This led to strong speculation that a large part of the Sinn Fein leadership were unaware of the planned IRA action or, alternatively, unable to prevent it - something that might yet help the Irish and British governments keep the peace process on track.  <p>  <p>The Irish prime minister, John Bruton - who phoned both Mr Major and Mr Adams late last night - was caught totally unaware.  <p>  <p>In his conversation with Mr Major, Mr Bruton accepted the IRA had made "a conscious decision" to end the ceasefire and pressed Mr Major to stick with the peace process.  <p>  <p>Mr Bruton admitted his ignorance of IRA tactics: "Whether it represents a permanent return to violence or a short-term measure is not possible to discern at this stage."  <p>  <p>Six people were seriously injured in the blast - one critically - and there were reported to be 100 walking wounded, including a five-year-old girl with facial injuries. Three of the injured were police officers. Thirty seven people were taken to hospital. People seeking information on the injured were asked to call 0171 834 7777.  <p>  <p>The bomb was believed to have been planted, at ground level, in an underground garage in a six-storey office block between South Quay station and an unfinished and empty building known as South Quays One. Nearby buildings, where workers were still at their desks when the explosion blasted the Isle of Dogs, were protected from worse damage by the empty building.  <p>  <p>No one within Sinn Fein immediately supported the bombing. Earlier in the day, Mr Adams had taken calls on BBC Radio in Belfast. His message was that talks were the way ahead.  <p>  <p>David Trimble, leader of the Ulster Unionists, said: "If there has been a resumption of violence then it has clearly been done in order to try and prevent elections in Northern Ireland. It is incredible that people who, for the last 18 months, have been telling us they want to move into the democratic process should be resorting to violence."  <p>  <p>Mr Clinton voiced his "deep concern", and Washington said it would urgently be contacting all the parties in order to continue the peace process. Aides said the president would not automatically break off contact with Sinn Fein. Later he made a ten-minute phone call to Mr Major.  <p>  <p>The first hint that the ceasefire was about to end came when Scotland Yard received warnings from news agencies and Sky Television at 5.41pm that a coded statement had been received.  <p>  <p>Commander John Grieve, head of Scotland Yard's anti-terrorist branch, said after visiting the scene: "Shortly before 6pm this evening there were a series of warnings, coded, of a recognised nature, that brought the police and emergency services here. Whilst they were clearing the scene an explosion occurred at 7pm."  <p>  <p>The message warned that the IRA had "with great reluctance" decided that the "complete cessation of violence" would end at 6pm.  <p>  <p>Within an hour, the threat had been realised. Moments after 7pm the blast was heard throughout east and north-east London.  <p>  <p>The Northern Ireland Secretary, Sir Patrick Mayhew, spoke of his sense of outrage. "Here were the republicans, offered a path through to the talks which they claim they have wanted to join for a very long time. That path was by way of elections. Rather than face elections they appear to have gone back to the bomb," he told BBC television news.  <p>  <p>In his statement, Mr Major said: "This is an appalling outrage. My first thoughts are with the casualties, their families and the emergency services. We will pursue relentlessly those responsible for this disgraceful attack. "Sinn Fein had given assurances time and time again that they were committed to peaceful progress. I now call on the leadership of Sinn Fein and the IRA to condemn immediately and unequivocally those who planted this bomb and any suggestion that the ceasefire is now over.  <p>  <p>"It would be a tragedy if the hopes of the people of Britain and Northern Ireland for lasting peace were dashed again by the men of violence.

<!--INFOLINE--><b> Jarvis Cocker jumps on stage when Michael jackson is singing at Brit awards  </b><br><br><br><b><h2>21 February 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Singer hits back over Brit stage 'attack'   </h2>
  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Angella Johnson</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>The lead singer of the pop group Pulp yesterday denied attacking three children during a stage  invasion while Michael Jackson was performing at the Brit Awards on Monday night. As his agents  pledged a legal battle to clear his name, singer Jarvis Cocker said that his actions were a protest  against Jackson's "Christ-like" projection of himself on stage.  <p>  <p>Cocker was arrested and questioned by police after he jumped on stage during Michael Jackson's  performance of 'Earth Song' and allegedly assaulted children taking part in the show. Scotland Yard confirmed it was investigating allegations that an 11-year-old boy was punched,  another suffered a cut ear and bruised ribs and a 12-year-old was thrown to the ground.   <p>  <p>Cocker, 32, claimed he had only protested at the way the music industry allowed Jackson to indulge in the fantasy  of portraying himself as a "Christ-like figure" with the power of healing. "I didn't make any physical  contact with anyone as far as I recall. I certainly didn't push anyone off stage."  <p>  <p>Organisers condemned his action - which was not seen by most of the 4,000 audience - as "dangerous  and irresponsible". Cocker, who allegedly made V signs at Jackson before being bundled offstage with a  companion, spent several hours at Kensington police station. He was granted police bail until 11  March.  <p>  <p>Jackson's record company, Epic, in a statement said the American had been "sickened, saddened,  shocked, upset, cheated (and) angry" at the disruption. Rachael Garner, whose seven-year-old daughter  Bethany was on the stage, said Cocker had caused chaos with his impromptu performance. "The man stood  on Bethany's toe. Then the 15-year-old girl next to her apparently kicked him. The whole episode was  outrageous. The children just couldn't believe what was happening. Some came off in tears and were  cuddling each other."   <p>  <p>Pulp's public relations manager Scott Piering said the group was preparing for a  legal battle to clear Cocker's name. "There were so many people in that room last night who did not  see Jarvis do anything other than take a stroll on stage that I really do not see how these charges  can stand. It is patently untrue that he struck anyone."  <p>  <p>Marc Marot, managing director of Pulp's record company, Island, said unedited video film showed  Cocker being pursued across the stage by a bouncer: "Jarvis does a little swerve, and the bouncer's  arm goes up and accidentally thumps a child in the face."  <p>  <p>Cocker has built a reputation for hard living and prides himself on his newly acquired bad boy  image.  <p>  <p>Before the ceremony the singer, whose group failed to win a prize, had told reporters: "Awards are  a good thing if you get nominated because you go to the party, get really drunk and show yourself up -  which is always something I enjoy doing."  <p>  <p>Pulp, which was formed by Cocker during a boring economics lesson at school in Sheffield 16 years  ago, soared to success over the past 12 months after years of penniless toil. In 1995 they had three  Top Ten singles including 'Common People', which made Number Two in the charts. Another single, 'Sorted  for E's and Whizz', which included references to illegal drugs, went on to be a massive hit along with  the album 'Different Class'.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p><b>Different tunes</b>  <p>  <p>Jarvis Cocker:  <p>  <p>"My actions were a form of protest at the way Michael Jackson sees himself as some Christ-like  figure with the power of healing. The music industry allows him to indulge his fantasies... I just  couldn't go along with it any more. I didn't make any physical contact with anyone as far as I recall... All I was trying to do was  to make a point and do something a lot of other people in the audience would have loved to have done  if only they had dared."  <p>  <p>Michael Jackson's record company Epic:  <p>  <p>"Michael Jackson respects Pulp as artists, but... utterly fails to understand their complete  lack of respect for fellow artists and performers. His main concern is for the people that worked for  him and the fact that children should be attacked. He feels sickened, saddened, shocked, upset,  cheated, and angry, but is immensely proud that... the show went on despite the disgusting and  cowardly behaviour of the two characters that tried to disrupt it."  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Four black workers at Ford appear as white in promotional material </b><br><br><br><b><h2>21  February 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Red faces at Ford as staff get 1,500 for race blunder  </h2>
  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>John Mullin</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>Ford was embarking on a damage limitation exercise yesterday after agreeing to pay four of its  black workers &#163;1,500 each in compensation because they had appeared in promotional material as  white people. Computer technology was used to change their colour.  <p>  <p>The motor company made the payments only after losing &#163;2.8m when hundreds of shopfloor workers staged an unofficial three-hour stoppage over its Ford's Credit  Options brochure. They threatened an all-out strike. The brochure, which features the offending  photograph on its front cover, has been withdrawn from car showrooms in Britain.  <p>  <p>The saga began five years ago when 25 shopfloor workers posed for a photograph to promote Ford's  Everything We Do Is Driven By You campaign. It was used all over Europe as Ford tried to emphasise the  ethnic mix of its workers and their pride in the new Fiesta. But then it went sadly awry. The finger  was pointed at Ogilvy & Mather, Ford's advertising agency. It doctored the photograph for use in  Poland, where it was felt black faces might not go down too well. Somebody sent the doctored negatives  back to Ford 18 months ago for use in the credit scheme brochure. And nobody at Ford, where the  original poster of 1991 was still adorning the shopfloor, noticed the changes.  <p>  <p>Noel Sinclair, who works at the Dagenham plant, discovered the anomaly when he walked into the  Dovercourt showroom in Essex to buy a car and was handed one of the brochures. Five of his colleagues  from the Paints, Trimming and Assembly section having new white identities, including a Sikh who had  to be shorn of beard and turban as well. Douglas Sinclair, aged 56, with Ford for 30 years, a bearded  black man with perfect eyesight, was transformed into a clean-shaven white man with glasses. "It was  embarrassing. People started to come up to me and call me Two Face."  <p>  <p>Patricia Marquis, aged 30, at Dagenham for eight years, had aged 20 years and turned white. She  felt angry and humiliated. "They had changed my face for God's sake. What the hell did they think they  were doing?" Keith Thomas, aged 40, was made to look younger, a white man of about 20 in a baseball  cap. "I immediately thought it was racist. They wanted me in the picture when they wanted to show the  mix of ethnic groups in Ford's workforce, but suddenly I wasn't good enough."  <p>  <p>Negotiations went on with the Transport and General Workers' Union for a fortnight. The workers,  reluctantly, accepted an apology and compensation. They say race relations at Dagenham have been badly  damaged. Mr Thomas told the Evening Standard in London: "It affects everyone who works at Dagenham and  who is black or Asian. It's a sign of just what Ford thinks of us all, and people are angry."  <p>  <p>Ford said last night that it had an unequivocal equal opportunities policy. There had been a  genuine administrative error. Van Leeuwen, managing director of Ford Credit, apologised: "There was  absolutely no racial motive."  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Peter Thurnham rejects Tory whip</b><br><br><br><b><h2>23 February 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Majority cut to two as Tory quits  </h2>
  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Michael White</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>The Tory MP, Peter Thurnham, last night resigned the Conservative whip "to take stock" after weeks of wavering. His decision, following a 70-minute private session with John Major, reduces the Government's majority to two. Mr Thurnham, MP for the highly marginal Bolton North-east since 1983, had expressed deepening disquiet over what he called falling standards in the party and public life even before last week's Scott report.  <p>  <p>But the driving force behind his decision was anger - shared by his wife, Sarah, who also attended last night's meeting with the Prime Minister - that he had not even been shortlisted for the safe vacant seat of Westmorland, where he has a farm. Mr Thurnham looks set to sit as an Independent Conservative as the Eurosceptic, Sir Richard Body, did for most of 1995. Mr Major was said to be "astonished", particularly as he and the MP had agreed to meet again next week after Mr Thurnham had had time to consider what they discussed.  <p>  <p>Tory officials last night put a brave face on the snub to Mr Major. They said that after a frank exchange of views both men had agreed to "think about things over the weekend" and that Mr Thurnham was still in receipt of the Tory whip. But Mr Thurnham later wrote to Mr Major setting out his position.  <p>  <p>Mr Thurnham's known dissatisfaction and the whips' failure to anticipate and placate it are another sign that the Major administration is splitting at the seams. If the South-east Staffordshire byelection is lost, as expected, the Tory majority will come down to one. The defection makes Mr Major even more reliant on the Ulster Unionists in Monday's vote on Scott, and until the election.  <p>  <p>Bolton North-East Conservatives reacted with fury last night, describing Mr Thurnham's move as "betrayal".  <p>  <p>Graham Smith, the constituency agent, said: "People here are very, very cross at what he has done. They have campaigned for him, they have raised money for him and he has gone ahead and done this without any recourse to the association.  <p>  <p>"He has not taken our view into account. He has not even consulted us. He has gone behind our backs and everyone is extremely angry."  <p>  <p>The constituency chairman, Norman Critchley, said: "I think it's disgusting. He has greatly upset the people of Bolton, who deserve better. I don't believe the Scott inquiry is anything to do with it.  <p>  <p>"I am heartbroken frankly, not only for the work my officers have done but heartbroken for all the loyal supporters in Bolton."  <p>  <p>Labour's chief whip, Donald Dewar, said Mr Thurnham was not alone among Tory MPs in his feelings of discontent over the way the party was going. "This is further evidence that the Tory Party is disintegrating under the weight of its own divisions," he said.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Lisa Buckingham</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>Peter Clowes changed the face of City fraud. Until then insider trading had seemed like a victimless crime while losses from the multi-million pound swindles in the Lloyd's of London insurance market had appeared to fall on investors with so much money they should have known better.  <p>  <p>But the Clowes crash in May 1988 took the life savings of small investors, most of whom were elderly  <p>  <p>For the first time there was a human face to scandal in the City. And as thousands of pensioners faced ruin, it emerged that the portly and prematurely grey Clowes had maintained a lifestyle of breathtaking extravagance at their expense.  <p>  <p>The oh-so-ordinary investment salesman had used their nest eggs to buy himself a yacht which had once been owned by Christina Onassis, four personal jets and a helicopter. His property investments included a &#163;600,000 chateau in France and a farm in the Peak district.  <p>  <p>He and his wife Pamela, who was formerly married to Hollies' bass guitarist Eric Haydock, holidayed in the Caribbean, drank Veuve Cliquot and chauffeured themselves around the North-west in a couple of Bentleys and a Porsche.  <p>  <p>But the Clowes' story, which started when he left school at 15 to work in his parents' hardware store before moving on to become an insurance salesman, came to an abrupt halt when the business crashed with &#163;150m of debts.  <p>  <p>Barlow Clowes had been set up in 1973 as a small-scale investment business in partnership with Elizabeth Barlow. She left the company in 1980 when it had about &#163;10m of investments. That swelled to &#163;190m  <p>  <p>with the savings of investors who thought they were putting money into gilts - rock solid government securities - during the next seven years. Clowes had promised them a better than average return. But instead of putting their money into gilts he was exploiting a tax avoidance loophole known as bondwashing which involved cleverly timing the buying and selling of bonds to maximise interest and minimise tax payments.  <p>  <p>This lucrative avenue was closed by the then-chancellor, Nigel Lawson, and a desperate Clowes was forced offshore to hide from regulatory scrutiny. The pressure to provide a growing return to investors as well as funding his increasingly lavish lifestyle prompted him to take over a moribund textile and financial services company called Ferguson which was quoted on the Stock Exhange and could provide him with the credibility he needed. He quickly hit the takeover trail to try to build up income with which to meet his promises to investors. But this manoeuvre depended on Ferguson's share price rising. And that came to a sudden end with Black Monday in October 1987 when stock markets worldwide crashed.  <p>  <p>Barlow Clowes suffered the ignominy of being the first company to be shut down by the new Securities and Investments Board, which had come into being as part of the sweeping changes to City regulation promulgated by the Financial Services Act of 1986.  <p>  <p>But a subsequent investigation by the Parliamentary Ombudsman in 1989 revealed that repeated bungles by the Department of Trade and Industry had allowed Clowes to continue his charmed life when the business should clearly have been closed. The Ombudsman concluded that had the DTI acted in 1985 when it first knew that Barlow Clowes was not maintaining proper records, losses would have been capped at &#163;31m.  <p>  <p>Finally, last year, the full 1,581-page DTI inquiry into the scandal was published. Costing an astounding &#163;6m to produce, the report  <p>  <p>calculated that Clowes had used more than 80 per cent of funds to support himself and his family. He had benefitted personally by some &#163;25. The whereabouts of his alleged personal fortune remains a mystery. The DTI report said Clowes did not act alone. An associate, Guy Cramer, had "a major responsibility" for manipulating investors' funds. Cramer had benefitted "substantially" the inspectors concluded. He was found not guilty in the 1992 trial.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Larry Elliott</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>Peter Clowes, who masterminded one of the biggest frauds of the 1980s, was freed on parole by a "reluctant" Michael Howard yesterday after serving four years of a 10-year jail term. The man who swindled 15,500 investors out of their savings left the High Court in London vowing he would clear his name and claiming he was worried that his case had taken on an unhealthy political dimension  <p>  <p>Mr Clowes was released after threatening legal action against the Home Secretary and the chairman of the parole board for failing to consider his plea for early release.  <p>  <p>The Prison Service said later that Mr Howard had reluctantly agreed to parole because Mr Clowes had been sentenced in 1992, before the introduction of tougher rules governing the amount of their sentences that criminals had to serve in prison.  <p>  <p>Mr Clowes had lost an earlier plea for parole when a judge ruled that the Parole Board was entitled to take the view that he needed more time in prison to come to terms with his guilt and "examine his attitude to dishonesty".  <p>  <p>But he withdrew his appeal against that decision last month after Mr Howard and the Parole Board agreed to reconsider his application and give a decision not later than 20 February.  <p>  <p>Investors, who recovered 90 per cent of their investments after a &#163;150m government rescue, reacted angrily last night to the news of Mr Clowes's release, saying that he should have served his full jail term. Politicians also expressed concern that Mr Clowes was free after serving less than half the sentence imposed when he was convicted of stealing &#163;16m from investors following the collapse of the Barlow Clowes investment group in 1988.  <p>  <p>Labour's City spokesman, Alistair Darling, said: "Many victims will be astonished to find he is out after only four years. It makes a mockery of the Government's claims to be tough on City crime."  <p>  <p>David Shaw, the Conservative MP who was a driving force in the campaign to get compensation for Barlow Clowes victims, said: "I think his release is appallingly early. It is difficult enough getting prosecutions, but far too many of these people are getting out before they should. I would have thought six to seven years would have been more appropriate." Mr Clowes continued to maintain his innocence during a BBC radio interview last night. "I reserve the right to challenge my conviction and I still hope and intend to get my conviction quashed. It's far from the end of the matter; this is the beginning of the matter."  <p>  <p>Explaining his concern about the political backdrop to the case, Mr Clowes said: "The situation here is a balancing one between the needs of victims, who rightly feel aggrieved, and the need for justice. I have accepted the justice of this country even though I personally disagreed with it. There was no intention of ever stealing from any investor."  <p>  <p>Mr Clowes, who is barred from holding company directorships until 2007, pledged to work for the return of the 10 per cent which remained unpaid to investors.  <p>  <p>Mr Clowes will be subject to a programme of supervision by the Probation Service and risks being sent back to jail if he breaks any of the conditions attached to his parole.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b> PG Tips announces triangular tea bag</b><br><br><br><b><h2>24 February 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Non-drip and pyramid tea bags steep to conquer UK taste buds  </h2>
  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>James Meikle</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>Tea claimed its place among the ultimate designer drinks yesterday, as leading tea bag makers insisted that bags represent the shape of things to come.  <p>  <p>Tetley, inventor of the round bag, teased away some of the publicity from PG Tips' new pyramid product by announcing that it would soon introduce Britain to the non-drip bag. And as both companies chortled about no longer being square, the battle for business became a matter of taste.  <p>  <p>Tetley's no-mess drawstring bag, on trial in Australia, "means you'll be able to lift the bag from your cup without spilling it all over your desk", said Ian Prutton, director of worldwide business development. "It has two strings with tags which, when pulled together, squeeze all excess liquid out of the bag."  <p>  <p>Plans for a British launch have to be finalised, but Tetley, which added 25 per cent to sales when it started selling the round bag in 1989, welcomed the competition from the pyramid. "It is good for the market," said Mr Prutton.  <p>  <p>But PG Tips, famous for its 40-year-old chimpanzee advertisements suggested that the round bag had done little for taste. "We will not only refresh the tea market but bring a whole new taste," said Marcus Marsden, PG Tips' senior brand manager.  <p>  <p>The pyramid bag will be launched in April. "Tests proved that the tetrahedral tea bag comes closer to allowing the tea to brew like loose tea in a teapot than any other bag," says the advertising blurb. "Whether the pyramid makes a better cup remains to be seen," said Mr Prutton.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Maev Kennedy</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>Greenwich has beaten off a challenge from Birmingham to stage the Millennium Exhibition in 2000 with a &#163;700m proposal involving a two-year exhibition with pavilions contributed by cities throughout the country, according to the Corporation of London.  <p>  <p>Michael Cassidy, policy chairman for the corporation, said yesterday that the Environment Secretary, John Gummer, had confirmed to him that the Millennium Commission had chosen London over the National Exhibition Centre in Birmingham.  <p>  <p>The commission is chaired by the Heritage Secretary, Virginia Bottomley, and includes the Deputy Prime Minister, Michael Heseltine, who is known to have favoured a London site as part of his cherished project to regenerate the East End and the Thames corridor.  <p>  <p>However a commission spokeswoman insisted yesterday that the final decision had not been made, and added: "We still hope to announce the site next week."  <p>  <p>Reports that six cities will hold linked exhibition projects were also premature, she said. Once the main site is announced the festival programme will be decided, and applications from the regions for grants invited. The leader of the Greenwich bid, Sir Bob Scott, was cautious. "The signs are that it is good news for Greenwich, but we are not throwing our hats in the air until we hear it officially."  <p>  <p>Unofficially, the NEC has been preparing for the worst since the chosen operator, the design consultancy Imagination, which preferred the NEC site, was asked to draw up equally detailed plans for the Greenwich peninsula site.  <p>  <p>The Millennium Commission will provide a grant of up to &#163;100m towards the exhibition, which is to open on New Year's Day 2000, and is expected to attract up to 30 million visitors. The value of the exhibition to Birmingham or London is calculated at &#163;700m.  <p>  <p>The NEC was prepared to invest &#163;50m in the project. When the London backers realised how close they had come to losing it, a massive effort, led by Mr Cassidy, was put into lining up support.  <p>  <p>The commission's decision angered Birmingham council. "It has been rigged," said the council leader, Theresa Stewart. "All the balls in this particular lottery were marked Greenwich."  <p>  <p>Anne Underwood, council Tory group leader, said: "It appears to confirm our worst fears that London was going to get it no matter how much better rival bids were."  <p>  <p>The Greenwich Meridian, much trumpeted in the bid, just nicks the corner of the site, which is downstream of the historic heart of Greenwich. Stratford East, one of the original four shortlisted sites, claims that it is actually closer to the Greenwich Observatory and the Cutty Sark.  <p>  <p>Greenwich says it is uniquely qualified to host the Millennium celebrations, which aim to rival the Great Exhibition in 1851 and the Festival of Britain in 1951.  <p>  <p>It is the point from which time and distance are measured - in Greenwich Mean Time and the Meridian - and offers a backdrop of historic monuments including Inigo Jones's Queen's House, the Royal Naval College, the National Maritime Museum, and the Cutty Sark.  <p>  <p>Mr Cassidy rejected criticisms that Greenwich was difficult to reach. The Jubilee Line Underground extension, due to be finished in 1998, would pass through the site bringing visitors from central London and Stratford, north of the river, where there would be a huge car park.  <p>  <p>"It's going to have the most modern railway in Britain, with the capability of moving 250,000 people a day."  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Michael Ellison</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>Francis Rossi has come a long way in 30 years. Back when rock was young and dangerous it was a season at Butlins, Minehead. Yesterday, 110 million record sales later, it was the five-star Langham Hilton Hotel, across the road from the home of the new orthodoxy, Broadcasting House, central London. The leader of Status Quo leaned forward, eyes narrowed below creased brow, and announced: "We're not having it." No one could deny it. Rossi's band is not having its latest record played on Radio 1.  <p>  <p>Neither are lots of others, but only Quo the denim-encrusted custodians of the 12-bar boogie, issued a writ for breach of contract yesterday demanding &#163;250,000 in damages. Their case is simple: Radio 1 is a top 40 station and Quo's records get in the charts, so they should be played. The BBC's case is even more simple: it is not a top 40 station.  <p>  <p>Only a few years ago they were all the best of friends. Quo even headlined the Party in the Park, Birmingham, to celebrate Radio 1's 25th anniversary in 1992.  <p>  <p>"Maybe Radio 1 doesn't like our music or the image of the band or maybe they think we're too old," said singer and guitarist Rossi (aged 46). "But these people aren't paid to be taste-makers or trend setters but to reflect tastes."  <p>  <p>These people are Radio 1's controller, young Matthew Bannister (37) and his head of production, young Trevor Dann (44). Each week Dann and a panel of producers select the records which will be played on the station. Those on the A-list will be heard up to 30 times in seven days, the B-list 20 times and the C-list 10 to 15 times. Status Quo, 50 hits down the line and new in the charts this week with Fun Fun Fun at number 24, do not figure on any of these.  <p>  <p>David Walker (51), the band's manager, said: "It has been brought to our attention that Mr Dann has, on behalf of Radio 1 FM, instigated a policy banning any producer from playing our new recordings other than the one play it would be necessary to give on their Sunday afternoon top 40 chart show." Mr Dann was "abusing his power by unilaterally declaring that Status Quo do not suit the demographic of Radio 1's audience." Three years ago, when keyboard player Andrew Bown was only 46, Mr Bannister took over the station charged with producing 'distinctive' broadcasting and lowering the audience's age profile. He promptly lost five million listeners, though the station has recovered slightly to retain 11.2 million.  <p>  <p>Bass player John Edwards, with the band for 10 years, said: "I still listen to Radio 1; just because I'm 42 doesn't mean I'm not allowed to listen to it any more, but there should be more of a mix."  <p>  <p>But the hugely successful 'senior statesmen of the rock and roll industry' are not going to court just to help themselves. "Numerous artists in our business are suffering the same injustice" said Parfitt (47). Radio 1 named some of the other victims as Mr Blobby, Michael Barrymore, Michael Ball, Robson and Jerome and Cliff Richard. "Unlike everyone else, Status Quo don't seem to have noticed that there have been a few changes at Radio 1 in the last couple of years," said a spokeswoman. "We do not slavishly follow the Top 40. Records are chosen on merit."  <p>  <p>This did not satisfy Edwards. "We're very popular. It's not as if we're The Thargs from Transylvania."  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Alan Travis</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>The armed robber who was given legal aid to sue the police for shooting him during a raid insisted in a telephone call to a newspaper yesterday that he had not escaped from prison.  <p>  <p>Stephen Charalambous absconded from Hollesley Bay Colony open prison in Suffolk on Wednesday night. After spending the night in nearby fields he telephoned the London Evening Standard and claimed: "I am not on the run officially. I have taken three days away and am going to hand myself back." The Legal Aid Board suspended any further payments to Charalambous, aged 26. He was initially granted legal aid to enable him to sue the Metropolitan Police Commissioner, Sir Paul Condon, for &#163;250,000 over the incident in which he was shot three times by police marksmen.  <p>  <p>The decision to help him make his claim for compensation for pain and distress sparked a political row. Charalambous who comes from Finsbury Park, London, was shot during a raid on a Post Office van in February 1993 after he ignored demands to drop his gun which turned out to be an imitation. He was sentenced to five years after he admitted conspiracy to robbery and firearms offences.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Ron Davies says Charles not fit to be King</b><br><br><br><b><h2>2 March 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Labour MP apologises for criticising Charles  </h2>
  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Patrick Wintour</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>The shadow Welsh Secretary Ron Davies apologised yesterday for giving an interview in which he said the Prince of Wales was not fit to be king because he talks to vegetables and likes blood sports.  <p>  <p>Mr Davies made the remarks in an interview recorded before news of the royal divorce, but broadcast by BBC Wales last night on St David's Day. In an apology hastily agreed yesterday with the Labour leader, Tony Blair, Mr Davies said: "I made a number of remarks which could be taken as a comment on his personal morality, and his fitness to be king. In view of Labour's support for the monarchy and the offence these comments could cause, I withdraw them and apologise."  <p>  <p>Mr Blair said last night: "Ron Davies has rightly apologised and withdrawn his remarks, and that is the end of the matter."  <p>  <p>The Tory MP Alan Duncan, former chairman of the Conservative backbench constitutional affairs committee, said: "Ron Davies is a shallow politician who demeans the Labour front bench and the process of politics, and if Labour is not to be branded as utterly hypocritical, he should go before the rising of the sun."  <p>  <p>Mr Davies told a BBC audience: "It just seems to me that someone who preaches the virtues that he's supposed to preach doesn't set a very good example.  <p>  <p>"We're told that he spends time talking to trees, flowers and vegetables and so on, and yet we know that he encourages his young sons to go out into the countryside to kill wild animals and birds just for fun, for sport." Speaking on BBC Wales's Welsh Lobby television programme, Mr Davies said he did not think that the Prince was a person who the majority of people in Britain would look up to and respect.  <p>  <p>"You can't divorce from the continuation of the monarchy the individuals who are likely to succeed to the monarchy. You must focus, for example, on Prince Charles and you must ask yourself the question, is this person the fit sort of person to continue the tradition of monarchy, and come to the conclusion: no he isn't."  <p>  <p>According to the party leadership, Mr Davies realised that, following news of the royal divorce, his remarks about the Prince might cause offence. Mr Davies said that in the rest of the interview, he had "stressed respect for the royal family, and the admiration that exists for the Queen and the Queen Mother."  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

  <br>Letter by
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Paul Flynn</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>Ron Davies' remarks were a refreshing antidote to the emetic sycophantic hypocrisy from other MPs on monarchy.  Almost all Tory MPs benefit from the royal favours of knighthoods, invites to garden parties or the prized photograph of a royal handshake. They guzzle greedily from the golden rivers of patronage that corruptly flow from this discredited and doomed institution. Ron's questions echo those of the great majority:  <p>  <p>* Should a future monarch teach his children that animals can be tormented and slaughtered for fun?  <p>  <p>* Is it really essential to provide vast sums of regal 'housing benefit' to maintain one family in seven palaces - one of which has 600 rooms?   <p>  <p>  * Is it right that one person should spend more on her underwear than the entire annual income of a basic pensioner?  <p>  <p>* Why inflict on Harry and William the miserable existence suffered by their father?  <p>  <p>Ex-Tory MP and historian Robert Rhodes James argues that the personality of the present Queen avoided a continuation of Thatcher rule. He believes that when she was in trouble in her own party in 1990 she planned to survive by calling a general election. Neither parliament nor her cabinet could have stopped her. Only the monarch now can halt a PM acting in her or his own interests rather than those of the nation. Would Charles have sufficient strength of character to stop a future Prime Minister who was out of control? Such a task should be entrusted only to an elected head of state. The hereditary principle has no place in a modern democracy.

  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>James Meek</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>It was like a happy dream of bygone days for Mikhail Gorbachev. There was hardly space to blink amid the mass of journalists squeezed into a tiny room as the last Soviet leader held forth.  <p>  <p>He was loving it. He was world statesman, Nobel prize winner, author, film star, the champion of free peoples everywhere. Would he fight Boris Yeltsin in presidential elections?  <p>  <p>"I will," he said. "I will."  <p>  <p>The trick with dreams is not waking up. When someone asked about the opinion polls, which show that the former Soviet president is supported by half of one per cent of voters, he seemed close to regaining consciousness. But not for long.  <p>  <p>"The latest poll I heard said that the basic mass of people will decide who to vote for in the voting booths," he said. "So let's not be in a hurry." Mr Gorbachev was ostensibly calling for all democratic forces to unite under - or at least alongside - him against his old rival, Mr Yeltsin, and the communist leader Gennady Zyuganov. But if the democrats failed to heed his call, he would fight alone.  <p>  <p>Unless there is an extraordinary shift in mood over the next three months, the former Soviet leader, who is 65 today, has as much chance of becoming president as Leonid Brezhnev.  <p>  <p>A survey of the top 100 politicians in the Nezavisimaya Gazeta newspaper yesterday put Mr Gorbachev in joint 92nd place.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Martin Wainwright</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>Pot-bellied Flossie the pig and her four daily kilos of manure were officially branded a nuisance yesterday, ending a rancorous neighbours' dispute and landing her owner with a bill of more than &#163;35,000. Computer engineer Paul Telford, aged 35, looked incredulous as a county court judge awarded &#163;15,600 damages to his retired neighbour Paul Bray, 62.  <p>  <p>The judge ordered him to pay his costs, estimated at more than &#163;10,000, and those of the Brays, who received legal aid only after using all their savings.  <p>  <p>Mr Telford appeared close to tears as his barrister Philip Walling described the penalty as "astonishing compared with the usual &#163;500 to &#163;1,000", but said immediately that he would not move house. Mr Bray and his wife Mary slipped away after speaking briefly of their hopes of "going home to peace and quiet, a good night's sleep and a nice cup of tea". The fate of 15-stone Flossie, a Vietnamese pot-bellied sow with an impressive range of squeals and smells, was meanwhile the talk of the North-east. The recorder Julian Hallam gave Mr Telford two months to move the animal from the scene of the six-year battle between neighbouring luxury bungalows in Tynemouth.  <p>  <p>The recorder dismissed entirely the picture painted in court of Mr Bray as an obsessive and jealous man who was supposed to have hit back with gallons of dumped wallpaper paste and nuisance calls. He said: "Mr and Mrs Bray could not sleep or enjoy normal lives."  <p>  <p>Mrs Bray's graphic account of Flossie's squeals, pungent dung and ability to attract rats and flies convinced the judge, who also decided that Mr Telford had played tapes in the middle of the night of the Brays' late dog Jet barking. This was reinforced by booming pop music, car revving and the use of industrial compressing machinery.  <p>  <p>Mr Telford, a bachelor, said after the judgment: "I will miss Flossie so much, she has been such a good friend. She has been living in my garden for five years now... I was stunned by the judge's decision and I just want to cry."  <p>  <p>Mrs Bray said after the judgment: "I'm just glad it's all over. What I am looking forward to most is getting a good night's sleep and a nice cup of tea."  <p>  <p>Mr Bray said forgivingly: "I hope that within the time limit Flossie can be found somewhere appropriate to live."  <p>  <p>Both sides thanked reporters after the case. Mr Bray said he appreciated the humour of the daily stories and Mr Telford suggested the press might find Flossie a home.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Bus bomb in Jerusalem kills 18</b><br><br><br><b><h2>4 March 1996</h2></b><br><h2>'Martyr' leaves perilous legacy  </h2>
  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Derek Brown</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>Little is known of Islam Mohammed, the young man who blew himself and 18 others to pieces in Jerusalem yesterday. He was 24, according to Palestine Liberation Organisation sources, and lived in the West Bank town of Hebron. He was, apparently, a former student at the prestigious Bir Zeit university, near Ramallah.  <p>  <p>He was a fanatic supporter of the Islamist movement, Hamas; a victim of an organisation seemingly in an advanced state of disintegration. Hamas and its military wing, Izedeen al-Qassam, have long been described as formidably disciplined and committed to their peculiar vision of an Islamic state of Palestine. But there is mounting evidence that at the political and paramilitary levels, the movement is deeply divided.  <p>  <p>The division is not simply between relative moderates and hardline militants. It is a more complex process of factional dissolution. Last week, the Hamas military wing claimed responsibility for the 25 February suicide bombings in Jerusalem and Ashkelon, which killed 27 people. There were two more statements four days later, the first denying responsibility for the slaughter, the second reiterating that responsibility. On 26 February, an American of Palestinian extraction drove his car into a crowded Jerusalem bus queue, killing a woman before being shot dead by Israeli armed civilians. Two days later, Hamas claimed - in Damascus - that he was yet another "martyr" in the anti-Zionist cause.  <p>  <p>The latest Hamas statement carries the group's hubristic hallmarks, claiming credit for the carnage in Jaffa Street on behalf of "the martyred Engineer Yahya Ayyash". He was the movement's master bombmaker, assassinated by Israeli agents in early January.  <p>  <p>"To the government of Israel: with this attack we end our response to the martyring of the Engineer, and we will halt military activities starting this morning in order to give the Israeli government and the inside (the locally-based) Hamas political leadership time to reach a truce through the mediation of the Palestinian Authority within three months," it said. The gloating tone was genuine enough. The only problem is that last week Hamas had already offered a conditional truce, strongly implying that there would be no more militant attacks before 8 March. Yesterday's bomb made that statement bloodily ridiculous.  <p>  <p>The statement also highlighted the divisions in Hamas by ticking off the authors of the earlier truce offer: "We warn those brothers who issued a leaflet... offering Israel a truce, that they must immediately halt issuing any statements because we have a clear programme and we are committed in front of the world to every word we say."  <p>  <p>The boast carries a chilling message for Israel and the Palestinian Authority. It is that Hamas divided could be a lot more difficult to deal with than Hamas united.  <p>  <p>Mahmoud Zahhar, a Hamas leader, yesterday dismissed a threat by Shimon Peres, the Israeli prime minister, to wage all-out war against the group. "If they force us to drink from this cup, they'll drink from it, too," he said.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>David Hudson</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>A devastating suicide bomb has killed 18 people on a Jerusalem bus in a repeat performance of last week's carnage which may wreck the Israel-Palestinian peace process.  <p>  <p>"This is total war," Israel's prime minister, Shimon Peres, declared, announcing a series of draconian measures after emergency consultation with his security chiefs.  <p>  <p>He said the Israeli cabinet had decided "to give this war the highest and most unequivocal priority - all that we have in men, ideas and means..." President Yasser Arafat announced in Gaza that he was outlawing the military wings of Hamas and of the Islamic Jihad organisation.  <p>  <p>The militant Hamas group said one of its "martyrs" blew himself up, on the same bus route, on the same street and at almost the same time as the previous Sunday's attack, which killed 25 people.  <p>  <p>Yesterday's attack was one of equal horror. Bodies and body parts lay strewn among the burnt-out metal shell of the bus. Observant Jews began to pick up the pieces in an attempt to identify the dead. The body of the bomber, found among the wreckage, was, according to one Palestinian security official, from Israeli-controlled Hebron.  <p>  <p>At least four of the dead were Romanian labourers brought in to replace Arabs prevented from crossing to Israel after previous attacks. One witness, shopkeeper Shabtai Levy, described the scene to journalists: "I saw the driver lying over the wheel and a woman without legs behind the driver. I didn't help her off - I was afraid that there was another bomb... There were parts of bodies everywhere. One body went rolling down the street."  <p>  <p>A Hamas statement said: "The cells of the engineer Yahya Ayyash declare our responsibility for the martyr attack... With this attack, we have ended our response to the martydom of The Engineer."  <p>  <p>The Hamas bombmaker known as 'The Engineer' was killed in January by a booby-trapped mobile telephone. His death was almost certainly the work of Israeli agents.  <p>  <p>The bombings are a severe blow to the Labour-led government, which faces a general election at the end of May. Last week's twin suicide bombings in Jerusalem and Ashkelon, which killed 26 people, had wiped out the comfortable lead Mr Peres enjoyed in the polls over his hardline Likud opponents.  <p>  <p>But yesterday, when he visited the scene of the bombing, Mr Peres was angrily jeered.  <p>  <p>After previous attacks, Israeli leaders had always proclaimed defiantly that they would not reward the militants by allowing them to destroy the peace process. This time Mr Peres was non-committal about its future. The tough new security measures include sealing and blowing up of homes of families of suicide bombers, deploying hundreds of additional troops and police in Jerusalem and at bus stops around the country, and the blanket closure of the West Bank and Gaza from Israel.  <p>  <p>Mr Peres also announced gradual implementation of a policy of total separation of Palestinian territory from Israel. Checkpoints would be set up all along the border with the West Bank.  <p>  <p>Mr Peres also made plain that he expects Mr Arafat's Palestinian police to act even more firmly against the militants. More than 200 Hamas members had been arrested after last week's bombing.  <p>  <p>Asked if this might mean Israeli troops going back into Gaza and West Bank towns under Palestinian control, Israel's chief military commander, Lieutenant-General Amnon Shahak, said: "We would much prefer the Palestinian police to do what is necessary. But if they do not do what has to be done, then someone else will have to."  <p>  <p>Mr Peres sidestepped questions on the peace process. "We are honouring the agreement and we will continue to honour it provided the Palestinian Authority honours its side." His cause was not helped yesterday when President Ezer Weizman called for a halt to the peace talks.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Martin Wainwright</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>Like a pirate from Never Never Land, the power of JM Barrie's original Peter Pan has reached out from a theatre stage to throttle recent, saccharine versions - unfortunately scaring a three-year-old witless in the process. The parents of terrified Morris Mitchener, who tried to hide under a seat and his Dad's coat as the tale of child kidnap, plank-walking and the relentless croc unfolded, are taking legal action over his "stress and trauma".  <p>  <p>Born in an era of sanitised Pete 'n' Wendy cartoon escapades, where moppety kids outwit an avuncular Cap'n Hook plus grinning reptile, Morris was not prepared for the real, dark and gripping thing. Although armed with his plastic sword and senior cousin Chloe, who is six, he started sobbing "Get me out, get me out!" within minutes of the curtain going up at the West Yorkshire Playhouse in Leeds.  <p>  <p>"My own grandson now calls me 'Nasty Granny' for taking him to the theatre," said Morris's grandmother Mavis Buck, of Pontefract, whose 61st birthday treat prompted the family outing. "I'm distressed that I took him to see something frightening."  <p>  <p>Morris's parents Amanda and Mark, of East Bergholt, Suffolk, said Morris suffered nightmares about the play. A black crows' feather costume for Pan, pretend-wolves and an enormous crocodile amounted to "an X-rated horror movie for a child of his age". Mrs Mitchener said: "I'd never seen Peter Pan done like this before. Morris was absolutely petrified."  <p>  <p>The family are suing over the Playhouse's lack of advance warning that the play might not be suitable for under-sevens, a message on handbills they only saw 10 minutes before the play. The theatre's house manager, Morag Darby, said that the initial brochure, which tempted the family to spend &#163;85 on tickets last summer, had not included the warning because the production was then at an early stage.  <p>  <p>"It is something we will be looking at more closely in future," she said, adding: "We have had heaps of praise from children and grandchildren, and we tried to remain faithful to the original play."  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Gary Younge</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>Police used CS gas spray for the first time yesterday against a rugby league international who allegedly resisted arrest in Oldham, Greater Manchester.  <p>  <p>Police say that four officers were unable to restrain Barrie McDermott, aged 23, after the Great Britain forward became aggressive outside a nightclub in the early yesterday morning.  <p>  <p>A taxi driver called the police after Mr McDermott, who plays for Leeds, allegedly kicked his car door.  <p>  <p>A police spokesman said: "The CS spray was deployed, which was effective in subduing the man sufficiently for him to be restrained and placed under arrest.  <p>  <p>"Without the spray, it appears that an officer would have been injured." Speaking from his home near the club's ground in Headingley, Leeds, West Yorkshire, Mr McDermott said: "I have been advised by police not to say anything."  <p>  <p>Mr McDermott was suspended for five matches by the Rugby League disciplinary committee while playing for Wigan last year, after he was sent off for headbutting in a reserve game. In December he was dismissed in a game against Warrington for a "mistimed shoulder charge".  <p>  <p>After yesterday's arrest Mr McDermott, who has a glass eye after a childhood accident, was given medical treatment in accordance with procedure and "appears to have suffered no lasting effects from the spray", the spokesman said.  <p>  <p>He spent the night in custody, but has not been charged and was released on bail pending further enquiries.  <p>  <p>The spray was issued to more than 2,000 policemen in 16 forces in England and Wales on Friday for a six-month trial.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Bomb in Tel Aviv kills 12</b><br><br><br><b><h2>5 March 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Peace blown to shreds</h2> <h3>Suicide bombing leaves 12 dead, 100 wounded  </h2>
  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Derek Brown</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>Israel last night tore a gaping hole in its peace deal with the Palestinians, after Islamist fanatics dealt out mass murder for the fourth time in eight days with a suicide bomb in Tel Aviv which killed 12 civilians. At an emergency session, the cabinet decided Israeli troops will be able to return to self-rule areas of the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, controlled by Yasser Arafat's Palestinian Authority.  <p>  <p>The prime minister, Shimon Peres, said Israeli forces would strike at the Islamists anywhere. "We will go to any corner where this terror has taken root," he said.  <p>  <p>The Israeli army forbade Palestinians to leave their towns or villages and banned Israelis from employing Palestinians. The restrictions seem certain to devastate the Palestinian economy.  <p>  <p>The government has acted against a background of popular rage. An angry mob in Tel Aviv last night stoned cars outside the defence ministry. They chanted "Death to the Arabs", and "We don't want peace, we want war". But the Israeli move will gravely undermine the tottering credibility of the Palestinian Authority, and of its beleaguered president.  <p>  <p>"This is a violation of the agreement," said Nabil Abu Rudeinah, spokesman for Mr Arafat. "There are security zones and limits. They should respect the agreement."  <p>  <p>The Israel-PLO accord allows Israeli forces to enter the self-rule areas, only in immediate reaction to attack or threat of it, and only in co-ordination with the Palestinian forces. Now Israel has taken back the right to act unilaterally. It is to set up a new task force under the head of the Shin Bet secret service.  <p>  <p>The deputy head of the Palestinian security forces last night said they had captured the mastermind of three of the last four suicide attacks. Mohammed Abu Wardeh, aged 28, was arrested in the West Bank town of Ramallah. Mr Peres said the suspect could also be connected to yesterday's bombing. And after a meeting with Mr Arafat, political leaders of Hamas appealed to their Qassam military wing to end its suicide bomb campaign. The latest suicide bomb came outside the Dizengoff shopping centre in the heart of Tel Aviv. As well as the 12 dead, about 100 were wounded, some critically.  <p>  <p>On Sunday, after the Jerusalem bus bombing which claimed 19 lives, Mr Peres had declared all-out war on the militants of Hamas.  <p>  <p>Yesterday at 3.56pm - the moment the public clock stopped - a man loitering outside the city's giant shopping centre detonated a powerful bomb. In an instant, the street resembled a battlefield.  <p>  <p>Crumpled corpses were scattered around the junction of Dizengoff and King George Streets, among the busiest of thoroughfares in Israel's busiest city. Debris from shattered shop fronts rained on to mangled cars, as dazed and terrified shoppers ran helter-skelter from the scene. Within minutes the junction was crammed with police and wailing ambulances. And before any semblance of order was restored, Israel's television channels were on hand to broadcast live from the scene. In graphic detail, the cameras picked out bodies, some with their clothes blown off, and all horribly charred.  <p>  <p>There were heartwrenching scenes of weeping children, some wearing fancy dress for the eve of the Purim festival. Israeli radio said the casualties included several children.  <p>  <p>In a further blow, an Israeli soldier died in a clash with guerrillas in Lebanon.  <p>  <p>The Dizengoff blast raised the death toll in the past eight days to more than 60, including the suicide bombers. With evidence mounting that the military wing of Hamas is out of control, almost certainly fragmented into small, ruthless cells, the Israeli government is facing the disintegration of the peace process on which its future is staked.  <p>  <p>Israel yesterday suspended negotiations with Syria as the US government called for a united effort by Israel and Arabs to shut down terrorist groups. The Foreign Secretary, Malcolm Rifkind, said he condemned "this sick act of violence and those who planned and executed it".  <p>  <p>As the 29 May election nears, many observers believe the government's plight to be terminal. Since the first of the latest spate of Hamas bombings Mr Peres and the government have promised draconian measures. They have closed the borders with the Palestinian territories, destroyed the homes of two bombers, imposed curfews, and arrested dozens of men. Palestinian security forces have detained some 350 suspected Islamist activists.  <p>  <p>None of it has worked. At least two of the suicide bombers came from Hebron, still under Israeli control. Yesterday's killer was said in a Hamas claim of responsibility to be Salah Abdel-Rahim Ishaq, aged 24, from Ramallah.   <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

  <br>Commentary by
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Martin Woollacott</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>The time has come again, as it did with Yitzhak Rabin's death, for a reckoning in Israel. But it is a hard one to make. The people are crying out for action, for change, for revenge, for a solution. The kind of solution they crave, however, does not exist.  <p>  <p>They want to see Hamas destroyed, either by Israeli forces or by Arafat. They want Arafat to 'deliver' with arrests, patrols, battles in the streets. And they want a change of dramatic proportions in the minds of Arabs. They want tears to match their own. They ask where are the peace rallies in the West Bank, where the peace ribbons? Why this glum silence, neither approbation nor repudiation?  <p>  <p>Could this be the moment when because what is called 'peace' is so desperately unsatisfactory, there will be a return to what is called 'war'? A Likud victory in the elections in May, with the Likud leader, Benjamin Netanyahu, telling the Palestinians, as he has promised, 'Forget about a state'? Israeli military incursions into the supposedly autonomous territories? A wall of wire and fixed-fire machine-guns between Israelis and Palestinians? The fall of Arafat, or his becoming a complete Israeli puppet? The transformation of Hamas from a minority movement into the main resistance to the Israelis? These are disastrous possibilities, and most Israelis, in their hearts, know it. Only a month ago, polls showed 59 per cent in favour of the Oslo accords. Have the bombs changed that or only overlaid it?  <p>  <p>Israelis are an emotional people. They are also a lonely people, preoccupied with themselves. They ask too much of the world they helped create. Arafat has not been brave enough to tackle Hamas head-on - but it is because he is a wily procrastinator that he has survived and Israel has been able to deal with him. The efficient PLO military chiefs who could have taken the right decisions are no longer with us: Israel killed them years ago, an illustration of the truism that what you need in peace you often destroy in war.  <p>  <p>The schisms within Hamas which make it so difficult to get the bombers may be, in part, a product of Israeli delays and confusions. Israel half wanted to see Hamas choose a political path, to have it come in from the cold, and half wanted to extirpate it. Not much was on offer politically, though, and what was on offer was accompanied by continuing military action, as with the assassination of Hamas's chief bomb maker. That was a recipe for fragmentation. It is speculation, but it may well have contributed to the disunity in the Hamas ranks which seems to be one of the reasons for this terrible campaign.  <p>  <p>In July last year when another Hamas suicide bomber struck in Tel Aviv, Rabin told Israelis that the tragedy was one "requiring greater adherence to the course upon which we have embarked, made progress, and will continue: the resolution of the conflict between us and the Palestinians". But there is a tariff in bombs and lives, a point at which deaths pass the point where they can be counted up as the 'price for peace'. The mood of Israelis, so purged and elevated by Rabin's assassination, has shifted again. There must be action. The chances are that it will be less than wholly effective. There must also be reflection before the election, for the danger is that, in finding one kind of price too high to pay, Israelis will blunder into paying another, which will be higher still.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>EU Commission report highlights ageing population in Europe</b><br><br><br><b><h2>5 March 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Europe faces a grey future  </h2>
  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Stephen Bates</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>The European Commission yesterday unveiled a striking picture of what Europe will be like in 30 years, with an ageing population and migration southwards towards the sun.  <p>  <p>The report projects an extra 37 million in the number of people aged over 60 - an increase of nearly 50 per cent. There will be 113.5 million pensioners in the European Union, nearly a third of the population.  <p>  <p>Those of working age, between 20 and 59, will shrink by 13 million and there will be nearly 10 million fewer children and teenagers, representing an 11 per cent decline in the numbers under the age of 20.  <p>  <p>The survey makes clear that some countries will suffer enormous demographic and social pressures as a result of the changing balance of their populations.  <p>  <p>Ireland will see a 67 per cent increase in its retired population and a 25 per cent drop among the young, while Germany will have to cope with a 51 per cent rise in its over-60s, with a 13.5 per cent drop in its working age population and a 12 per cent decline in the number of its young people. The United Kingdom will have a 43.6 per cent increase in the population aged over 60 between now and 2025, a 2.8 per cent decline in the working population and an 8.2 per cent drop in the under-20s.  <p>  <p>Statisticians have known for some time that the population is ageing, but the latest figures show more starkly how great the shift in the balance of the population will be by 2025 - and what the consequence will be for social welfare provision.  <p>  <p>The 32-page report by the European Commission's statistical office warns: "The labour market will have to adapt to a different kind of demand, principally in the fields of education, housing, health, transport and leisure.  <p>  <p>"This will have to be done precisely at a time when those producing the resources needed by the economy are steadily decreasing in numbers and when the future generations (who will have to be highly educated and trained if growth is to be achieved) will also be fewer and fewer in number... All aspects of social and family life will thus be dominated by the needs of older people. What concessions will the elderly be prepared to make to the younger generations and how will the latter finance pensions? "There can be no doubt that the principle of solidarity between generations will emerge as a key factor in the adjustments which will have to be made." But the report warns that changing social patterns, including the decline of the family unit, may make it much more difficult to accommodate the generational shift.  <p>  <p>It says: "Not only are certain social protection systems based on the traditional concept of the family model... but some of them also presume the provision of family support for the very old. Given the context of family changes, the possibility for families to assume such support could necessitate certain adjustments to the labour market and the organisation of social protection."  <p>  <p>The report predicts that increasing numbers will head for the southern coastal districts of Europe because of their better climate and associated industrial development.  <p>  <p>It also argues that, while depopulation of city centres is likely to continue, the suburbs will grow and populations will be concentrated along the traffic corridors linking major cities.  <p>  <p>Across Europe, Scandinavia has seen an upturn in fertility levels and increases in birth rates in the last 10 years. The central EU countries, including the UK, the Low Countries and France, have seen levels of fertility decline over the last 20 years below what is needed to maintain population levels.  <p>  <p>Fertility rates in Germany and Austria - where the post-war baby boom took place earlier than elsewhere - have also been very low. Southern Europe and Ireland have seen a sudden drop in fertility levels and consequently are likely to have the largest disproportions in their elderly and young populations.  <p>  <p>Although the decline in the young population might lead to some savings in education and welfare systems, these are likely to be outweighed by increasing costs associated with the elderly. "The fall in the number of children in the past has not automatically produced an equivalent fall in per capita expenditure on child care and education."  <p>  <p>To counter the decline in the indigenous population, the report estimates that net immigration into EU member states would have to rise from its current level of half a million a year to as much as seven million. The report argues that the scope for couples to decide the spacing and number of their offspring freely and independently has led to a drop in fertility. Social and medical progress has permitted a longer life span in better health. The report claims other surveys show Europeans now want more children than they actually have.  <p>  <p>It adds: "Whereas life expectancy was initially achieved by cutting infant mortality, further improvements are now principally due to falling mortality at advanced ages: death is occurring later and later. Nowadays children who have reached their first birthday are unlikely to die before the age of 60." Of the over-80s it says: "Thirty years from now, there will be two or three times as many people in this age category as there are now, bringing with it a proportional increase in the specific infrastructure needed to cope with their particular requirements."  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>EU Commission report  highlights ageing population in Europe</b><br><br><br><b><h2>6 March 1996</h2></b><br><h2>The  greying of Europe</h2>
<h3>An ageing continent may need immigration</h3>    <br><b>Leading article</b><br><br>        <p>A spectre is haunting Europe. But it is certainly not the spectre of communism that Marx and  Engels foresaw in the 19th century. The shadow over today's Europe is the greying of the  indigenous population, and the pressures which this remorseless demographic trend will  inevitably place upon the labour market and welfare systems of the 21st century. Academics and  policy-makers have been aware of the ageing trend for many years; it underlies, for example,  much of the pensions debate of the last decade. But it sometimes takes a piece of good timing  to bring the point home to a wider audience. Such a moment may have occurred this week with the  publication by the European Commission's statistical department of a report setting out the  likely scale and speed of the ageing process. It paints a remarkable picture which no  government can afford to ignore. <p> <p>The fundamental demographic change facing almost all  nations in Europe is the inexorable increase in adult life expectancy brought about by the  absence of war and the improvement of public health and welfare. According to the Commission,  the number of Europeans aged over 60 is set to double by 2025. By that date, there will be  113.5 million over-60s in the European Union, who will make up nearly a third of the total  population. Their demands for welfare and health services, pensions and forms of employment  will place enormous demands upon the traditional 'working' population. Yet at the same time  both the 'working' population and the under-20s will be in absolute and relative decline. This  will happen at just the moment when society needs an increase in economic activity to support  the growing numbers of the elderly. The consequences in terms both of absolute welfare  provision and of its balance between the generations are potentially vast. No nation in Europe  will be spared the impact. Britain's elderly will increase by 43.6 per cent by 2025 while our  working population will decline by 2.8 per cent and the young (the under-20s) will fall by 8.2  per cent. <p>  <p>Some of our partners face even more dramatic changes, with consequences at which in  some cases it is only possible to guess. Ireland, for example, faces the prospect of a  two-thirds increase in the elderly and a 25 per cent drop in the young. Germany, motor of the  European project and examplar of the late 20th century European welfare state, will have to  cope with a 51 per cent rise in the over-60s, a 13.5 per cent fall in its working age  population and a drop of 12 per cent in its under-20s. The political and cultural effects, not  least in terms of grey voter power, could be prodigious. All societies will have to negotiate  the relationship between the generations in new ways. <p> <p>In any event, the changes will  mean steadily more spending on pensions, more on health care for the elderly, on residential  homes and other forms of social service. That may come from taxation or from private insurance,  but it will have to come from somewhere. There could be some compensation from less spending on  education and welfare for the young. But the absolutely essential consequence, the societal  shift in the balance between wealth producers and wealth consumers, will mark every society.  One effect must be to reopen the immigration debate; Europeans must decide whether to make good  the imbalance by allowing up to seven million economically active migrants to enter the EU.  Compared with matters such as these, the arguments in the forthcoming inter-governmental  conference seem like trivial squabbles. <p> <p> <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr> <td  width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td  width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td  width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td  width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr> <td align=left  valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td> <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A  HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td> <td align=right  valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td> </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Caroline Beale freed from US jail</b><br><br><br><b><h2>5 March 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Baby killer freed in US court deal</h2><h3>Mother returning to Britain after plea bargain  </h3>  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Mark Tran</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>Caroline Beale, the woman accused of murdering her newborn baby in a New York hotel room, will return to Britain this week after striking a deal with the US prosecuting authorities.  <p>  <p>Yesterday she was sentenced to eight months in prison - which she has already served - after pleading guilty to second degree manslaughter. The rest of her sentence comprises five years' probation and one year of psychiatric care. Until yesterday, she had consistently maintained that the child was stillborn.  <p>  <p>Ms Beale, aged 31, shook uncontrollably as she took her seat in front of the judge, and answered his questions in a barely audible whisper. The prosecuting attorney, Marjory Fisher, said the case was one of the most tragic in her 13 years as a prosecutor. Citing a psychiatric report, she said Ms Beale, although aware of her action, had suffered from a pre-existing condition - depression - and would need continuing psychiatric therapy and medication.  <p>  <p>Ms Beale is due to fly back on Friday with her parents, and will immediately start psychiatric treatment at the Maudsley hospital in south London. A former Department of Health employee from Chingford, Essex, Ms Beale was arrested in September 1994 at Kennedy Airport, New York, when she, her boyfriend, Paul Faraway, and two of his brothers were about to board a flight to London. The body of her 8lb daughter was concealed beneath her coat.  <p>  <p>She had given birth alone in the bath of a Manhattan hotel room the previous night after hiding her pregnancy from her family, friends and even Mr Faraway, her live-in lover of 12 years.  <p>  <p>Ms Beale and Mr Faraway had taken a holiday in the US to help them recover from the death of a close friend, Alison Taylor, who had desperately wanted children of her own. Ms Taylor had been forced to have her ovaries removed in an attempt to stop the progress of cancer, shortly before Ms Beale became aware she was pregnant. Her death was cited as central to Ms Beale's subsequent depression and psychosis.  <p>  <p>After arrest, Ms Beale was charged with second degree murder - which carries a sentence of between 15 years and life imprisonment - and was sent to New York's Rikers Island prison.  <p>  <p>Eight months later she was granted bail. Her parents, who were by their daughter's side in her last few court appearances, put up their &#163;100,000 London home as part of the bail arrangement.  <p>  <p>After the verdict, Miss Beale declined to answer reporters, except to say that she intended to "learn to speak properly".  <p>  <p>Peter Beale, her father, described the prosecution as "cruel and medieval", while her mother, Daphne, added: "I pity any American girl that gets into this situation because American laws are medieval and should be changed."   <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

 <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Mark Tran</b><br><br>      <p> <p>Caroline Beale, who pleaded guilty to the manslaughter of her newborn baby, is making  arrangements for the body to be exhumed from a pauper's grave and cremated, and for the ashes  to be taken to England for a church service. Ms Beale and her parents were stunned to learn  that the girl had already been buried. They thought the corpse was still being held at the  Queens County Mortuary in New York until Ms Beale's case was resolved. <p>  <p>An official said the  body was sent for burial because it was unclaimed. "We were holding it for 14 months," said a  spokeswoman. The body was buried in a pauper's grave at Potters Field, near Riker's Island jail  where Ms Beale spent eight months. <p> <p>Ms Beale, aged 31, who is due to fly to England  today, found out about the burial on Tuesday when she and her parents were at the British  consulate to arrange for the body to be taken to England. "She was shaken," said British consul  Michael Dwyer, "but not unduly distressed." <p> <p>In pleading guilty to manslaughter on Monday  after a plea bargain, Ms Beale avoided a painful trial. She will be under probation for  five years and subject to psychiatric care. Ms Beale, who concealed her pregnancy from family  and friends, was arrested at Kennedy Airport 18 months ago as she tried to smuggle the body on  to a flight to England. <p> <p> <p> <p> <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td  width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td  width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td  width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td  width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE  height=30 width=400 border=0><tr> <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A  HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td> <td  align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td> <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Caroline Beale freed from US jail</b><br><br><br><b><h2>9 March 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Jailed mother back home</h2><h3>Legal row rages as woman who tried to smuggle her dead baby out of US enters hospital in Britain  </h3>  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Eleanor Carty</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>Caroline Beale, the British woman who tried to smuggle her dead baby on a flight from New York, last night spent her first night in intensive psychiatric care at Maudsley hospital, south London, after returning from the United States. But the row over her treatment by the US legal system continued.  <p>  <p>Doctors at the Maudsley said she would remain there for at least two weeks, but they were optimistic that she would make a complete recovery from the psychosis that led her to kill her child. Her parents, Peter and Daphne, from Chingford, Essex, will not be able to see her for the time being. Ms Beale, aged 32, was said to be exhausted but relieved to be home after striking a deal with the US authorities. In return for her admitting manslaughter of her baby, Olivia Ann, New York State Supreme Court Judge Robert Hanophy sentenced her to eight months' jail - which she had already served on remand in Riker's Island prison - five years' probation and psychiatric care in Britain for at least a year.  <p>  <p>But the row over her treatment resurfaced at a press conference at the Maudsley yesterday when her new psychiatrist advised against "crowing" over the British legal system. During sentencing on Thursday, the American judge had criticised her father, Peter Beale, for calling the US justice sytem "barbaric and uncivilised" and had called Britain's system, which allows a manslaughter charge for infanticide, primitive.  <p>  <p>Ms Beale's psychiatrist, Professor John Gunn, said: "We in this country have nothing to be crowing about and shouting across the Atlantic about how things are and should be."  <p>  <p>A country that forced jailed pregnant women to give birth in chains had "nothing to tell other countries about the treatment of prisoners". Ms Beale's New York attorney, Michael Dowd, said yesterday there was insufficient evidence to prove the baby was born alive. Ms Beale might have been acquitted of murder at trial, but he persuaded her to admit manslaughter to ensure she could return home.  <p>  <p>He said he was ashamed of the American legal system. "I'm ashamed of our ignorance but I don't think I'm alone. It does the best it can with the laws it has.  <p>  <p>"The best thing I have seen in the past 18 months was the look on her face as the wheels touched the ground in London, knowing she was home," Mr Dowd said. "That was very special to witness."  <p>  <p>Professor Channi Kumar, who had prepared a psychiatric report for her defence, said: "If she is given privacy, she has a very good chance of putting things together. It's going to be difficult but she has shown great resources and I am very optimistic."  <p>  <p>Her time in prison had left her with a condition similar to post-traumatic stress disorder and she still had nightmares. "I visited Riker's myself and I had nightmares about it afterwards," Prof Kumar said. He will oversee Ms Beale's treatment when she is discharged from hospital.

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Martin Wainwright</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>The most ambitious attempt to bring art to the people of Britain was launched last night with a skyburst of fireworks and an unscheduled hand from football's Premier League.  <p>  <p>Hundreds of Manchester United and Newcastle supporters joined crowds on the banks of the river Tyne before their match to mark the start of the Year of the Visual Arts, which hopes to crack the snobbery barrier between galleries and the public.  <p>  <p>"This is just the kind of coincidence we need," said Alan Sykes of Northern Sights, which is co-ordinating the &#163;70m extravaganza on behalf of the Arts Council. "We want to show the latest developments in visual art and the artists to everyone."  <p>  <p>The football fans were treated to an event by the French theatre group Katertone, who surrounded Earl Grey's statue with a fiery recreation of an engineering forge and blast furnace.  <p>  <p>The region won the right to host the year, the latest in the Arts Council's Millennium 2000 project, which saw Manchester produce the 1994 Year of Drama and Swansea and South Wales manage last year's Year of Literature. Mr Sykes said: "This... will have a lasting impact. The building programme alone, which will give the region six new art galleries, is the biggest capital investment in the visual arts to date."  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

  <br><br>      <p>A key defendant at the first jury trial in the Whitewater case, who is a former business partner of President Clinton, promised yesterday to "kick the hell out of these Republican prosecutors".  <p>  <p>As jury selection began for the trial, James McDougal, a former savings and loan executive, arrived at the courthouse in Little Rock, Arkansas, in a combative mood. "This is gonna be one of the best days of my life. We're gonna kick the hell out of these Republican prosecutors," he told reporters. Mr McDougal, his former wife Susan McDougal and Jim Guy Tucker, the governor of Arkansas, are charged with loan fraud in transactions during the 1980s stemming from the failure of Madison Guaranty, an Arkansas savings and loan bank. Mr Tucker succeeded Mr Clinton as governor and the McDougals were partners with the Clintons in the failed Whitewater property venture. Mr Clinton has been subpoenaed to testify for the defence.  <p>  <p>All three defendants say they are victims of politically motivated efforts to damage President Clinton.

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Guardian ICM poll says Charles to blame for his divorce</b><br><br><br><b><h2>6 March 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Hostile public turns against Charles role  </h2>
  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Martin Linton</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>The Prince of Wales appears to be losing the battle for public sympathy as he negotiates the terms of his divorce. An ICM poll* for the Guardian shows that on average people put 59 per cent of the blame on the prince and only 37 per cent on the princess. It also shows the public would be hostile to the idea of Prince Charles marrying Camilla Parker Bowles after his divorce.  <p>  <p>Asked whether he should still become king if he gets remarried to Mrs Parker Bowles, a total of 44 per cent say he should and 45 per cent say he should not. Excluding people with no opinion, fractionally more than half - 50.05 per cent - believe he should not succeed his mother in those circumstances. Over the past few years polls have consistently shown that, although people are more likely to blame Charles for the break-up of his marriage, most of them believe he should still become king.  <p>  <p>A majority of four-to-one or three-to-one holds the view the throne should pass to him and should not jump a generation to Prince William. But today's poll suggests remarriage could forfeit that support.  <p>  <p>In the Commons yesterday Ron Davies, shadow Welsh Secretary, who apologised last week for saying Prince Charles was not fit to be king, was telling colleagues that he has been inundated with mail from the public, running 10 to one in his favour.  <p>  <p>Welsh Labour MPs were pointing to the results of a survey in Newport and Cardiff shopping centres on Saturday showing five-to-one backing for Mr Davies's remarks. Of the 3,657 quizzed in three hours, 2,597 said the prince was not fit to be king and only 478 said he was.  <p>  <p>The Press Association conducted a straw poll among Labour backbenchers which found that 65 wanted an open debate within the party on the future of a hereditary monarchy and 35 did not.  <p>  <p>A dozen MPs were critical of party leader Tony Blair for obliging Ron Davies to apologise for his comments and some of them described it as a "gagging". It emerged at Westminster that Michael Heseltine, the Deputy Prime Minister, is intending to tell MPs in the Commons, if asked, that the Government will not set aside time for a debate on the future of the royals.   <p>  Only 17 per cent think Mrs Parker Bowles should be recognised as queen if she marries Charles, while 76 per cent do not. The poll also tries to gauge public opinion on the sensitive question of whether Prince Charles, if he were remarried, should still take the hereditary title of head of the Church of England. A quarter say that if he is remarried before he succeeds to the throne he should be both king and head of the Church, 19 per cent say he should be king but not head of the Church, the rest say he should not be king.  <p>  <p>* ICM interviewed a random sample of 1,200 adults aged 18+ by telephone between 2 and 4 March 1996. Interviews were conducted throughout the country and the results have been weighted to the profile of all adults.   <p>  <p><b>Royal poll</b><br>    <p>Now that Charles and Diana are getting divorced, how would you apportion blame between the two in percentage terms?    <br>Charles 59    <br>Diana 37<p>    <br>If Charles gets remarried to Camilla Parker-Bowles, should he...<br> still become king and head of the Church of England 25    <br>still become king but not head of the Church 19    <br>not become king 45    <br>don't know 11<p>    <br>If Charles marries Camilla and succeeds to the throne, should she be recognised as queen?    <br>Yes 17    <br>No 76    <br>Don't know 7  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Tension grows between  China and Taiwan over missile tests</b><br><br><br><b><h2>6 March 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Taiwan  faces virtual blockade</h2><h3>Chinese plan for offshore missile tests steps up tension in  eight-month war of nerves  </h3> <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Andrew Higgins</b><br><br>      <p> <p>China yesterday declared what amounts to a partial blockade of Taiwan, announcing new  missile tests and warning ships and aircraft to stay away from danger zones near the island's  two main ports. <p> <p>It was the most serious escalation yet in an eight-month war of nerves  across the Taiwan Strait and drew an immediate threat of retaliation by Taipei against any  penetration of its waters and condemnation from the United States, Japan and other governments.  <p> <p>The new round of sabre-rattling by the People's Liberation Army (PLA), due to start on  Friday and continue for a week, will hurl missiles into the sea off Keelung and Kaohsiung,  ports through which flows nearly three-quarters of Taiwan's trade. <p> <p>Taiwan's defence  minister, Zhang Chung-ling, warned "we will strike back immediately" if any of the test rockets  land inside the island's 12-mile territorial waters. He told legislators Taiwan has a range of  missiles with which to hit back. A Taiwanese newspaper reported yesterday that Taipei had  obtained Patriot and anti-missile systems from the US and was setting up six batteries on the  main island and on Penghu island. <p> <p>China's show of force intensifies a bellicose campaign  to undermine support for Taiwan's president, Lee Teng-hui, now campaigning for a presidential  election on 23 March, the first poll of its kind in the Chinese-speaking world. Yesterday's  news hammered Taiwan's currency and jittery stock exchange, forcing heavy intervention by a  newly established "stabilisation" fund. <p> <p>"They are trying to push us to the limit, to  find out the bottom line of Taiwan and the bottom line of the United States," said Andrew Yang,  secretary-general of the Chinese Council of Advanced Policy Studies, a think-tank close to the  Taiwanese military. "This is a pseudo-economic blockade that will impose a tremendous handicap  on shipping and airlines." <p>  <p>In a state of the nation address yesterday in Beijing before the  annual session of China's rubber-stamp legislature, the National People's Congress, Li Peng,  the prime minister, advised against any attempt "in word or action" by foreign governments to  block the reunification of China. "The Chinese government and people are determined and  able to safeguard the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the motherland and would never  allow the secession of Taiwan." <p> <p>The PLA, according to most military experts, does not  have the airborne or sealift capability to launch a successful invasion of Taiwan. But the new  tests, apparently part of a huge military exercise expected to involve more than 150,000  Chinese troops, seem designed to probe Taiwan's vulnerability to an economic blockade. Taiwan  imports some 300,000 barrels of oil a week, much of it through sea lanes. <p> <p>The  co-ordinates of two 'test boxes' announced by Xinhua News Agency extend perilously close to  Taiwan - some 20 miles from Keelung in the north and 30 miles from Kaohsiung in the south. A  misfire could send a rocket into inhabited areas. <p> <p>"I think it is a very bad mistake on  their part to put the impact area so near to Taiwan," the US defence secretary, William Perry,  said in Washington, "I deplore that decision and I will express my concern to them." Washington  sent a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, the USS Nimitz, and four escort ships through the  Taiwan Strait in December but the Clinton administration faces mounting pressure for bolder  displays of US muscle. Congress wants a policy of 'strategic ambiguity' replaced with an  explicit pledge to defend Taiwan against any mainland military action. <p> <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td  width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td  width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td  width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td  width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr> <td  align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td> <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A  HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td> <td align=right  valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td> </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Michael Ellison</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>Trevor Nunn, the millionaire director of the musicals 'Cats' and 'Les Miserables', will be named today as the new director of the National Theatre. Mr Nunn, the former artistic director of the Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC), will become the fourth man to take charge of the National, on the south bank of the Thames, in its 34 years. He will follow Laurence Olivier, Peter Hall and Richard Eyre.  <p>  <p>Stephen Daldry of the Royal Court, Sam Mendes of the Donmar Warehouse, and Jude Kelly of the West Yorkshire Playhouse had been considered among the frontrunners for a job no one was prepared to say they wanted. All are much younger than Mr Nunn, aged 56, who will take over from Mr Eyre in 18 months. Indeed, Mr Nunn is four years older than Mr Eyre. "You don't give the National to some young thruster who wants to enhance his career," one observer said last night.  <p>  <p>"But Eyre is a class act and a very hard one to follow, in critical terms and at the box office. The big challenge for Nunn is to show he can still command a big classical stage, something he hasn't done since the early 1980s."  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Michael J Ellison</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>Stephen Daldry, Royal Court:<br> "Head of the National Theatre is a tremendously difficult job. It has to be an inclusive, not an exclusive organisation, and a variety of tastes have to be reflected in the programming. It must be a shop window, but it must also enable new talent to emerge - in that sense it's got to be a manufacturing business. The director should back his instincts to find the classic works of tomorrow, and make sure the theatre is reinvented for the next generation."  <p>  <p>Adrian Noble, RSC:<br> "The National has to be very involved in developing new writing and drama, as well as the classics, but it should avoid becoming a classical theatre. It's important that the many different strands of British theatre find a voice at the NT, but not in a rigid way. It can't operate to a pre-ordained brief - 15 per cent new writing, 25 per cent populist etc - nor can it proceed by committee. It has to reflect the artistic passions of the man at the helm. There are very few directors who've created entirely new forms of theatre as Trevor Nunn has. His talents are both populist and scholarly."  <p>  <p>Jude Kelly, West Yorkshire Playhouse:<br> "His status will allow the National to continue to attract top artists, which in turn gives him scope to bring on new writers and performers. It's nice to think someone like Trevor is willing to come back into public service."  <p>  <p>Ruth Mackenzie, Nottingham Playhouse:<br> "For the job of artistic director at the National, you should first be brilliant - Trevor Nunn shouldn't find that difficult. Second, be national - something Richard Eyre has been exceptional at. The National has to reach all sorts of audiences. It should be a place where people of all ages and classes can see outstanding theatre. It's important that the NT is full of children and that's a real challenge."  <p>  <p>Rose Fenton , LIFT:<br> "He should bring in more international directors and artists. He should also make more of a link between the National Theatre and the Studio, which is a fantastic resource - as the Royal Court has realised."  <p>  <p>Jenny Topper, Hampstead Theatre:<br> "He has the experience to run a large organisation, and he's one of the best directors we have. There has been speculation about his interest in new writers, but even if he doesn't take an interest he'll appoint someone who will - Howard Davies did this very successfully for him at the RSC."  <p>  <p>Jatinder Verma, Tara Arts:<br> "Trevor Nunn is one of the few directors on record about the need for multi-cultural productions in Britain. He must recognise social changes and reflect them in the theatre so the NT is national in the truest sense - geographically and ethnically."  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Trevor Nunn appointed  as director of National Theatre</b><br><br><br><b><h2>7 March 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Stand and  deliver</h2><h3>As Trevor Nunn took to the stand to defend his new appointment as director of  the National Theatre, questions of age and commitment came thick and fast  </h3> <br>By 
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Michael J Ellison</b><br><br>      <p> <p>Trevor is teeming and tingling, but that's only to be expected at his age. Another  worrying sign is that he has started quoting from Richard II and is questioning his own sanity.  Well, wouldn't any musicals-made millionaire theatre director who was on the verge of giving it  all up for a pittance of &#163;90,000 a year? Trevor Nunn has been in an institution before,  though he has just tasted a delicious period of freedom roaming the world. But the question of  age persists and even he agrees he should be committed. <p> <p>Sane or otherwise, the man who  looks like Benny from Abba auditioning for the part of a Shakespearean king in blue denims and  brown loafers, has 18 months before he goes back inside. <p> <p>Way before care in the  community was thought of, never mind discredited, he was banged up in the Royal Shakespeare  Company, although he did go on the run a few times. Towards the end of next year he goes back  inside for another stretch, this time in the National Theatre on the south bank of the Thames.  <p> <p>His case was heard yesterday in front of a jury made up mostly of theatre critics of  advanced years. "I'm breathless, not because of my very great age but because I'm excited," he  said folding his hands and fidgeting in a minimalist metal and black plastic seat. <p> <p>"It's  all been rather a pity. I've always been able to be rather discreet about my age. People used  to ask 'What are you going to do when your 40th birthday comes up?' " <p> <p>Anyway, Nunn knows  all about ageism, having tackled it from the other end of the prejudice scale. When he was a  28-year-old slip of a thing at the RSC he had to enthuse actors twice his age and convince  directors that he was a serious proposition. A series of Andrew Lloyd Webber musicals later  they had their answer. <p> <p>And age does have its advantages. For one thing, there's  experience, Nunn's done this sort of thing before, to say nothing of his work in television,  the movies, opera and the West End. After three marriages this "family man by instinct" has  life in perspective, knows it is time to focus on one big task. <p> <p>Then there was the  second item on the charge sheet: commitment. As in, did the globe-trotting director of Sir  Andrew's finest have enough of it to do justice to a five-year contract as the National  Theatre's director? Nunn's defence counsel was having, well, none of that. <p> <p>"I find the  implication of your remark mildly offensive," said the dashing Richard Eyre, bristling above  his black polo-neck. Eyre should know about these things as he will have given his all to the  job by the time he hands over to Trevor after 10 years. It's a little unfair to charge a man  before he's walked out into the street. The most useful adage Brecht ever gave to the theatre  was 'The proof of the pudding is in the eating.'" <p> <p>Shakespeare (of course) and George  Bernard Shaw were the others witnesses subpoenaed from literature in Nunn's defence. Then there  was the chairman of the National's board, Sir Christopher Hogg, erect, debonair, coldly polite,  unforthcoming and deaf to hostile questions. The court wanted to know how old Trevor had got  mixed up in all this. A younger man like Stephen Daldry from the Royal Court or Sam Mendes from  the Donmar Warehouse might have taken the rap. But dark forces had intervened. "I was  approached a few weeks ago and urged to allow myself to become a candidate for this position,"  said Nunn. "I'm disinclined to say who they were. There were several who came from different  aspects of the profession." <p> <p>This, and a promise to mix the esoteric and the populist,  earned him his 18-month suspended sentence reading plays and going to the theatre. "It's  entirely possible that I'm not sufficiently in touch," he confessed.

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Michael Ellison</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>A young couple as in extremely young - engage in tender embrace on a bed surrounded by teddy bears and with a Beastie Boys poster in the background. "Know what I want to do? What do I want to do?" the boy in boxer shorts asks the girl in bra and knickers.  She need hardly answer, but she does. So they do. And now the British Board of Film Classification, Britain's movie censors, have also answered in the affirmative.  <p>  <p>Larry Clark's film 'Kids' - moral tale for our times or exploitation at its worst, depending on your point of view - has been given an 18 certificate and will be shown in 60 cinemas across Britain from May.  <p>  <p>Clark last night accepted that two scenes taking less than a minute could be cut to clear his film, which makes Danny Boyle's film, 'Trainspotting', seem like an early 1970s episode of 'Blue Peter'.  The BBFC has given the film a certificate after four months of consideration.  <p>  <p>'Kids' is set among a group of young people in New York with nothing on their minds but sex and drugs.  The actors appear very young and tell the story in documentary style of a boy who likes to have sex with virgins because they have "no diseases". He turns out to be HIV positive.  <p>  <p>The board's director, James Ferman, said the $3m movie was one of the most painful he has seen during his 21 years in the job. The New York Daily News said the sex lives of the teenagers in Clark's drugs-driven Manhattan tale made "jack rabbits look lazy".  <p>  <p>Mr Ferman said: "The New York Times called this a 'wake-up' call to parents. It is about the fact that totally unsupervised kids are running wild, leading a promiscuous lifestyle. The result is that they just destroy themselves. It is one of the most painful films I have seen." Liz Wrenn, managing director of Electric films, the British distributor, said: "I think it's very interesting and the kids stayed in my mind. It wasn't shocking, it was just a bit upsetting and you feel very sorry for them.  <p>  <p>"It's just too believable to be true, it made a very powerful picture." She added: "I'd like to show it to a group of 18-year-olds and their parents in separate screens at the same time. The dynamic between the two groups would be very different. Moral outrage? No, it's just a warning."   <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Martin Wainwright</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>Scientists are poised to confirm the discovery of the first new British mammal for 50 years, once problems with an empty museum cabinet and a headless corpse have been sorted out.  <p>  <p>Radar frequency analysis and a study of breeding habits provide overwhelming evidence that pipistrelle or common bats are two separate species, with similar appearance disguising very different habits.  Examples of the two types were put on fluttering show in a Yorkshire forest yesterday, as mammal specialists celebrated their first addition to the British list since Brandt's bat was shown to be different from the whiskered bat in the early 1950s.  <p>  <p>"This is perhaps even more exciting than that discovery," said John Altringham, a bat specialist at Leeds University, "as the research which separated Brandt's and the whiskered was carried out in Germany. This time, we've done it ourselves."  <p>  <p>The breakthrough was made by Gareth Jones of Bristol University, currently pursuing bats in Malaysia, who discovered that two distinct radar frequencies were used by individual pipistrelles. Most specimens tracked in north Lancashire carried out echo-location on the 55 kilohertz channel, while the majority of Yorkshire bats in Dalby forest, near Scarborough, unvaryingly used 45kHz.  <p>  <p>Dr Altringham, who carried out follow-up studies with doctoral student Kirsty Park, said: "We wanted to see whether bats on the different frequencies ever mated, and they don't. We have not uncovered a single example of 55kHz individuals co-habiting with 45kHz ones."  <p>  <p>The findings have been bolstered by previously unrecognised physical differences. Dr Altringham said: "I have just got to the stage where I can tell you which type a bat is. The 45kHz ones have a slightly more pointed snout and the others have pinker faces."  <p>  <p>Classification experts face a delay in naming the new bat because the original 'type' specimen of Pipistrellus pipistrellus went missing from the Natural History Museum some years ago.  A reserve specimen has lost its head in storage, and scientists are not sure which type it is.  <p>  <p>"It will be a matter of deciding which species is to keep the pipistrellus name and then a new title will be found for the other one," said Dr Altringham.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Justice Taylor criticises Howard over mandatory life sentences </b><br><br><br><b><h2>6 March 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Seeking justice</h2><h3>Lord Chief Justice Taylor has crossed swords with Michael Howard but the main battle is yet to come  </h3>  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Mary Riddell</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>When Lord Taylor of Gosforth announced his intention, some time ago, to appear on 'Question Time', his decision reduced one venerable columnist to a state of near-apoplexy. What inappropriate subjects, he hazarded, might the Lord Chief Justice be called upon to discuss? Trivia? Gossip? Or (this in a wild lunge for the most improbable topic he could think of) Virginia Bottomley's knickers?  <p>  <p>Lord Taylor is the unstuffiest of men and able, therefore, to laugh at this bizarre suggestion. "Yes, he did mention those. He was writing off the top of his head, of course, since I was only going to comment on legal matters." Which brings us safely back to a more familiar set of political underpinnings: Michael Howard's bloomers.  <p>  <p>Five months have elapsed since the Home Secretary announced to an adulatory conference his package of tougher sentences, reduced remission and automatic life terms for second-time serious sex offenders. The cheers had scarcely died before Taylor moved in for the kill.  <p>  <p>Judges' discretion must not be limited, he said, in the most devastating tirade in legal history. Why not, instead, supply the police with sufficient money to catch criminals? And then, his verdict delivered, he stayed silent. The row has smoked on ever since, but Taylor - driven into an unscripted role as defender of the public interest - has added not a further word. And now round two is imminent. Within the next few weeks Howard - this time possibly with the nervousness appropriate to a second-time offender - will produce the white paper detailing his plans. The battle lines are drawn, and Taylor is waiting.  <p>  <p>"The proposals were so, er, striking (he is a master of the understated adjective) that I thought I should indicate my disagreement with some of them at an early stage... I would like to see what the white paper says. It may be that it will be modified somewhat and therefore one doesn't want to beat the air."  <p>  <p>Since the notion of a climbdown by Howard is as probable as a certified sighting of the tooth fairy, it would seem the Lord Chief Justice is erring on the optimistic side here. "Well, if that is so, we shall have to meet it. If the proposals are as they have been signalled, then I shall oppose them, give reasons why, and speak against them in the House of Lords." Today he gives a lecture at King's College, London, and those close to him expect it to contain the first public salvo on sentencing policy. Taylor, the most unexcitable of men, will have measured his text carefully. His appearance - pin-stripes, watch chain and grey silk hanky tucked into a top pocket - suggests an urbanity untinged with pugilism. Do not be deluded, for his plan of campaign represents a preview of the most cataclysmic dust-up yet in the fractured relationship between government and judiciary. If there were grounds for reconciliation, Taylor would take them, but he sees none. "I am certainly not in favour of the two central proposals of mandatory life sentences for two or more serious sexual offences, and minimum sentences. That is not because it's curbing our power - there is no question of amour propre - but because it restricts the scope for doing justice."  <p>  <p>There is no question of amour of any variety in the current chilly climate of mistrust. While Taylor has been staying tactfully silent, his colleagues have not. Lord Hailsham has viewed the Home Secretary's plans with "very grave suspicion", Lord Donaldson has warned of "government by despots", and Lord Justice Rose has said that violent criminals may, if Howard has his way, murder their victims rather than stopping at assault.  <p>  <p>Such views, according to Taylor, are normally run past him before being aired. Since he recommends a toning down of anything over-political, one wonders quite what bombshells may lurk in the wastebins of the Royal Courts of Justice. But does he agree with his colleagues? "Well, I do think there's a risk that if someone rapes a little girl and has done so on a previous occasion and knows that he will get a life sentence if convicted, he may very well feel like removing the only witness who can identify him and say what happened. That's a very real risk.  <p>  <p>"I also think there's a need for discounts to be allowed on pleas of guilty. If you're going to have mandatory life sentences, that factor goes. So you'll get nobody pleading guilty to a second rape."  <p>  <p>Let us pause here, look back and wonder, as Taylor must, how we ever reached such dire straits. When he took over four years ago as Britain's top judge, via a glittering career at the Bar (he prosecuted both Jeremy Thorpe and John Poulson), the Hillsborough soccer disaster report and a fast-track rise through the judicial ranks, the system he inherited appeared formalin-bottled.  <p>  <p>Here was a judiciary which, according to legend, had not yet heard of the Beatles. "Oh, that old thing... I think judges are reasonably au fait now. One's children and grandchildren (he has four of each) keep you in touch. I know about Mr Blobby and Wallace and, er, Grommit." Taylor, in his own description "user-friendly", was to be the great force for modernisation. The first thing he did, on his appointment, was to hold a press conference. Since his predecessor, Lord Lane, would have been as likely to throw a garage house party, this was seen as the boldest of moves, a litmus test of the new openness bolstered by the Lord Chancellor's move to give judges the freedom to speak out.  <p>  <p>In Taylor's view, there is still some way to go. "If a particular decision doesn't please, the temptation is to to say: Here's a fusty old judge wearing a horsehair on his head, went to Oxbridge, all those awful things... although why it should be awful to go to a decent university (he is a graduate of Pembroke) I don't know. Anyway, that approach still comes up. I'm disappointed things haven't moved further. But the pendulum may have swung too far for some. There are those who say the judges are getting above themselves." And are they? "I don't think so. I absolutely don't. You need the judiciary to see that people don't transgress their powers." Step once more into the frame, Michael Howard, large numbers of whose decisions (although, as Taylor is at pains to point out, by no means all) have been overturned by a judiciary composed, some would say, of perilously liberal muesli-eaters.  <p>  <p>"Yes, they even ride bicycles, so help me," says Taylor in his only reference to Sir Richard Scott, whose report findings he presaged long ago when he cited the Government's abuse of justice in the first arms-to-Iraq trial. Specifics apart, Taylor and his Alpen-crunchers have achieved much. He is particularly pleased that the waiting time for appeals has been reduced, that more judges have been hired, that litigation is swifter, if still too expensive, for "the little man" - his target audience for all reforms.  <p>  <p>It was naturally never part of the grand plan that the judiciary would be thrown into open warfare with the Government. Indeed, Taylor abhors judicial involvement in politics and extraneous criticisms of ministers. Nonetheless the scene was set for divergence on a range of issues. The decision last week by the European Court of Human Rights to remove the Home Secretary's powers to decide on the release of young murderers re-evoked once again the Bulger case and the disparity over the sentencing of Jon Venables and Robert Thompson.  <p>  <p>The trial judge said eight years. Taylor revised that to 10 and the Home Secretary stipulated 15. "We have to recommend what would be appropriate for retribution and deterrence. Clearly an awful case, but one would scale down the period bearing in mind the age of the offenders. But the Home Secretary has other considerations, such as the impact on the public. I don't think I can comment further."  <p>  <p>His wish is that the European Convention on Human Rights should be incorporated into British law - an institution he wants to see otherwise less tampered with. "There has been a great deal of government interference - please make that activity - in the way we live. We've had more criminal justice acts in the last few years than in the previous 60." And none of them much good? "No. They come too fast, and they're done on the hoof." It is that, perhaps, which most preoccupies the Lord Chief Justice, as he rises early to read endless legal papers and snatches a few moments a day to practise the piano he plays to near-professional standards. ("I only do charity concerts now, so that if something goes wrong no one can demand their money back.")  <p>  <p>The great moderniser had planned for progress, but it is clear that he believes the Government has instead decreed a shambles. "In the last three years, almost everything has been changed or thrown overboard in the criminal justice system. When you are going to legislate, you should do it less hectically and with a little more preparation and not have to introduce amendments because you hadn't got them ready before."  <p>  <p>Hectic seems a very polite word to apply to the Home Secretary's Criminal Justice Bill. "I used it carefully," says Taylor, with a most charming smile. "I won't go further."  <p>  <p>Oh, but he will. As Howard may dismally reflect, while toiling over his forthcoming white paper, he most certainly will.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Justice Taylor criticises Howard over mandatory life sentences </b><br><br><br><b><h2>7 March 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Judge flays Howard over "unjust" plans  </h2>
  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Clare Dyer</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>Lord Taylor, the Lord Chief Justice, last night mounted a scathing attack on the Home Secretary's plans for mandatory life sentences for repeat rapists and violent offenders and stiff minimum terms for persistent burglars and drug dealers.  <p>  <p>The senior judge in England and Wales said the plans, due to be published in a White Paper this spring, would cause injustice and would not work. The evidence that a harsher sentencing regime "will achieve anything beyond a bonanza for prison architects simply does not exist".  <p>  <p>He added: "All the wishful thinking in the world will not convince anyone that crime in America has fallen because of their sentencing policy." Speaking at King's College, London, Lord Taylor said England's second most senior judge, Sir Thomas Bingham, the Master of the Rolls, agreed with him. Launching the latest salvo in the battle between Michael Howard and the judges over the plans, Lord Taylor said his objections were not based on constitutional grounds or "a jealous protection of judicial independence". As a judge, it was not for him to complain that it would have what had been described as a "disastrous" effect on the prison population. His first objection was that the plans would cause injustice by fettering the judge's discretion to take account of the circumstances. They were incompatible with an important strand in the criminal law, the policy of discounting sentences for guilty pleas, which saved time and money and encouraged criminals to admit their guilt, enhancing the prospects of rehabilitation. Both objectives would be frustrated if judges had no discretion to reduce sentences.  <p>  <p>Lord Taylor echoed Lord Justice Rose's concern that repeat rapists who knew they faced a mandatory life sentence would kill their victims. "I wonder whether a repeat rapist, faced with an automatic life sentence, will not think it less risky to cut his losses by killing the only witness to his crime. He may then escape conviction altogether."  <p>  <p>Finally, said Lord Taylor: "I disagree with these proposals because I am quite sure they will not work... I have no doubt that what primarily deters crime is the likelihood of detection."  <p>  <p>He said the volume of criminal justice legislation was alarming. There was "a pervading sense of frenzy and uncertainty" in the courts, added to by an "invading army conducting management reviews, feasibility projects and pilot studies".  <p>  <p>Complex laws were pushed through so quickly that "inconsistencies and lacunae have to be cured in the Court of Appeal or even by yet more legislation".  <p>  <p>Ordinances and procedures regulating what could or could not be done in society "should not be subject to arbitrary change by the powers that be or to the vagaries of fashion".  <p>  <p>Lord Taylor told his audience that he had voiced his opposition, and that of the senior judiciary, when the sentencing proposals were first announced but had since refrained from commenting while awaiting the White Paper. However, the motivation behind the judiciary's objections had been misinterpreted, he said, and he felt obliged to clarify them. Mr Howard's proposals have drawn strong criticism from other senior figures in the judiciary, including the former Master of the Rolls Lord Donaldson, and from churchmen and penal reform campaigners.  <p>  <p>Mr Howard said last night that life sentences were needed for serious violent and sexual offenders because unless they got life they had to be released at the end of their sentences, even if they were still a danger to the public.  <p>  <p>Persistent burglars and drug dealers were "a menace to society", he added. "The public need to be protected from them. The Government believes that they deserve long stretches in prison. In some cases they do get them, but in many cases they do not."  <p>  <p>The Home Office said the average sentence length for a first time domestic burglary in the Crown Court in 1993/94 was 16.2 months, and for a seventh offence or more it was only slightly higher at 19.4 months.  <p>  <p>"There is surprisingly little progression in these figures. The Government firmly believes that if the public is to be protected, and if a clear message is to be sent to the criminal that crime does not pay, then action must be taken."  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Strike by workers at Kew Gardens over pay</b><br><br><br><b><h2>6 March 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Pass Notes - No 779: Kew Gardens  </h2>
  <br><br>      <p>Age: About 278 if you are a royal. 155 to you and me. The gardens were only opened to the public in 1841, having previously been a playground for various interchangeable Georges.  <p>  <p>Appearance: Deserted from next Friday if the seeds of discontent are allowed to germinate.  <p>  <p>What? A case of downing trowels? Eighty botanists and horticulturalists say they'll close the garden gates if they don't get a better wage deal. <p>  <p>So they've been made a weedy offer? Their union, the GMB, says the unsettled claim from last year will leave some gardeners with an increase of just one per cent, and even that is performance related.  <p>  <p>Dependent on growth presumably? That sort of thing. But the angry arborealists claim their standard of living is being eroded and that their salaries were blooming useless in the first place.  <p>  <p>It's becoming a bit of a hothouse of militancy then? Hardly fertile ground, there has only been one strike in its history.  <p>  <p>So who propagated that one? Not exactly a grass-roots revolt. August Bank holidaymakers were locked out in 1979 at Kew and Edinburgh, when the members of the Royal Botanic Gardens Constabulary downed handcuffs.  <p>  <p>But surely the back garden of Britain isn't short of a few bob? It got &#163;21m from the Millennium fund in December. Ah, but that's not for wages. It's for a new seed bank to preserve the country's fast-disappearing flora. And it's still looking for another &#163;7m to get the project started.  <p>  <p>But they charge quids to get in these days. Part of public sector pruning. Government cuts took their funding down by a third.  <p>  <p>They've been letting the grass grow under their feet then? Not exactly. It is still home to six million specimens and the last resting place for 3,000 of the world's rarest species.  <p>  <p>Like the breadfruit trees from Tahiti? Those are the ones that Captain Bligh, master of HMS Bounty, was sent to find. They were supposed to be used for cheap food in the slave plantations of the West Indies. And that little episode led to a bit of a mutiny as well, if you remember.  <p>  <p>So instead of being a haven of pastoral peace, it's really seen some stress. If you count George III's 'mad business', yes. He was living there when he was first strait-jacketed  <p>  <p>Not to be confused with: Q-tips, queue this side, B&Q.  <p>  <p>Do say: Great oaks from little acorns grow.  <p>  <p>Don't say: Heigh-ho, it's off to work we go.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Strike by workers at Kew Gardens over pay</b><br><br><br><b><h2>9 March 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Strike hits Kew in show of discontented flower power  </h2>
  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Owen Bowcott</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>Botanic horticulturists at Kew Gardens yesterday walked out of their tropical hot-houses to stage their first strike, in protest at a pay offer amounting to &#163;65 a year.  <p>  <p>Where the demented George III once talked to the trees, the staff of the Royal Botanic Gardens claim they are being driven to distraction by low wages. Waving GMB union placards, nearly 100 picketed the entrances and asked visitors to boycott the site.  <p>  <p>The dispute, growing steadily since last July, has been aggravated by the fact that the gardening world has never been highly paid. Dusha Hayes, a higher botanical horticulturist who has been at Kew, west London, for 10 years, said she earns &#163;9,500 for a 39-hour week.  <p>  <p>"This is the middle of our Orchid Festival and I'm a specialist orchid grower. I should be looking after the orchid nursery, which gives me a lot of job satisfaction," she said. "But these wages can't pay the bills." A private, royal garden since the 18th century, Kew was a refuge for George III during his periodic bouts of madness.  <p>  <p>Paul Maloney, a GMB regional official, said: "This is the first time in more than 200 years of history that there has been industrial action taken by staff. They are extremely low paid. These people are not mowing the lawns. They are all highly qualified botanic horticulturists."  <p>  <p>The dispute centres on a performance-related pay offer last July, which Kew's management claims averaged 6.5 per cent. Everyone was promised a 0.9 per cent increase for inflation, but some staff received no performance-related element and their annual increase amounted to around &#163;65.  <p>  <p>The GMB, which claims 82 out of 125 horticulture staff at the gardens, has threatened further industrial action if there are no fresh talks. John Lavin, operations manager at Kew, yesterday insisted the performance-related pay scheme had been agreed with the unions three years ago.  <p>  <p>"Horticultural pay in the country as a whole is pretty low," he conceded. "For that reason we moved staff off civil service grades which formerly equated them with industrial workers or ordinary gardeners. Only a very few people have not received performance-related pay."  <p>  <p>Kew is run by a board of trustees, but its main subsidy of &#163;15.5m this year comes from the the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. Treasury cuts had not been severe, Mr Lavin said. "We like to be first in a lot of things, but this is our first strike - it's regrettable and disappointing."  <p>  <p>Among recent achievements was the production of the world's largest water lily which reached a diameter of 8ft 7in. Such successes are not reflected in their performance-related pay packets, argues Dave Barnes, a GMB shop steward. "We are not asking for much, just a reasonable wage."   <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Andrew Culf</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>Players who match three winning numbers in the National Lottery will no longer be guaranteed a &#163;10 prize, it was announced last night. Peter Davis, the director general of the National Lottery, insisted the rule change was minor and a clarification of the contractual rights of players. Camelot, the lottery operator, said the likelihood of the &#163;10 prize - usually won by more than one million people a week - not being paid out was as likely as players landing on the moon.  It would only happen when the number of players matching three of the winning balls and claiming &#163;10 exceeded the total amount in that week's prize fund, which is usually more than &#163;30m.  <p>  <p>Mr Davis described that as an "unlikely circumstance". It has not happened in the lottery's first 15 months. But the lottery has already thrown up the statistical freak of two double rollovers in successive weeks and if the &#163;10 prize was suspended, the entire prize fund for that week would be equally divided between all winning tickets. Those matching six numbers would receive the same prize as those with three numbers.  <p>  <p>The change comes into effect from 17 March.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

William Hill accused the lottery organiser of trying to have a one-way bet by refusing to guarantee the automatic &#163;10 pay-out to players with three winning numbers.  <p>  <p>Members of the Commons national heritage select committee were warned the impact of the lottery meant bookmakers could cut 7,400 jobs and close 2,400 betting shops, while a third of Britain's greyhound tracks could go out of business and 2,500 employees lose their jobs within three years. More than 2,200 jobs have been axed by football pools companies.  <p>  <p>Earlier, Camelot said the move on the &#163;10 prize was a safeguard against a freak result. Most weeks about one million people match three numbers, and three million would have to do so before the &#163;10 prize was suspended. In computer simulations of 279,000 years of lottery draws the so-called "Armageddon scenario" had not happened.  <p>  <p>At question time in the Commons the Prime Minister defended Camelot, saying the chances of someone winning the jackpot were "much greater than the chances of them not being paid &#163;10 for three numbers".  But Jack Cunningham, shadow heritage secretary, said: "The public will understandably be outraged... British people rightly have a clear expectation that prizes will be paid when they win on the lottery." Robert Maclennan, Liberal Democrat heritage spokesman, said: "Camelot makes millions so this miserly move beggars belief."  Graham Sharpe, of William Hill, said: "They are not playing fair. I have never met anyone who backed the winner of the Grand National who has not been paid out."  <p>  <p>Tom Kelly, director general of the Betting Office Licensees Association, told the committee the National Lottery needed a stronger regulator than Oflot, which approved the change. He also said bookmakers wanted a change in the law so they could take side bets on the winning lottery numbers. In Ireland such bets account for seven per cent of the industry's turnover. But Sir John Gorst, Tory MP for Hendon North, asked gambling industry representatives if they were seeking a "cosseted life" because of lottery competition. Mr Kelly said: "All we want is an equal playing field so, product for product, we can match the lottery in order to survive."   <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Rob Jones</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>The director general of the National Lottery, Peter Davis, thinks that the &#163;10 rule change was "a clarification of the contractual rights of players".  Yesterday, I bought my regular ticket of one set of numbers for five weeks, understanding that if I correctly forecast three numbers in a given week, I was guaranteed &#163;10 - Camelot's explanation of the contractual rights, not mine. I now understand that they will not honour their promise ("If you have matched any three numbers from the first six main numbers drawn in any order, you win the Match Three prize. This is a fixed prize of &#163;10"). Anybody reasonably numerate could see that it is statistically possible, although highly improbable, that Camelot could be required to pay out more than the week's prize fund. Surely the risk they undertake is the same as that of a turf accountant or casino operator?

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Bioethics panel approves heart transplants from pigs to humans  </b><br><br><br><b><h2>7 March 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Pig heart swaps to humans approved  </h2>
  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Tim Radford</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>A panel of leading scientists has given a cautious go-ahead for heart transplants from genetically-altered pigs to humans.  But the approval from the Nuffield Council on Bioethics, announced yesterday, could actually slow progress in the new science of xenotransplantation. <p><p>The scientists are asking for reassurance that no new diseases could be introduced into the human population along with animal organs.  They urge that there should be no human trials until the Government's own committee on xenotransplantation has approved procedures.  <p>  <p>The council's examination of the ethical problems that science now poses comes after an announcement last September by a Cambridge biotechnology firm, Imutran Ltd, that the first clinical tests of pig-to-human heart transplants could happen in 1996.  <p>  <p>A heart surgeon at Papworth hospital and a Cambridge biologist have been working for years to produce a line of pigs with a genetic alteration which would make their hearts immunologically acceptable to human patients. Pig hearts have much the same pumping power as human hearts: chimpanzees are more closely related to humans but would take longer to breed for surgery, and there are conservation objections.  <p>  <p>Albert Weale, professor of government at the University of Essex and chairman of the Nuffield Council's working party which reported yesterday, pointed out that society dined on pigs, and that pig heart valves were already used in transplant surgery.  "Around 5,000 patients are on the waiting list for transplants but because of the shortage of donated human organs fewer than 3,000 human organ transplants were performed in 1995."  But the problem of rejection - the most difficult aspect of a transplant operation - had still to be resolved. There was concern for animal rights, along with possible religious and emotional objections.  <p>  <p>And the working party wanted to be convinced that no new and serious disease - no unknown virus lurking in the pigs - would be introduced to humans. "Our view was that the benefits of transplantation are so considerable, and the present organ shortage so serious, that it would be ethically acceptable to develop xenotransplantation experimentally, in order to explore its potential for solving the problem of organ shortage." Because pigs were more distantly related to humans than baboons or chimpanzees, the chance of a transfer of infection across the species boundary was much lower, and the risk almost impossible to assess.  Because of this, safeguards might be harder to demonstrate.  <p>  <p>David Morton, professor of biomedical science and ethics at the University of Birmingham, saw no problems with genetic alteration. Species boundaries were not inviolate; evolution demonstrated that.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Jonathan Aitken says ex-BMARC chairman, Gerald James should be in "funny farm" </b><br><br><br><b><h2>7 March 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Aitken accuses ex-colleague of "fantasy" over arms sales  </h3>  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>David Pallister</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>Jonathan Aitken, who resigned as chief secretary to the Treasury last year, yesterday launched a vitriolic attack on the former chairman of the defence company, BMARC, which MPs are investigating over the sale of guns to Iran via Singapore.  <p>  <p>Mr Aitken, who was a director of BMARC from 1988 to 1990, told MPs on the Commons trade and industry committee that Gerald James was an obsessive who could not distinguish fact from fantasy. "The conclusion I have come to is that Mr James should be taken off to a funny farm or be charged with perjury, to which he could no doubt successfully plead diminished responsibility," he said.  <p>  <p>It was partly because of Mr James' allegations - that it was well known among BMARC directors that the company's naval cannon were being shipped on to Iran - that the committee was invited to investigate last June by Michael Heseltine, then trade secretary. Mr Heseltine told the Commons that intelligence reports from 1986 to 1988 showed that the final destination of the BMARC weapons "could well have been Iran".  <p>  <p>Mr Aitken, who is involved in legal action against the Guardian, yesterday told MPs he was never informed that the guns were going on to Iran. If he had been told, it would have been like an electric shock. "This story of Gerald James' is completely untrue. It is a lie from start to finish," he said.  <p>  <p>The committee has been told by Mr James and another director that it was common knowledge the guns, made by BMARC under licence from its Swiss parent Oerlikon, were being transferred to Iran. Two other directors have given evidence that they had heard shop-floor rumours about the diversion. All four directors have said they knew the guns were being re-exported elsewhere, but Mr Aitken said he had been told by one of three company executives - he could not remember which - that they could be absorbed by the Singapore navy.  <p>  <p>Mr Aitken was asked by Joan Whalley, Labour MP for Stoke on Trent North, about his experience in the defence field after he said on BBC's Question Time last year: "I don't know the arms trade really at all." He was asked about a letter he sent to Mr James in March 1985, as chairman of Astra Pyrotechnics, in which he offered to help sell the company's military pyrotechnics through "a trusted contact who seems to be able to produce excellent results in both Iraq and Iran".  <p>  <p>Mr Aitken said his friend, Fouad Makhzoumi, "was in the pipe business for sewerage and water. He had many contacts in Iraq and Saudi Arabia. I thought he might be helpful."  <p>  <p>He was also referred to another offer in the letter. Mr Aitken wrote that he was deputy chairman of Security Centres Holdings "which now has a growing business in the field of international defence, military and security training" for special forces in the Middle East. He suggested that the director in charge of that division - a former SAS commander - might use some of Mr James' products.  <p>  <p>Mr Aitken told the committee that Security Centres sold burglar alarms, and the training was for soldiers guarding buildings from terrorist attacks. He said he could not recall newspaper reports about Oerlikon being investigated for illegal arms shipments to Nigeria when he was covering the Biafran civil war as a journalist.  <p>  <p>In his written submission to the committee Mr Aitken said: "I had no knowledge or business experience in Iran." But he admitted to Ms Whalley that he had been a director of a consultancy in the mid-1970s which was involved in laying pipelines in Iran.  <p>  <p>After the hearing Mr James said: "I stand by everything I have said about BMARC and Project Lisi (the code name for the Singapore contract). I think it's a pity that what was supposed to be an independent committee looking into breaches of the export licensing system has developed into a personal attack on me."  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Europe hit by return of killer diseases</b><br><br><br><b><h2>8 March 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Europe hit by return of diseases  </h2>
  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Tim Radford</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>The World Health Organisation last night launched a bid to halt the alarming spread of once-forgotten diseases across Europe. Officials want $20m (about &#163;13m) and co-operation in a 10-point programme to contain cholera, diphtheria and sexually transmitted diseases, and to collaborate against invasion by terrifying infections from the Tropics. Since 1990, syphilis infections in eastern Europe have risen dramatically; Cholera cases have risen ninefold, mostly in the Black Sea region, to 2,658 cases.  <p>  <p>Diphtheria, once almost eliminated, has returned. Last year there were 52,000 cases and 1,500 deaths, but the rate of infection has grown so fast that experts have begun to brace themselves for up to 200,000 infections. The alarm is far wider than the European Union: the 'Europe' of the WHO stretches from Greenland to the Mediterranean, and across Siberia to the Russian Pacific, taking in 50 countries and 850 million people. It includes many nations once in the Soviet Union. Up to 1990, despite the cold war, Western and communist nations co-operated in disease control and surveillance. Measles was rare, cholera almost unknown and polio - already extinct in the Americas - was dwindling swiftly.  <p>  <p>"What happened?" asked Jo Asvall, regional director of the WHO at a London conference yesterday. "There was a very happy event, which was the collapse of the communist system and the emergence of many new countries. Unfortunately at the very same time we had a fantastic economic collapse of those countries - a country like Moldova lost 60 per cent of its gross national product in three years; Kyrgyzstan 50 per cent in three years, and so on."  <p>  <p>As economies crumbled, immunisation programmes collapsed, and fundamental services - water and sewage and disease surveillance - also faltered. "In consequence we are seeing a re-emergence of diseases that we thought were safely behind us. Communicable diseases won't stop at border crossings," Dr Asvall said.  <p>  <p>The most alarming had been diphtheria. More than 80 per cent of all the world's infections had occurred in the former eastern bloc last year. Half of all the cases in Ukraine were among adults, which suggested that earlier immunisation had only been partial. 'Imported' infections had already turned up in Finland, Norway, Mongolia, Poland and Germany.  <p>  <p>The WHO also wants funds to redouble efforts to eliminate polio worldwide. Around 60 million children in 18 countries in the eastern Mediterranean and the Caucasus region were immunised in 1995. The WHO had planned to wipe out the virus in Europe, but infections in Chechenia rose to 130 during the war. All this was against a sharp rise in sexually transmitted diseases in eastern Europe, with an associated risk of the spread of Aids.

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Leonard Barden</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>The International Chess Federation (Fide) dropped a political timebomb yesterday by switching the next world championship from Montreal to Baghdad. This emerged as the UN Security Council in New York reaffirmed economic sanctions against Iraq on the grounds that Baghdad had not made sufficient progress in meeting its demands.  <p>  <p>Kirsan Ilumjinov, Fide's president, said in Paris that the $2m championship between Anatoly Karpov of Russia and the Russian-born American Gata Kamsky would be opened on 1 June in Baghdad by President Saddam Hussein, who would preside over the event in civilian clothing. This is supposed to be the last official world championship before the 'reunification' tournament including Gary Kasparov's breakaway organisation later in the year. Mr Ilumjinov is trying to turn it into a knock-out competition instead of the present one in which challengers play each other in long zonal eliminators to take on the reigning champion.  <p>  <p>Mr Ilumjinov said Karpov and Kamsky had agreed to give $500,000 of their joint winnings to Unicef to benefit Iraqi children and other humanitarian causes.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Helen Nowicka</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>David Ashby, the Conservative MP who lost a libel action three months ago over allegations that he was a homosexual, was last night deselected by his constituency party.  <p>  <p>Mr Ashby has represented the marginal seat of Leicestershire North West since 1983, winning with a slender majority of 979 at the last election. After hearing him argue his case, more than 200 members of the constituency party voted in a secret ballot not to readopt him. Members of the association's executive committee had publicly urged him to offer his resignation before the meeting.  <p>  <p>Afterwards Mr Ashby said: "I am absolutely certain I am the only person who could win this seat, but being in public life has been very difficult indeed... I must admit I am rather delighted to be out of it." He added that he may consider applying to be selected for another seat.  <p>  <p>Clifford McKee, the association chairman, said work would begin immediately to select a new candidate.  <p>  <p>Local Tories were concerned that Mr Ashby, aged 55, became a household name during his libel case against the Sunday Times. The paper had claimed he was having an affair with a man later identified as Irish doctor Ciaran Kilduff. Mr Ashby denies he is homosexual. Star witness for the paper was the MP's wife, Silvana, who claimed her husband had told her he was homosexual when their 28-year marriage ended.  <p>  <p>On Wednesday Mr Ashby angered his constituency by voting with Labour to defeat the Government on part of the Housing Bill. The clause gives homosexual couples the same right to stay in a council or housing association property as married people if the partner who officially holds the tenancy dies.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Liverpool Council sets 1,000 council tax</b><br><br><br><b><h2>9 March 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Heseltine tells deficit city not to expect help  </h2>
  <br><br>      <p>Michael Heseltine, the Deputy Prime Minister, last night made it clear that Liverpool could not expect the Government to bail it out of its latest financial crisis.  The city council, with Britain's biggest council tax, faces the prospect of cutting up to 1,000 jobs tomorrow in an effort to bridge a &#163;44m budget deficit before the midnight deadline.  <p>  <p>But Mr Heseltine insisted during a visit to the Labour-controlled city last night that its problems were not all down to the Government, as both unions and councillors in the city had been claiming. "My message to the council is: you've shown that you can win in competition to bring jobs to this city and improvements to this city - but only if the economic climate is right. That means you have to have the same constraints as any government would insist on."  <p>  <p>Tony Blair, the Labour leader, would also insist on tight financial management, Mr Heseltine said. "There is no escape from that, nobody can buck the system."  <p>  <p>The formulas used to decide how central government distributed money were fair, he said. "This city has probably gained as much as any city in the UK from the help this Conservative government has brought here." He added: "A lot of other councils with similar sorts of problems manage extremely well. One is forced to the conclusion that there must be something particular about Liverpool."  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Martyn Halsall</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>Cash-starved Liverpool council yesterday set the country's highest council tax, taking band D payers through &#163;1,000 for the first time in the country. However, the council staved off immediate compulsory redundancies for its workers with a deal expected to include a temporary pay cut. Hundreds of workers lobbied the town hall as the Labour controlled authority agreed a 4.5 per cent increase in council tax.  <p>  <p>The Labour group's &#163;496m budget, which had to absorb &#163;44m of government-imposed cuts, was passed by 47 votes to 41, after a four-hour debate and eight hours before this year's deadline expired. After the meeting, Harry Rimmer, the council leader, said he was confident of an "understanding" response from the unions, but warned against action that would disrupt council services. "It would be futile; it wouldn't achieve anything," he said.  <p>  <p>He said negotiations "may very well involve" job losses, but forecast these might be avoided "if we get maximum co-operation between now and 31 March". The budget, fiercely opposed by the Liberal Democrats, set a council tax of between &#163;670.97 for band A and &#163;2,012.92 for band H. It takes properties in band D - those valued at between &#163;68,000 and &#163;88,000 - above &#163;1,000 for the first time in the country.  <p>  <p>Labour leaders blamed the new rates primarily on the Government's hostility to Labour-controlled cities. They pointed out that 85 per cent of Liverpool's properties were in band A, valued at up to &#163;40,000. Several hundred protesters whistled and jeered councillors as they entered the town hall. Cardboard effigies of Hitler and Churchill were brandished to underline the protests.  <p>  <p>Changes already clear from yesterday's vote include a 15p increase in school meals charges, to &#163;1, and a deal for 24,000 council workers expected to include a two per cent pay cut for six months and a six-month suspension of a 2.9 per cent pay increase.  <p>  <p>Job losses had been projected at between 140 and 863, with the council pledging everything possible to avoid compulsory redundancies. Talks up to 31 March would include "strenuous efforts" to identify alternative savings, and a comprehensive review of council structures, including councillors' allowances.  <p>  <p>Mr Rimmer said he commended a "bad budget" to the council, "not with any great sense of achievement... it's making the best of an extremely poor job".  <p>  <p>He criticised government categories governing aid. One such index showed Liverpool 85th on a table of the most deprived authorities, while Westminster was ranked fourth. Liverpool, where unemployment is 18.5 per cent, was also "less deprived" than places like Lincoln and Runnymede. If Liverpool received the same financial support as Westminster, it would be able to give a &#163;250 rebate to every council tax payer, said Mr Rimmer. The Liberal Democrats' alternative proposals were defeated by 50 votes to 38. Flo Clucas, the party's deputy leader, said Labour proposals would cost 170 jobs and involve a pay cut levelled unfairly at both poorly paid and well-paid council employees.  <p>  <p>"As far as this council is concerned, there's been a hole in it for some time," she said. "There is no political leadership to take it into the 20th century, let alone the 21st."  She said the budget was a recipe for disaster, which would fall apart in the next six months.  "You will have nowhere else to run, except compulsory redundancies," she told the Labour leadership.  <p>  <p>Frank Prendergast, Labour deputy leader, said the budget was "a package that's bridging the gap for this city". But he warned councillors: "It is no good anybody walking away from here today and thinking that the problems are over. The problems are only just beginning... if any of the [budget] figures are going to be achieved."  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Balliol  College accepts money for Flick chair despite Nazi links </b><br><br><br><b><h2>11 March  1996</h2></b><br><h2>Pass Notes - No 781: Balliol College  </h2>
 <br><br>      <p>Age: 733. <p> <p>Appearance: Gothic horror. <p> <p>Pronunciation guide: BAY-LEE-OL. <p>  <p>Status: Oxford University's oldest college (though Merton disputes the claim). <p> <p>Origin  of silly name: Its founder was a nobleman called John de Balliol. <p>  <p>Why did he found it -  scholarly ambition, an interest in rowing? You forget that this was the 13th century, when men  were men and clerics cantankerous. De Balliol had fallen out with the Bishop of Durham, who had  him whipped and demanded an act of charity. De Balliol's response was a house in Oxford for  poor scholars, which his widow Dervorguilla later extended. <p> <p>Adding bar billiards and  table football? That sort of thing. <p>  <p>Any other history? Nothing except drink and theology for  six centuries, until Benjamin Jowett transformed the college in the late 19th century into a  production line for politicians and poets, all characterised by what Asquith - a Jowett protege  - called "effortless superiority". <p>  <p>Fascinating, but is there, as we news hounds say, a peg?  Two. The college is under attack for accepting an endowment from the German Flick family of a  chair in European thought. And Sunday Times columnist Robert Harris has decided that Balliol  man Chris Patten's own brand of "effortless superiority" will be his political undoing. <p>  <p>What's the problem? Naziism. <p> <p>You mean Chris Patten... ? Goodness, no, the very idea,  call the libel lawyer, excise that line. The difficulty lies in the Flick family's history:  Friedrich Flick, who founded the company on which the family fortune is based, armed Hitler in  the Thirties and was jailed for war crimes. Ergo, says agitated alumnus David Selbourne and  others, the money is tainted. <p>  <p>Has Balliol had this problem before? Funnily enough, yes. In the  Eighties Robert Maxwell, whose sons Kevin and Ian both graced the college, endowed a fellowship  in politics. <p> <p>Possible future endowment: The Vincent Jones chair in Peace Studies. <p>  <p>Famous  old boys: Matthew Arnold, Roy Jenkins, Denis Healey, Graham Greene. <p>  <p>Infamous old boy: Drug  trafficker Howard Marks. <p> <p>Mythical old boy: Lord Peter Wimsey. <p> <p>Imperial old girl:  Masako Owada, wife of the crown prince of Japan. <p>  <p>Do say: "Behind every great fortune there is a  great crime" (Balzac). <p>  <p>Don't say: "Didn't Balliol used to have a reputation for radicalism?"  <p> <p> <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td  width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td  width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td  width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td  width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr> <td  align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td> <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A  HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td> <td align=right  valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td> </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<h3>The college is right to accept the money for a Professorship  </h3>  <br><b>Leading article</b><br><br>      <p>Only one thing exceeds the readiness of the world's wealthiest industrialists to give their money to Oxbridge colleges, and that is the eagerness of those same colleges to accept it from them. The colleges have always depended upon the generosity of the rich to maintain them in the style to which they are accustomed and, the world being what it is, it is not surprising that some bequests come from more morally questionable sources than others.  <p>  <p>There must have been a time, for example, when the huge generosity of Cecil Rhodes and Alfred Beit towards the university could have been a source of serious moral embarrassment to Oxford. There was, without doubt, African blood on these massive bequests, however equitably they have subsequently been spent. With the passing of the years these arguments have become less powerful and the educational usefulness of the bequests more obvious. These arguments have now resurfaced in the debate as to whether Balliol College should accept money from the Flick family to endow a chair in European Thought. Those who oppose the endowment say, correctly, that the Flicks were among the most prominent employers of slave labour during the Third Reich. Those who support it say, equally correctly, that 50 years have passed and that the sins of the fathers should not be visited upon their sons.  <p>  <p>Every endowment raises questions of this kind. The purpose of such money can never be divorced from its source, a point which beneficiaries should always carefully assess. It is beyond doubt that the Flick family has a very guilty past. But they also have an entirely honourable present and it is hard to see how a society which places no restrictions on Mercedes-Benz cars can logically object to the family's charitable bequests.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Balliol College accepts money for Flick chair despite Nazi links </b><br><br><br><b><h2>12 March 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Balliol accepts cash despite 'link to Nazis'  </h2>
  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Edward Pilkington</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>The governing body of Balliol College, Oxford, yesterday gave unanimous backing to the establishment of a professorship financed by the grandson of a Nazi war criminal.  <p>  <p>Members of the college critical of the move to set up a Flick chair for European Thought called the decision a betrayal of Balliol's liberal traditions.  <p>  <p>"It is a moral disgrace which represents the abandonment of Balliol's humane record. I am ashamed of my college," said David Selbourne, a writer on ethics.  <p>  <p>But the college last night responded that it had no moral case to answer. "Balliol does not accept that anyone can bear guilt by descent," it said. Prominent figures in the Jewish community agreed a line had to be drawn under Germany's Nazi past. Lord Weidenfeld, who is of Austrian Jewish descent and who lost half his family in the Holocaust, said: "There is a new generation in Germany and it is time for reconciliation."  <p>  <p>The Flick chair has been causing growing anguish for Oxford dons, particularly within Balliol, for the past few months. It has raised profound moral questions on the ethics of fundraising when colleges are increasingly dependent on private largesse. In 1991 Dr Gert-Rudolph Flick, an heir to the Mercedes car fortune, who is a benefactor of colleges, hospitals and the arts, offered Oxford a sum believed to be &#163;350,000 over five years to set up a chair in his name.  <p>  <p>The money was accepted by the university and earmarked for Balliol until it was pointed out that the history of the Flick empire could render the donation highly controversial. Dr Flick's grandfather, a prominent industrialist called Friedrich Flick, was put on trial as a war criminal at Nuremberg in 1947 and sentenced to seven years' imprisonment. He was found guilty of using slave labour in his munitions factories.  <p>  <p>In January last year, after concerns about Flick were raised, the university called on its secretive Ethical Committee, of which even the membership is kept confidential, to investigate. It concluded that the money on offer was untainted; there was no conceivable association between Dr Gert-Rudolph Flick and Nazi attrocities and no grounds for supposing "that Dr Flick, or the various recipients of his personal generosity, could be regarded as beneficiaries of those events".  <p>  <p>Critics of the Flick chair were not satisfied. They said the committee, by operating behind closed doors, could not be regarded as independent. At the heart of the debate is the provenance of Dr Flick's immense personal wealth - estimated at about &#163;200m. Supporters say his inheritance stemmed from the rebuilding of the Flick empire after the war as a separate, and morally unquestionable, venture. The wartime operations of Friedrich Flick were almost entirely dismantled or lost to the Communists in eastern Europe.  <p>  <p>But critics insist that wartime profits made with slave labour were used as seed-corn to finance the family's post-war recovery. Under anti-Nazi laws, the family was forced to break up several of its industrial cartels but received ample compensation which was then reinvested in car production. "There is a saying that gold has no smell, but that isn't true. Gold reeks, and there is a distinctly unpleasant odour coming off here," said David Cesarani, professor of Jewish studies at Manchester University. The Holocaust Educational Trust, which has many Jewish survivors among its members, said there was no point in insisting that "every deutschmark has to be cleaned". But it said that it was concerned about an academic chair bearing the name Flick. The trust's chairman, Labour MP Greville Janner, has written to the university to protest. Bombarded by several such protests, the university recently agreed to rename the professorship in the hope of disassociating it from Friedrich. It will now be called the Gert-Rudolph Flick chair.  <p>  <p>But the dispute is unlikely to die down until Dr Flick placates his opponents by making an unequivocal repudiation of the actions of his grandfather. Lord Weidenfeld last night said that "anybody who knows him well knows he is on the side of the angels".  <p>  <p>A final resolution will have to wait, however, until Dr Flick returns from east Africa where he cannot be contacted.    <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Martin Wainwright</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>The tradition of prophets failing to find honour in their home towns was upheld yesterday with the release of proposals to site a statue of the late Lord Wilson by a Huddersfield loading bay or on a multi-storey car park. The full range of options will be presented to Kirklees council tomorrow, but a pre-emptive strike by the famously self-deprecating prime minister's friends was launched yesterday to quash the more "barmy" schemes. "It's an insult to an outstanding prime minister," said Lord Wilson's friend from schooldays, Harold Ainley, aged 80, who has been campaigning for a tribute since the statesman died last year.  <p>  <p>Councillors in the three main parties, which have jointly appealed for public subscriptions for a lifelike monument, turned on large parts of the "zealous but bizarre" shortlist of 12 sites prepared by their planners. Friend Fisher, a Conservative, said: "It's outrageous. If you are going to recognise a bloke for what he's done, it should be in St George's Square, where people can see."  <p>  <p>The square, along with Market Square and McAlpine Stadium where Huddersfield Town play, is at the top of the shortlist; but an agreement tomorrow may only be the dress rehearsal for battles about the actual statue. Mr Ainley and Eric Lawson, a Labour councillor, form a united front against the statue wearing Wilson's trademark Gannex mac. "No mac, please," said Mr Lawson. "But I suppose we'll have to accept that godawful pipe."  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Barmy scheme to cite statue of Harold Wilson in Huddersfield car park </b><br><br><br><b><h2>13 March 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Swings and roundabouts for statues  </h2>
  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>David McKie</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>Old friends of Harold Wilson are angry at the suggestion that a statue to be erected in his honour in Huddersfield might be sited at the entry to a loading bay, on a multi-storey car park, or even aboard a bridge over the thunderous M62. Even political opponents agree such schemes are an insult: "If you are going to recognise a bloke for what's he's done," says one Conservative, "it ought to be in St George's Square, where people can see." The football ground is another suggested alternative, since Harold was a famous supporter of Huddersfield Town FC. But in the days of Wilsonian heroes like Hesford, Willingham and Boot they played on the old Leeds Road ground, not today's dazzling hi-tech McAlpine Stadium. Harold, one feels, would have favoured somewhere more homely.  <p>  <p>This is all a little illogical in the sense that to have any force, an insult must be known to the insultee, and that hardly applies with statues, unless they're erected in the subject's lifetime, which few of them are. Even so, one can't help, for instance, feeling for poor Prince Albert, less because of the obloquy heaped on the Albert Memorial than for what he is having to suffer at the other end of town. When the statue of Prince Albert on horseback was put up at Holborn Circus, he would have been raising his hat to that quarter's nobility and gentry. Later on the gesture would have been mostly addressed to people shopping at Gamage's department store. Now all he salutes are the cars and buses and lorries which whirl about under his feet. Albert has become a mere roundabout.  <p>  <p>What is the point of all these statues? How many who pass them every day notice them, could tell you who they are and why they are there? In the middle of the City Square, Leeds, there's a statue of the Black Prince, surrounded by nymph-like creatures with names like Morn and Even, judged so erotic by the city authorities that when workmen were sent to clean them, tent-like creations were wrapped around them so that artisan hands should not be seen by the public appearing to finger the sensual bits. People know it's the Black Prince, and usually seem quite content to have him there. "That's the Black Prince, Edward I," I once heard a proud citizen telling a gaggle of visitors, "that was known as the Lionheart."  <p>  <p>It mystified me as a child what the Black Prince was doing in Leeds, a place which historians suggested never bothered him much in his lifetime. Officialdom explained at the time when they put him up (1903) that the prince was supposed to evoke chivalry, good government, the patronage of arts and education, the encouragement of industry, and democratic values. Precisely what the prince had done to embody democracy is another mystery. In a great Victorian city like Leeds you might have expected the Queen Empress to dominate what, before most of the central area was surrendered to traffic, was one of the most successful squares of the town. In fact, poor Victoria no longer even occupies her former privileged place near the Town Hall. She's been exiled to Woodhouse Moor, and now gazes out on a tract of land best known as the mustering ground of the Chartists, not a group she ever sought to encourage - together with the Leeds City Council Fitness and Jogging Trail. Victoria, in this case, is by George James Frampton, other of whose Victorias can be seen in Southend, St Helens, Newcastle, Calcutta and Winnipeg.  <p>  <p>The Black Prince is by Thomas Brock, who designed the Victoria Memorial outside Buckingham Place (another roundabout), as well as her bust at Oxford and her statue at Hove. As a general rule, if you were any good you got asked to do Queen Victoria. Alfred Drury, creator of the Black Prince's acolytes Morn and Even, did her at Portsmouth and Bradford. There are said to be at least 150 Victorias in existence, discounting forgeries, of which 40 are in India.  <p>  <p>I gather Leeds is planning to celebrate the millennium with a further crop of statues commemorating famous sons, like Marks and Spencer. I hope they will also find room for the Rev Charles Jenkinson, its pioneering chairman of housing, and John Charles, the finest Leeds United footballer of my lifetime. Statues of local worthies add more to the life of our great provincial towns than crowned heads who rarely visited. No town square or public park in the North is complete without at least one statue raised by public subscription to some frock-coated alderman or long-serving member of parliament. Like Sir Francis Sharp Powell, Bt, born Wigan, 1827, the town's Tory MP from 1857 to 1859 and again from 1885 to 1910, who looks out across the broad and tranquil sweep of Mesnes Park in the calm assurance that while others more glorious than he may be doomed to suffer, he at least is safe from being reduced to a roundabout.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

We swore allegiance to the Queen [because] she's part of our constitution," Mr Howard told reporters.  "The question of our constitutional future is to be determined through a process involving a convention and I think in every sense of the word the oath got it right.

  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Greg McIvor</b><br>      <p>  <p>Scandinavian police said yesterday they were bracing themselves for a 'war' between feuding motorcycle gangs after one man died and four were wounded in gun battles at Copenhagen and Oslo airports between rival Hells Angels and Bandidos.  The shooting incidents, which caused panic among passengers and sparked an international police alert, is the most serious outbreak of violence yet in an escalating conflict between the gangs.  <p>  <p>Last week three Bandidos were injured in an exchange of fire with Hells Angels in the Swedish town of Helsingborg. The day before a Hells Angels member escaped death after discovering a bomb under his car bonnet. Sunday's victims were all members of the Bandidos, which established itself as rivals to the Hells Angels in Scandinavia two years ago.  <p>  <p>The men, who were returning from a weekend convention in Helsinki, were apparently shot with automatic weapons by Hells Angels who escaped by car. Oslo police charged a Norwegian Hells Angel with attempted murder yesterday and held a further three for questioning. Danish police made about 30 arrests and Swedish police set up a 20-man squad to monitor the gangs' activities.  <p>  <p>"I do not believe the warring will stop here. There are reasons to believe there will some kind of retribution, but we don't know what," said a Swedish detective superintendent, Gunnar Hierner.  <p>  <p>Hells Angels and Bandidos in Scandinavia take their orders from parent organisations in Texas and California respectively. There, distance reduces the risks of confrontation, but in Scandinavia the geographical proximity increases tensions.  <p>  <p>Both groups have about 100 members in the region, with headquarters in southern Sweden, Copenhagen, Oslo and Helsinki.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Angella Johnson</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>The average family will spend an estimated &#163;20,000 bringing up a child to the age of five, according to a consumer survey published yesterday. Some wealthier parents will spend &#163;50,000 on their first-born even before the youngster starts school, says the report,  'What Price A Child'. And indirect costs such as childcare can add a further &#163;18,000.  <p>  <p>The author, consumer specialist Jan Walsh, found that mothers-to-be spend an average &#163;373 "from conception to contractions" on items such as extra food and maternity wear.  "Having a child could be the most expensive decision of your life," she concluded.  <p>  <p>Based on official figures and interviews with a panel of parents, the survey commissioned by supermarket chain Asda looked into the cost of parenting from conception to age five. It included expenses such as pregnancy, equipment, food, clothes, household expenses, education and entertainment. Looking at what the "top and bottom 10 per cent" would be likely to pay, it found that equipment for new-borns can run into hundreds of pounds. Adding top-of-the range accessories such as pushchairs, car seats, baby monitors and cots increases the cost to more than &#163;1,800.  <p>  <p>Between years one and three are the most expensive and boys are more expensive to feed than girls, the survey found.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>John Vidal</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>Two teams of Britain's most skilled rock climbers, one loyal to the cause of conservation and the other hired by the under-sheriff of Berkshire, yesterday fought hand to hand battles 50 feet up the trees on the route of the Newbury bypass.  <p>  <p>It was the most dramatic episode yet in the so-called 'Third Battle of Newbury', moving from extreme danger as climbers grappled and swapped punches, to high farce as one of the sheriff's officers was isolated by protesters and handcuffed to a tree.  By the end of the day, 38 people had been arrested, a woman's ankle had been broken in scuffles with security guards and the sheriff's army of retainers had clawed another small section of bypass route from the grip of the protesters.  <p>  <p>The battles, described by eye-witnesses as being like jousts rather than vicious fighting, were underpinned by a clash of philosophies as well as climbing skills.  They started at dawn when protesters jumped on a slow-moving cherry-picker machine on a hill outside Newbury, stopping it and a convoy of security guards. A delay of more than an hour allowed a flying squad of 10 leading rock climbers, including Ben Moon, one of Britain's two professional rock climbers, time to reach Gotan Camp on the bypass route. Here 30 protesters were in three oak trees waiting for Under Sheriff Nicholas Blandy and 400 guards.  <p>  <p>The Sheffield-based climbers - who are staying in the Newbury camps in protest against climbing colleagues accepting &#163;500 a day from Mr Blandy to drag protesters out of the trees - raced to the tree houses. Within an hour two of the Gotan tree houses had been cleared of protesters and most of the amateur climbers and tree-livers had been brought down in a cherry-picker and charged by the police. The scene was set for the two climbing teams to face each other.  <p>  <p>"It's like Gladiators," said Nicola Murphy, among 100 onlookers gathered below the trees. They were treated to a display of death-defying technical climbing virtuosity.  <p>  <p>Mr Blandy's men made full use of their one advantage, the cherry-pickers, which they manoeuvred to take one person at a time.  <p>  <p>One of the Sheffield climbers was "three quartered", with someone on each leg, one on his arm and only holding on to the cherry-picker for safety. At one point there was a full-scale fight between four climbers with fists going randomly, arms being twisted and people in head, leg and arm holds. In what became a battle of wits, with climbers on both sides chatting and insulting each other liberally, Mr Blandy's men pushed Mr Moon's team higher.  <p>  <p>For five hours the climbers blocked the routes up, hanging upside down, cutting off walkways and teasing the sheriff's men.  High farce followed as two of the climbers handcuffed one of Mr Blandy's officers to a tree.  <p>  <p>Mr Moon and fellow climber Stephen Coates were caught when the cherry-picker descended on to them and two climbers came from below.  The climbers were charged with violent disorder.  <p>  <p>Climbing commentator Jim Perrin said: "Those who joined the bailiffs are set to be ostracised by many in the climbing community because they are abusing their climbing skills when they attack the protesters."    <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>John Vidal</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>Oh dear. The Guardian has upset the Government's Highways Agency, the police and now the Under Sheriff of Berkshire. Reliance Security are not best friends either - but that's another story. The problem is the media 'arrangements' made for the 'Third Battle of Newbury'.  <p>  <p>Hostilities opened two weeks ago. I had spent the night with protesters 80 feet up a tree. Given the constant running fights, the self-evident illegal assaults, the acts of bravery and the punches being swapped between the protesters and bailiffs at every eviction from trees along the bypass route, 80 feet up was the only place to be when the law came knocking. It was important to be close to the action because the press and legal observers were being made - "for their own safety" - to stay well clear. The danger of trees uprooting themselves and flying several hundred yards on to journalists is as real in Newbury as people not being able to see what is going on in front of their eyes.  <p>  <p>The protesters, who felt that their situation was the most endangered, welcomed the Guardian's commitment to witness what was going on. So did the few bailiff's climbers with whom I managed to speak. Both 'sides' agreed that there should be independent observers of the evictions. Problems began when freelance journalist Jay Griffiths and I were spotted wearing climbing harnesses - a red rag to the Newbury authorities, who assume that anyone wearing one is an enemy of the state. From then on we were constantly harassed, firstly by the Central Office of Information, which acts as the lead agency for all Newbury information. A press officer physically obstructed us from getting into a press conference with the under sheriff, Nicholas Blandy, because we were not wearing British standard hard hats, the correct fluorescent jackets saying 'Press' front and back, or the right sort of identification, even though they knew perfectly well who we were and referred to us by name.  <p>  <p>Matters deteriorated after that. Blandy threatened to have us arrested under Section 10 of the Criminal Law Act 1977 if he found us in his 'shrivalture' - that is, anywhere near the bypass route. He said that the protesters had forfeited their rights to protection by law as they were the "authors of their own misfortune". He only agreed to give the Guardian an interview after I had complained very loudly during a broadcast to the BBC that he was giving.  <p>  <p>Next came a chief inspector who formally warned us in Blandy's presence that if he found us in the trees he would treat us exactly the same as the protesters. It continued with an unidentifiable Highways Agency man, who threatened me verbally for listening to his colleague being interviewed by Swiss Radio and then technically assaulted Griffiths.  <p>  <p>More hassle came from a policeman, who formally cautioned me for using abusive language. Any more? Yes. Brays detective agency, which is employed by the Highways Agency to collect information about anyone attending road protests, aggressively filmed both of us on video and other cameras over several days. Then a letter was sent from a senior COI man to another Guardian journalist threatening to withdraw the newspaper's 'privileges' if we didn't toe the line. It suggested that the rest of the Newbury press would also lose their privileges if I continued to flaunt their rules. The last straw came when the Highways Agency press officer refused to speak to me because he thought (correctly, though he did not know it) that I was seeking information about a serious accident that happened while I was up a tree, as it was being cleared of protesters. 'Privileges', it seemed, had been withdrawn. All this for trying to report from a tree.  <p>  <p>No harm done, but there are serious issues. Questions: why are the authorities trying to massage the news coverage of Newbury? What right has an Andover solicitor (Blandy) to dictate to the world's media what they should wear, how they should be identified and just what they should see when men in his pay are being accused of assault and worse? Why will Blandy not allow trained, independent legal observers and the press into his security cordon, especially when there is a growing catalogue of alleged human rights abuses and complaints against chainsaw operators, guards, climbers and others? Why is it impossible to interview protesters during or immediately after the eviction? How can the Central Office of Information and the Highways Agency, both government bodies, try to withold information and 'withdraw privileges', like some school monitor, from bona fide journalists?  <p>  <p>The Highways Agency argues that the rest of the media has accepted "as pure common sense" the "minor conditions" restricting the press from full and open access to the story. They say that they refused to talk to me not because I was in a tree, but because "I was in a tree inside a cordon". They assume ("not unreasonably") that the presence of an unaccompanied journalist within the working cordon would constitute an obstruction.  <p>  <p>I was beginning to think it was becoming personal. Then Radio 5 Live's Stop Press team turned up at Newbury. They, too, were refused entry to one of Blandy's intimate press conferences because they only had their BBC identification. Tut, tut. Must get the right jacket, boys.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Thomas Hamilton shoots  dead 16 children and a teacher in Dunblane </b><br><br><br><b><h2>14 March  1996</h2></b><br><h2>Murders beyond words</h2>
<h3>Dunblane's lesson is that guns must be curbed   </h3> <br><b>Leading article</b><br><br>        <p>Yesterday was a time for grief. The British are not usually very good at expressing loss.  Yesterday they were. The nation united in compassion for the people of Dunblane after Britain's  worst massacre. The television cameras caught the horror, confusion and bewilderment of the  small community as stricken parents rushed to the Scottish primary school to queue and hear  whether their children had been mowed down by the gunman. The age of the children only made it  more poignant: first year primary school pupils aged five or six: 16 of them shot dead, 13  others injured, their teacher killed plus the killer himself after turning a gun on himself.  Even the politicians were unable to find words to express their horror at the atrocity. <p>  <p>Today  the search for explanations will continue as more facts emerge. There are some obvious  parallels with Hungerford, the English town where Michael Ryan shot dead 16 people in 1987.  Both are the last places where one would expect random violence to erupt: small attractive  country towns with strong community ties and none of the alienation associated with larger  cities. Both killers lived within the communities they devastated. Both are described as  lonely, secretive, friendless people. Neither was being treated for any mental disorder. Yet  both committed indiscriminate and irrational violence on a massive scale. Why? <p> <p>The facts  which emerged last night about Thomas Hamilton point to a seriously repressed paedophile who  either suffered an acute psychotic episode prompted perhaps by voices, hallucinations and  fantasies or was a seriously disordered psychopath. But no one knows and, because he is no  longer there to interrogate and examine, no one is ever likely to know the full story. The bare  facts show a 43-year-old man, who was expelled as a scoutmaster 20 years ago for improper  behaviour and who was still said to be "unnaturally fond" of young boys. But not even Michael  Howard can lock away a man for life on such flimsy suspicions. Contrary to what the Home  Secretary likes to assert, predicting human behaviour is a hazardous task. As Dr Robert Runcie,  the Archbishop of Canterbury, noted at the memorial service for the Hungerford victims: "The  human mind is the most complex and delicately balanced of all created things. Wisdom cannot  foresee all the consequences of its sickness. The most that wisdom can do is to shield society  from some of the possible consequences of disordered thinking." <p>  <p>Top of the list for some  yesterday was better school security. Of course schools could be made more secure against the  random violence of rival juvenile gangs as well as the weapons they carry. But no security  system in the world can protect schools from yesterday's unpredictable violence. There are  26,000 schools in the country. On any rational list, Dunblane primary would have been at the  bottom in terms of needing protection. As Fred Forrester, the Scottish teachers' leader,  sensibly recognised yesterday, it would be foolish to create a school security system based on  a one-off incident, no matter how horrific it was. Unlike America, schools in Britain do not  need to be turned into fortresses. <p> <p>Tighter controls over guns and gun clubs offer better  opportunities for creating a safer society. Hungerford forced the Government to improve  controls over automatic rifles. But Hamilton used handguns. They too need much tighter  controls. The Hungerford coroner rightly called for a review of the 'need-to-own policy'. There  are one million firearm certificates. This is absurd in a society in which the police rule many  officers as unfit to hold one. <p> <p> <p> <p> <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr> <td  width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td  width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td  width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td  width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr> <td align=left  valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td> <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A  HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td> <td align=right  valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td> </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Thomas Hamilton shoots dead 16 children and a teacher in Dunblane </b><br><br><br><b><h2>14 March 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Massacre of the infants</h2><h3>Gunman mows down class of children leaving 16 dead with their teacher  </h3>  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Erlend Clouston</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>The small Scottish town of Dunblane was racked with grief and horror last night as details emerged of the killer who had lived in their midst until yesterday, when he shot dead 16 small children and a teacher in three minutes of carnage in a primary school gym.  <p>  <p>Thomas Hamilton, aged 43, a disgraced former Scout master whose behaviour had attracted the attention of the police, turned one of his four guns on himself after killing or injuring all but one of a class of 29 five- and six-year-olds at Dunblane primary school, near Stirling.  Last night three of the 12 children at hospital in Stirling, Falkirk and Glasgow were on the critical list.  <p>  <p>As the Queen, the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition registered their shock and distress at the worst multiple murder this country has seen, there were immediate calls for greater security in schools and tightening of the laws on gun ownership, last addressed after the Hungerford massacre in August 1987.  <p>  <p>No obvious motive had emerged yesterday, but the many people who had encountered Hamilton drew a picture of a man who was obsessed with small boys and embittered by rejection. He became a Scout leader in 1973, aged 20, but was asked to leave the following year because of complaints about his behaviour at camp. He tried many times to get back into the organisation. Later he ran a boys' club - at one time in the school gym, some say - and recently, said a neighbour, he had been turned down as a voluntary worker for the primary school where he yesterday wreaked such bloody havoc. It is believed the gunman began firing his weapons in the playground not long after school began, then forced his way past two of the 25 staff as he walked along a passageway, past the dining room, and into the gym, where 45-year-old Gwen Mayor's class was in progress.  <p>  <p>Fifteen children and Mrs Mayor died at the scene; another child died in hospital. It is not known how many bullets were discharged during the massacre, which the police estimate lasted between two and three minutes. Only one child escaped unscathed. Two pupils were absent because of illness. The whole school heard gunfire. The head teacher, Ronald Taylor, was described by police as a hero for the work he put in to calm the distraught pupils of the 700-strong school.  <p>  <p>Jack Beattie, a senior consultant paediatrician, who arrived with the medical team, said it was the worst carnage he had witnessed in his 19 years as a doctor.  "We saw a large number of dead and injured children when we arrived in the gymnasium," he said. "There were a number of teachers comforting the children who were still alive and ambulance staff who had arrived before us. The children were very quiet. They were in shock both because of the injuries and because of the psychological shock."  <p>  <p>A governor at the school, Gerry McDermott, said he had comforted a distressed teacher, Stuart McCombie, who had rushed to the gymnasium after the shooting. "Stuart told me they were looking up at him with their wee eyes, slowly changing colour as the blood drained from their faces and they died in his arms. He said the room was just awash with blood." <p>  <p>Steven Hopper, aged 11, was in his classroom yards from the gym, which shortly before had been full for morning assembly. "It was right next to my classroom," he said. "I looked over and saw the gunman.  He was coming towards me, so I just dived under my desk when he turned and fired at us.  It was pretty scary when he started firing at our classroom window because all the glass smashed in and I got hit by a piece."  <p>  <p>As the news reached the town, parents congregated at the school gates. Their children were handed back to them in small groups, but the parents of the victims were led to a private room.  Nora Dougherty, governor at the school, said: "I found out it was not my daughters. I felt relieved - and then I felt terribly guilty that I felt relieved."  <p>  <p>A father outside the school gates cried: "I don't know if my girls are alive or dead. What kind of a maniac does this? They are just babies in there." Janet Aitken, mother of an 11-year-old pupil, said: "I have my son, but many don't. When I saw Campbell I just wanted to weep, but many parents aren't having a reunion with their children."  <p>  <p>Michael Forsyth, the Scottish Secretary, flew to Scotland as soon as the news broke. "I cannot find the words to express what has happened here today," he said after being taken to the scene. He was joined by the shadow Scottish secretary, George Robertson, who lives in Dunblane and whose children attended the Dunblane primary. He described the murders as "an act of unspeakable brutality and woe".  <p>  <p>Last night Mr Forsyth said he had once met Hamilton, when the killer attended one of the MP's surgeries to complain of police harassment. "He was one of my regular correspondents... I did discuss him with the police. They were not able to find any evidence against him which could result in prosecution," he told the BBC.  <p>  <p>In a message to Mr Forsyth, the Queen said: "In asking you to pass my deepest and most heartfelt sympathy to the families of all those who were killed or injured, and to the injured themselves, I am sure I share in the grief and horror of the whole country."  <p>  <p>John Major said: "They are perhaps the generation that has more to look forward to in optimism and hope than any before and suddenly this appalling act snuffs out that opportunity."  <p>  <p>Police in Scotland will open a fatal accident inquiry. They refused to say whether Mr Hamilton's pistols were automatic, but confirmed that Hamilton had held the appropriate firearms certificate.  <p>    <p>  <p>  <p>  <p><b>The children who died</b>  <p>  Victoria Clydesdale, 5  <br>  Emma Crozier, 5  <br>  Melissa Currie, 5  <br>  Charlotte Dunn, 5  <br>  Kevin Hasell, 5  <br>  Ross Irvine, 5  <br>  David Kerr, 5  <br>  Mhairi McBeath, 5  <br>  Brett McKinnon, 6  <br>  Abigail McLennan, 5  <br>  Emily Morton, 5  <br>  Sophie North, 5  <br>  John Petrie, 5  <br>  Joanna Ross, 5  <br>  Hannah Scott, 5  <br>  Megan Turner, 5  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Thomas Hamilton shoots dead 16 children and a teacher in Dunblane </b><br><br><br><b><h2>15 March 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Who licensed him to kill?</h2><h3>Hamilton had six gun permits and was known to the police and politicians after pervert allegations  </h3>  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Sarah Boseley</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>Thomas Hamilton, the disgraced scout leader who shot dead 16 small children and their teacher on Wednesday, held firearms certificates for two rifles as well as the four handguns found amid the bodies when the slaughter in the primary school gym finally stopped, it emerged yesterday.  <p>  <p>As a senior Scottish judge was appointed to head an inquiry encompassing everything from school security to tighter firearms controls, the Scottish Secretary, Michael Forsyth, revealed that Hamilton was first granted a gun licence in 1977.  <p>  <p>At the time of the Dunblane massacre, which ended when Hamilton turned a weapon on himself, he was authorised to keep two .357mm revolvers and two 9mm pistols, believed to be the weapons recovered at the scene of the shooting. He was also allowed to keep a 7.6mm rifle and a .22mm rifle, but he was not thought to own either at that time.  <p>  <p>As it began to be questioned how this man could possibly have cleared the hurdle required under the Firearms Act 1968, which states that police must be convinced an applicant is not "of intemperate habits or unsound mind or... for any reason unfitted to be entrusted with a firearm", an extraordinary insight into his thinking was provided by the arrival at television stations and newspapers of letters he had written to the Queen, the Scottish Secretary and others.  <p>  <p>Copies of seven letters, posted the day before the killings, revealed Hamilton's obsession with clearing his name of any sexual perversion. Writing to Mr Forsyth, he accused "over-zealous police officers from Central Scotland Police, obsessed with child abuse, [of] carrying out their failed pervert hunt using unfair tactics".  <p>  <p>In his letter to the Queen written a week ago, he accuses the Scottish Scout Association of passing on the information "that I was a pervert" to the public in an underhand manner.  <p>  <p>Writing to the education convenor of Central regional council in January, he said: "At Dunblane primary school where teachers have contaminated all of the older boys with this poison, even former cleaners and dinner ladies have been told by teachers at school that I am a pervert."  <p>  <p>It also emerged that one mother went to police in 1989 with accusations about Hamilton's sexual activities during a summer camp her son had attended. Later, she says, Hamilton threatened her with a shotgun. When she complained again to the police, she was told the man had a licence for the weapon.  <p>  <p>Last night Scottish police were withholding details of the killings at Dunblane Primary School on the grounds that the matter is sub-judice. Police practice in Scotland, where contempt of court laws are more rigorously enforced than in England, is to say as little as possible while any court case or fatal accident inquiry is pending.  <p>  <p>Lawyers questioned whether prejudice could arise, since the inquiry would be conducted by a judge without a jury. Juries, which sit in many high profile inquests in England and Wales, have been abolished in fatal accident inquiries.  <p>  <p>The three children most seriously injured in the shooting are still critically ill in Glasgow's Yorkhill hospital. One boy, who was shot three times, went through emergency surgery yesterday and is on a ventilator. Another boy, aged five, has multiple wounds and is expected to be operated on later today. The third child, a girl, has a fractured thigh bone. Two children who spent the night in Falkirk hospital were allowed home, while five at the Stirling Royal Infirmary, together with two teachers, were making good progress.  <p>  <p>The headmaster of Dunblane Primary School described yesterday for the first time how he ran to the school gym to find a scene of carnage. Ron Taylor, aged 45, who was first at the scene of the killings, said: "Evil visited us. We don't know why, we don't understand it, and I guess we never will." At Westminster, after a Prime Minister's question time entirely given over to expressions of sorrow and dismay, Mr Forsyth announced the appointment of Lord Cullen, who chaired the investigation into the Piper Alpha disaster, to head the Dunblane inquiry, which will be held in public.  <p>  <p>Calls for further restrictions on gun ownership were muted, due to the atmosphere of mourning in the Commons, but signalled the likely pressures to come.  <p>  <p>Sir David Steel, the former Liberal leader, asked Mr Major if further steps to prevent "the madness of yesterday" could not be taken by adopting proposals from the Firearms Consultative Committee. These include tighter controls on gun clubs and the introduction of the 'good character' test when granting gun licences.  <p>  <p>In an unusual gesture, John Major and Tony Blair will visit Dunblane together this morning. The Queen and Princess Royal will make the journey on Monday.  <p>  <p>MPs in the Commons listened in a rare silence as the Prime Minister spoke of "the almost unimaginable horror" of what had happened and the Labour leader - evidently emotional - asked: "How many parents last night will have clutched their own children to them, imagining the pain which for others is all too real."  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Liggett tobacco group agrees to help smokers quit in US court settlement </b><br><br><br><b><h2>14 March 1996</h2></b><br><h2>US tobacco firm to help smokers quit</h2><h3>On no smoking day, a tobacco firm in the US finds itself having to pay millions of dollars to help people give up smoking  </h3>  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Ian Katz</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>A leading US tobacco firm will spend millions of dollars helping people to give up smoking as part of a ground-breaking settlement in a lawsuit brought by smokers who claimed that cigarette companies had deliberately sought to hook them on their products.  <p>  <p>In a volte-face, Liggett Group, America's fifth largest tobacco firm, broke ranks with the rest of the industry to offer a settlement of the suit brought on behalf of up to 50 million American smokers.  <p>  <p>Under the deal, the company will not admit liability for tobacco-related illnesses but will contribute five per cent of its pre-tax profits for the next 25 years to a nationwide programme to help smokers give up.  It will also pay $4m (&#163;2.6m), and a further proportion of its profits, to four states which are separately suing the tobacco firms, and has agreed to accept US government curbs on cigarette advertising and marketing.  <p>  <p>The settlement, which was expected to be formally announced yesterday, represents a significant breakthrough for America's dogged anti-smoking campaigners because no tobacco firm has yet paid a penny in a smoking-related lawsuit.  <p>  <p>"Why should we keep spending $10m (&#163;6.5m) a year on legal fees if there is a way to settle it," Bennett LeBow, the majority shareholder in Liggett's parent company, the Brooke Group, told the Wall Street Journal.  <p>  <p>In exchange for its concessions, Liggett will be dropped from the so-called Castano class action suit, in which a consortium of nearly 60 law firms has alleged that tobacco companies deliberately manipulated nicotine levels in cigarettes in order to hook smokers.  <p>  <p>Four of the five states suing tobacco firms for the cost of treating tobacco-related illnesses - Florida, Massachusetts, Mississippi and West Virginia - will also drop their suits against the company, which produces Chesterfield cigarettes as well as a number of discount brands. The company's move will infuriate the rest of the $45bn (&#163;30bn) industry, which has come under attack in recent years from the US Congress, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and countless city and state legislatures, seemingly competing to pass the most draconian smoking bans.  <p>  <p>The industry's policy has been to fight every lawsuit, confident that it can muster more resources than any group of aggrieved smokers. But the army of lawyers behind the Castano suit managed for the first time to level the legal playing field.  The suit, brought against the five largest tobacco companies, claimed the firms and their lobbying body, the Tobacco Institute, deliberately concealed research which showed that nicotine was addictive.  <p>  <p>Industry watchers believe the Liggett settlement had less to do with corporate contrition than Mr LeBow's campaign to force a split between the food and tobacco operations of R J R Nabisco, in which he is also a major shareholder. The Nabisco management has insisted it cannot spin off its tobacco operations until smoking-related lawsuits against the company have been resolved. But the terms of the Liggett deal would allow it to accept a similar settlement by taking over the smaller cigarette company. The Liggett settlement, which must still be approved by a federal judge, does not require the company to pay anything to individual smokers. The firm had pre-tax profits of $11m (&#163;7.4m) last year.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Family feud over succession to earldom of Selkirk </b><br><br><br><b><h2>15 March 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Duel over earldom ends well for young pretender  </h2>
  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>David Pallister</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>Sir Malcolm Rognvald Innes of Edingight, Lord Lyon King of Arms, handed down his judgment yesterday and a 17-year-old youth was &#163;500,000 the richer.  So ended a fiendishly complicated, 14-month legal battle over the Scottish earldom of Selkirk.  <p>  <p>There were two contenders: Lord James Douglas-Hamilton, the Scottish Office minister, and his cousin, Alasdair Douglas-Hamilton, a lawyer. But in November 1994 Lord James's uncle, the 10th earl, died without male heirs and in order to avoid a byelection in his marginal Edinburgh West constituency, Lord James renounced his claims.  <p>  <p>Before the Court of the Lord Lyon, the arbiter of matters titular in Scotland, however, he pressed the claim on behalf of his son, John Andrew. In finding for Lord James and making John the heir apparent, Sir Malcolm said the minister could not use the arms or the title in his lifetime. The legal problem centred on a little Latin written over 300 years ago. In 1646 Charles 1 granted the earldom to his cousin, 12-year-old William Douglas, the younger brother of the premier Scottish peer, the Duke of Hamilton. There was a proviso that the two titles be kept separate. But William went on to marry Anne, Duchess of Hamilton, and himself became the 3rd duke. He resigned the earldom but it was granted to one of his sons in 1688.  <p>  <p>And so the Selkirks and the Hamiltons prospered. Alasdair Douglas-Hamilton thought he had it in the pot. He was listed in Debrett's and Burke's as the heir apparent. And a letter from Sir Malcolm's father, the previous Lord Lyon, seemed to confirm his succession would be trouble free. But it was not to be. And besides losing the legacy and the right to sit in the House of Lords he had expenses granted against him.  <p>  <p>Asked what effect the case had had on the family, he replied: "It doesn't help matters." Of his relationship with Lord James, he said: "I seldom see him so that is academic." Lord James was not present.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Asylum seeker Ibrahima Sey dies after police struggle using CS gas </b><br><br><br><b><h2>18 March 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Police shun calls to ditch CS spray after man dies  </h2>
  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Gary Younge</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>Police will continue to use CS spray, they insisted yesterday, despite calls for its suspension from MPs, civil liberty groups and anti-racist organisations following the death of a Ghanaian-born asylum seeker early on Saturday morning.  <p>  <p>Ibrahima Sey, aged 29, died after he was sprayed with the incapacitant, in the first case of its kind. Neighbours say about 10 officers overpowered Mr Sey following a domestic disturbance at his home in Ilford, Essex. After a struggle the police handcuffed him and put him into a police van. He was taken to Ilford police station and then to King George's hospital, Ilford, where he was later pronounced dead.  <p>  <p>"There is no evidence to suggest the CS spray contributed to this tragic death. There are no plans to suspend use of this spray, which has been used on more than 20 occasions so far and we are not aware of any cases of long-term adverse reactions," said a spokesman for the Association of Chief Police Officers.  But Tony Banks, Labour MP for neighbouring Newham North West, said it might be some time until the exact circumstances of Mr Sey's death become known. "It would be sensible to suspend use of this spray until an absolute exact cause of death is established and CS gas eliminated."  <p>  <p>A post mortem examination carried out by three pathologists - representing the coroner, the Police Federation and the Metropolitan Police - indicated that Mr Sey suffered from hypertensive heart disease and had collapsed following a period of exertion.  But a spokesman from the Police Complaints Authority, which is to investigate, said yesterday: "We can't be absolutely sure of this until we have the results of the toxicology tests, which should show whether the gas contributed to Mr Sey's death. We must also examine whether the use of the spray was appropriate."  <p>  <p>Mr Sey's sister, Awa Sey, demanded a second opinion on the post mortem. "We need to know what happened. I am very much concerned if CS gas was used. There was no need to use CS gas when he wasn't resisting arrest," she said, adding that the family was devastated.  <p>  <p>The spray was issued to more than 2,000 officers in 16 authorities in England and Wales this month for a six-month trial. One police inspector is suing for compensation after suffering burns to his eyes during a CS gas test in Northampton last summer, which led to trials being temporarily postponed.  <p>  <p>John Wadham, director of the civil rights group Liberty, called on the police and the Home Office to end the trials, publish information about the dangers and set up a public inquiry into the death of black people in custody. His demand follows criticism from a United Nations committee over Britain's record of investigating deaths in custody, particularly involving black and Irish people. "Current mechanisms for investigating deaths are deficient. They are often investigated by police themselves," it said. Mr Sey is the fourth black man to die in just over a year.  <p>  <p>Lee Jasper, of the anti-racist National Black Caucus, said: "This will inevitably crystallise the tattered and battered relationship between the black community and the police. The officers involved should be suspended and a public inquiry held."  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Stephen Bierley</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>Diane Modahl is suing the British Athletic Federation for &#163;480,000 compensation over her drugs case, the federation's annual meeting was told in Birmingham.  <p>  <p>The figure was disclosed by the outgoing treasurer John Lister, who warned of "painful" years ahead for the sport, adding that commercial income fell short of the budget by &#163;174,000 last year.  Lister, speaking on Saturday, revealed that &#163;250,000 had been spent on anti-doping actions in the past five years, with &#163;195,000 going on the Modahl case, still unresolved.  <p>  <p>On the same day in Mansfield, where Modahl helped her club Sale Harriers win the women's team event at the national cross country relay championships, her husband Vicente spoke of their financial difficulties.  <p>  <p>Next weekend in Cape Town the International Amateur Athletic Federation is to make a further pronouncement. The BAF cleared Modahl on appeal last year but the IAAF has not accepted the finding.  <p>  <p>Vicente Modahl again stressed the lack of evidence and complained about the BAF's lack of help and its unwillingness to accept any financial responsibility.  <p>  <p>Lister restated the BAF's position that, on the best current advice, "Mrs Modahl has no legal basis for a claim". He added that the BAF was having to bear "an unfair burden".  <p>  <p>Although accentuated by the legal costs in the Modahl case, the loss made last year was a grim warning to the BAF, and Lister attacked the English AAA, for hanging on to its &#163;1.8m account, and the South of England AA, which "needs to shed its image of trouble-making and greedy self-interest".  <p>  <p>Lister, whose decision to stand down as treasurer came earlier this year, was replaced by Martin Evanson, the treasurer of the South of England; he defeated Geoff Parsons, who with Roger Black was instrumental in launching the International Athletes' Association last year, by 550 votes to 356. Asked from the floor if there were any plans to staunch the profligacy of head office, Peter Radford, the BAF's chairman, said he "absolutely rejected such nonsense".  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Diane Modahl cleared of taking drugs by IAAF</b><br><br><br><b><h2>27 March 1996</h2></b><br><h2>BAF faces ruin over Modahl  </h2>
  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Duncan Mackay</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>British athletics could find itself teetering on the edge of financial ruin as a result of Diane Modahl's &#163;480,000 compensation claim for loss of earnings, legal fees and money spent on scientific advice, after the decision of the International Amateur Athletic Federation to clear her of all doping charges.  <p>  <p>The British Athletic Federation last month announced a record loss of &#163;256,000, of which &#163;91,000 was accounted for by legal and professional fees on the Modahl case. Since then the affair has eaten even more into the BAF's dwindling coffers. Should she win her claim, the BAF would have to pay the money out of its reserves and would probably be unable to continue funding elite and grass-roots athletics much beyond a basic level. Modahl's lawyers will argue that it took the BAF more than a year to reverse the original decision to suspend her, even though it was widely believed that the sample had not been stored properly in the Lisbon laboratory. The BAF, officially, says it has done everything by the rules and it should not be held responsible, especially as the case was brought by the IAAF and the tests were done abroad, in Portugal. But senior officials admit privately to concern that the High Court might feel sympathy for Modahl, who is having to sell her house to help clear a debt of &#163;250,000 incurred in clearing her name.  <p>  <p>Six years ago, in a case similar to Modahl's, the Norwegian federation paid Trine Hattestad, the European javelin champion, $50,000 compensation after she successfully appealed against a positive test for testosterone, the hormone Modahl was accused of taking, and the laboratory in Utrecht that did the test was struck off for getting its readings wrong.  <p>  <p>Even if the BAF wins, it will still have to pay more large legal fees to defend itself, all of which will plunge it into more crisis at a time when its television contract with ITV is in danger of being ended and it is having problems replacing sponsors.  <p>  <p>The BAF would be hugely embarrassed but it may have to go cap in hand to the AAA of England, its most powerful member, to help it out of its financial hole. The AAA has a reported &#163;900,000 in reserve but would probably drive a hard bargain for its help and demand that Peter Radford, the BAF's executive chairman, whom Modahl criticised on Monday for not supporting her enough throughout her ordeal, be stripped of some of his powers. The AAA has been unhappy for some time at the way Radford is running the sport, and the South of England AA has taken legal advice on his position.  <p>  <p>Modahl could also join the 1991 world 100 and 200 metres champion Katrin Krabbe in suing the IAAF. The German is awaiting judgment in Munich on her claim for more than $500,000 in damages and lost earnings over a 1992 ban.  <p>  <p>The IAAF has never lost a court case of this kind, though it took two years to overturn the decision of an American judge to award the world 400 metres record-holder Butch Reynolds $27.3m damages after he was suspended in 1990.  <p>  <p>Things already look a little brighter for Modahl, with the decision of her long-time kit sponsor Nike to pay her &#163;20,000. Her contract was suspended 19 months ago when the positive drugs test was announced.   <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Geoffrey Gibbs</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>A call for Europe-wide talks to reform the Common Fisheries Policy was issued by the European fisheries commissioner, Emma Bonino, when she visited fishing communities in the South-west yesterday.  <p>  <p>Mrs Bonino was left in no doubt about the region's unhappiness with European fishing regulations, and the bitterness felt towards Brussels over quotas and 'quota-hopping', under which foreign-owned vessels registered in Britain can fish against British quotas. But she defused much of the hostility by acknowledging that the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) needed reform. In a hall decked with banners reading 'Save Britain's Fish', Mrs Bonino told Brixham fishermen: "I don't think the CFP is perfect. I think there is scope to improve it."  <p>  <p>Withdrawing was a matter for the people of Britain and its government. But she added: "I strongly believe it is better to improve the existing policy. My goal is to find an equilibrium between fishing capacity and fishing resources."  <p>  <p>Jim Portus, chief executive of the South-West Fish Producers Organisation, said: "British fishermen and British people and our elected officials in Parliament are not going to lie belly up like a dead cod while Brussels takes over our rich fisheries resources and creates a European fishing fleet which would inevitably be Spanish in the South-west and Dutch in the North Sea."  <p>  <p>On the quayside in Newlyn, where feelings still run high after the 'tuna wars' with Spain, Mrs Bonino was strongly criticised by fishermen. Mick Mahon, a leading figure in the 'Maple Leaf' campaign to support Canada in its fishing dispute with Spain, said everything Mrs Bonino had said in the past persuaded him and most other fishermen to call for Britain's withdrawal from the CFP.  <p>  <p>Sam Lambourn, chairman of the Cornish Fish Producers' Organisation, said there was no future for the industry without changes to the CFP. But the meeting with Mrs Bonino had given him hope.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Rebecca Smithers</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>The European fisheries commissioner, Emma Bonino, accused Britain yesterday of failing to act to prevent foreign ships from plundering its fish quota by 'quota hopping'.  <p>  <p>Mrs Bonino, in London for a meeting with the fisheries minister Tony Baldry said that between 1986 and 1994 Britain had failed to provide 'matching funds' which would have unlocked EU money set aside to cover the cost of fishermen taking their boats out of service.  <p>  <p>Britain had been expected to contribute 30 per cent of the cost, the European Union providing the remaining 70 per cent. But Mrs Bonino said: "The EU part of the money was there but the national part - the matching funds - was not available."

  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Stephen Bates</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>European efforts to crack down on illegal fishing by national fleets under the EU's common fisheries policy have been woefully inadequate, according to the results of an official survey yesterday.  <p>  <p>The report, on how thoroughly the EU's member states police the policy, last night looked likely to revive British fishermen's complaints about the unfairness of the policy in the wake of the weekend visit to Britain of Emma Bonino, the Italian fisheries commissioner.  But the 105-page survey, based on monitoring in 1994, shows that British inspections are also inadequate due to the shortage of qualified inspectors to monitor catches at the dockside and that the chief culprits over illegal fishing have been British boats.  <p>  <p>The European Commission report says: "There are very big differences in the level of inspection between the various member states. The current lack of co-operation may reflect the permissive attitude towards the national fishing industries which attempt to exploit fishing possibilities beyond the limits set in accordance with the common fisheries policy. As long as the fishing industry in most member states exploits such fishing possibilities, none of them will gain, but obviously the conservation of fish stocks will be undermined for everyone."  <p>  <p>Of Britain, the report praises the inspection service's efficiency and competence and the significant resources devoted to control fishing, but says that limits to catches are extremely difficult to monitor. The report shows that, of 371 infringements notified, including illegal fishing and undersized fish catches, British vessels were responsible for 119, the French for 73, the Irish 62 and the Spanish - usual victims of British criticism - for just 22.  <p>  <p>The commission says: "Apart from some shortcomings... concerning the closure of fisheries and the prosecution of infringements, the means and the commitment invested in control and inspection in the UK provide an example of how the CFP should be enforced."  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Monks in remote monastery in Santa Fe on internet</b><br><br><br><b><h2>19 March 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Monks take to hi-tech habits for their scriptoria cyberia  </h2>
  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Elizabeth Cohen</b><br><br>      <p>At Christ in the Desert, a Benedictine monastery at Abiquiu, near Santa Fe, 24 monks follow the routine of prayer and labour that has sustained their order for 1,500 years. They clean, weave, carve icons, bake bread and design sites on the internet's Worldwide Web.  <p>  <p>"I can't think of better work for us to be doing," said Brother Mary-Aquinas, 30, a bespectacled monk in a brown hooded habit and hiking boots, who was once a systems analyst in Denver. "This work goes back to the ancient tradition of the scribes, taking information and making it into art," he said. <p>  <p>Making art out of words is nothing unusual for the order: as long ago as the 6th century, Benedictine monks worked in the scriptoria of Italian monasteries creating illuminated manuscripts from the Bible and classical texts. But for a community that has dwelt in isolation amid the angular and haunting vistas that inspired the artist Georgia O'Keeffe, going on-line was not simple.  <p>  <p>Before they could embark on their mission to the internet, the monks had to bring a few worldly necessities to their remote home along the Chama River in the Sangre de Cristo Mountains.  They added to their array of solar panels to generate extra power for 12 personal computers, found an internet service provider and bought a phone. These upgrades were matters of economic necessity. "Twelve new brothers joined our monastery in 1994 and 1995, and we needed to find a new source of income," said Brother Aquinas. In fact, the monastery has now enough monks to reach abbey status, a step it hopes to take soon.  <p>  <p>"For years it was small and we could get by on revenues from our guest house and our shop," Brother Aquinas said.  "Then we got on the internet - it seemed a good opportunity to supplement our library so the monks could do scholarly work - and we found out about the Web.

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Cambridge University accepts money for chair from tobacco company BAT </b><br><br><br><b><h2>21 March 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Cambridge row over tobacco sponsorship  </h2>
  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Edward Pilkington</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>Cambridge has become the latest university to be engulfed in controversy over commercial sponsorship after it agreed to allow the world's second largest international tobacco company to endow a professorship. A plan to set up the Sir Patrick Sheehy Chair of International Relations, named after the former chairman of BAT Industries, makers of Benson and Hedges, Silk Cut and Lucky Strike cigarettes, has aroused fury among doctors and health campaigners. Last year the company made record profits from tobacco sales of &#163;1.56bn.  <p>  <p>The dispute is likely to fuel the debate about the propriety of commercial sponsorships, coming a week after dons at Balliol College, Oxford, accepted a Chair in European Thought donated by Dr Gert-Rudolph Flick, grandson of a Nazi war criminal.  <p>  <p>Under Cambridge's proposed package, BAT would donate &#163;1.6m towards the setting up of the professorship and a bursary for inner-city undergraduates. In return, the university would pay for two post-doctoral appointments and four scholarships for students from developing countries, all bearing the tobacco company's name.  <p>  <p>The package has been accepted by Cambridge's general board on behalf of the Centre of International Studies. Sir David Williams, the vice-chancellor, said he was "delighted to be able to honour Sir Patrick in this way". With smoking on the wane in the UK and other western countries, the company has shifted its focus to new markets such as China and Russia. More than half of the 670 billion cigarettes it sold last year went to Asian and Latin-American countries.  <p>  <p>Sir Keith Peters, Cambridge Regius Professor of Physic, led opposition to the scheme at a meeting of academic staff on Tuesday. He referred to estimates that worldwide deaths caused by smoking would rise within 30 years to 10 million annually.  <p>  <p>Sir Richard Doll, an Oxford-based scientist who was one of the first to establish a link between smoking and cancer, said he would oppose "any move to commemorate Sir Patrick's contribution to society, which has been to cause a great deal of disease".  <p>  <p>Keith Ball, of the anti-smoking campaign, ASH, said he was appalled Cambridge was even considering the plan. "Why is one of our most prestigious universities aligning itself with merchants of death?"  <p>  <p>Other protests have come from the Duke of Gloucester, who is chairman of the Cancer Research Campaign, and Sir Walter Bodmer, head of the Imperial Cancer Research Fund, who slammed the proposed donation as a "cynical public relations exercise".  <p>  <p>The university is to make a final decision on whether to accept the BAT endowment in May. If it agrees to go ahead, opponents are expected to force a ballot of all teaching staff later that month. A spokesman for BAT denied it was encouraging smoking in the developing world and rejected claims that its sponsorship schemes were manipulative.  <p>  <p>Sir Patrick Sheehy, who retired as BAT chairman three months ago, was unavailable for comment.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Menendez brothers found guilty of killing parents in second trial </b><br><br><br><b><h2>21 March 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Brothers face Death Row for killing millionaire parents  </h2>
  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Christopher Reed</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>Lyle and Erik Menendez, the Beverly Hills rich boys who shot dead their parents, have been found guilty of murder by a jury in Los Angeles in their second trial, six years and seven months after the killings. The verdict, which found 'special circumstances' in that the brothers conspired and had laid in wait, could bring the death penalty, to be decided at a special hearing. Otherwise they get 25 years in prison. The penalty phase of the trial will be conducted before the same jury that delivered the guilty verdict. And the prospects of avoiding Death Row do not look bright for the brothers.  <p>  <p>Hollywood music firm executive Jose Menendez, aged 45, and his former beauty queen wife Kitty, aged 47, were found in their Beverly Hills mansion after being shot 15 times with 12-bore shotguns.  <p>  <p>The prosecution is likely to dwell on the fact that during the shootings, the brothers left the room to reload their shotguns.  Their mother's murder is particularly damaging because there was no suggestion that she engaged in alleged sexual abuse, although they claim she knew about it. Also, the jury was given more options of bringing in lesser charges in Mrs Menendez's case, but it brought in identical first degree murder verdicts with the special circumstances in both cases. <p>  <p>At first Lyle, now aged 28, and Erik, 25, suggested it was a mafia execution, and went on a million dollar spending spree. They bought Rolex watches to attend the funeral, invested in a restaurant and acquired flashy sports cars.  But only weeks before the first trial opened in 1993, they admitted to the murders in what became known as the 'abuse excuse'. They claimed that their father, with their mother's knowledge, sexually abused both of them through their childhood and with Erik into his teenage years.  <p>  <p>They threatened to go public with the sexual abuse charges, a threat that created such tension that they were frightened for their own lives, and killed out of this fear. The prosecution argued that it was simple greed - the brothers wanted the $15m (&#163;10m) fortune their father was to leave them, money that has now been spent on legal and other costs while the brothers were in jail.  <p>  <p>Separate juries for each brother were unable to agree on a verdict in the first trial, which ended in January, 1994.  In the second trial the brothers had a much more difficult time presenting their abuse excuse. Judge Stanley Weisberg decided that the defence had shown insufficient evidence that the young men had killed out of duress and fear.  <p>  <p>This precluded Lyle from repeating his tearful testimony from the first trial, a performance that had a significant impact on his jury. That jury was divided, with the women seeking a conviction for manslaughter only, and the men demanding a murder verdict. This time one jury of eight men and four women judged both cases.  <p>  <p>The defence also faced risks in presenting Lyle again. After the last trial it was revealed that he had tried to coach witnesses to lie, a charge that could have been put to him. Prosecutors also kept out 30 witnesses from the brothers' circle of friends, tutors and relatives who were to offer sympathetic portrayals.  <p>  <p>Erik's controversial defence lawyer, Leslie Abramson, who exploited courtroom television cameras in the first trial, was denied coverage this time.  <p>  <p>Many Americans felt duped by the brothers' first trial. The result of the second, which the brothers heard in stoical silence, was met by cheers and demands that they go to Death Row.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>New scare as government admits link between CJD deaths and eating BSE-infected meat </b><br><br><br><b><h2>23 March 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Stores set to replace British beef with imports </h2>
  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Sally Weale</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>Supermarkets were last night preparing contingency plans in the face of a mass consumer boycott of British beef.  <p>  <p>As criticism grew of the Government's delay in providing advice on children's consumption of beef, the Co-op announced that in view of the BSE scare it was considering breaking a 150-year tradition of stocking exclusively British beef.  A spokesman said buyers were looking into the possibility of importing meat from Australia, New Zealand or South America to stock its 3,000 stores in the face of growing concern about the safety of domestic supplies. <p>  <p>"We will be looking at providing alternatives because we recognise that this problem will result in consumers switching to other products," the spokesman said.  "We are extremely critical of the way the Government has handled this announcement and the delay in providing clear advice about children and the consumption of beef. It's creating a great deal of confusion." <p>  <p>Yesterday most supermarket chains were insisting it was too early to measure the impact of the Government's announcement on a possible link between 'mad cow disease' and the human illness, CJD, but all are anticipating a sharp decline in sales and are considering buying beef from elsewhere, as well as increasing orders for alternatives like poultry, pork and lamb. <p>  <p>During the last BSE scare before Christmas, sales of beef at Co-op stores fell by up to 25 per cent. The impact of this week's announcement is likely to be more severe given the implications of the government statement. "We've just come away from a store and the cabinet was still full of beef. Everyone's going for pork or chicken for this weekend," the spokesman said. <p>  <p>None of the supermarkets approached said they were withdrawing British beef, but customer demand will determine how shops respond.  <p>  <p>Somerfield Stores said a slump in sales was already apparent in its 625 outlets, with shoppers opting instead for lamb, pork and poultry. A spokesman said the company was looking into Irish beef.  <p>  <p>Hundreds of customers have taken advantage of an offer to return beef they bought prior to the announcement in exchange for double its purchase value. <p>  <p>Tesco, which stocks beef from 18 different suppliers in the UK and Ireland and clearly marks country of origin on all its products, said it had not decided whether to buy beef from elsewhere.  Corporate affairs manager David Sawday said: "We are monitoring what our customers want. We will get a feel for that in the next couple of days. This is a new experience for all of us."  <p>  <p>Sainsbury's is putting up information notices in its 362 stores. It is also producing recipe cards providing alternative ideas of everyday meals without beef. "We are considering all options," a spokesman said.  <p>  <p>A Waitrose spokeswoman said the supermarket chain was bracing itself for a sharp drop in sales. Its beef supplies came from known and approved farms and was produced to the "highest standards of husbandry and safety". Customers are being provided with leaflets offering information, and every branch manager has been briefed to deal with inquiries.  <p>  <p>Asda is also looking into buying beef from elsewhere. Demand has dropped, with sales of turkey and pork up 18 per cent compared with last week. "We have been securing increased quantities of turkey, pork, chicken and lamb to cope with increased demand, though demand for beef sirloin has remained buoyant," a spokeswoman said.  <p>  <p>Marks & Spencer reported a drop in demand for beef, with customers opting for fish, chicken and lamb.  A spokeswoman said information leaflets were available in all stores, but the company was awaiting further announcements from the Government before taking further action.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>New scare as government admits link between CJD deaths and eating BSE-infected meat </b><br><br><br><b><h2>26 March 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Advisers confirm that CJD cases linked to BSE before offal ban  </h2>
  <br><br>      <p>The following is the statement from the Government's Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee:  <p>  <p><b>Introduction</b>  <p>  <p>The committee has reported 10 cases of a previously unrecognised variant of CJD (Creutzfeldt-Jakob's Disease).  It agreed this weekend, after further discussion and consideration of additional genetic data from some of these patients, that our conclusions of 20 March 1996 are unchanged. That is, on current data and in the absence of any credible alternative, the most likely explanation at present is that these cases are linked to exposure to BSE before the introduction of the SBO (specified bovine offal) ban in 1989. It emphasises that there are only 10 cases to date, and that it is not in a position to confirm whether or not there is a causal link between BSE and the human disease.  <p>  <p><b>Risk assessment</b>  <p>  <p>The committee has considered whether a quantitative risk assessment can provide an estimate of the absolute risk in relation to BSE. In its judgment a precise measure is impossible because of a number of interacting uncertainties, including:  <p>* the magnitude of the species barrier between cattle and man; lack of data on levels of infectivity in a range of important cattle tissues which are below the level of detectability by current assays; the uneven distribution of infectivity in any tissue;  <p>* the time course for the appearance of infectivity over the duration of the incubation period;  <p>* whether there is a dose below which there is no risk of infection. It therefore made assessments on the basis of the available quantitative data, and where these were lacking on expert opinion and its own collective judgment.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p><b>Age-related susceptibility</b>  <p>  <p>SEAC had a wide ranging discussion of the changes in the physiology of the human gastro-intestinal tract and host defences throughout life. It considered carefully its knowledge of the transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (kuru, CJD, scrapie, transmissible mink encephalopathy, BSE) in natural infections and animal model systems. If the new variant of CJD is related to exposure to BSE, this exposure is likely to have been between 1982 and late 1989, and the age range of the cases does not suggest that those who were children at the time were at any greater risk than young adults. Taking all the above into account it concludes that if human infection with the BSE agent occurs, infants and children are not likely to be more susceptible to that infection than are adults.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p><b>Other vulnerable groups</b>  <p>  <p>The committee also considered the following groups: the immunosuppressed, patients in hospital and pregnant women. It concludes that if human infection with the BSE agent occurs, none of these groups is likely to have any increased susceptibility to infection.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p><b>Public, the younger generation, and parental concerns</b>  <p>  <p>No human activity is without some risk; if the Government rigorously enforces the current and newly recommended controls, we believe this risk is likely to be extremely small; however the committee recognises that parents will often choose to reduce risk to their children beyond that which they are prepared to accept for themselves. It is important to be aware that many foods are associated with health risks, and that changing from beef to non-beef products is not necessarily without risk.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p><b>Trimmings from cattle over 30 months of age</b>  <p>  <p>The committee reconfirmed its recommendation that cattle aged over 30 months must be deboned in licensed plants, and went on to recommend that the trimmings, comprising the obvious nervous and lymphatic tissue (including the 14 lymph nodes specified in EC trade legislation) and the vertebral column (excluding tail vertebrae) should be treated as specified bovine offal.  It also recommended that the whole head of animals aged over six months, except for the tongue (provided that it is removed without contamination), should be treated as specified bovine offal.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p><b>Gelatin</b>  <p>  <p>It concluded that this material was safe... given the large reduction in theoretical infectivity in the production of gelatin.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p><b>Meat and bone meal</b>  <p>  <p>The committee confirmed its previous advice that the use of mammalian meat and bone meal should be prohibited in any circumstances where there might be a risk of the material being fed to or ingested by ruminants. In particular, it must not be incorporated into any feed for any farmed animals, including fish or horses, or into fertiliser likely to be used on land to which ruminants have access.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p><b>Conclusions</b>  <p>  <p>The committee therefore advises the Government:  <p>  <p>a) to ensure that all the restrictions previously recommended are fully implemented. If this is ensured, any BSE-related risk from eating any beef or beef products is likely to be extremely small;  <p>  <p>b) to reinforce immediately the surveillance of CJD and associated epidemiological research;  <p>  <p>c) that these issues will require long-term, basic and applied research (which) will require substantial additional resources. There should be no delays due to difficulties in obtaining resources.  <p>  <p>The committee does not believe that additional measures are justified, but the situation needs to be kept under careful review.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>New scare as government admits link between CJD deaths and eating BSE-infected meat </b><br><br><br><b><h2>26 March 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Seriously ill 'suspects' studied - Youth link in doubt  </h2>
  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Paul Brown</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>Two cases of suspected Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease which could be linked to beef are being studied by the Government's panel, its chairman, John Pattison, said yesterday.  <p>  <p>"They are still alive and it's very difficult for me to talk about the details," he said. An examination of a tiny piece of brain tissue of one of the victims had proved negative, but this did not in itself rule out CJD. Both were seriously ill and confirmation that the disease was the same was not possible until they died.  <p>  <p>Professor Pattison also said that some of the victims of the new strain of fatal brain disorder which may be a human version of 'mad cow disease' were under 10 when they were infected.  Revealing the ages of the 10 victims for the first time, Professor Pattison said the youngest was 18 at the time of death. The others were aged 19, 20, three were 29, two were 30, one was 31 and the last 41.  <p>  <p>The assumption must be that the incubation period was 10 years and the victims had been infected in the mid-1980s. This coincided with the time the bovine form of the disease showed itself.  He said it was the extreme youth of the victims at the time of infection which led the Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee to consider whether children might be particularly at risk. The normal form of CJD generally affected people over 50. After exhaustive evidence at the two-day meeting the answer was 'no'.  <p>  <p>Professor Pattison said that the advice to government remained the same as the previous week. It was unclear why no cases of the previously unrecognised variant had been found in older patients but that did not mean that younger people were more susceptible.  It could mean that the dietary habits of older people were different or that the disease had been passed off as dementia.  <p>  <p>In contrast to the more robust statements of the two ministers at the press conference, the professor continued to be cautious.  He said that a large number of tests were being carried out and it would be weeks and sometimes months before all the results were available. The most likely cause of the new human form of CJD was eating beef but there was still no proof. Other possible explanations had not stood scientific scrutiny.  <p>  <p>Asked about whether milk and dairy products were safe, Professor Pattison said there was no evidence that they could be a route of infection. He was not so sure about beef. Since muscle contained some nerve tissue then it was a possible route but no evidence had been found.  If there was transmission through beef then it was probably through splashing of offal on to meat in the slaughtering process. The committee wanted measures to make sure offal was removed.  The committee also wanted the Government to ensure that fertiliser derived from animal blood and offal should not be put on fields where animals would graze.  <p>  <p>* Richard Lacey, a Leeds University professor of microbiology in the vanguard of warnings about BSE, suggested putting the age of cattle on packets of beef would help customers avoid the risk of eating BSE-infected meat.  He said on BBC1's consumer programme Watchdog: "The only thing that might matter is the age of the animal from which the beef has come. If they put on the packet the animal slaughtered was aged one or one-and-a-half, that would be much better than age seven."  <p>  <p>Professor Lacey, who has warned BSE-related diseases could spread from animals to humans since the late 1980s, added most beef products come from older animals, the ones most at risk.  <p>  <p>He said the statement by the Health Secretary Stephen Dorrell was meaningless. "I presume it might mean that one burger is safe, 10 - probably safe, 100 - probably safe, 1,000 - might be dangerous."  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>New scare as government admits link between CJD deaths and eating BSE-infected meat </b><br><br><br><b><h2>26 March 1996</h2></b><br><h2>In a stew about beef  </h2>
  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Richard Doughty</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>Ten years after the first case of mad cow disease (BSE) was identified in Britain, the Government last week announced that there may be a link with the human illness, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD).  <p>  <p><b>What is mad cow disease?</b>  <p>  <p>Mad cow disease (bovine spongiform encephalopathy) was first identified by scientists in 1986, following the death in 1985 of a previously healthy Holstein dairy cow on a British farm. It had suddenly become edgy and unable to control its movements. Scientists later found that its brain was full of holes, like a sponge.  <p>  <p><b>How widespread is the disease?</b><p>By 1987 there were 20 cases of BSE and by mid-1988 731 cases on 590 farms across Britain and the Channel Islands. By 1991 there were 1,500 cases a week; numbers are currently 300 a week.  <p>  <p><b>Where does it come from?</b>  <p>  <p>No one knows exactly, but the now outlawed practice of feeding cattle with the treated carcases of other animals, including sheep, is thought by many to have caused BSE in cows. The disease is similar to scrapie, a disease that affects sheep's brains.  <p>  <p>In the 1970s and 1980s animal feed manufacturers were adding animal remains and fishmeal to cattle feeds in order to boost their protein content. Sheep remains were used in greater quantities in the early 1980s, when the price of fishmeal rose sharply.  <p>  <p>Scientists believe that cattle ate feed infected with scrapie, and contracted BSE as a result.  <p>  <p><b>How is BSE connected with CJD?</b>  <p>  <p>BSE also closely resembles CJD, a fatal human disease, with symptoms including depression, loss of balance, uncontrolled body movement and loss of memory. Some scientists believe that, in the same way as cattle have contracted BSE by eating sheep infected with scrapie, so some humans could have contracted CJD by eating beef infected with BSE.  <p>  <p><b>What is known about CJD?</b>  <p>  <p>Until recently CJD has been a rare disease which kills about one person in a million, as far as doctors know. It has tended to affect older people and is one of a group of diseases which involves the degeneration of the nerve cells and the production of deposits of prime protein. In CJD this happens in the brain.  <p>  <p><b>What has the Government done to prevent the spread of BSE?</b>  <p>  <p>In 1988 the Government set up a committee to assess BSE, which led to a law requiring the slaughter of all infected animals. But after its investigation, the committee said it was most unlikely that BSE would affect humans. In 1989 the Government introduced a ban on offal sales but until last week ministers were saying that there was no conceivable risk in eating beef.  <p>  <p><b>Why are people getting so worried at the moment?</b>  <p>  <p>New research by a group of specialists into the deaths from CJD of 10 people, who were younger than the usual age of CJD victims, has concluded that it is likely that these cases are linked to exposure to BSE before the introduction of the Government's 1989 offal ban. Experiments have now shown that BSE is only found in the brain and spinal cord, not muscle. Nevertheless anyone who ate beef offal in the years before 1989 may be at risk of contracting the disease. The incubation for the disease is between five and 15 years, so we may be seeing the first few cases of an epidemic.   <p>  <p><b>What is the Government doing now?</b>  <p>  <p>The Government has now announced special regulations for cutting up carcases of cattle aged over 30 months; banned all meat and bonemeal in feed for farm animals; and set up an immediate &#163;4.5m research programme into possible links between BSE and CJD.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>50th anniversary of 'Letter from America'</b><br><br><br><b><h2>25 March 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Cooke's grand tour takes a 50th birthday flashback and gets ready to move on  </h2>
  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Vivek Chaudhary</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>It was originally scheduled for a 13-week run, the brainchild of an aspiring BBC journalist looking to broadcast a series of talks on life in America after the end of the second world war.  <p>  <p>Yesterday, veteran journalist Alistair Cooke turned the clock back half a century, marking the 50th anniversary of his 'Letter from America' by re-reading the very first of his legendary 15-minute BBC talks. Mr Cooke, now aged 87, began yesterday's letter by explaining to listeners the context within which his first talk was written in 1946. Mr Cooke had just returned to the US from a sobering month-long visit to London, where he encountered chronic food shortages and long queues. He told listeners yesterday: "I think I ought to fill in the dark, bleak background of Britain in early 1946, otherwise you will wonder at the obsession in this talk of food and clothing and the desperate ways of procuring them.  <p>  <p>"In Britain, the winter of 1945/46 was the hardest to bear, not only because of ferocious weather but because during the war the American government under President Roosevelt had voted to send to Britain millions of tons of food and billions of dollars in loans to finance the making of all the weapons of war. But the day after the Japanese surrender in August 1945, President Truman suspended all this so-called lend-lease aid. "My trip to London was frankly a shocker. There was everywhere a dire shortage of heat and electricity, coal, food. Soap was a luxury." The letter became the first of 2,458 broadcasts by Mr Cooke about his adopted homeland, which is regularly heard by more than a million listeners in Britain alone.  <p>  <p>In his first letter, Mr Cooke spoke of leaving Britain aboard an ocean liner filled with thousands of war brides "weeping like mad" and waving handkerchiefs "in an unbroken line, like washing day in Manchester or Leeds". He spoke of shortages of nylons, bread, meat and butter in America, and the long queues for basic items.  <p>  <p>Born in 1908, Mr Cooke was educated at Jesus College, Cambridge. He joined the BBC in 1934 as a film critic but as the winner of a Commonwealth Fellowship, he had travelled throughout America in the summer of 1933 and fell in love with its landscape and people. In 1941 he became a US citizen. Mr Cooke's soothing, deadpan style and eye for detail have earned him a worldwide audience estimated at 34 million.  <p>  <p>He still writes his scripts on a manual typewriter in his New York apartment, doing the corrections by hand.  <p>  <p>At the end of yesterday's broadcast, Mr Cooke vouchsafed that a journalist had recently asked him if the BBC had asked him to retire and whether he planned to. He told listeners: "I said the answer was no and no. I've noticed if you retire you keel over."  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>First patient fitted with artificial heart, Abel Goodman dies</b><br><br><br><b><h2>26 March 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Artificial heart man dies</h2><h3>Procedure thrown into doubt after Oxford hospital has to remove pump because of internal bleeding  </h3>  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Edward Pilkington</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>A man whose doctors claimed he was the first patient in the world to be fitted with a permanent electric heart has died, 30 hours after the battery-powered pump was removed from his body.  <p>  <p>Surgeons at the John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, operated on Abel Goodman on Saturday to take out the device after signs of internal bleeding. The patient's own heart had shown a "remarkable recovery" since the implant five months ago and was considered capable of working alone. However, Mr Goodman, aged 64, died on Sunday night after suffering a "sudden and unpredictable" change in heart rhythm. He leaves a wife and two children.  <p>  <p>Mr Goodman's death is a blow for the hospital, which has been trying to develop an electrically-powered heart as an alternative to human donor organs, which are in short supply. He died four days after a similar heart was implanted in another man at the John Radcliffe. The patient, who has not been identified, was described yesterday as "stable and satisfactory". When Mr Goodman's titanium heart was implanted last October his surgeon, Stephen Westaby, said he could expect a normal life. However, Mr Goodman was plagued by infection and never returned home.  <p>  <p>Mr Goodman, a retired film producer, volunteered to try the new procedure having been told he was too old for a transplant and had six months to live. After the implant he said: "It seemed the only way forward - there was no choice."  <p>  <p>He was the fourth patient to die in Britain after being implanted with an electronic heart. The other three were all treated at Papworth Hospital, Cambridge, which yesterday condemned the John Radcliffe, accusing it of "hype".  <p>  <p>John Wallwork, a heart surgeon who has led Cambridge's research said that, contrary to media reports, it was Papworth that first implanted a permanent artificial heart 18 months ago. Previously, such implants were temporary devices for patients awaiting donor organs.  "The only difference between what we did and what Oxford has done is in the type of pump used. They had a Vauxhall Cavalier, we had a Ford Mondeo - so what?" Mr Wallwork said.  <p>  <p>Papworth made its first permanent trial of the heart on Arthur Cornhill, aged 63, in August 1994. He returned home for several months, but died nine months later.  <p>  <p>Mr Wallwork said Mr Goodman's death underlined the need for a proper trial to evaluate the procedure. Papworth is planning a Europe-wide trial comparing medical treatment of heart patients with the use of mechanical hearts. A further trial is expected soon in the United States.   <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Nottingham business group aims to dump town's Robin Hood image </b><br><br><br><b><h2>26 March 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Robin Hood on run from PR men  </h2>
  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Martin Wainwright</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>The Sheriff of Nottingham is riding to the rescue of his old antagonist Robin Hood, after an attempt by business and PR executives to dump the man who gave taxation a warm and friendly image.  Companies and export specialists in the Midlands city are hoping to oust the green-jerkined bowman as their civic symbol, on the grounds that he gives the wrong impression to potential, money-minded investors.  <p>  <p>The Nottingham Partnership - comprising businesses, the city's two universities and the local council - has decided that Robin is "soft imaging" and a PR lightweight, for all the havoc attributed to his stave and longbow.  <p>  <p>"We have to find a way of promoting what we have to offer, to attract wealth-generating activity in competition with all the other UK and European regions," said Alaistair Eperon, director of corporate affairs at Boots, the city's biggest firm.  He added: "Nottingham has on offer a lot of very good things, but none of them has much to do with Robin Hood - that is the problem."  <p>  <p>Bob White, the city council's director of corporate affairs, said that Robin was a difficult symbol to adapt to 21st century Europe.  <p>  <p>The partnership, which is backing its claim with research and surveys, hopes for a new symbol by August. The delay is offering time for a fightback, led by the current Sheriff of Nottingham, Roy Greensmith.  He said yesterday: "The legend of Robin Hood is of a person with a soul and a civic conscience, a man who robbed the rich to give to the poor. That is rather out of fashion these days. But can we really afford to give him up? I don't think so - not just for tourism but for business."  <p>  <p>The move also brought an immediate bid for Robin from Pontefract, where the author Brian Lewis has fought a long campaign to restore the outlaw to his more likely stamping ground of South Yorkshire. "At last, Nottingham has given up its long fantasy," he said. "We look forward to welcoming Robin back to where he really belongs."    <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Queen opens her website</b><br><br><br><b><h2>1 April 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Royal web war feared as  Queen sets up site in cyberspace</h2>  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Nick Davis</b><br><br>      <p>  The Queen took her critics by surprise yesterday by taking her first steps into cyberspace.  Buckingham Palace announced that she has opened her own website on the Internet, false footing those  who have dismissed the monarchy as an anachronism in the age of the infobahn.  <p>  <p>In a welcome message on her new home page, at <A  HREF="http://www.windsor.co.uk">http://www.windsor.co.uk</A>, the Queen says: "It is our hope that  these electronic pages will bring us closer to the lives and interests of our younger subjects."  <p>  <p>The website offers computer users an interactive tour of Buckingham Palace, a quiz about the  history of the royal family and pages about royal pursuits. The Queen's move into cyberspace won  immediate support from Tory backbencher Sir Nigel Howton, whose Norfolk constituency borders on Royal  properties at Sandringham. "One advantage is that she can speak directly to her people - without Fleet  Street distorting the message," he said.  <p>  <p>But some of the first to connect up with the site believe she may have been given bad advice. "It  is superficially attractive," said Jack Scholfeld, editor of Computing Age, "but there are huge holes  in the subjects her web pages cover - loads about royal finances going right and virtually nothing  about royal marriages going wrong. Princess Di doesn't seem to exist in the virtual monarchy."  <p>  <p>However, friends of Princess Diana are setting up a website in what looks like an effort to start  a 'web war'. Jo-Jo Williams, self-styled 'Prince of the Net Surfers,' said: "Princess Di will be queen  in our cyberspace and Charles will feel as though he has fallen into a black hole."   <p>  <p>But more seasoned royal war watchers thought the Queen had subtler ambitions than stealing the limelight, noticing that  her website offers her virtual subjects the chance to swear an oath of fealty in an 'on-line  audience'. Buckingham Palace has plans to confer honours on virtual subjects - and the Queen will not  need to confer with her Prime Minister. "It is as if Her Majesty has regained all those powers which,  over centuries, Parliament has abrogated," said Lord Fawsley, an authority on the constitution. "Now  she can demonstrate - albeit in a virtual world - the enduring strength of monarchical government."  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Ian Katz</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>The FBI appeared to have made a huge breakthrough in its 18-year hunt for a technophobic serial bomber yesterday when federal agents detained a former university professor they believe may be the so-called Unabomber. Theodore Kaczynski, understood to be a Harvard graduate and an academic at the University of California, at Berkeley, was reportedly taken into custody when he tried to prevent agents from searching his home in a remote area near Lincoln, Montana.  <p>  <p>It is believed that the FBI had been monitoring him for several weeks. Agents reportedly zeroed in on him after a lawyer approached the FBI in Washington on behalf of a man who feared the Unabomber might be his brother. The ingenious terrorist has mocked his pursuers for almost two decades, killing three people and injuring 23 in his sporadic bombing campaign against academics and executives associated with technology. In the most bizarre twist of the Unabomber saga, two of America's most respected newspapers, the New York Times and the Washington Post, in September published a 35,000 word 'manifesto' written by the bomber. Since then a huge FBI task force has enlisted the help of more than 60 academics in the hope of identifying the bomber's intellectual fingerprints. The agency also offered a $1m reward.  <p>  <p>According to reports yesterday, agents sought permission to search the Chicago home of the suspect's family after receiving a tip-off. They are said to have found documents and other material linking the man to the explosions.  <p>  <p>The bomber was dubbed Unabomber in the late Seventies because of his choice of targets. His devices have become increasingly sophisticated since a crude pipe bomb injured a security guard at Northwestern University, Illinois, in 1978.  <p>  <p>The hunt for him has been frustrated by the fact that he has been spotted only once, while planting a bomb in a Salt Lake City car park. He did not strike after that for several years.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Unabomber suspect, Theodore Kaczynsk, held</b><br><br><br><b><h2>5 April  1996</h2></b><br><h2>Misfit's lonely downfall</h2><h3>FBI agents believe they have finally caught up with a  serial bomber  </h2>
  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Ian Katz</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>By yesterday morning the pieces were sliding into place like parts of a jigsaw. He was a brilliant  mathematician who abandoned academia for a hermit-like existence. He lived in a tiny, hand-built cabin  without electricity or running water. He spoke little and read voraciously. The description of  Theodore Kaczynski could hardly have matched the profile drawn up by the FBI any better. Long before  the former Berkeley professor, aged 53, was charged in a Montana courtroom with possessing an  unregistered firearm - specifically, components from which an explosive device could be assembled -  agents who had hunted a technophobic serial bomber for almost two decades were convinced they had the  Unabomber.  <p>  <p>Perhaps only in Montana, a tolerant haven for eccentrics and extremists such as the so-called  Freemen holed up in a ranch several miles to the east, could the intense, bearded recluse have failed  to arouse suspicion. So disdainful of motorised transport was he that he rode everywhere on an old  bicycle fitted with homemade snow tires.  <p>  <p>Mr Kaczynski's arrest as he resisted a search of his cabin by FBI agents on Wednesday appeared to  have ended one of the most expensive and humiliating manhunts in American history.  <p>  <p>Ever since a primitive bomb exploded at Northwestern University in May 1978 injuring a security  guard, an army of agents had criss-crossed the country, always seemingly a step behind the bomber  whose campaign cost the lives of three people and maimed 23 others.  <p>  <p>In one of his many letters to newspapers, the bomber even took the trouble to taunt his pursuers:  "It doesn't appear the FBI is going to catch us any time soon," he wrote. "The FBI is a joke."  <p>  <p>In the end, it was not the thousands of hours spent combing library records, questioning academics,  or visiting scrap metal yards that led investigators to Mr Kaczynski's cabin outside the tiny town of  Lincoln. The 18-year-old case was broken by a stroke of luck.  <p>  <p>According to law enforcement sources, members of Mr Kaczynski's family became suspicious two months  ago when clearing out their bungalow in Chicago. Among the suspect's effects, they found a collection  of writings uncannily similar to the 35,000-word 'manifesto' published by the Washington Post and New  York Times in September.  <p>  <p>Fearing the worst, Mr Kaczynski's brother contacted the FBI. A search of the family home turned up  more clues, but even after weeks of painstaking surveillance, investigators said they did not have  enough evidence to arrest the former academic. That changed when agents searched his cabin on  Wednesday. According to the New York Times, they found explosive materials and bomb-making equipment.  <p>  <p>As agents had long suspected of the bomber, Mr Kaczynski had once lived in Chicago, northern  California and Utah. The suspect was described as a broody loner who was all but self-sufficient. He  spoke in enigmatically incomplete sentences.  <p>  <p>The young Mr Kaczynski was remembered as distinctly unmemorable. He passed quickly through high  school, winning a scholarship to study mathematics at Harvard University, before moving to the  University of Michigan to study for a doctorate.  <p>  <p>It was the mid-Sixties, and the Michigan campus was a cradle of student radicalism. But Mr  Kaczynski was remembered more for his academic achievements. The suspect's prefered intellectual  terrain was the recondite area of so-called 'complex analysis'.  <p>  <p>George Pirnaian, a mathematics professor who taught him, said: "He was a very able, very serious  student and he solved a very difficult problem in his thesis."  <p>  <p>After earning his doctorate, Mr Kaczynski took a job as an acting assistant professor at the  University of California at Berkeley, another hotbed of leftwing activism. After teaching mathematics  for two years, he resigned for unknown reasons.  <p>  <p>His path after leaving academia is less clear. According to reports yesterday, he took a succession  of odd-jobs as he wandered round the country. For a period around 1990, agents believe he lived in a  remote Afghanistan village.  <p>  <p>With his bizarre Luddite credo and fiendish bomb-making skills, the Unabomber has surpassed the  most notorious serial bomber in American history, the so-called Mad Bomber, George Metesky, whose  pursuers grudgingly admitted their admiration for his intelligence and craftsmanship. Investigators  could have had little idea of the trail of terror that lay ahead when amateurish devices exploded at  two Illinois universities in 1978 and 1979. Agents began to suspect that they might be dealing with a  serial bomber in November 1979 when a device exploded in the hold of an American Airlines flight to  Washington, without causing injury. Because his targets had been linked with universities and  airlines, they dubbed the case 'Unabomb'.  <p>  <p>The bomber struck regularly in the early Eighties. In 1980, the United Airlines president, Percy Wood,  was injured opening a package at his Chicago home. A Berkeley professor received one two years later.  In 1985, two people were maimed at the University of Michigan. Later that year, the bomber killed for  the first time. His victim was Hugh Scrutton, the owner of a computer store in Sacramento, California.  <p>  <p>The bomber appeared to have broadened his range of targets, but investigators still saw a pattern:  individuals linked with technology - in particular computers. They speculated Unabomber may have lost  his job to a computer.  <p>  <p>But the bombs themselves were a window on the Unabomber's personality, crafted from everyday items  such as scrap wood and lamp wire. Metal parts appeared to have been polished, and some even numbered.  <p>  <p>"He's doing these things not because he has to, but because he enjoys it or feels a compulsion to  do it," a retired FBI bomb expert who helped hunt the Unabomber for 14 years said. "I picture someone  bent over a bench late at night tinkering with the things. He may even be talking to himself while he  makes them."  <p>  <p>Frequently investigators manage to track down bombers through the rare components used in their  devices, but the Unabomber made everything himself. The agents hunting him with increasing desperation  got their first breakthough in 1987, when a man in a hooded sweatshirt and sunglasses was spotted  leaving what later proved to be a bomb in a Salt Lake City car park. They now had a sketch of their  suspect, but the bomber simply disappeared, stopping his attacks for six years.  <p>  <p>By the time a San Francisco geneticist was injured by one of his devices in June 1993, agents  conceded privately that their sketch was all but obsolete. The Unabomber resumed his campaign in  December 1994, mailing a bomb that killed an advertising executive, Thomas Mosser, in New Jersey. Four  months later, another device killed Gilbert Murray, head of a lobbying company which had worked for  the timber trade.  <p>  <p>The killing fuelled speculation about one aspect of the case. The Unabomber appeared to have a  fascination for wood: almost all his devices had some wooden parts.  <p>  <p>In April 1995, the Unabomber wrote to the New York Times declaring that he was an anarchist. He  announced that he was "getting tired of making bombs" and proposed a Faustian bargain: if the New York  Times and Washington Post would publish his 35,000-word manifesto, he would stop.  <p>  <p>The rambling diatribe eventually published by the Washington Post provided investigators with a  treasure trove of clues. In his rant, the bomber cited a small library of abstruse texts. Agents  combed university library lists to find out who had borrowed titles such as 'Chinese Political Thought  in the 20th Century'.  <p>  <p>Meanwhile, the manifesto earned the Unabomber an almost cult status in America's growing  technophobic counter-culture. "He has become one of those emblems of 20th-century America," says Gar  Smith, a radical environmentalist, in a forthcoming documentary to be broadcast on Channel 4. The FBI showed copies  of the manifesto to dozens of academics in an effort to identify the Unabomber - but the suspect's own  family appears to have beaten them to it.  <p>  <p>In Lincoln yesterday, most people who knew him were still shaking their heads in disbelief.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Cunard liner Royal Viking Sun hits a coral reef in Red Sea</b><br><br><br><b><h2>5 April  1996</h2></b><br><h2>World's top liner adrift with 1,000 aboard after collision  </h2>
  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Barbie Dutter</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>A luxury cruise liner with around 1,000 people on board was adrift without engine power in the Red  Sea early today after being holed when it hit an unidentified object. The Royal Viking Sun, owned by Cunard Line, began listing and taking in water after the collision  as it entered the Gulf of Aqaba, between Egypt and Jordan.  <p>  <p>The eight-year-old ship, which boasts five-star facilities and is the world's top-rated liner, was  part-way through a 114-day world cruise for which passengers had paid at least &#163;20,000 each.  <p>  <p>Bill Spears, Cunard's public relations director, said from New York that there was no panic on  board and the situation was "under control". "The ship is in no immediate danger and nor are the  passengers and crew," said Mr Spears.  <p>  <p>"The ship is drifting but the seas are calm. She hit a submerged object and has lost main  propulsion because of the water which entered the generating room and the engine room. But we have now  pumped quite a lot of it out and we have emergency power which is keeping services such as the pumps  operating."  <p>  <p>The 37,845-tonne, 669ft-long Royal Viking Sun had been heading towards the Jordanian port of Aqaba  on a trip from the Yemen. There were 500 passengers on board, mostly British, American and Australian,  and an international crew of a similar number.  <p>  <p>Two tugs were sent from Aqaba and were due to reach the ship by midday today to tow the liner to  the most accessible port and allow the passengers to disembark.  <p>  <p>Mr Spears said there was no indication of the nature of the object which holed the ship.  <p>  <p>A rescue service spokesman said: "The situation is stable, the list has been corrected and the  water is being pumped out. She has lost her main engines and is drifting but there are other vessels close by that will  assist."  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Cunard liner Royal Viking Sun hits a coral reef in Red Sea</b><br><br><br><b><h2>6 April  1996</h2></b><br><h2>Passengers fly home as holed Cunard liner abandons voyage</h2><h3>Coral reef blamed for  leaving Royal Viking Sun adrift in Red Sea with 950 on board  </h2>
  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>John Duncan</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>Fifty-four Britons among the 950 people stranded when the Cunard-owned liner Royal Viking Sun hit a  coral reef in the Red Sea fly home today after an abrupt end to their &#163;21,500 world cruise. Cunard confirmed yesterday that the cruise was being abandoned and compensation would be paid to  passengers for the remainder of the 116-day trip.  <p>  <p>The Britons were among 527 passengers and 450 crew towed into the Egyptian port of Sharm el-Sheikh  after the 37,845-tonne ship hit 'an underwater object' on Thursday night and lost power.  <p>  <p>Passengers had to don lifejackets and go to lifeboat stations after the liner took on water and  began to list. The lifeboats were swung out over the water, but were not needed as water was pumped out and the  crew managed to stabilise the list after an hour, and power up reserve generators. Two tugs were sent  from the Jordanian port of Aqaba. An evacuation ship was also sent but not used.  <p>  <p>Officials at the Mohammed nature reserve, a protected area of coral reefs off the southern tip of  the Sinai peninsula, said radio messages from the ship made clear it had struck coral.  <p>  <p>The incident happened just outside the nature reserve boundaries, and the reserve is sending a team  to assess damage.  <p>  <p>A spokesman from the international control centre in Stavanger, Norway, which co-ordinated the  operation, said: "It must have been frightening for a time."  <p>  <p>The crash tore a three-yard hole in the hull and some water initially went into some cabins. "We felt a jolt, it was a terrible jolt," said Geoff Edwards, a passenger from Palm Springs,  California. "There were a bunch of people singing on stage and they all went down like dominoes.  That's how big a jolt it was." "The passengers are all safe," a Cunard spokesman said. "There are  absolutely no injuries. They are reasonably happy, considering what they have been through."  <p>  <p>The passengers were put up in hotels in Cairo and Sharm el-Sheikh last night.  <p>  <p>Their round-the-world cruise began at Fort Lauderdale, Florida, in early January, and had been due  to end at the same place on 29 April. The voyage was the second failed Cunard cruise for about 120 of  the passengers, who had been aboard the liner Sagafjord last month when an engine room fire left it  drifting in the South China Sea.  <p>  <p>Cunard's public image first took a knock in the QE2's disastrous 'Cruise from Hell' in December  1994. A sailing from Southampton to New York went ahead before a big renovation was completed, and  passengers were left fuming over 'exploding toilets' and corridors that they said looked like building  sites.  <p>  <p>In November Cunard agreed to pay a total of &#163;7.5m in refunds and travel credits to passengers  on that cruise.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p><b>Succession of mishaps undermines cruise firm</b>  <p>  <p>Cunard has run into troubled waters in recent years. The firm reported a &#163;16.5m deficit last year and chief executive Peter Ward warned it is unlikely to break even until 1998. In March, the Norwegian group  Kvaerner bid &#163;904m for Cunard's parent Trafalgar House, sparking speculation that the shipping  company and its flagship QE2 could be put up for sale.  <p>  <p>In February, the liner Sagafjord lost power after a fire in the South China Sea with 500 passengers  on a world cruise. It was towed to the Philippines. Last year port officials in Southampton condemned  food hygiene on board the QE2 after an inspection of the ship's Queen's Grill.  <p>  <p>Cunard was forced to pay &#163;7.5m compensation to QE2 passengers after a trip, dubbed the 'Cruise  from Hell', in December 1994. US coastguards accused the company of putting passengers' lives at risk  during the cruise and said the ship should never have set sail. In 1993, Cunard was fined &#163;1,000  after complaints that a cruise advertised as a two-day trip lasted only 38 hours.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Drug tests introduced at Eton</b><br><br><br><b><h2>6 April 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Eton headmaster  brings in drug tests  </h2>
  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Alex Bellos</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>Eton public school has introduced drug testing. Headmaster John Lewis's decision, announced in the  end-of-term newsletter, comes a year after a series of drugs scandals at the school.  <p>  <p>Eton is the most famous of a growing number of private schools, including Marlborough, Sevenoaks  and Ardingly, that tests pupils suspected of taking drugs as a means of deterrence.  <p>  <p>Mr Lewis told parents: "The headmaster may require any boy to submit to a urine or other  appropriate test whether on suspicion of the use of illicit drugs or other harmful substances, or at  his sole discretion, and may cause a search to be carried out of any boy's personal possessions or  room." He also reminded pupils that discipline can be breached at holidays and weekends. Even though  drug-taking was not mentioned explicitly, it is widely understood to mean that pupils may be tested  for what they may have experimented with outside the school gates.  <p>  <p>John Sutton, general secretary of the Secondary Heads Association, said many boarding schools felt  obliged to introduce anti-drugs measures to protect their reputations. Tales of drugs at public  schools were more likely to make tabloid newspaper headlines than similar stories at state schools. Mr  Sutton added that boarding schools also had to take precautions because, unlike day schools, they  stood in loco parentis and had legal responsibilities. Last year Eton, which is situated in Berkshire,  was one of many prominent public schools to expel pupils. Four Etonians were arrested outside a London  nightclub after they were seen handling ecstasy tablets, although no charges were brought.  <p>  <p>One parent of a former Etonian said yesterday that she was aware of drug use at the school,  predominantly cannabis and ecstasy.  <p>  <p>Ewa Lewis, social editor of the Tatler magazine, said: "Recreational drugs are now very fashionable  whether you go to Eton or Walthamstow High. It is prevalent in all schools. People seem to think that  the upper classes are some sort of dinosaur breed. They have exactly the same culture and fashions of  any other children.  <p>  <p>"Just because these children are at public school it doesn't mean they have pocketfuls of cash.  They haven't. Most are on very tight allowances. Most don't get the chance to work on a paper round or  on the weekend."   <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Blunder over faulty HIV test</b><br><br><br><b><h2>6 April 1996</h2></b><br><h2>'Blunder' over  faulty HIV test</h2><h3> Callers besiege Aids agencies  </h2>
  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Vivek Chaudhary</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>The Government was last night facing fierce criticism over its handling of the HIV testing scare,  as tens of thousands of people anxiously awaited new results to see whether they are clear of the Aids  virus. Aids counselling agencies were besieged by worried callers after reports emerged of a fault in the  test, which is manufactured by the American-based multi-national Abbott Laboratories.  <p>  <p>Up to 40,000 people in Britain could have received a negative result over the past six months.  They, and thousands more across Europe, will have to be re-tested following the disclosure that the  method used was faulty. The Department of Health was criticised for not publicising the fault sooner  and allowing news to seep out via the media during the Easter holiday break, when many clinics and  Aids counselling agencies are closed.  <p>  <p>Harriet Harman, the shadow health secretary, said the fears of those caught up in the scare were  exacerbated by not being able to talk to people in authority over the weekend. She called for a fax to be sent to all hospitals, rather than GPs, giving full information on the  situation so that the public can get details easily, and for a designated hospital in each area for  people to be re-tested if necessary.  <p>  <p>Simon Hughes, Liberal Democrat health spokesman, said: "It would be wrong to panic but it is right  to be concerned."  <p>  <p>Susie Parsons, executive director of London Lighthouse, Europe's largest centre for people  suffering from the HIV virus, said her organisation had been informed that up to 200 people who  originally tested negative could be positive. Ms Parsons added: "We have had hundreds of calls from people who are obviously very worried. We are  the largest HIV centre in Europe but we first heard about the fault through the media. The Department  of Health has not given us any guidance or warnings. We can't believe the lack of information that  Aids counselling agencies have received. We are advising people to ring the centre that did their  test."  <p>  <p>Dr Graham Winyard, the Deputy Chief Medical Officer, expressed his "deep regret" for the way the  information had got out through the press. But he insisted the chances of a wrong diagnosis were  "very, very tiny". "We were planning to make the situation public next week when more detailed  arrangements could have been made," he told BBC Radio. "It's unfortunate that this has come out now  and led to a lot of unnecessary distress. "This is a very rare fault in the test. The majority of  people who had negative tests will remain negative."  <p>  <p>Laboratories across Britain and Europe were warned of the fault by the Chicago-based Abbott  Laboratories on 29 March. Spokesman Mat Kuhn said the company stopped distributing the tests on 25  March. He added: "We took the action following reports of a small number of inaccurate results. We  informed all our customers and relevant health authorities across Europe and we are working with them  to resolve the situation."  <p>  <p>Blood samples from those tested negative since 25 September 1995, when this particular form of the  Abbott test was introduced, are being re-tested and it could take up to a month before new results are  released. So far three incorrect test results have been identified in Britain, four in Germany and two  in France.  <p>  <p>The Dutch health ministry said about 50,000 people would have to be re-tested. The German health  ministry said 650,000 of the two million affected tests had already been sold. Italian, Swedish and  Danish medical authorities have also ordered re-testing.  <p>  <p>The fault is thought to have been discovered by a Portsmouth doctor who noticed a negative result  for somebody who clearly had Aids.   <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Stuart Millar</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>It was an announcement that Oasis stars Liam and Noel Gallagher could have done without. To the dismay of fans, their proud mum yesterday revealed that the icons of bad behaviour were actually sensitive souls who always put their family first.  <p>  <p>Margaret Gallagher leapt to the defence of her sons after Greater Manchester police confirmed they were investigating claims that they used to burgle houses and steal cars before their band took the music world by storm. In an interview with the music paper Melody Maker last month, songwriter and guitarist Noel said: "What people have got to understand is that we are lads. We have burgled houses and nicked car stereos, and we like girls and we swear and we go to the football and take the piss."  <p>  <p>But Mrs Gallagher, who raised her boys single-handed in Burnage, Greater Manchester, insisted they were nice, thoughtful lads who loved their mother. She said she would have known if they had been involved in crime as they had lived at home with her. Noel only moved out when he was 23. "As far as I know they were never involved in any crime. They were just normal boys. "They get a lot of bad publicity. Really they are very thoughtful and kind and all they think about are their family and friends."  <p>  <p>But Sir Wyn Roberts, Tory MP for Conwy, said: "If they are owning up to burgling, perhaps they would help the police by letting them know which houses they burgled."  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Mrs Gallagher and famous names pledge support for Oasis</b><br><br><br><b><h2>29 April 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Oasis play Maine Road, Manchester  </h3>  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Caroline Sullivan</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>What Oasis did next: played to 78,000 people at the Manchester City football ground over the  weekend. The two shows, which sold out in an hour, were ostensibly to thank fans for making them the  biggest British band of the last 10 years, but there was doubtless an ulterior motive. It would not be  beneath Noel and Our Kid Gallagher to play their beloved team's stadium just for the pleasure of  refusing entry to United players.  <p>  <p>But if Ryan Giggs had turned up, he would have been just another body in the celebrity crush  backstage. Patsy Kensit and a shoal of soap stars headed the guest list, which raises one of the most  perplexing Oasis questions. Why are the rich and beautiful so eager to hob-nob with the strikingly  ordinary Gallagher brothers? Answer that and you'd have the key to the Oasis phenomenon.  <p>  <p>The music, loutishly marvellous as it is, can't be the whole reason that t-shirts were selling at a  rate of 20 per minute on Saturday. Nor can it be their dress sense. It is probably not even Noel's  admission to having been a teenage burglar. Rather, Oasis's secret recipe seems a combination of all the above, plus a meat-eating,  maiden-ravishing virility that inspires girls to go semi-naked on cold spring nights.  <p>  <p>Maine Road is their promotion to the stadium band elite. The 120 personnel involved in the show -  caterers to third violinist - made their days of playing cubbyholes seem far more remote than just two  years ago. Yet the payroll belied the simplicity of the show, which was essentially five men banging  guitars before a black and white logo backdrop. The brief appearances of string and brass sections  aside, the Oases used none of the special effects deemed de rigueur for stadiums. This took guts, as  they aren't dynamic performers. Liam's stage manner, which once consisted of a "You lookin' at me,  poonk?" scowl, now extends to ambling around in sleepy incomprehension - and he's the frontman.  <p>  <p>That it would be great, however, was predestined. Take 15 bumptious tunes familiar from incessant  radio play, add Oasis's arrogance and the drama of a stadium at sunset and it couldn't not feel like  one of the gigs of the year. When Liam sang 'I feel supersonic', you believed him. Anyone would feel  supersonic if 38,000 people were echoing every word of his every song.   <p>  <p>Unexpectedly, the apex wasn't 'Wonderwall', the ballad that helped their 'Morning Glory' album sell eight million copies. Although the  brothers did it as an atypical duet, it was surpassed by 'Roll With It'. Deservedly so, too, because for  brainless exhilaration it is unmatched by any other pop song this decade.

  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Philip Van</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>The United States government prepared to evacuate dozens of foreign nationals from war in the  Liberian capital yesterday amid intense combat between rival warlord factions which reduced the city  to anarchy. As buildings in Monrovia burned, tens of thousands of people streamed into the diplomatic  enclave of Mamba on the southern tip of the city, seeking refuge in the US embassy compound. Looting  combatants even advanced on this traditional safe haven, and a compound of the United Nations observer  mission was ransacked.  <p>  <p>Dudley Sims, the US embassy spokesman, said more than 40 British, American, Irish, and other  nationals had sought refuge inside the compound. The airport terminal was burning and all roads out of  the city were closed. Helicopters and boats seem the only options for any evacuation. However, three  helicopters at the airport, lent by the US to Ecomog, the West African peacekeeping force in Liberia,  are understood to have been blown up. Hundreds of armed youths rampaged through central Monrovia,  sacking the city. Ecomog troops did nothing to stop the looting; in most cases they were not even  present.  <p>  <p>There were reports late yesterday that Ecomog tanks were finally being deployed in the town centre;  this was too late to stop the destruction. The battle began in the early hours of Saturday, when  police and fighters loyal to the warlords Charles Taylor and Alhaji Kromah stormed the stronghold of a  dissident faction leader, Roosevelt Johnson. The ruling council of state had ordered police to arrest  Gen Johnson on charges of murder after a clash with militia rivals.  <p>  <p>Although Gen Johnson's headquarters in the suburb of Finko was overrun early yesterday by fighters  from Mr Taylor's National Patriotic Front of Liberia (NPFL), members of his Krahn ethnic group put up  stiff opposition elsewhere in the city. Neither side appeared to have total control as street battles  raged.  <p>  <p>Krahn members of the Armed Forces of Liberia (AFL) and the Liberia Peace Committee, another  signatory to the now collapsed peace accord signed last August, threw in their lot with Gen Johnson.  <p>  <p>Mr Taylor's forces launched a ferocious onslaught on the Barclay training centre in central  Monrovia, the military barracks which is the home of the AFL militia. Witnesses said the barracks was  hit yesterday by rocket-propelled grenades. The thud of water and rocket fire was heard outside the  barracks throughout the day.  <p>  <p>Plumes of black smoke hung over the city. People gathered under roadside shelters, huddling  together during occasional wayward bursts from an AK-47. Mr Taylor, a member of the council of state,  who launched Liberia's civil war on Christmas Eve 1989, denied that militia rivalry was at the root of  the fighting.  <p>  <p>"This government, and not Mr Taylor of the NPFL, will do all it can to bring the situation under  control and have General Johnson arrested," he said yesterday.  <p>  <p>Gen Johnson refused to turn himself in, saying the police were biased and had been infiltrated by  the NPFL.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Clashes between rival warlords in Liberian capital, Monrovia</b><br><br><br><b><h2>10 April  1996</h2></b><br><h2>Hunger is the new threat as food runs out in looted city  </h2>
  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Phillip Van</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>Against the insistent rattle of gunfire, people sheltering in Monrovia's diplomatic enclave of  Mamba Point speak of something as threatening as the war: hunger. Once American helicopters airlift Westerners and diplomats, those left behind in the Liberian  capital will have to forage for something to eat in a city whose shelves are bare.  <p>  <p>At the Black and White Entertainment Centre, where Liberians party on Friday nights, there is a  small market. All the stalls have been closed since last Saturday and the only goods available are  being hawked by children: a tiny bag of sugar $3 (&#163;2), a blob of butter &#163;2.  <p>  <p>A small boy carries a red plate of rotten, dried fish, swarming with flies. If the choice between  hunger and dysentery seems a bad one, the search for water is even more thankless. The only fresh water available is down the road, past a known encampment of fighters who let off  volleys of gunfire with their AK-47s. The corpse of a young boy on a nearby beach is a stark reminder  of the risks of stray bullets.  <p>  <p>Hundreds of people congregate on the steps of the peeling two-storey Mamba Point House, once a  mansion and then a public health clinic. It was transformed into a refugee centre four years ago - the  previous time Monrovia was sacked. As if by instinct, dozens of young mothers have fled the fighting to this crumbling stone structure  even though all medical equipment they need to help their babies was looted in 1992. The women hold their babies in the air crying: "We have no food. We have no pure water."  <p>  <p>Henry Newman, an elderly grey-haired man in a suit, shakes his head. "No, we're not scared. We just  want to go home and forget about it all." Until the outbreak of hostilities last Saturday morning, 400  people lived in Mamba Point House. Now the latest estimate is 3,000 people, packing in together on the  concrete floors, with more coming every day. A further 20,000 refugees are being housed at the  American compound up the road. But with this compound also overcrowded, small refugee camps are  springing up throughout the enclave.  <p>  <p>Arthur Major, who insists that the international community take note of the plight of his people,  points down the beach to another pathetic collection of refugees. "We are 100 there. Many children.  You have to do something fast. Don't know how long we're going to be here."  <p>  <p>A soldier from the West African peacekeeping force, (Ecomog), waves as he strolls past in combat  uniform. A woman in the street pulls me aside and says he is not a soldier, but one of the militia  members on surveillance duty. These are the men who hold the lives of ordinary people in their hands now.   <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>David Sharrock</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>Violence erupted on the opening day of the Protestant marching season in Northern Ireland when riot  police fired plastic bullets at loyalist demonstrators wielding petrol bombs during a tense stand-off  over the right to march through a largely Catholic district.  <p>  <p>Five people were injured during yesterday's sporadic clashes, and several shops and businesses on  Belfast's Ormeau Road were damaged as the RUC mounted a day-long blockade to prevent the Protestant  Apprentice Boys organisation from marching across the River Lagan into the Lower Ormeau. Violence  flared four times during the day-long stand-off, notably in the early evening when riot police fired a  volley of plastic bullets into a crowd of 500 demonstrators, and later when plastic bullets were again  fired in an attempt to disperse about 300 people who were still blocking the road.   <p>  <p>Five Catholics were murdered in a bookmaker's shop on the Lower Ormeau by the Ulster Freedom Fighters four years ago.  Since then the Lower Ormeau Concerned Community has orchestrated a campaign to prevent the parades  taking place. The marchers say they had nothing to do with the murders and were simply upholding a  century-old tradition to march into the city centre down a public highway.  <p>  <p>The local Ballynafeigh branch of the Apprentice Boys had been due to parade down the road in south  Belfast - where Catholics have come to outnumber Protestants in the past two decades - at 7.30 in the  morning before making their way to an annual rally in Portadown, Co Armagh.  <p>  <p>But last week the RUC served notice that it would not permit the parade to go ahead, citing the  threat of serious public disturbance as the reason. For much of the day, barring two scuffles, the  Apprentice Boys maintained a dignified vigil at the Ormeau Bridge, which was sealed before dawn by  police armoured Land-Rovers.  <p>  <p>In the afternoon the Rev Ian Paisley, Democratic Unionist Party leader, arrived at the bridge in an  apparent attempt to negotiate a settlement. But he left without making any comment amid some  barracking from the demonstrators.  <p>  <p>At about 5pm it looked as if the demonstration was about to break up peacefully, but Apprentice  Boys returning from their rally in Portadown 30 miles away began swelling the numbers. Some of those present seemed determined to stage a repeat of last July's three-day stand-off  between police and Orangemen in Portadown, in what became known as the Siege of Dumcree, after an  Orange parade was banned from going down a Catholic road.  <p>  <p>More plastic bullets were fired when demonstrators began smashing their way into a tyre depot. Side  streets were sealed off.  <p>  <p>Defending the officers' action, Ronnie Flanagan, the deputy chief constable, said outside elements  were to blame for the trouble. "Many of them were quite obviously the worse for drink," he said.  <p>  <p>Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland Secretary, said: "The disgraceful attacks on the police  are the work of people intent on violent confrontation and disorder. They followed a peaceful demonstration this morning. I utterly condemn them as will everyone in  Northern Ireland who believes in peaceful and democratic methods."  <p>  <p>As the evening wore on, more Protestant bands arrived, marching up and down the road and playing a  medley of loyalist songs.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Alliance of Germany, France and European Commission pressurise UK to rejoin ERM  </b><br><br><br><b><h2>9 April 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Britain faces ERM threat  </h2>
  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Ian Traynor</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>An alliance of Germany, France and the European Commission is seeking to pressurise Britain into  rejoining an overhauled Exchange Rate Mechanism in a move which will inflame Tory party divisions over  Europe. Refusal to put the pound into a new currency framework could result in trade sanctions or financial  penalties being imposed on Britain, the Chancellor, Kenneth Clarke, will be warned at a meeting of  European Union finance ministers later this week.  <p>  <p>Although Mr Clarke will attempt to fend off moves by Britain's European partners to force the pace  on closer currency ties, the ambush at Friday's meeting is certain to infuriate Tory Euro-sceptics.  <p>  <p>Backed by the commission and Frankfurt-based European Monetary Institute (EMI) - the forerunner of  a European central bank which would set EU-wide interest rates - the Franco-German alliance intends to  punish Britain if sterling devalues outside a new system. The sanctions could include discrimination on goods and services exported by Britain to the  Continent and fines in the form of higher EU budget contributions.  <p>  <p>Such a move could damage the single European market and represent a breach of the principle of free  trade across national borders in the EU. Euro-sceptics regard Britain's departure from the ERM on  'Black Wednesday' in September 1992 as the turning point in the revival of the British economy.  Interest rates have fallen dramatically since, while the weaker pound has given British exporters a  competitive boost at the expense of European and world rivals.  <p>  <p>Bill Cash, Conservative MP for Stafford, said: "Any attempt to bully Britain into another exchange  rate mechanism by imposing sanctions must be vetoed. The Prime Minister would be expected to give  instructions to Kenneth Clarke to tell the other countries where to get off."  <p>  <p>Friday's meeting is aimed at resolving the issue of how the future single European currency will be  linked to the currencies of EU member states which stay outside. Despite economic problems across  Europe, some countries still believe the 'euro' could be established by 1 January 1999.  <p>  <p>Heartened by the cabinet decision last week to agree to hold a referendum before adopting the euro,  Tory Euro-sceptics - who see a single currency as leading inevitably to political union - will demand  that Mr Clarke reject pressure for an early decision to rejoin the ERM.  <p>  <p>German and French officials met last month to fine-tune their views ahead of the meeting in Verona,  northern Italy.  <p>  <p>Last week central bank governors met in Frankfurt to agree proposals to be put to the meeting by  Alexandre Lamfalussy, head of the EMI. Last week's annual report from the EMI said exchange rates in  the EU were a matter of 'common interest' and Mr Lamfalussy said that would entail policy  co-ordination among EU members.  <p>  <p>While declining to disclose the proposals he will table, Mr Lamfalussy described the row over the  relationship between those inside and outside the single currency club as "a major political issue"  which would become "crucial and could become a very difficult problem to handle". Germany and France  appear to favour compelling membership in a new ERM to prevent, say, the British or the Italians  engaging in "competitive devaluations" to make their exports cheaper.  <p>  <p>The battle over the 'ins-outs' dilemma has intensified since the Prime Minister, in his Mansion  House speech last November, raised the issue. Within days of that speech, Hans Tietmeyer, chief of  Germany's powerful central bank, responded by conceding that some unnamed countries might get the  "silly idea" of opting for competitive devaluation against the euro and called for moves "to eliminate  the national option of deliberate devaluation".  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Alliance of Germany, France and European Commission pressurise UK to rejoin ERM </b><br><br><br><b><h2>13 April 1996</h2></b><br><h2>UK pressed to accept euro regime  </h2>
  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>John Palmer</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>The Government came under renewed pressure last night to accept tough new disciplines to guarantee Britain's economic convergence with the rest of the European Union, even if it stays outside both the single European currency and a new EU exchange rate mechanism.  <p>  <p>European finance ministers and central bank governors, meeting in Verona, began two days of detailed discussions about how the pound might be linked with the euro - the future single currency - even if it is not part of either monetary union or the ERM.  <p>  <p>The Chancellor, Kenneth Clarke, was told by several ministers that the pound should rejoin the ERM in the interests of monetary stability in Britain and throughout Europe after the single currency is launched in 1999. Britain and Italy were ejected from the exchange-rate mechanism in 1992 and the Government is loath to rejoin.  <p>  <p>Proponents of a new ERM want to stop those outside from undermining the system through making national devaluations. But there were no calls at last night's meeting for any trade or other sanctions to be imposed against Britain if it refuses to participate in the single currency or the ERM. Discussion in Verona is focusing on how to get all 15 EU countries to achieve closer economic convergence. The meeting was told that there should in future be more detailed scrutiny of national economic and monetary policies for all members.  <p>  <p>The EU economic affairs commissioner, Yves Thibault de Silguy, said he believed "the commission and Council of Ministers should increase their surveillance of national economic policies. They should also be expected to approve any emergency measures which a national government might be forced to take to ensure it remains on track to closer convergence." He endorsed a proposal by Hans Tietmeyer, chief of Germany's powerful Bundesbank, who has made it clear that he wants the governor of a future European central bank to have powers not only over those joining a single currency but also over those EU currencies left outside, to avert the risk of "competitive devaluation".  <p>  <p>On no account, however, do the Germans want a European central bank to intervene to defend EU currencies outside EMU against market onslaughts. Mr Tietmeyer dismissed as 'false' all speculation that the Bundesbank was anti-EMU. But his attempted reassurance followed a highly sceptical speech on the single currency from his bank's chief economist and board member, Otmar Issing. Mr Issing told a Vienna conference that a single currency probably would not spur economic and jobs growth, as claimed by Bonn and Brussels. He said EU countries had wasted five years since Maastricht in failing to pursue the right kind of economic convergence.  <p>  <p>Since 1991, he noted, the average EU national state debt had soared from 56 to 71 per cent of GDP. Nailing his colours to the mast of EMU-scepticism, he declared that European integration could not only be driven by "visionaries".  <p>  <p>It remains unclear whether any specific penalties will be incurred by non-EMU countries which fail to comply with the reinforced convergence targets. There is little support for a French proposal to fine those who stray. The surveillance role pictured by Mr De Silguy for the commission and Council of Ministers would reinforce the requirement for any measure like this to have unanimous support.  <p>  <p>The Irish finance minister, Ruari Quinn, said last night that Britain, and other non-participants would "be expected to manage currency policy as a matter of the common interest of all European Union member states"'. Mr Clarke and the Swedish finance minister believe they can contribute to the goal of wider European currency stability by agreeing to tough new national inflation targets.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Alliance of Germany, France and European Commission pressurise UK to rejoin ERM  </b><br><br><br><b><h2>19 April 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Message in a bottle of champagne   </h2>
  <br>Commentary by
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Peter Preston</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>It was the clearest of blue mornings on the last day of the hols. The great plain where Champagne  meets Picardy stretched away towards Reims, beyond the Gothic miracle of Laon cathedral. Birds sang.  Coffee and croissants arrived on call. Everything signalled a heart-warming change in the seasons.  Bang on. The battered hotel TV set, against all scientific odds, turned out to carry Sky News. And  there, before the coffee cooled, was Norman Lamont slagging off the ERM.  <p>  <p>Just as winter becomes spring in a trice, so the election season suddenly dawns after months of  grey chuntering. The greater-crested Lamont returns to its old haunts, chirruping bizarrely the  bestest of admiration for Kenneth Clarke and Jimmy Goldsmith in equal measures. The razor-billed  Mawhinney bites Sue MacGregor on the nose. We're into six/nine/12 months of hysteria and synthetic  wrath and sheer, grinding beastliness. We need our memories honed and Jennifer's ear-plugs dusted.  <p>  <p>Because they're so stinky, the armpits of political existence, you forget what general elections  are like. But it is wise, as the next bell sounds, to look back in humility at the fight that went  before, to brood over all the predictions that went wrong and the promises which drained into the  gutters. Easy for 1992. Everybody, those who played, those who watched, those who polled, made idiots  of themselves.  <p>  <p>Norman, meanwhile, is getting into his stride. The Exchange Rate Mechanism is a once and continuing  disaster. An affront to common sense. There can be no question of re-joining it. Of course, under his  gritty superintendence, some taxes had had to be raised. But now we were on course for sustained  recovery, the wonders of Europe.  <p>  <p>What was it though, that the same Norman, this bird of infinite wisdom flushed with electoral  triumph, was telling the European Policy Forum in July, 1992? "The ERM is not an optional extra, an  add-on to be jettisoned at the first hint of trouble. It is, and will remain, at the very centre of  our macro-economic strategy." The chancellor-that-was rehearsed five so-called alternative policies -  including "leaving the ERM and cutting interest rates" or "leaving the ERM and setting strict monetary  targets". No good, he said, useless. "They are all illusory and destined to fail. They would not  deliver low inflation."  <p>  <p>Lamont, of course, was not alone at the time. He was one big parrot amongst many, squawking the  Major Mynah tune. "We are in the mechanism because that is where the Government judge we should be,"  sang the PM. "Nobody compelled us. We took a judgement. Baroness Thatcher and I took a judgement that it  was the right thing to do."  <p>  <p>You may hear such refrains revived over the coming year, though only at the basest level of  argy-bargy (as in Mawhinney kicks Mother Teresa on Knee Horror). But, there again, nobody may make  much of it on stage where the NHS or income-tax-banding seems to dominate. They certainly didn't last  time. A little Austin Mitchell invective and Will Hutton analysis had to serve. Yet nothing in 1992,  or since, has been more crucial. If the Tories are dished (as ICM and the majority of their own MPs in  chorus believe) it's because Black Wednesday, that memorable September, made fools of them all and  shredded belief so comprehensively it is simply impossible to restore. They were sunk within six  months of a victory by an issue the three front benches agreed on. The election itself was an  irrelevance. The manifestoes were irrelevant. Greater realities supervened.  <p>  <p>That's the bit of the 1996/97 deck which needs clearing early. For what would have happened four  years ago if the pollsters had been right, if Labour had indeed won? Shadow Chancellor Smith,  remember, was signed up for the ERM at 2.95 marks to the pound. Then Shadow Chancellor Brown echoed  his leader's line. Even after the September debacle, Labour policy still insisted that "withdrawal  from the mechanism has gravely damaged Britain's long-term economic and political interests". No  turning back. But Prime Minister Kinnock and Chancellor Smith would surely have found September  happening a little early in 1992: like June. They were pledged publicly and privately to perish any  thought of devaluation, to fight harder than Lamont: but the tides of Soros would have surely washed  them away, out of the system, before the last champagne cork had popped. And then where would we have  been? With a Labour Government crippled and flailing. With a Conservative Opposition regrouping  gleefully for 13 more years in office.  <p>  <p>It is sensible to dwell from the start on such things, because they determine the future in a way  which no rhetoric can. These are different times, of course. There will be a bit of a debate about  Europe, but mostly on the coded circuit of Clarke and Portillo. Labour's anxious winning team  (shredding new surveys about Euro-splits in the ranks) will short-circuit any doubts amongst top  comrades.  <p>  <p>The question European finance ministers would most like answered - Will you get back in the ERM  sharpish as a mandatory preliminary to monetary union? - must surely echo into empty air.  <p>  <p>Welcome back from the long migration, Norm. Perch on my cathedral spire whilst you peck a scrap of  croissant. This second coming reminds me where we went first time round. Millions of angry words,  thousands of furious charges: and all of them - as it proved then and may prove again - beside the  ultimate point, where the Grim Reaper of a greater reality lives.   <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Larry Elliott</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>Chancellor Kohl has been around for so long that he can doubtless recall the last time withdrawal  from Europe was a serious proposition in the UK. But even the seen-it-all, done-it-all Chancellor may  be in for a shock when he is briefed by John Major at Downing Street today.  <p>  <p>Mad cows and vanishing fish have breathed new life into a movement that has never given up hope  that the 1972 decision to join the Common Market will some day be reversed, and is now stronger than  it has been for years. Most of the running on Europe is being made by the right, but the left's  Euro-sceptics are also quietly marshalling their troops, with one publication last week* outlining  what life might be like outside monetary union.  <p>  <p>Interestingly enough, the preface to the book was penned by Norman Lamont, an indication that the  awkward squads of both ends of the political spectrum are finding common ground.  <p>  <p>Mr Lamont was the first senior Conservative to put his head above the parapet and suggest that  there might be circumstances in which Britain would have to leave the European Union. But there are  plenty of others who agree with the former Chancellor when he says he cannot "pinpoint a single concrete  economic advantage that unambiguously comes to this country because of our membership".  <p>  <p>The reason Euro-sceptics are back in business is quite simple. The Project - as enthusiasts for  closer integration put it - is in trouble. Serious trouble. The current row over who governs Britain  is not really about beef or fish, it's about economics.  <p>  <p>The problem is summed up by a famous quote from Walter Hallstein, the first president of the  European Commission: "The business of the Community is not business but politics." The Brussels  mind set has not changed. Economic conditions have.  <p>  <p>Monetary union is meant to facilitate economic integration, keeping Europe 'moving forward' towards  political union. But Europe does not have one economy any more than it has one language, history or  cultural identity, and it is a dangerous fantasy to pretend it does. It has none of those qualities  denoting a unified economy - mobility of labour, wage flexibility or a mechanism for fiscal transfers.  <p>  <p>What it does have is a sado-monetarist blueprint for a single currency based on convergence  conditions that, in the absence of the attributes mentioned above, will institutionalise low growth  and high unemployment, and make the problems of German unification seem utterly inconsequential. The  orthodox view is that following the Maastricht treaty to the letter is perfectly compatible with  eating into Europe's jobless total. According to the theory, cutting public spending to reduce  deficits and debt will lead to lower inflation and cheaper money, thereby unleashing a tidal wave of  investment. Subsequently, locking currencies together and handing control of monetary policy to a  European Central Bank will provide stability, lower transaction costs and put those nasty currency  speculators in their place.   <p>  <p>This argument - weak even when it was formulated during the inflationary upswing at the end of the Eighties - looks even more threadbare now. Europe is suffering from weak  domestic demand, principally in consumption and investment, so now is hardly the ideal time to slash  public spending and raise taxes. Indeed, the proselytisers for a single currency have all but stopped  making an economic case and now dwell on the political ramifications should 'the Project' founder.  <p>  <p>Paris and Bonn insist that monetary union must go ahead because the alternative will be an  unravelling of the integration process and the threat of recrudescent nationalism. Actually, the  opposite is the case. The single currency project, if tested to destruction, will lead to greater  poverty and economic alienation, and act as a breeding ground for every tinpot xenophobe across  Europe.  <p>  <p>There are hints that Messrs Kohl, Chirac and Santer are aware of the economic problems that lie at  the heart of monetary union but are not prepared to own up to them. Whereas in 1992, Germany and  France argued that devaluation was the road to ruin, they are now trying to prevent those countries  that remain outside a single currency from embarking on 'competitive devaluations'.  <p>  <p>This is illogical. Either a single currency offers tangible benefits, in which case those nations  with weak currencies will suffer by being on the outside, or the economic benefits of a single  currency are a chimera and there may indeed be advantages in retaining national autonomy over monetary  policy.  <p>  <p>Mexico, for example, would not see the sense in an argument that said currency union with the  United States was essential to make Nafta work. Nor does it make much economic sense for Italy's new  left-of-centre government to toss away the competitive advantage it has enjoyed over Germany and  France since 1992 by rejoining the ERM. Some in the financial markets now harbour serious doubts about  monetary union. A recent book by Noriko Hama, of the Mitsubishi Research Institute, predicts that, far  from heading for EMU, Europe is set to revert to a network of medieval city states. Bonn, Brussels and  Paris will have none of this, insisting that monetary union is still full speed ahead for 1999. But  doubts are setting in.   <p>  <p>In January this year, Mr Santer and Lamberto Dini, president of the European  Council, declared that the Commission would make a priority of issuing Union bonds to co-finance  Trans-European Networks (TENs). This was a significant departure for Mr Santer. The idea of providing  a Europe-wide Keynesian boost had first been agreed at the Edinburgh summit of 1992, but had been  allowed to lapse. Indeed, in a lengthy correspondence with Labour MEP Ken Coates, Mr Santer  steadfastly denied that slashing budget deficits to hit an arbitrary target would have deflationary  implications. It was, he argued, predicated on a simplistic Keynesian model of the economy that had  been rebutted in analysis by the International Monetary Fund.  <p>  <p>The not-so-subtle shift of emphasis is an indication that Mr Santer has started to have second  thoughts about the Maastricht blueprint. Certainly people like Mr Coates and the former Labour MP  Stuart Holland believe that the argument may be inching their way.  <p>  <p>Last week at a conference in Florence, Mr Holland argued strongly that a European investment fund  financed by Union bonds could help lift Europe out of recession. The Union bonds would not count as  debt for the member states, so would not show up in the Maastricht convergence criteria but, by  financing the TENs and helping small and medium-sized enterprises, would provide a much-needed boost  to investment spending.  <p>  <p>Mr Holland says that the fund, although currently small, could expand to 60bn ecu and have an  important macro-economic impact, particularly in the regions, which could circumvent national  governments by applying direct to Brussels for finance.  <p>  <p>There is one big problem with this idea: the Germans will not wear it. If they are cutting back  public spending by DM30bn to hit the Maastricht convergence criteria, they are damned if they  will allow Keynesian pump-priming by the back door. Theo Waigel, Germany's finance minister, is fond  of quoting John Major: "If it isn't hurting, it isn't working." That quote came back to haunt Mr  Major, and it may do the same to Mr Waigel. For some, the idea that a cathartic collapse of monetary  union is necessary before Europe can return to economic sanity is too frightening to contemplate.

  <br><br>      <p>Earl Waldegrave's farm manager was yesterday convicted of growing cannabis at his employer's  Somerset estate. The jury at Bristol crown court unanimously convicted John Lucksted, aged 51, of possessing  cannabis with intent to supply.  <p>  <p>He admitted producing the plants last year at Rookery Farm, on the Chewton Mendip estate of the  earl, brother of Treasury Secretary William Waldegrave, but claimed he grew them as a hobby, solely  for his own consumption. Lucksted had also admitted two charges of possessing cannabis resin, one of  possessing cannabis, and a further charge of abstracting electricity to aid propagation.  <p>  <p>Judge Richard Toyn remanded Lucksted, of Clifton, Bristol, in custody until 8 May pending a report.  <p>  <p>Earlier the court heard that on 14 September last year police had raided the farm and found  'substantial quantities' of cannabis and up to 1,000 plants worth an estimated &#163;70,000 to  &#163;75,000.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Bomber targets Barclays bank</b><br><br><br><b><h2>11 April 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Bomber targets  bank</h2><h3> Extortionist with grudge sending homemade devices to Barclays  </h2>
  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Duncan Campbell</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>An extortionist using homemade bombs has been making demands for hundreds of thousands of pounds  from Barclays Bank for the last 16 months, it emerged last night. He has used the phrase 'Welcome to  the Mardi Gras' as his code. Scotland Yard confirmed last night that an extensive investigation into  an obsessive but amateurish bombing campaign has been under way since December 1994. One person has  been injured and no arrests have been made. The demands started with a device being sent to a branch  of Barclays Bank. The extortionist, whose nationality and identity are not known, indicated that he  wanted money to be paid before he would call off his campaign. The bank has not paid any money.  <p>  <p>Some 25 homemade devices have been sent to Barclays branches, and offices and small businesses in  some way connected to the bank. Many of the devices have not exploded. They have been made using a  simple mechanism and some have been hidden inside hollowed-out books. One employee has been injured, suffering slight burns. Remarkably there have been no other  casualties.  <p>  <p>Members of the Anti-Terrorist Branch have been attempting to negotiate with the bomber through the  personal columns of newspapers, including the Daily Telegraph and the Daily Mail. A cat-and-mouse game  has been taking place clandestinely as officers have sought to know more of the reasons for the  demands.  <p>  <p>A police source said it appeared the extortionist had some kind of a grudge against Barclays as the  campaign seemed to be more than an attempt to extract money. Barclays Bank has been attempting to  discover if a disgruntled member of staff, an angry customer, or the relative of a sacked member of  staff could be responsible. The exact total of the money demanded is unclear but it is in six or seven  figures, according to sources. In his first letter the extortionist used the phrase 'Welcome to the  Mardi Gras', which has been used in subsequent correspondence.  <p>  <p>Today's Daily Mirror claims he began his campaign by sending six homemade devices to Barclays  branch managers in early December 1994. Inside the Christmas wrapping paper were video cassette boxes,  each of which concealed a shotgun cartridge springloaded to fire as the box was opened. The paper  claims a woman clerical worker at a branch in Hampstead, north London, was burned on the face and  hands when the box exploded as she unwrapped it. Another worker at a branch in Ladbroke Grove, west  London, was temporarily deafened when the box he was holding detonated in his hands. The other devices  were all defused and taken away for analysis.  <p>  <p>A letter signed Mardine Graham was then received at Barclays headquarters in Northampton, demanding  the bank supply him with credit cards and a means of drawing unlimited sums of money from accounts  which could not be detected. The Mirror claims devices, some containing butane gas cylinders, were  sent to businesses in London, the Midlands and the North. One device was rigged to a phone box in a  busy high street.  <p>  <p>Police sources were last night playing down any similarities with the American 'Unabomber' who has  caused a number of fatalities over the years and has allegedly just been arrested. He too was an  obsessive, although his obsession appeared to be against companies and universities involved with  computers.  <p>  <p>There has been a series of slow and protracted procedures in an attempt to establish a dialogue  with the extortionist. Police had been hoping that details of the investigation would remain secret  until they had a successful conclusion. Most of the targets of the extortionist have been in the  London area or in the Home Counties.  <p>  <p>The operation to trap the extortionist has involved many officers who had spare capacity during the  IRA ceasefire, but clearly now the anti-terrorist branch has other priorities, particularly because  his devices have in some cases been so unsuccessful that no one was aware they were even explosives.  Scotland Yard was unable to comment last night on whether the man was operating alone. "He certainly  has a lot of time on his hands," said one source.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Ian King</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>Barclays Bank has intensified security arrangements for its annual meeting this Thursday in the  wake of extortion attempts by the so-called Mardi Gras bomber.  <p>  <p>Barclays, which has been sent 25 homemade bombs by the extortionist over the past 16 months, fears  that the bomber could attempt a 'spectacular' at the meeting. In the most recent attack, nine days  ago, a small device exploded outside a Barclays branch in Ealing, west London.  <p>  <p>A Barclays spokeswoman confirmed that security would be strengthened for Thursday's meeting at the  Queen Elizabeth II conference centre, in Westminster, but declined - for obvious reasons - to talk  about specific arrangements. She added: "Security will be tightened, and we are working with the people at the centre to ensure  this."  <p>  <p>Barclays is also being advised on the meeting by Scotland Yard, which has handled all negotiations  to date with the extortionist, and which initially corresponded secretly with him or her through the  personal columns of the Daily Telegraph.  <p>  <p>The fears about the Mardi Gras bomber mean Barclays has had problems with its annual meeting for  the third consecutive year. Two years ago, it withstood calls for the resignation of the then chairman, Andrew Buxton,  following complaints about boardroom pay and treatment of customer shareholders. A year ago, the AGM was picketed by members of UNIFI, the bank's staff union, who were protesting  about branch closures and redundancies.   <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Mike Tyson accused of sexual assault after incident in Chicago nightclub </b><br><br><br><b><h2>11  April 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Tyson back in a corner</h2><h3> Woman accuses world champion of attack in  nightclub  </h3>  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Kevin Mitchell</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>Trouble continues to follow Mike Tyson around. The world heavyweight champion has been accused  again of sexual assault, this time in a Chicago nightclub only hours after he had attended a Muslim  prayer meeting. His fighting career - revived by a stunning victory over Frank Bruno last month - and  his liberty will be determined in the next day or so as police investigate the complaint, the details  of which remained vague last night, giving rise to suspicions among his closest associates that the  millionaire boxer might have been set up.  <p>  <p>If guilty, however, and subsequently sent back to prison for breaching the conditions of his  parole, Tyson's life will be returned to the turmoil that engulfed him in 1992 when he was convicted  of raping the beauty queen Desiree Washington.  <p>  <p>He was jailed for six years then and released last March, apparently convinced of the virtues of  Islam and preparing for marriage soon to Monica Turner, a divorced trainee doctor who visited him in  the Indiana Detention Centre. They have a two-month-old daughter, Raynor.  <p>  <p>This time the aggrieved woman from Indiana is said to have arrived with friends at a Southside club  called The Clique on Sunday night and, according to conflicting versions, had either asked to be  introduced to Tyson, who arrived with a small entourage about 1am and stayed for two hours, or was  approached by the fighter.  <p>  <p>The woman says Tyson committed "sexual battery", although it was not specified where and when the  alleged assault took place. Moody Andrews, a manager at The Clique, said: "She was never alone with  Mike. She was in an open space with him. Mike had two security guards that we hired to protect and  watch over him." He said Tyson was not drinking.  <p>  <p>Tyson was with his former sparring partner Oliver McCall, a noted wild man who two nights later was  arrested in North Carolina for possession of marijuana.  <p>  <p>The complainant said she was treated in a Chicago hospital and released on Monday morning. She  filed a complaint with police on Tuesday. Her lawyer Jerry Lee Peteet said: "We are going to pursue  the criminal avenue and also a civil case. She's scared, upset, angry, hurt."  <p>  <p>Muhammad Siddeeq, who was instrumental in converting Tyson to Islam during his time in prison, said  he was with the fighter earlier on Sunday at a prayer meeting in Chicago. "I give no credence to this  report," he said. While Tyson's innocence in the legal sense is yet to be determined, the boy from  Brownsville is no lamb. Since his release from prison, while cloaked in the respectability of his new  religion, he has spent many long nights in the strip clubs of Las Vegas with his fellow fighter James  Toney. There were suggestions that he had fondled shop assistants in a boutique there. Tyson, probably  the most easily recognised sporting figure on the planet, is not so naive as to imagine that his  celebrity is not a magnet for chancers and has a retinue of loud and vulgar hangers-on, an aggressive  coterie that intimidated Bruno when he failed in his defence of his World Boxing Council title in Las  Vegas on 16 March.  <p>  <p>Although dedicating himself to the rigours of training and freed now from the bouts of heavy  drinking that threatened to destroy him before he was imprisoned, Tyson struggles to keep other urges  in check. The boxer, who once admitted he did not know the meaning of the word "percentage", spends  indiscriminately and complains he is not paid enough.  <p>  <p>Tyson's crime sheet is a long one. Teddy Atlas, his first trainer, held a pistol to Tyson's head  when he was a 12-year-old delinquent in Catskill, New York, and threatened to kill him if he touched  his sister-in-law again; in 1987 Tyson was charged with punching a parking attendant who intervened  when the fighter tried to kiss a female employee; his first wife, Robin Givens, catalogued a series of  violent attacks; he was later sued by Phyllis Polaner, who claimed sexual assault and harassment; a  jury also found Tyson committed battery in a case brought by Sandra Miller.  <p>  <p>Tyson is not alone among renegade heavyweights.

<!--INFOLINE--><b>'Neighbours from hell' evicted from their home</b><br><br><br><b><h2>11 April  1996</h2></b><br><h2>'Neighbours from hell' must quit council home, says judge  </h2>
  <br><br>      <p>A family of 17, known as 'the neighbours from hell', are being evicted from their council home in  Wythenshawe, Manchester, after 500 complaints.  Mother-of-10 Kay Potts and her extended family were  given 48 hours to leave after a judge at Salford county court granted the city council a repossession  order. >A council spokeswoman said: "Members of the family were chronically noisy, used abusive language  and threatened violence towards their neighbours and were involved in vandalism and burglary."  <p>  <p>Mrs Potts, 50, had been sharing her three-bedroom semi, designed for six, with up to 17 people,  after moving to Royalthorn Road two years ago. The council received more than 500 complaints from  neighbours. The family had been evicted from their previous council house in Manchester for causing a  nuisance.  <p>  <p>Three of their neighbours, who kept a diary of the Potts's behaviour, gave evidence to the court  after an injunction last year failed to have any effect. "In the teeth of harassment and intimidation, these extraordinarily brave individuals were  determined to appear in court to fight for themselves and their community," a council spokeswoman  said. Neighbour Gerard Ridings, 57, said: "To call them the neighbours from hell is an understatement.  They're an evil lot." Mr Ridings had bricks thrown at him, his greenhouse shattered, his home vandalised and his garage  set on fire. He said: "In the end I'd just had enough."  <p>  <p>The council housing chairwoman, Claire Nangle, praised the "courageous" tenants for "helping to end  a nuisance which has caused so much misery. This is an important and successful story in the fight  against anti-social behaviour." The council's policy was to find evicted families temporary accommodation while their cases were  reviewed but the judgment made it clear that such families must mend their ways, she said.  <p>  <p>A spokesman for Mrs Potts's solicitor, Nina Ramsden, said she had no comment to make.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Martin Walker</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>An attempt by seven-year-old Jessica Dubroff to become the youngest pilot to fly across North  America ended in tragedy yesterday. Her single-engined Cessna aircraft crashed as she took off during  a hailstorm in Cheyenne, Wyoming, killing herself, her father and her flying instructor.  <p>  <p>The aircraft had just completed the first leg of the journey, from the Pacific Coast at San  Francisco across the Rocky Mountains to Cheyenne. The flight should have ended at Cape Cod, near  Boston, today, before a return flight to California to win Jessica the round-trip record, even though  she would not be old enough to qualify for a full pilot's licence until the year 2005.  <p>  <p>"I love flying so much, I can't wait to get back into the air," were the young girl's last known  words, given to a local television crew in Wyoming as she completed her pre-flight checks.  <p>  <p>Jessica's Cessna Cardinal 177 went down in a residential neighbourhood about a mile from Cheyenne  Municipal Airport, officials said. One eyewitness, Ron Nimmo, said, "The nose of the plane directly  impacted the street. Needless to say there was not a whole lot left of the plane." The plane lay in the driveway of a home, its wings and tail collapsed and wreckage strewn across a  wide area.  <p>  <p>Tom Johnson, a former commercial pilot, saw the plane come down. "It was low and it was stressed.  You could tell it was overloaded," he said. He saw the plane try to turn to head back to the airport  but he realised it would not make it.  <p>  <p>The plane was equipped with dual controls. Jessica sat in the main pilot's seat, with special  extensions to allow her, at 4ft 2in, to reach the rudder pedals. Her flying instructor, Joe Reid, sat  at the other controls beside her, and her father, Roy Dubroff, in the rear seat.  <p>  <p>"The weather was clearly a factor, with heavy rain and hail," said Dick Royce, of the Cheyenne  Police Department. "But we have to await the Federal Aviation Authority inspectors for a full report."  <p>  <p>Mitch Barker, a spokesman for the Federal Aviation Administration, said it was not immediately  known who was at the controls at the time of the crash. But he said the flight instructor was legally  responsible for piloting the aircraft and the girl was considered to be a passenger.  <p>  <p>Mr Barker said the minimum age for holding a pilot's licence is 16. Tony Aliengena, aged nine, of  California, became the youngest cross-country flier in 1988. The Guinness Book of Records has stopped  recognising the 'youngest pilot' category for fear of encouraging unsafe flights. In a television  interview on Sunday, Jessica was asked why she wanted to fly across the country. "Well, I think it was  my dad's idea," she replied.   <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

  <br><br>      <p>The operators of the Sellafield nuclear plant were fined &#163;25,000 yesterday after admitting to  "serious and significant" failures in safety that left a worker contaminated with radioactivity.  <p>  <p>British Nuclear Fuels' system of controlling the amount of contamination from plutonium to which a  contractor was exposed while working in its main fuel separation area had failed, Carlisle crown court  was told. BNFL was also ordered to pay &#163;16,104 costs after admitting a breach of safety  regulations. Henry Globe QC, prosecuting, said it was "fortuitous" that a plater, James Martin, aged  53, had only received a relatively low dose of radioactivity as he replaced bolts on a ventilation duct  without proper protective clothing in June 1994.  <p>  <p>After it was discovered he had become contaminated, changing-room staff wrongly allowed him to put  his radioactive clothing back on before going to the surgery in the Cumbrian reprocessing plant.  <p>  <p>Mr Martin panicked when a checking instrument had "gone off the scale" and suffered episodes of  acute anxiety after the incident, Mr Globe said. In fact the radioactivity he received was only half  the amount of BNFL's annual maximum target for workers and a seventh of the statutory maximum. But Mr  Globe said the subsequent investigation "highlighted a failure by the defendants to take the necessary  and important safety precautions demanded of them."  <p>  <p>Anthony Edwards-Stuart, for the company, said BNFL had introduced an extensive review of training  for contractors. "It is a reflection of the company's serious concern and determination to prevent a  recurrence of incidents such as this," he said.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Gary Younge</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>Pass the guacamole and roll out the futons, it's official. The MP who left school at 15 to train as  a chef, worked for 10 years at sea and rose through the ranks of the trade union movement has finally  come out of the closet. "I was once (working class), but by being a member of Parliament, I can tell you, I'm pretty middle  class," confessed John Prescott, deputy leader of the Labour Party, on Radio 4's 'Today' programme  yesterday.  <p>  <p>And his leader, Tony Blair, acknowledged his new status as he thanked him for his contribution to  the party's Staffordshire South East byelection triumph. "I gather you are now a class act, not a class  warrior," he said. Mr Prescott's admission came in response to the Labour MP Chris Mullin who warned:  "Those who have done best out of the Thatcher decade will be expected to contribute most to repairing  the damage." >Mr Prescott replied: "We're not selling our soul. You have to appeal to all parts of the  community."  <p>  <p>Once described by a Tory MP as "(not) the sort of man we'd invite back to our club after a debate",  Mr Prescott has long been irritated by being caricatured as a 'trade union thickie'. But his transition has not been overnight. Two years ago he was caught writing for the Tatler,  appealing for subscribers to write to him under the banner 'Tatler readers for Labour'.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Rebecca Smithers</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>Billionaire financier Sir James Goldsmith added to John Major's woes yesterday by pledging to press  ahead with his &#163;20m campaign to put up 600 Referendum Party candidates at the election. Sir James was speaking for the first time since the Government announced its decision to make a  manifesto commitment to hold a referendum on a single currency. His candidates will stand in seats where the Conservative candidates oppose a referendum.  <p>  <p>Sir James said in an interview on BBC1's 'Breakfast with Frost' that the Government's decision was  "an act of appeasement within the Cabinet to try and keep it stable". He said the proposed referendum was dependent on the Conservatives being re-elected - "a somewhat  obscure idea at this moment" - and that it only lasted for one Parliament.  <p>  <p>The threat posed by both the Referendum and the UK Independence parties is being taken more  seriously since Thursday's Staffordshire South-East byelection when the UK Independence candidate,  Andrew Smith, came a close fourth to the Liberal Democrats, securing 1,272 votes (3.5 per cent). Sir  James said he would unveil his full list of candidates at the party's conference in Brighton in  October. He had not yet decided where he would stand, but said it would be in a Surrey constituency.  <p>  <p>Asked about Tory fears that his party could take 15 to 25 seats away from them at the general  election and put Euro-friendly Labour in power, Sir James replied: "This is not a left-right issue. It  is a yes-no issue. Does Britain remain a sovereign nation or not? In an analysis of the number of MPs  of both major parties who have been for a referendum, more socialist MPs have declared themselves in  favour of a referendum than have Conservative Members of Parliament."  <p>  <p>He confirmed that after a referendum his party would disappear and that he had no other political  ambitions.  <p>  <p>The former chancellor, Norman Lamont, said he supported the Referendum Party on the issue of a  wider referendum on political integration in Europe.   <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<h3>Is Sir James really such a demon?  </h3>  <br><b>Leading article</b><br><br><br>      <p>None of the issues which the Eurosceptics pursue from time to time is unimportant or even only of  narrow party concern. As the Labour MEP Shaun Spiers argues in a challenging article on our Arena page  this morning, all of them would confront a future Labour government every bit as much as they confront  the Conservatives today. All of them are also powerful questions with some electoral potential. The  problem with the Tory Eurosceptics, however, is that they have absolutely no perspective about their  obsession. Thinking about little except the European Union, and misinterpreting widespread popular  irritation against aspects of the European project for fundamentalist opposition to the whole of it,  the Eurosceptics imagine that they are more popular than they really are, and are therefore  increasingly led into overplaying their hand.  <p>  <p>Nowhere is this currently on display more vividly than in the Eurosceptics' live-now-pay-later love  affair with Sir James Goldsmith's Referendum Party. Sir James presents himself as a great national  figure. The Eurosceptics love his message and relay it back to Sir James. The net result is that each  is encouraging the other to believe things which a little calm reflection would show to be nonsense. A  particularly good example of this is the list in Lord Archer's pocket which purports to show the  electoral damage to Tory fortunes which Sir James would cause if he made good his threat to stand in  every seat at the general election, and then took a couple of thousand votes in each one. At the sight  of this list, strong Conservatives are now said to blanch and quail.  <p>  <p>It doesn't take a genius to work out that if everything else stayed the same and Sir James got  those sorts of results, then the Tories would lose 30 seats and Labour would win the election. But  there are so many ifs and buts in this simplistic projection that the calculation is almost entirely  worthless. In particular, there is no evidence that large numbers of people intend to vote for Sir  James anywhere. European election protest votes and the occasional good score in a byelection, as the  Independence Party managed in Staffordshire South East, are extremely unreliable guides to general  election intentions.   <p>  <p>Last week's Times/Mori poll found that only six people in a national sample of  1,947 voters would support the Referendum Party, too small a figure to register as a meaningful  percentage. Future polls may temporarily boost Sir James's score, especially in view of all the  publicity he receives from his media admirers, but come a general election it is extremely improbable  that he will hold on to very much even of that support. No one should blind themselves to the current  churning of mood in this country - and others - about the European Union.   <p>  <p>No one should delude themselves that the European issue is bogus or unimportant. But the atmosphere in the Tory Party  speaks volumes about shattered and desperate Tory nerves and very little about the wider and more  generally alienated political mood. Far be it from us to intrude on private grief, but a serious  political party surely ought to count to 10 before it relies upon the combined judgment of two such  men as Sir James Goldsmith and Lord Archer.   <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>EU angered by lack of clear BSE action plan</b><br><br><br><b><h2>17 April  1996</h2></b><br><h2>Beef exports 'will take five years to recover'  </h2>
  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Paul Brown</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>The Government's BSE action plan was drawn up after a report commissioned from the accountant  Coopers & Lybrand painted a bleak picture for the future of the industry, worth &#163;2.6bn a year  before the BSE crisis. It says: "There is a genuine crisis in the industry and urgent action is  needed."  <p>  <p>Douglas Hogg, the Agriculture Secretary, said yesterday that the immediate task was to get the  industry moving again so that beef could get from the farm to the public who still wanted to buy it. This meant removing the 'blockages' of stocks in store. To protect farmers from price reductions  and stave off a chain of threatened bankruptcies, the Government was prepared to subsidise market  prices by up to 25p a kilo until prices regained pre-scare levels.  <p>  <p>Farmers would be paid compensation of up to &#163;480 an animal for cows too old to go into the  food chain, and more for specially bred beef cattle over 30 months old which were now also banned from  human consumption. These animals would be slaughtered and sent to the rendering industry, which boils  them down into tallow and bonemeal. The industry used to be able to sell these products but had been  unable to do so because of fears of spreading BSE. Special disposal methods for this waste would be  devised. This special aid to the rendering industry would cost &#163;118m.   <p>  <p>Mr Hogg ruled out any mass slaughtering policy, but said that selective slaughtering of animals most likely to be affected by BSE  was still being considered. These would be put to the industry before they were publicly announced,  but the number of herds affected would be small and the animals involved would be in the thousands.  <p>  <p>Another scheme, to be announced soon, for allowing animals over 30 months back into the food chain  was also being formulated. This was for specialist beef herds where there was no BSE and the cattle  had been fed on grass and feed which could not have contained any BSE infection.  <p>  <p>The Coopers & Lybrand report is based on the assumption that current loss of exports would continue  for at least six months, and that it was unlikely to fully recover within five years. Farmers would be  forced to continue selling cattle, however, and the Government should aim for a much reduced  slaughtering and processing industry sufficient to meet demand. According to the report, lost export  revenue for the industry was &#163;10m a week, which could not be recovered in the short term. There  was a further &#163;15m a week lost in revenue from slaughtering cattle that could no longer go into  the food chain.  <p>  <p>The accountants estimated that the beef industry was already 45 per cent over capacity and, as a  result of the crisis, a large number of slaughterhouses and meat processors would have to close.  Estimated job losses as a result of the closure of between one quarter and one third of abattoirs was  6,000 to 8,000, and at meat processing plants 15,000 to 20,000. Total losses in the industry might  reach 28,000. "The damage to the infrastructure is likely to be huge and unrecoverable in the medium  term."   <P>  <p>The Country Landowners' Association, which represents 50,000 rural businesses said it believed  the Government's measures would put the industry back on its feet. "We agree wholeheartedly with the commitment to no mass slaughter of healthy productive cattle,"  Ewen Cameron, the president, said.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>EU angered by lack of clear BSE action plan</b><br><br><br><b><h2>24 April  1996</h2></b><br><h2>At last, a streak of sanity</h2><h3>But nothing can excuse the great  beef bungle  </h2>
<br><b>Leading article</b>  <br><br><br>      <p>The disgraceful mishandling of the beef crisis profoundly underlines the Conservative Party's  inability to govern in the national interest. Faced with the original disturbing medical advice about  the effects of BSE on humans, the Government took prompt but inadequate action on 20 March. There were  many reasons for that, among them over-reliance on imprecise expert advice, reluctance to appreciate  the extent of the problem, unwillingness to offend vested interests and a failure to draw up a  comprehensive strategy. But at the end of the day the Government's action was unconvincing. The result  was the collapse of confidence in the domestic beef market and a rapid panic about eating British  beef, both here and abroad (and not merely in Europe), from which we have not yet emerged.  <p>  <p>It is easy to be wise after the event about the Government's errors in those first crucial days.  Even if one accepts that it did the best it could the first time round, the fact remains that the  solutions to the difficulties which quickly followed lay in the Government's own hands. First, the  Government should have promptly reconsidered the actions it took on 20 March, whereas in the event it  did too little too late. Second, it should have acted far more urgently to secure European Union  support for its strategy, pre-empting the possibility that Europe would become an impediment to a  solution, as in the event it has now become.  <p>  <p>Instead, the Government quickly showed the tell-tale signs of its own inadequacy. It focused on the  wrong issues. It began blaming others for the problem. It turned against Labour, against the press  and, above all, against Europe. It took its eye off the real issue. Instead of thinking about meat  industry standards and how to improve and enforce them, it increasingly focused its anxiety on  Brussels and the council of ministers. It allowed itself to redefine the crisis as a piece of European  obstruction, and (as John Major repeated yesterday) as Labour's fault. By Easter the Government had  lost control of a crisis for which it - not the press, not Labour, and not Europe - was fundamentally  responsible.  <p>  <p>We are still living with the consequences of that loss of control, as the political absurdities of  the past few days have so powerfully illustrated. Because the Government so condescendingly dismissed  anxieties about BSE for so long, it should not be surprised that public anxiety cannot be conveniently  crammed back in the container from which it exploded. Because the Conservative Party adopted such  abusive attitudes towards the EU over so many years, it is hardly a surprise that the EU is not  busting a gut to help Britain in an hour of genuine need. And because the Tories have so completely  failed to get a grip on their own party over the European issue, they should not be astonished when  the Europhobes cash in on the latest pretext, as Iain Duncan Smith did in the Commons yesterday and  Sir James Goldsmith has been doing all week.  <p>  <p>The recent comments of some Conservatives beggar description. This is supposedly the party of free  trade. But the Tory MPs who have been queueing up to call for retaliatory sanctions against Europe  this week give the lie to that. The Prime Minister was right to scotch them yesterday, but Tony  Blair's charge of confusion and incompetence was still right. The Conservative Party has been put to  the test and has proved itself compulsively incapable of pursuing the best interests of British  consumers and producers. If a little sanity resurfaced in Douglas Hogg's talks in Brussels last night,  it only highlights the fact that much that went before it was a destructive madness.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>EU angered by lack of clear BSE action plan</b><br><br><br><b><h2>24 April 1996</h2></b><br><h2>EU  snubs Hogg on beef ban</h2><h3> Brussels angered by lack of clear BSE action plan  </h2>
  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Stephen Bates</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>Douglas Hogg, the Agriculture Minister, returned empty-handed from his latest talks with the  European Commission in Brussels yesterday, with no promise of an early end to the European Union's  beef ban despite days of Conservative bluster and hints of a trade war.  <p>  <p>During fevered exchanges in the Commons, John Major ruled out illegal retaliation, while refusing  to identify the other options ministers might deploy if all else fails. It prompted Tony Blair, the  Labour leader, to dub his indecisive stance on the crisis as a "Grand Old Duke of York strategy",  while Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, called it "five weeks of fiasco".  <p>  <p>In two hours of frosty talks with Franz Fischler, the Agriculture Commissioner, Mr Hogg was warned  the Government will have to produce more detailed measures at a meeting of EU agriculture ministers in  Luxembourg on Monday before lifting the ban could be considered.  <p>  <p>The ban is unlikely to be removed for several weeks, if not months, even if British proposals are  agreed on Monday. That is by no means certain because the commission has made it clear they will have  to be in place and working before there can be any recommendation of a return to normal. The impasse  is bound to heighten the dangers for Mr Major's leadership as rightwing Tory critics step up the  pressure for unilateral action, though key players like John Redwood reject talk of illegality such as  withholding budget payments.  <p>  <p>In a diversionary ploy, the Prime Minister will use a speech to the Institute of Directors today to  talk tough against backdoor EU encroachments against Britain's social chapter opt-out. He will warn  "subsequent shifts in interpretation" of EU law could make it impossible for him to agree to new laws.  <p>  <p>Following Monday's upheavals in London and Luxembourg in which ministers appeared first to  encourage, then to dampen speculation that Mr Major might initiate retaliatory bans on European  agricultural exports to Britain, Mr Hogg admitted he had made no threats at yesterday's meeting.  "There was no discussion of retaliation. We were talking about how together we can satisfy the Council  of Ministers, the veterinary committee and the commission as to the fullness of the steps we have  taken and as to our earnest desire to see a substantial reduction in the incidence of BSE. "It is our  belief British beef is safe and we were working together to try to bring about a solution to this  problem."  <p>  <p>Notably more restrained beside him, Mr Fischler said the ban would not be lifted until further  measures had been adopted. "Those controls have to convince us that the prerequisites are there for  removing the export ban. The quicker this can take place the better."  <p>  <p>Brussels officials made little secret of their annoyance that Mr Hogg had produced no additional  proposals to prove British seriousness about eradicating BSE, three weeks after he was asked to do so  at the last agriculture ministers' meeting. Mr Fischler said: "As to specific proposals in writing, these are something we are still waiting  for."  <p>  <p>In Brussels there was incredulity at what EU officials see as British frivolousness in tackling the  crisis of public confidence in the European beef business and bemusement that the Government should  resort to threats when it needs help and money to resolve the crisis.  <p>  <p>Mr Fischler told MEPs on Monday that the slaughtering of some younger cattle in herds where there have  been cases of BSE will have to be implemented before the ban can be lifted. The measures will be  monitored for an unspecified period.  <p>  <p>Malcolm Rifkind, the Foreign Secretary, insisted yesterday there was no question of Britain acting  illegally to force the lifting of the ban. Michael Heseltine, the Deputy Prime Minister, reinforced  the message on BBC radio: "It would have been naive and irresponsible for us to have started issuing  threats to senior European colleagues."  <p>  <p>Although the commission hinted at eventually lifting the ban for grass-reared cattle and on some  supplementary products, there was little sign from Britain that extra measures are being formulated. Despite suggestions that the Government might put forward proposals to cull an additional 40,000  cattle from herds where there have been cases of BSE, no figures were discussed yesterday.  <p>  <p>Tory Eurosceptics, meanwhile, took comfort from a symbolic coup over a 10-minute rule bill  introduced by Iain Duncan-Smith, MP for Chingford, designed to limit the power of the European Court  of Justice in Britain. Though the bill was defeated by 83 votes to 77 - including ex-cabinet ministers  such as John Biffen, Norman Lamont and Kenneth Baker, plus Peter Shore on the Labour side - it was  presented as a sign of the fast-shifting tide among Tory MPs. It has no chance of becoming law.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Goldfish on display in art exhibition at Tate gallery, Liverpool </b><br><br><br><b><h2>19 April  1996</h2></b><br><h2>Lone goldfish causes art world ripples as animal lovers see clear case of cruelty   </h2>
  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Martyn Halsall</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>Dai Vaughan thought the goldfish was rather enjoying the art show. "It's just looking at a lot of  culture vultures as opposed to people slouched in front of the telly," he said. "It looks like a very  happy fish to me." But Maureen Barrett-Spring, an art student in the Sixties, saw the goldfish as victim  of a "cold and pretentious" exhibition. "I don't like living exhibits; it makes me very cross," she  said.  <p>  <p>Other visitors had gone further: the RSPCA confirmed a number of complaints. The animal charity  concluded that the fish was "not necessarily happy (but) is not in a cruel situation," said  spokeswoman Sue Atkinson. The goldfish in question was yesterday still trawling the inside of a glass  suitcase on the floor of the Tate Gallery in Liverpool.   <p>  <p>Across the gallery from its sealed tank stood four other glass suitcases, one on a trolley. They were exhibited by James Chinneck, one of 33  entrants from more than 1,600 submissions for this year's New Contemporaries exhibition. Ms  Barrett-Spring was concerned that the gallery was ignoring the lessons of history. "In Victorian times  they had conversation pieces, but now they call them art," she said. "I think it's the same with this;  it's not art, it's a conversation piece."  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Stuart Millar</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>John Major may be associated with tucking his shirt into his underpants rather than wearing rubber,  but today Britain's growing fetishist population will ask him to repeal a 250-year-old statute which  they say inhibits sexual freedom.  <p>  <p>Groups as diverse as the National Campaign Against the Obscene Publications Act and Feminists for  Free Expression will march through central London to Downing Street to deliver a letter to the Prime  Minister calling for the abolition of the 1751 Disorderly Houses Act.  <p>  <p>They accuse the police of taking a heavy-handed approach to enforcing the act - originally designed  to control prostitution in pubs - which they say has little relevance to fetish clubs in the Nineties.  <p>  <p>The march is being organised by an umbrella body, the Sexual Freedom Coalition, hastily set up last  week after police threats to use the act led to the cancellation of the 10th annual Sex Maniacs Ball  at Brixton Academy. More than 2,000 people were expected to attend the members-only event, which last  year raised more than &#163;15,000 for the Integration Trust, which helps disabled adults to meet  partners.  <p>  <p>Tuppy Owens, the ball's organiser and founder of the Integration Trust, said yesterday the charity  would close unless it was compensated for the loss of revenue. "Obviously it's a disappointment for  the people who lost money on the tickets, but the people in the charity are even more sorry. Our  coffers are now just about empty."  <p>  <p>Ms Owens, author of the annual 'Sex Maniacs Diary' for 22 years and owner of an honorary doctorate  from the Institute for the Advancement of Human Sexuality in San Francisco, said she hoped the ball's  cancellation would force a change in the law. "At a time when fetish clubs are becoming more  mainstream, and more people are getting into them, this act has never been more out of date."  <p>  <p>She admitted she had little confidence that Mr Major would champion their cause, but "I am an  eternal optimist, and I'm sure it's a vote winner." The specialist club scene is enjoying growing  popularity across the country. In London around 10 clubs, catering for sado-masochism,  partner-swapping and fetish wear, run on a regular basis, attracting a diverse clientele. About 3,500  people filled the Hammersmith Palais last year for the highlight of the fetishist calendar, the Skin  Two Rubber Ball.  <p>  <p>But police have continued to raid clubs and bring prosecutions. This month Martin Church, organiser  of the Whiplash club in Putney, west London, was acquitted of offences under the 1751 Act.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Christopher Robin (Winnie-the-Pooh) dies</b><br><br><br><b><h2>22 April  1996</h2></b><br><h2>Christopher Robin dies, aged 75  </h2>
  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Sue Quinn</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>Christopher Robin Milne, confidante of Winnie the Pooh and son of the enchanting bear's creator, AA  Milne, has died at the age of 75. Milne was the inspiration for his father's enduring children's tales  about the little boy, Christopher Robin, his bear with very little brain and his other stuffed toys  which came to life.  <p>  <p>But Milne, whose father in real life was cold and distant, was a reluctant star and spent his life  trying in vain to cast off his image as the golden-haired real-life friend of Pooh. "One day I will write verses about him and see how he likes it," Christopher Milne once said about  his father.  <p>  <p>While the stories for and about him have been essential bedtime reading in British nurseries for  the past 70 years, Milne's relationship with his father was a troubled one. Far from spending hours at his father's knee, the young Milne was taken on formal visits to his  parents at mealtimes, spending the rest of his time with a nurse.  <p>  <p>Even for Milne, fact and fiction blurred. He could not remember which of the events recounted by  his father were true. Small and shy, he loved to sew and knit and gloried in taking clocks apart. >Sent to boarding school, he learned to box to defend himself against the inevitable taunts from his  schoolmates. He eventually won a scholarship to Trinity College, Cambridge, but dropped out after a  year to join the army. He was wounded in Italy during the second world war, but returned to university  to earn a degree in English.  <p>  <p>Milne eventually opened a bookstore in Dartmouth in 1951.

  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Gary Younge</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>Her aim, she said, was to be the queen of all our hearts. But yesterday the Princess of Wales was  being seen as an ace at self-publicity after she took her role a little too literally. Trailed by television cameras, she watched as Professor Sir Magdi Yacoub performed a four-hour  heart operation on Arnaud Wambo, aged seven, at Harefield hospital, Middlesex.  <p>  <p>Abandoning her more familiar sportswear for a matching sky-blue surgical mask and gown, Diana  claimed witnessing hospital operations was a profound experience. "It is literally seeing life on a  knife edge. It motivates me - it brings meaning to my life," she said.  <p>  <p>But Claire Rayner, an agony aunt and former theatre nurse, attacked the visit as a "stunt" and a  "photo-opportunity". She said: "I am appalled. This is nothing to do with her as an individual,  honestly, except that I think doing charity is about being private and quiet and not being in the  limelight. There is every reason to have other observers... but to have someone going along to gawp  for the sake of gawping. To actually go there to dress up and pretend that she is part of the scene -  because that's all it is - I can't think what the sister in charge is doing. I would not have allowed  it."  <p>  <p>It was the sixth time the princess has watched open heart surgery. Last week she reportedly watched  a mastectomy.  <p>  <p>"I'm a great lover of children and the fact that a little person can have a second opportunity from  my country - I'm very proud to be involved," said the princess. "When I speak about the various  subjects, whatever it is, I find it's more beneficial if I've seen it for myself." She said she hoped her support for the charity, which was set up in Paris, would attract sponsors  to finance more operations.  <p>  <p>A spokesman for the British Medical Association said there was nothing untoward in people who are  not medically trained and have no family connection with the patient attending surgery.  <p>  <p>But a spokeswoman for the Royal College of Nursing, who saw the princess on television, said:  "Normally everybody in theatre should have their hair tucked away. They shouldn't have make-up and  they wouldn't normally be wearing watches and jewellery."  <p>  <p>Wambo was brought from Cameroon by the charity, Chain of Hope, for surgery not available in his  country, to mend a hole in his heart. Sir Magdi said he was suffering from the congenital heart condition, Fallot Syndrome. He was  precisely the kind of child the charity hoped to help "because we want to have maximum impact on the  lifestyle as well as the longevity of the child".  <p>  <p>Cardiologist Dr Rosemary Radley-Smith predicted that Wambo, who hopes to be able to play football  after his operation, would be "running around" within four or five days and should now lead a normal  life.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p><b>Mercy missions</b>  <p>  <p>The Princess of Wales, interviewed on 'Panorama', 20 November: "I'd like to be a queen of  people's hearts, in people's hearts."  <p>  <p>24 November: Visits Argentina's infantile paralysis association. <p>  <p>3 December: Makes secret night  visits to sick and dying in London hospitals, according to the News of the World.  <p>  <p>4 December: Daily Mirror claims Diana has visited a mother and daughter who are dying of Aids.  <p>  <p>22 February: Hugs a blind boy with a brain tumour at Shaukat Khanum hospital in Pakistan,  founded by the former cricketer, Imran Khan.   <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Diana slated for being photographed watching a heart operation  </b><br><br><br><b><h2>24 April 1996</h2></b><br><h2>The Queen of Hearts and aortas  </h2>
  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Catherine Bennett</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>On her latest trip to the operating theatre, Princess Diana impressed a throng of spectators with  the depth of her anatomical expertise. A television journalist who was also enjoying a jaunt to  Harefield Hospital - which seems likely to become the Alton Towers of the medical world - reports that  the Princess showed "an incredible knowledge"' of the heart. As the camera pointed at the Princess,  the Princess pointed at a monitor, offering tips to her fellow spectators: "This is where the aorta is... is that where the problem is?"  <p>  <p>Given her obvious mastery of the systole and diastole, it would be a loss for the NHS if the  Princess's vocation were to amount to nothing more than a hobby. Could a career as a heart surgeon  mark the end of her struggle to find a fulfilling role outside the royal family? Alas, she seems to  have discovered her calling too late in life. Even if the Princess manages to achieve high grade A  levels in mathematics, physics and chemistry, she will have to endure at least five years working her  way through medical school before she gets her itchy fingers on an aorta.  <p>  <p>An alternative and quicker route into surgery might be to train as a registered nurse. Is Diana  eligible? A spokesman for the Royal College of Nursing confirms that although five GCSEs are normally  required, it is possible for differently-educated applicants, such as Diana, to be admitted after  passing an aptitude test. If she turns out to be literate and numerate, she could, within three years,  emerge as a registered nurse, and after some experience in the wards, and a six-month course, qualify  as a cardiac surgeon's assistant.  <p>  <p>Inevitably, the latter course will involve a certain amount of reading, which may present problems,  given Diana's stated aversion to formal study. Emerging from Sir Magdi's operating theatre, the  Princess confided: "You gather information much more from the visual contact rather than reading  books." Does a nurse's training involve reading books? "Loads of it," confirms the Royal College of  Nursing, "absolutely loads of it." If the Princess is not intent on a medical career, why is she so  keen to 'gather information' about major surgery? Many children will understand her passion for  playing at doctors and nurses, but by the age of six or so, most have discarded their little white  outfits, and lost all the bandages and baby-stethoscopes in the Fisher Price doctor's set.  <p>  <p>Perhaps she feels that ambulance chasing is a royal duty? After all, for the upper classes, gawping  at the misfortunes of the sick and needy is a traditional source of amusement. In the last century,  the quality were still gathering to watch amputations at the Old Operating Theatre, at St Thomas's,  which is now a museum. What was the appeal? "It was the thrill of seeing something strange, novel and  bizarre," says the curator, Marietta Ryan, "the thrill of being allowed somewhere most people were not  allowed in." This week the Princess confirmed that she enjoys this very thrill, "literally seeing life  on a knife edge" as she tastefully put it. This, presumably, is a response shared by fans of the Great  Ormond Street television programme, which regularly presents the sufferings of real-life children and  their parents as a form of mass entertainment.  <p>  <p>But the Princess goes further. "It motivates me - it brings purpose and meaning to my life," she  said, as if this constituted some form of justification: trust me, I'm a princess. But how does  watching a mastectomy, or a heart operation, bring purpose and meaning to life? By giving her the  opportunity to explore her own identification with the afflicted? By suggesting that she, too, is a  victim, no less than the helpless patient? Only those who share the Princess's fathomless fascination  with the sick could comprehend her motives; one suspects that the only people who might sympathise are  those other loiterers around casualty wards and operating theatres: the bogus doctors who dress up in  white coats and sidle into hospitals where they occasionally succeed in conducting impromptu  examinations, even operations. These obsessives must envy Diana. As a princess, she need not resort to  deception to dress up in a surgical mask and gaze into the body cavities of comatose strangers.  <p>  <p>With the collusion of her public, Diana has managed, until now, to pass off the most eccentric  behaviour as if it were really quite normal conduct for a modern, forward-looking princess. But  hanging round hospitals and watching surgical operations for kicks is something different. If Diana  cannot stop, someone should help her to do so. The Hippocratic Oath states: 'I will impart a knowledge  of the Art to my own sons, and those of my teachers, and to disciples bound by a stipulation and oath  according to the law of medicine, but to none other.' Perhaps Diana's medical chums should re-read it?  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Gary Younge</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>A doctor arrested three times in two months for stalking the Princess of Wales was struck off the  medical register yesterday because of drugs offences.  <p>  <p>Klaus Wagner, aged 37, was committed to a mental hospital in March after his latest arrest for  stalking, but yesterday he appeared before the General Medical Council to answer the misconduct charge  after drug convictions last September.   <p>  Dr Wagner, an orthopaedic surgeon, was sentenced to 15 months in jail but was released immediately because of time spent on remand. The GMC took only 10 minutes to  decide to strike his name from the register after the committee was told that Dr Wagner's offences  included five of obtaining morphine-based drugs by deception, two of attempting to obtain drugs by  deception and one of possessing a Class A drug, codeine phosphate.

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Aum cult leader Shoko Asahara goes on trial in Japan</b><br><br><br><b><h2>25 April  1996</h2></b><br><h2>Murder trial of doomsday cult leader grips Japan  </h2>
  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Kevin Rafferty</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>Shizue Takahashi, whose husband, a deputy station master, died in the sarin gas attack on the Tokyo  underground last year, sobbed as the multiple murder trial of the founder of the Aum Shinrikyo  doomsday cult began yesterday. Chizuo Matsumoto, more commonly known as Shoko Asahara, is charged with  masterminding the terrorist attack during the morning rush hour on 20 March last year in which 12  people died.  <p>  <p>For reasons to do with rules of evidence, Mr Asahara is charged with 11 deaths and more than 3,700  injuries. The names of all 3,700 were read out in court yesterday.  <p>  <p>Mrs Takahashi, whose husband inhaled a fatal dose of the gas as he tried to help passengers  retching and convulsing on the platform of his underground station, felt enraged yesterday as Mr  Asahara sat with eyes closed and showing no emotion. "My husband died a slow, painful death," she said, wiping tears from her eyes. "How could Asahara  just sit there? He didn't even seem to care."   <p>  <p>From the start, it was clear that Mr Asahara sees the case as a test of wills. The four judges refused him permission to wear his robes, so he appeared in a  navy blue tracksuit with his hair tied back in a ponytail. He stumbled into the courtroom as if to  demonstrate his blindness and frailty. When asked to plead on the charges of murder, he told the judges: "I won't speak."  <p>  <p>But he made a rambling statement about founding and leading the Aum cult. "I pity those who do not  know the truth," he said. "I have no comment about things like lack of freedom and pain." Some people  in the court thought it sounded like an message to his followers, of whom about 120 remain in the  headquarters in the shadow of Mount Fuji.  <p>  <p>A total of 12,292 people queued to take part in a computer lottery for the 48 public seats in the  court. All other court hearings were cancelled, and security was tight with more than 2,000 police on  duty. A dozen media helicopters hovered as Mr Asahara was brought to court in a bullet proof coach  flanked by police cars. If convicted he could face death by hanging. The underground gas attack  destroyed Japan's self-confidence that it was the safest country in the world.  <p>  <p>The names of the more than 3,700 victims took six hours to read. In the public gallery Michiko  Hishinuma sobbed as the name of her husband, Tsuneo, was read out. He was a stationmaster who died  trying to remove a parcel of gas from a train.  <p>  <p>There are eight prosecutors and 12 defence lawyers. Mr Asahara's lawyers have asked to remain  anonymous because they do not support Aum. They complained yesterday that the prosecutors had not  disclosed enough evidence, and that public anger made it hard for Mr Asahara to get a fair trial.  There is no jury system in Japan and judges decide the case.   <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Genetic mutations found in children born eight years after Chernobyl </b><br><br><br><b><h2>25  April 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Chernobyl affects children's genes  </h2>
  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Tim Radford</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>Scientists examining the genetic fingerprints of families in the path of the radioactive plume from  Chernobyl, the reactor which exploded 10 years ago today, have found mutations inherited by children  born years later. This could be the first evidence that radiation damage to one generation could enter  the germline - be passed to children, and to their children. The research, by Yuri Dubrova of the  Vavilov Institute in Moscow, and Sir Alec Jeffreys, the Leicester scientist who pioneered genetic  fingerprinting, is published today in the periodical Nature.  <p>  <p>The researchers report that genetic mutations occur twice as often in children of parents exposed  to the fallout. The scientists collected blood samples from 79 families in a heavily polluted part of Bielarus, to  the north of the reactor. What the families had in common was that both parents had lived in the  region since the accident, and that children had been born into each family between February and  September 1994.  <p>  <p>Although the researchers do not claim that the mutation was directly caused by radiation, they  point out that the worse the level of caesium-137 contamination in the area, the higher the rate of  mutation in local families. "From the very beginning, we started to see that there was probably something wrong," said Dr  Dubrova. "We were absolutely shocked." But both scientists stressed that the mutations were in the  part of the DNA used by forensic scientists to establish paternity, or links with crime. These  'mini-satellite' regions of DNA do not seem to be biologically important.  <p>  <p>The work developed out of an interest in mutations in the DNA used by scientists for  fingerprinting. "To our great surprise we did indeed find an effect at really low doses of radiation," said Sir  Alec.  <p>  <p>The British scientist, Dr Dubrova and five others began examining blood samples from the families,  which they compared with British families. "What we found in the Bielarus sample was evidence for  approximately a doubling of the mutation rate," said Sir Alec. If correct, it would be the first direct evidence for radiation causing mutation through the  generations in humans.  <p>  <p>* Firefighters at Chernobyl were yesterday monitoring the smouldering remains of a blaze that on  Tuesday burned 375 acres of contaminated forest and grassland, writes Matthew Brzezinski in Kiev. The full extent of radiation released from the fire in the 18-mile exclusion zone that surrounds  the power station was not clear yesterday.   <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Owen Bowcott</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>Two 13-year-old girls were last night being questioned by Northamptonshire police after a teenager was kicked to death near a funfair after attempting to stop a fight.  <p>  <p>Louise Allen, of Corby, who was also 13, was put on a life support machine after the attack involving several teenagers in her home town on Monday evening. But it was switched off yesterday afternoon. Her parents had been at her bedside all day.  <p>  <p>The Rev Niall Sheridan, chairman of governors at Our Lady and Pope John School, where Louise had been a pupil, claimed her death was the result of a mindless act of violence.  <p>  <p>"She died trying to break up a fight," he said. "She was trying to make a little peace and got killed for her trouble. She was loved in the school, she was a member of a big extended family with lots of uncles, cousins and aunts. They are absolutely wrecked tonight. She was a sweet girl with a lovely personality."  <p>  <p>Louise had been walking back from the funfair when she came across a fight on Monday evening, Mr Sheridan said. She had been repeatedly kicked around the head during the incident.  <p>  <p>Louise's cousin, Nicola O'Neill, aged 14, yesterday laid flowers on the spot where the fight had taken place. Louise had gone to the aid of a friend, she said, who had been attacked by a girl from a rival school on grassland near the Stevens funfair. But Louise had then become the object of assault, dragged by her hair to the ground and then repeatedly kicked about the head.  <p>  <p>"She was a quiet girl, although when she was with her friends she had a good time," said Nicola. "I've only known her have one fight in her whole life before. That was last year when someone started picking on her and she just started back."  <p>  <p>The funfair owner, Charmaine Guest, said there had been no trouble at the fair and no one had known anything about the incident until some time after. Louise was fatally injured less than a mile from her home, in Steyning Close, on a large council estate in Corby. Friends reported that she had been asthmatic and there were suggestions that the assault had triggered an attack.  <p>  <p>A post mortem is being held at Kettering General Hospital, where Louise died. Northamptonshire police last night confirmed that two 13-year-old girls were being interviewed in custody. Detective Chief Inspector John Cordner said: "We are still trying to establish exactly what happened last night."  <p>  <p>Counselling sessions have been arranged for pupils at her school.   <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Louise Allen kicked to death after trying to break up funfair fight </b><br><br><br><b><h2>4 May 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Tribute to schoolgirl  </h2>
  <br><br>      <p>The parents of Louise Allen, aged 13, allegedly kicked to death by a gang of girls, broke their silence yesterday. "No words will ever be able to describe the pain we feel now she is no longer with us," said Ellen and John Allen, whose daughter died trying to stop a fight between two schoolgirls in Corby, Northamptonshire. "We are living every parent's nightmare." The couple issued their statement a day after more than 1,000 people crowded into Louise's school for a Mass. They said: "She was a wonderful daughter, who lived life to the full. Louise was a very caring girl. She was just a normal teenager." Mr Allen, aged 40, and Mrs Allen, 34, did not attend the service. Two girls, aged 12 and 13, have been charged with her manslaughter. An inquest was opened in Northampton and adjourned to a date to be fixed. Evidence from a Home Office pathologist, Dr Clive Bouch, was read out which said that Louise had died from a brain haemorrhage.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>John Mullin</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>Two schoolgirls were yesterday charged with murdering Louise Allen, the 13-year-old who died after a disturbance following a visit to a fairground in Corby, Northamptonshire, last month.  <p>  <p>The defendants, aged 12 and 13, appeared before magistrates at a specially convened sitting of a youth court in Kettering, Northamptonshire, yesterday. They had been accused of manslaughter, but Crown Prosecution Service lawyers decided to charge them with the more serious offence of murder. The girls, who cannot be named for legal reasons, were remanded in the custody of the local authority.  <p>  <p>Louise died the day after she was allegedly kicked unconscious as she went to the aid of her best friend, Rebecca Tyson. Doctors switched off her life support machine at Kettering general hospital after consulting her parents. A post mortem examination showed she died from a brain haemorrhage. Her father, John Allen, aged 40, a lorry driver, from Glasgow before moving to the former steel town, said: "We are devastated at the loss of our little soul, Louise. No words will ever be able to describe the pain we feel now she is no longer with us. She was a wonderful daughter who, like any normal 13-year-old girl, lived life to the full."  <p>  <p>Mr Allen, and his wife, Ellen, 34, have two other children, John, 10, and two-year-old Dean.  <p>  <p>More than 1,000 people crowded into Our Lady and Pope John School, Corby, which Louise had attended, for a mass in her honour.  The Rev Peter Wilson, Dean of Corby, and the family's local parish priest, spoke of Louise as a mother figure.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>National Grid share sale</b><br><br><br><b><h2>1 May 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Grid takes lion's share of business  </h2>
  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Paul Murphy</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>The nervousness which has characterised trading over the past week or so was still noticeable yesterday.  While speculators continued to unwind positions in potential bid stocks (Labroke was the main victim yesterday), the downside was limited by the flurry of activity around National Grid. But the final score on the FT-SE 100, up 8.7 at 3817.9 at the end of the day, disguised the fact that there were a couple of worrying drops during the day - the most serious coming mid-afternoon as the Dow Jones index on Wall Street opened 30 points lower. Reported trading volume of more than one billion shares suggested a boom in business, but almost a quarter of this was accounted for by the one big trade in the Grid.  <p>  <p>The move by brokers James Capel to buy Hanson's 12.5 per cent stake in the Grid at 192.5p a share was discussed all day. Usually, when a broker or investment bank buys such a big stake in any company, it immediately places the stock - either with another single buyer (such as a predator) or, more commonly, with a string of institutions. These are known as 'bought deals,' with the broker simply taking a turn.  <p>  <p>It quickly became clear yesterday morning that Capel's move on the Grid was different. The only trade printed on the stock market's trade reporting system was the business with Hanson. The expected follow up of a string of trades with institutions failed to materialise - triggering speculation that something had gone badly wrong at Capel, that it might have failed to place the stock and been left, instead, with a &#163;400m liability on its trading book.  <p>  <p>It was only just before market business came to an official close that the broker disclosed a few details of the derivatives transaction it has struck with the Saudis. Shares in National Grid subsequently closed 6p higher at 205p and Hanson added 0.5p to 197.5p, while shares in Capel's highly rated parent, HSBC, crept 2p higher to 984p.  <p>  <p>Elsewhere, it was the turn of Ladbroke to face the profit takers and the stock fell 7.5p to 195.5p as a result. Last week, the City was braying for a bid for the hotels-to-gaming group, with Scottish & Newcastle widely predicted to be the most likely predator. Scottish & Newcastle itself lost 3p to 688p yesterday. Amongst other recent takeover favourite's, the pressure was still on Standard Chartered, off 4p at 622p, while a few nervous types were selling out of Cable & Wireless, down 3.5p at 521.5p as the talks with British Telecom continue.  <p>  <p>National Power, facing attention from across the Atlantic, also succumbed to a bit of selling, closing 10p lower at 561p.  <p>  <p>On a more positive note, there was a sudden rally in Argos just before the close, leaving the market price a net 21p higher at 649p in brisk trading. Dealers insisted the move was a very technical one, simply reflecting a shortage of stock amongst market makers.  <p>  <p>Glaxo Wellcome also ended the day on a strong note, up 14p at 806p after an advisory board to the US Food and Drug Administration recommended that the drug regulator clear Glaxo's new general anesthetic, Ultiva. Amongst the bio-technology stocks, British Biotech continued its run, with a few brave punters paying &#163;30 apiece for the shares at one stage in the afternoon. Late in the day, however, there was a sudden rush to take profits, cutting the day's gain to 50p, with the stock at &#163;29.25. Cortecs International was also hit, closing 19p lower at 394p. TI Group closed up 10p to 547p as the company made a presentation to analysts, while BAT Industries ended the session 11p higher at 502.5p ahead of today's first quarter figures. Most of this rise came during the last half-hour of business, suggesting the figures may have leaked. AromaScan, the 'electronic nose' company, added 5p to 181p after news that it has signed a five-year development and marketing deal with Japan's Mitsubishi Electric covering the British firm's sensor technology. It remained unclear whether the market had woken up to how significant the deal is for AromaScan, which just a month or so ago was warning on profits and trying to explain how long it takes to finalise alliances such as the one with Mitsubishi.  <p>  <p>Close followers say the Japanese group took 15 months to carefully evaluate AromaScan's technology and check out the competition. Alliances with other players in other parts of the world are expected, and broker Credit Lyonnais Laing now reckons the company will be profitable by the end of next year. Cray Electronics jumped 5p to 48p after a trading up-dated, released ahead of year-end figures due in early July. The firm reported "steady progress", but followers who have watched this former stock market rocket come back to earth like the proverbial stick seemed more interested in a statement that the company's cash position has now "stabilised" after the huge losses reported for the past 18 months.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Andrew Culf</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>Radio 5 Live, the BBC's news and sports network, was yesterday named national station of the year at the Sony radio awards, the industry's equivalent of the Oscars.  <p>  <p>The two-year-old station beat off competition from the rejuvenated Radio 1, and took five other awards on a day of triumph for BBC radio. The only surprise was the defeat of Chris Evans, hailed as Radio 1's saviour, in the music-based breakfast programme category by Virgin Radio's Russ and Jono's Breakfast Experience, starring Russ Williams and Jonathan Coleman.  <p>  <p>But Evans, who last week renewed his production company's &#163;1.5m contract with Radio 1 for a year, was named national broadcaster of the year for boosting the station's audience share.  <p>  <p>Matthew Bannister, Radio 1 controller, said: "Chris is the most talented broadcaster of his generation and adding a million listeners in just nine months is an extraordinary single-handed achievement."  <p>  <p>Radio 5 Live, which has silenced pre-launch critics who labelled it "Radio Bloke", succeeds Radio 2 as national station of the year. The judges said: "The excellent team of sports presenters deliver clear, exciting and informed broadcasting, so engaging that it makes listeners feel they are actually there at the event itself."  <p>  <p>The triumph was hailed by controller Jenny Abramsky, who said: "We now have a station which is both fun and of the highest quality, reporting to the whole of the UK."  <p>  <p>The station's awards included two for coverage of last year's Ryder Cup golf, which was otherwise available only on satellite TV.  <p>  <p>Michael Green, acting managing director of BBC Network Radio, said the awards reflected "the great strength in depth of what we do".   <p>  <p><b>Winners</b>  <p>  <p>Documentary: War and Peace (Radio 2); Magazine: Offspring (Radio 4); Comedy: People Like Us (Radio 4); Daytime music sequence: Sounds of the Sixties (Radio 2); Themed music: Fairest Isle (Radio 3); Specialist music: Kershaw in South Africa (Radio 1); Arts programme: Green and Pleasant Land (Radio 2); Drama: Albion Tower (Radio 3); Service to community: Affairs of the Heart (Radio 2); Creativity/innovation: Poetic Theorems (BBC Radio Scotland); Best on-air contest: Apollo 13 (Virgin Radio).  <p>  <p>Best event coverage: Ryder Cup (Radio 5 Live); Best education: The Square on the Pythagoras (Radio 4); Phone-in/debate: Any Questions - Hong Kong (Radio 4); Response to news event: Dallyn on Saturday (Radio 5 Live); Interview: In the Psychiatrist's Chair - Ffyona Campbell (Radio 4); Sports broadcaster: Jonathan Pearce (Capital Gold); Best dramatic performance: Janet McTeer (Radio 4); Broadcaster (local): Steve Penk (Key 103); Local station of year: Moray Firth Radio; Regional station of year: Clyde 1FM; Best radio writer: Lee Hall for I Luv U Jimmy Spud (Radio 4); Radio Academy award: Henry Wood Promenade Concerts.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Radio 5 Live named UK  station of the year in Sony radio awards </b><br><br><br><b><h2>18 May 1996</h2></b><br><h2>BBC  tops radio ratings  </h2>
 <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Andrew Culf</b><br><br>      <p> <p>The BBC has leapfrogged ahead of commercial radio in the ratings battle for the first  time in nearly two years, it was disclosed yesterday. A decline in listening to local  commercial stations combined with strong performances by Radio 1 and Radio 5 Live helped the  BBC regain pole position in the first three months of 1996. <p> <p>Viva!, the women's radio  station in London, which has been bought for &#163;3m by Mohammed Al Fayed's Liberty  Publishing, slumped to one of the lowest figures recorded with 11,000 listeners a week, fewer  than 0.1 per cent of its available audience. <p> <p>BBC radio gained a 50.4 per cent share of  the total radio audience between January and March, compared to 47.2 per cent in the final  quarter of 1995. Nearly 400,000 more listeners tuned into BBC services over the period, while  commercial radio's share slipped from 49.7 per cent to 47.6 per cent. The reversal contradicted  warnings by Liz Forgan, the former managing director of BBC network radio, who was credited  with successfully repositioning its five national stations before resigning earlier this year.  She said increasing competition would erode the BBC's share to 30 per cent within a decade. <p>  <p>Best performances were recorded by Radio 1, where breakfast show host, Chris Evans,  increased his weekly ratings from 6.2 million to 6.48 million adults, an increase of 280,000.  When under 15-year-olds are included the weekly audience is 7.36 million. <p> <p>Radio 5 Live,  named last month as national station of the year in the Sony radio awards, achieved a record  weekly audience of 5.21 million. BBC local and regional services also registered an increased  share. <p> <p>Sue Farr, head of marketing and publicity for network radio, said the figures  were robust and healthy. <p> <p>Douglas McArthur, managing director of the Radio Advertising  Bureau, denied the commercial sector faced a crisis, but said local stations would investigate  the decline. He said commercial radio had been the fastest growing advertising medium for three  years and had 30 per cent more listeners than three years ago. <p> <p>All the national  commercial stations, except Atlantic 252, registered increases. Talk Radio UK, which increased  its audience by six per cent to 2.1 million, has poached BBC radio's head of strategy and  development Paul Robinson as general manager. It intends to follow Radio 5 Live's success by  boosting its evening sports output. <p> <p> <p> <p> <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr> <td  width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td  width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td  width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td  width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr> <td align=left  valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td> <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A  HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td> <td align=right  valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td> </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>RAF to pull out of Germany, final base will close by 2002</b><br><br><br><b><h2>2 May 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Faults on Polaris submarines leave two-year nuclear 'gap'  </h2>
  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>David Fairhall</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>The last four RAF squadrons in Germany are to be pulled out, ending a deployment that began in post-war occupation more than half a century ago. RAF Bruggen, the only British air base remaining from the five established in Germany at the end of the second world war, will close in 2002. The departure is prompted partly by the German population's refusal, now the Soviet threat has been removed from its eastern borders, to allow the RAF's Tornados to practise low flying. Nor will the Germans tolerate British 60-tonne Challenger tanks - many of which will remain there for the foreseeable future along with 27,000 ground troops - ranging over their countryside in the way they used to.  <p>  <p>However yesterday's defence white paper, in which the RAF withdrawal was announced, confirms plans for British forces to carry out manoeuvres deep in eastern Europe, on tank ranges formerly used by Soviet troops. In September, armoured units will deploy to the Drawsko Pomorskie range in western Poland, while the Royal Welsh Fusiliers will exercise on the Lvov training area in Ukraine.  <p>  <p>Both countries are happy to accept the environmental disturbance in return for hard currency. In Poland's case, making western forces welcome is also a means, with the despatch of peacekeeping forces to Bosnia, of establishing credentials for early membership of Nato.  <p>  <p>The disclosure that the Royal Navy's Polaris nuclear deterrent patrols are to end this year, two years before the next of the new Trident missile submarines, HMS Vigilant, is ready for sea, is also buried deep in the white paper. It means that until 1988 only two submarines will be available to maintain nuclear deterrence instead of the three or four boats the Navy says it normally requires.  <p>  <p>A warning that this 'gap' would appear came last year from the Commons defence committee. A series of undisclosed problems with the Polaris submarines' nuclear propulsion system has apparently forced the last two Polaris boats, Renown and Repulse, into retirement.  <p>  <p>The Chief of the Defence Staff, Field Marshal Sir Peter Inge, said yesterday there was no doubt about providing the strategic deterrent with just two Trident boats until the other pair are completed, in 1998 and around the turn of the century.  <p>  <p>But the field marshal's words could be used as evidence by an incoming Labour administration to challenge the defence ministry's insistence on building four Trident boats at a cost of &#163;10bn when continuous patrols could be maintained by three submarines - or for a short period, as now, by only two. The fourth boat is essentially an insurance policy against accident.  <p>  <p>Yesterday's white paper lays out for Parliament the Government's justification for spending &#163;21,425m on defence this year. The forecast trend of military expenditure is roughly level for the next three years, amounting by 1998/99 to 2.7 per cent of gross domestic product, against the 2.3 per cent average of Britain's European allies. Last year the budget was underspent by &#163;500m, mainly on equipment and spares. But yesterday the Defence Secretary, Michael Portillo, forecast increased expenditure on equipment, rising to more than 40 per cent of the total, and providing the armed forces with the best equipment "at any time in memory".  <p>  <p>The standard of military housing should also benefit from cash made available by selling thousands of married quarters to private property companies.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Arthur Scargill launches the Socialist Labour Party on May Day </b><br><br><br><b><h2>2 May 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Scargill makes his pitch  </h2>
  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Michael White</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>As Mohamed al Fayed, owner of Harrods, entered the political fray yesterday with plans for an independent think tank, Arthur Scargill opened a new phase in the guerrilla war which small parties are threatening to wage against the Labour-Conservative hegemony at the coming general election. When the miners' leader's Socialist Labour Party (SLP) was finally given its formal May Day launch, he hinted that he would stand against Alan Howarth at the next election if Labour imposes the Tory defector on a constituency such as the Yorkshire seat of Wentworth.  <p>  <p>Given the unpopularity of the Tories under John Major and unease on the left about Tony Blair's leadership, the surprise is that David v Goliath politics has taken so long to re-emerge after Margaret Thatcher's charismatic grip on British politics was replaced by pragmatic muddle. The prolonged political crisis of the 1970s led to the rise of Scots and Welsh nationalist parties, a surge of Trotskyite activism in and beyond Labour's ranks and - briefly in the 1974 elections - a boost for the fascist National Front.  <p>  <p>Little was heard from Tory MPs like Douglas Hurd and Chris Patten about the need for electoral reform and PR once Mrs Thatcher was firmly in charge. And the greatest breakaway of all, the ex-Labour SDP, ended in merger with the Liberals. But in the 1990s electoral reform talk has returned on both left and right, with disaffected MPs and activists predicting splits and realignment in both major parties after the next election.  <p>  <p>Mr Scargill has long been a supporter of PR as a vital element and is anti-European, like Sir James Goldsmith, from whom he does not expect financial support.  <p>  <p>Just as the Goldsmith-funded Referendum Party is sizing up prominent Tory MPs such as Kenneth Clarke and David Mellor to take on, members of Mr Scargill's SLP have already decided to challenge Tony Blair in his Sedgefield constituency and the Shadow Employment Secretary, Michael Meacher, in Oldham West.  <p>  <p>Mr Scargill announced yesterday that the party planned to field as many parliamentary candidates as it could afford, not a problem facing Sir James, who has pledged &#163;20m from family trusts to fight for a "real" referendum on Europe.  <p>  <p>Mr al Fayed - who, like Sir James, made his first fortune in the grocery trade - is similarly free of immediate financial constraints if he decides to go down the same path. But colleagues stated categorically yesterday that the Egyptian-born entrepreneur is not, contrary to reports, planning to start a formal political party as such, even though he is passionately interested in democratic politics and reform of British instititions. Instead he may emulate another philanthropic tradition in the grocery trade, that of the Sainsbury family, whose good causes have long included discreet help for political think tanks. Mr al Fayed is looking for bright young people, "without axes to grind", to run an independent institute to examine options for constitutional reform. He will provide the 'seed corn'. Options range from a slimmed-down monarchy and reformed House of Lords to a Bill of Rights and Freedom of Information Act.  <p>  <p>Mr Scargill is also an outsider with a grievance. The SLP was being founded, the National Union of Mineworkers president said yesterday, because there were now "no fundamental differences between the Conservative Party, New Labour and the Liberal Democrats".  <p>  <p>The new party, whose candidate Brenda Nixon won 5.4 per cent of the vote in the Hemsworth byelection in February, has been dismissed by both the Labour leadership and leftwing MPs like Ken Livingstone as irrelevant. Mr Scargill was flanked at the launch by two London Labour councillors who have defected to Socialist Labour, Pat Sikorski of the Rail Maritime and Transport union executive, and Imran Khan, solicitor for the family of the racist murder victim, Stephen Lawrence.  <p>  <p>Between 400 and 500 SLP members are expected to attend the new party's founding congress on Saturday.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

"I'm knackered," he says, attacking the tea and coffee-making  facilities left out by the NUM lawyers in whose offices we are meeting. "I'll stir," I offer,  waving a spoon towards the teapot he has just filled. He grins: "Typical journalist, always  stirring things." <p> <p>In fact, he looks anything but knackered, he is glowing. Energy throbs  through his face, his hair bristles with static. After something of a fallow period, Arthur has  bounced back into the news and clearly, Arthur is happiest when he is in the public eye.  Wednesday's launch of his new Socialist Labour Party went well, "there were 100 reporters and  six camera crews in attendance!" There was a one-to-one with Jeremy Paxman on Newsnight which  was good because Arthur likes an audience. To be more precise, he likes performing. God knows  what happens to him when he's alone; maybe he simply disappears. But for now he is here, and I  am curious to know where this abundance of energy comes from. <p> <p>"You're only the second  person that has ever asked me that," he says, pleased. "The other person was Billy Graham, the  evangelist. It's interesting. We met for two hours in 1985 and Billy said (at this point  Scargill breaks into a plausible imitation of the American) 'You know Arrthurrr, one of the  things people say to me is: How on earth does Arthur Scargill keep going, against all the  ahdds? You seem to have this tremmennus ability to bounce back. What keeps you going?'I just  looked at him, and I said, it's called faith, Billy. He looked at me and he said, 'I  unnerstand.'" <p> <p>Billy, of course, was talking about his Christian faith whilst Arthur was  talking about socialism. But faith is the right word here; Arthur burns with righteous Old  Testament indignation. His energy comes from his anger, what spurs him on is his capacity for  feeling outrage. <p> <p>His invective towards New Labour is on an Olympian scale. "If the  church to which you went decided to stop worshipping God and started worshipping the devil, you  would have second thoughts," he declaims, when I suggest that starting a new party might be an  overreaction to Labour's dumping of Clause Four. <p> <p>"The leadership of New Labour has  abandoned their socialist faith and embraced capitalism which is tantamount to embracing the  devil!" We will come back to Arthur's firebrand socialism, but first I would like to know a few  personal details. For starters, is it true that he forbade his only daughter Margaret, a GP  aged 31, to marry her fiance Justin Maitland because he wasn't good enough? <p> <p>"I never  speak about my family." Yes, but the wedding was called off at the last minute in March, and  Justin told the Daily Mail that "people don't realise what a terrible snob he [Arthur] is". Did  Arthur, as was alleged at the time, force Margaret to choose between them because he'd had a  row with Justin's father, an Australian trade unionist? "I never speak about my family. I think  it is proper that I should not do so." <p> <p>This, though disappointing, is fair enough.  Scargill is not one of those public figures who peddles the image of a happy family for his own  personal/political gain. <p> <p>But how important are his family to him? Do they give him  strength to continue his fight against capitalist forces? "I've been involved in politics since  I was 14, I wasn't married then and I didn't have children," he says pointedly. <p> <p>Later on  he throws in that he "was offered a place at Oxford but I didn't go because I was married with  a wife and child." This, I think, is meant to sound like a generous sacrifice made on their  behalf; instead, it comes out as slightly peevish, as if he now regrets the decision. <p>  <p>But then Arthur's life turns out to be full of opportunities that he has resolutely refused  to countenance. "I could have been an MP at least six times," he tells me twice. "I'm talking  about rock solid Labour seats offered to me, when I was an extremely 'popular' figure." <p>  <p>He could have gone to grammar school too, he was bright enough, but even aged 10 he was  sufficiently stubborn to refuse to sit the 11 plus. The grammar school was in Barnsley and he  didn't want to leave his home in Worsbrough. A decision he also regrets. <p> <p>He lives there  still, on the outskirts of this grim mining village, in a stone house called Treelands with a  small goldfish pond at the front. But it's hard to imagine him kicking off his Hush Puppies and  curling up on a sofa. He is quick to tell me that in the last week alone, he has travelled more  than 1,000 miles between speaking engagements. <p> <p>"In Salford I spoke to 1,200 economics  students; in Leeds Town Hall, 1,100; in Manchester 1,500; in Swansea there were 450 people  present and in Cardiff they turned 200 people away! In Manchester, they were queueing down the  stairs..." Yes, yes, but what does he do at home? "I watch television actually. I like 'Morse' and  'The Two Ronnies' were extremely good. I like TV because I can read the paper at the same time.  When I went to university in Leeds, one of my tutors, who was an aide to Winston Churchill,  taught me to read newspapers very quickly. You glance down the page like a scanner. It is a  unique facility!" <p> <p>As I left the office to meet him, several female colleagues confided  they find Scargill "oddly sexy". It is obvious he enjoys being the centre of attention, does he  think of himself as attractive? <p> <p>"Are you serious?" He shines for a moment. "I have never  considered that question in my life! I will say though that I find I can work with women much,  much easier than with men. Working with women does not have the same conflicts, or the same  competitiveness as with men." <p> <p>(Afterwards, I wish I'd asked him how he coped for 20  years down the mine with only men for company. But interviewing Scargill is like asking  strangers for directions. You can get distracted by their mannerisms.) He continues, smiling.  "For example, the way this interview has been conducted has more understanding, on both sides,  than if you had been a man. I remember being interviewed by a man who became aggressive, well  you know, I am a coal miner from Yorkshire and I begin to react! The moment anyone cross  examines me in an aggressive way I respond. <p> <p>"One of the most classic interviews ever  done in the history of television was between Peter Snow and me. I am also told that it is now  used as an interview to show journalists what not to do! I really forced him into backing down  and taking back something he said, because what he was putting to me was untrue." And just for  a second his pale eyes dart off into the middle distance, as if he is briefly reliving this  triumph. <p> <p>The aggression thing is understandable; symbols of it abound throughout his  life. From the image of the mine itself, to his one-time hobby of judo (he was a green belt but  gave up after breaking his big toe) to his two giant schnauzer dogs which weigh 18 stone  between them. When he's in Yorkshire, he goes to bed around 2am but is up by 6.30am to walk  them four miles a day. But why schnauzers - more commonly associated with the German police?  "We used to breed Airedale terriers," he explains. "But when my daughter moved house she took  the three Airedales with her. She had always argued they were hers and I accepted that," he  adds, hinting at another unresolved family tension. "Emotionally we didn't want to get another  Airedale, so we decided to get a schnauzer." <p> <p>Are they an extension of himself? "Oh they  are not aggressive like rottweilers. They're magnificent with children. The bitch is a bit  naughty with other dogs, but the dog is fine." <p> <p>And Arthur is fine too, far less prickly  than I'd expected from his television appearances. In fact, he is wildly charming, performing  funny little cameos of his old tutors (which involve lots of Arthur mimicking a posh voice) and  listening with the unfailing attention of a dictaphone. His sincerity about socialism is never  in doubt. But then neither is his enormous ego. "I am not an egomaniac," he says emphatically.  "If I was I would have gone for the gravy train special, I would have gone to parliament." <p>  <p>But isn't that just where he's hoping to go? "I have never had any desire to be an MP." So  why form a political party? "I want to ensure we have a political party that puts into words  its principle of faith, but has a practical means of putting them into action." <p> <p>But  surely that means being an MP? "I would not rule it out for the reason that the party may feel  there are circumstances where I should stand." But Arthur is the new party, and in our  conversation all roads lead back to Arthur. Take the following simple and ostensibly Arthurless  question. Does he think Tony Blair is charismatic? "The only memory I have of Tony is when he  first spoke with me, when he spoke as a young newly elected MP, when he said it was one of the  proudest moments in his life to speak alongside one of the greatest trade union leaders in  Britain, Arthur Scargill." It is as if he is stuck in his own Scargillian groove. He even  speaks with his own Scargillian syntax, which has a formal, almost biblical flavour. Words are  rarely abbreviated - I had is rarely shortened to I'd; it's remains it is. <p> <p>And Arthur  Scargill remains the same too. "There has been no change in the way I have reacted all through  my life," he says proudly. "It is no different now than it has always been." <p> <p> <p> <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td  width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td  width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td  width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td  width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr> <td  align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td> <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A  HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td> <td align=right  valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td> </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Matthew Engel</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>This was the fulfilment of a dream. At long last, a new political party of the left! Strong men had awaited this day for generations - not the people who were ever going to join, you understand, but the leaders of the Labour Party desperately keen to get rid of the ones who would.  <p>  <p>Now the awkward squad sat in a North London conference hall, at the feet of Arthur Scargill, proclaiming allegiance to the Socialist Labour Party, and out of Labour's hair forever. Arthur: Tony could have hugged you - just like Margaret, all those years ago.  <p>  <p>By its own lights, Socialist Labour had a successful launch conference on Saturday. The hall was almost full. Debate was well ordered. After an uneasy start, Mr Scargill, the party's president and thus far its only well-known member, hit top oratorical form.  <p>  <p>Total membership is 1,152 and climbing fast, including a councillor in Greenwich. And, freed from the old pressures from leaders who considered them loony, all of them were able to say whatever they wanted. The effect was exquisitely ironic. The president had to sit on the platform, looking as serene as possible, while his own leftwingers - the Very Awkward Squad - tried to amend the party's initial policy documents. Mr Scargill proposed the economic policy, which merely wanted to end capitalism. Before the party was an hour old, one speaker cried: "Send this motion back into the Fabian bog it crawled out of!"  <p>  <p>A comrade from Cheshire demanded that the party explain to the working class its revolutionary destiny. One from Leicester wanted to "smash the bureaucratic and military apparatus of the state through revolutionary struggle".  <p>  <p>Suddenly, it was Mr Scargill who had to play the role previously assigned to Labour leaders opposing the likes of him. He was "saddened" by the criticisms. It was "absolutely irresponsible" to talk about armed struggle. The policies had to be "relevant" and "meaningful", he said. "It's no good going to Liverpool dockers and telling them what a revolutionary said in 1917."  <p>  <p>The platform won, as it did all day. The members will allow Mr Scargill to get rid of the capitalists his way. They also stifled proposals to make housework mandatory for men (a possible vote-winner, this, but with interesting implications for law enforcement) and abolish all immigration controls.  <p>  <p>This was defeated, very narrowly, partly after pro-platform speakers pointed out that it might mean letting in fascists and white South Africans. It is not entirely clear that white South Africans would be flocking to a Scargillite Britain, but those who fear that such a government would be Stalinist in practice can, I think, be reassured. It would not be that efficient.  <p>  <p>The conference - due to start at 10am or 11am, depending on which message you got - began at 11.23am; the afternoon session, scheduled for 1.45pm, started at 2.08pm. There were 26 documents to discuss; they managed six. Trivial subjects like the British constitution will have to be considered by the membership next May, presumably after the general election. In the meantime, the party's new national executive committee will take charge of these questions. It was touching throughout to see how everyone kept hold of the Labour Party's forms and formulae while hurling down anathemas on it. The day was replete with attempted references back; and the party has a new Clause Four lovingly rebuilt to resemble the original. This is a party of ex-lovers, spurned but still obsessed.  <p>  <p>The loudest cheer of the day was for the fraternal delegate from Cuba. He must have felt at home in the Camden Centre, an art deco hall in need of someone willing to give it a lick of paint, put the clock right and unblock the lavatories. He may also have recognised much of Socialist Labour's programme.  <p>  <p>This does involve a certain amount of public expenditure: huge pay rises for the deserving; voluntary retirement on full pay at 55; pensions to be doubled within 12 months; a million new homes every year; all closed hospitals to be opened etc etc.  <p>  <p>These are policies that used to be known as millenarian. However, now the millennium is approaching faster than the policies, the word is no longer very helpful.  <p>  <p>But Mr Scargill was certain they could be funded, from (1) company profits (2) Britain's withdrawal from Europe and (3) the cancellation of Trident. There will be churls who mutter that one whiff of this programme will cause profits to vanish like the morning dew.  <p>  <p>That will not worry Mr Scargill. As he finished, having promised to nationalise the Midland and NatWest Banks, Unilever, ICI and various others whose names cannot be intimated to their shareholders here because they were drowned in applause, his serenity was complete.  <p>  <p>It was as if he had returned to his own personal reworking of Kipling that characterised his handling of the great strike: "If you can meet with triumph and disaster/And never quite work out just which is which." But he may be a little concerned about his left flank. So, in a comradely spirit, I offer some advice on how to isolate them and attract more mainstream support. Why not make the banner a little less scarlet and go for something more pastel-shaded? Why not a red rose emblem instead? That would be nice. A little less socialism and a few more grins all round, maybe? I am only trying to be helpful. It has worked for other parties, you know.   <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Vivek Chaudhary</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>The Crystal Palace fan attacked by Eric Cantona with a kung fu kick last year, launched his own drop kick attack on a prosecuting lawyer yesterday in court, seconds after hearing he had been found guilty of provoking the Manchester United star.  <p>  <p>Matthew Simmons, aged 21, threw himself at Jeffrey McCann, grabbing him around the neck, trying to haul him over a table and appearing to kick him in the chest.  He attacked as the 55-year-old lawyer, who was spending his last day in court before his retirement, asked magistrates to ban Simmons from all football grounds.  <p>  <p>As Mr McCann, who led the prosecution's case during the three-day trial at Croydon, south London, magistrates, attempted to break free, six police officers rushed in to restrain Simmons, who then rushed at the press box shouting: "I am innocent. I swear on the Bible. You press, you are scum." The case was adjourned and Simmons, who was convicted of two charges of using threatening words and behaviour at Selhurst Park on 25 January 1995, was bundled away in handcuffs.  <p>  <p>Mary Richards, chairman of the bench, later sentenced him to seven days in prison for contempt of court. "Your violent outburst was an obvious and serious contempt of court and we feel that a term of custody is appropriate," she told him.  <p>  <p>For his part in the Cantona incident - during a Crystal Palace-Manchester United Premier League game - Simmons, of Thornton Heath, Surrey, was fined &#163;500 for threatening behaviour. Magistrates banned him from all professional football grounds for 12 months.  <p>  <p>Adam Davis, defending, told magistrates that his client apologised for the courtroom attack and that he had just snapped.  "He's had this case hanging over him for nearly a year and a half and has had to run the gauntlet of the press. He's suffered death threats, abuse and had bullets sent to him in the post... Having waited nearly 22 hours for a decision on this case, and bearing in mind that he's 21 years of age... having to deal with all this and the pressure building and building, he snapped."  <p>  <p>Mr Davis also told the court Simmons had recently been in hospital suffering from a panic attack, and had lost his job since the Cantona affair. Simmons apologised to Mr McCann for his actions.  He told the magistrates: "I don't think anything I say can justify my actions but I can only apologise to Mr McCann."  Mr McCann was not hurt.  <p>  <p>The court had heard that Simmons rushed from his seat at the game, hurling racial abuse and making obscene gestures at Cantona as the player was sent off.  The Manchester United player was sentenced to two weeks in jail for common assault for his part in the incident at the match. But this was later reduced to 120 hours' community service.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Tories suffer heavy losses in local elections</b><br><br><br><b><h2>4 May 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Let the markets decide  </h2>
  <br><br> 
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Leading article</b>  <p>    <p>John Major must be thanking his stars that the local election results were only a disaster and not the meltdown that might have prompted his voluntary resignation or a visit from The Suits to help him make up his mind. No matter what gloss the Tory spin doctors put on it, this is an unmitigated disaster for the Government. And it is an even bigger disaster for the country which will have to struggle rudderless under a lame-duck administration for another year - unless the Government is unexpectedly defeated in the Commons. Dr Mawhinney, the chairman of the Conservative Party, may be right that Labour didn't do as well as before and that the Tories (up two points from last year's disaster) may have bottomed out: when something falls off a cliff it can only go so far before bouncing back a bit.  <p>  <p>Analysis of the results shows that Thursday's voting projected into general election terms would put Labour on 43 per cent of the votes, 16 percentage points ahead of the Conservatives on 27 per cent and with the Liberal Democrats only one point behind on 26 per cent. The Lib-Dems have done better than expected partly because they benefited from tactical voting (at Labour's expense) at the local elections despite being screwed by the 'Blair effect' in opinion polls at national level. The Government's near-obliteration as a force in local politics is only natural justice for a party which itself tried to obliterate local councils as a force in national politics by reducing their revenue raising powers to only 20 per cent. The Conservatives failed to win a single seat in Manchester, Newcastle, Salford, Slough, Tameside and Oxford. They lost Dr Mawhinney's Peterborough and narrowly held bluer-than-blue Runnymede on the casting vote of the Mayor. Lib-Dems stormed to victory in John Redwood's Wokingham and in Tunbridge Wells where 'Disgusted' turned turtle. But no victory was sweeter for Labour than Essex Man seeing the error of his ways and severing his Tory bonds with iconic Basildon.  <p>  <p>To win the general election from this position, John Major would need a psephological as well as an economic miracle. As our analysis shows, even if the Conservatives were to close the gap on Labour by as much as they did between the 1986 local elections and the 1987 general election they would still be behind Labour. That period involved the most outrageous experiment in election engineering of recent times - the Lawson Boom of 1986/1987 when income tax was reduced by 3p in two successive budgets against the background of a six per cent-a-year increase in consumer spending and a raging boom in house prices. In today's conditions it is almost impossible - and assuredly undesirable - to reproduce those conditions and if they were the Governor of the Bank of England, now free to speak his mind, would do so in no uncertain terms.  <p>  <p>The Government is trying to stoke up a mini-boom as witnessed by last month's &#163;4bn income tax cuts (following on a &#163;1bn electricity rebate) to which must be added maturing Tessas, windfall gains from building society mergers, interest rate reductions plus capital projects from the lottery. But no one knows whether punters will spend this bonanza money or save it. Either way it is highly unlikely to reproduce the feelgood factor of the Lawson boom. Unless something unexpected happens (the equivalent of the Falklands War) this government is doomed. Doomed but not dead. It will stumble on plucking policies out of the air (like building yet more prisons) in a vain hope to attract more votes without disturbing its Eurosceptic wing. They must know there is no policy big or imaginative enough to extricate this exhausted government from the quicksands in which it has sunk. Its only distant chance is to stir up a campaign so dirty, even in comparison with the last one, that it once again persuades the electorate to swallow the snake oil of self-interest against the needs of the community. A change of leadership won't help either. Mr Major for once should rise above all this and put his country before his party and call a general election as soon as possible. As he tells us so often in other contexts: let the market decide.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Alex Bellos</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>They used to be the pride of Essex and a symbol of Government electoral success. Now Basildon Conservatives are an endangered species, with only a handful of votes in Thursday's local election keeping them from extinction. As the sole remaining Tory on Basildon's 42-member council, Michael Buckley is aware of the weight on his shoulders. "I intend to rise to the challenge," he says. "A lot of people voted Conservative but didn't get a councillor. I will represent them."  <p>  <p>It is perhaps fitting that the man carrying the Tory torch in an area that did particularly well during the 1980s housing boom is an estate agent. The father of two has lived in Basildon's small neighbour Wickford all his life. After leaving school to work in the City he was tempted back to start selling homes in the county. Rising rates bills in the 1970s ignited interest in Tory policies. He won Wickford's safest Liberal seat by 373 votes in 1988.  <p>  <p>The margin of victory increased to about 2,000 in 1992, when the Tories won control of the council for the first time, shortly after the general election in which Basildon MP David Amess's victory was a vital indicator that John Major would retain power.  <p>  <p>Mr Buckley became deputy leader of the council, although he resigned when he voted against reorganising into a unitary authority. Now after beating a Lib Dem candidate by 99 votes, he is the Conservative group. So is Essex Man's honeymoon with the Tories over? "Essex Man is disillusioned with politicians. The economic indicators are that our support will come back." On a local level, the most pressing issue is the Lib Dems plan to brick-pave Wickford's High Street. He would prefer money going on street-lighting and cameras, but realises that with one versus 41 he faces a near impossible task.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Tories suffer heavy losses in local elections</b><br><br><br><b><h2>6 May 1996</h2></b><br><h2>No gloom at the inn  </h2>
  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>John Biffen</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>At times of political drama I retire to my home village of Llanyblodwel and listen to the wisdom spoken in the Horseshoe Inn. Against the background of the gentle Tanat River it all seems much calmer. So it has been this weekend as the drama of the local election results settled into context. It has not been a political Armageddon and the removal vans are not yet outside Downing Street.  <p>  <p>There are three useful yardsticks for measuring government popularity. They are byelections, local authority elections and opinion polls. Byelections are the most dramatic and, with the loss of seats, they can be politically potent as a government's majority disappears. On the other hand, they are an ephemeral judgment of localised opinion in special circumstances. At the last general election every Liberal byelection gain was reversed. Local authority election results are a better guide to current opinion, but still remain an uncertain pointer. The turn-out, usually less than 40 per cent, is often less than half a general election figure. Furthermore the 'stay at homes' - if they had voted - would not necessarily conform to the same pattern of voting. Yet the local vote is largely determined by national issues.  <p>  <p>It is my judgment that the most reliable test of political choice is the national opinion poll. The track record is good, although the 1992 election showed that even the pollsters could go astray. A particularly interesting aspect of last Thursday's vote was how the total local vote tallied with the current opinion polls. The Liberal share of the total vote has moved up. Labour's dominant lead has been maintained and the Tory share, at just above a quarter, has been confirmed.  <p>  <p>Although this is a miserable result for the Conservatives it is hardly startling. With nearly a year to go, there are opportunities for a reversal in political fortune and I suspect many Labour strategists would be happy with an election tomorrow. The Liberal vote is intriguing and a potential challenge for the Conservatives. It suggests that, despite modest national opinion ratings, the Liberals are concentrating powerful strength in the traditional Tory heartland. Brian Mawhinney has problems enough without Orpington man reappearing in Royal Tunbridge Wells.  <p>  <p>The key Tory problem will be how to prevent these local election results further eroding party morale. My laid back analysis will bring little comfort. An election is now in sight. There have been previous spectacular, late recoveries in government fortunes. Indeed, 1992 was a case in point, but Conservative agony over the past three years cannot be assuaged in weeks. Many commentators already observe a lack of will on the Tory benches and a preparedness and expectation of defeat, hopefully restricted to a scale that enables the parliamentary party to keep its side arms in order to squabble over the leadership and Europe in 1997.  <p>  <p>It is against this background that Westminster proceeds through May to the dog days of July. Much folklore is attached to this fetid period when MPs are cooped up passing legislation well into the night. There seems to be a chemistry of discontent that produces plots and coups, the most memorable being in July 1962 when Macmillan sacked a third of his cabinet, and I was artless enough to make my maiden speech in support of the fallen Selwyn Lloyd.  <p>  <p>I predict that this July will bring its full range of schemes, threats, discontents and even a modest government reshuffle. All of this will be faithfully and imaginatively reported by the press, but the Prime Minister and the Government will survive.  <p>  <p>The cornerstone of Tory fortunes remains the Prime Minister. Any coup to remove him would be self defeating. The semtex would blow up the plotter before the intended victim. The Tory majority is now so thin that a contested change of leadership would bring about a further chain of defection initiated by Alan Howarth and Peter Thurnham. Secondly, John Major has devoted himself to keeping the Conservative Party as a broad church. He has performed this task manfully and I know none who could do it better, although it is not a task that permits excellence.  <p>  <p>There have been great difficulties for him, not least on the European issue. Inevitably one is driven to query whether his words, on issues such as the single currency, reflect his own views or those that he thinks are best judged to maintain party unity.  <p>  <p>When Tory backbench frustration subsides, I believe that it will be judged that Major provides the economic leadership and the European compromise that will command broadest support. He will lead the Tories, probably in 1997, to either a spectacular victory or honourable defeat.  <p>  <p>The European debate is the millstone that weighs down the Tories. Should Labour gain office it too would discover that sharing power is an immensely painful business, particularly when decisions - such as the beef ban - had no sense of equity.  <p>  <p>Meanwhile Labour has been particularly skilled at avoiding the European challenge that would await them in office. Alas there is no such comfort for the Tories. Office brings them headlong into Brussels realities. The mass burning of cattle on spurious BSE hygiene grounds is not specifically provided for in the Maastricht Treaty but it is a practical example of how Europe "is not working".  <p>  <p>The entry of Sir James Goldsmith into the electoral ring has, predictably, stirred emotions. Douglas Hurd now picks up &#163;250,000 annually from the NatWest bank. With this experience, he berates Goldsmith for using his wealth to promote political power. I can understand Hurd's argument, and am tempted to ask is this an Old Etonians' fight or can anyone join in? The truth is that the European debate will not subside. It is at the heart of our economic and constitutional traditions. It will proceed into the next parliament and with a vitality that challenges loyalties. Meanwhile Major's leadership is not threatened by it, and whilst Tory Euro-discord loses votes, it is easy to exaggerate the haemorrhage.  <p>  <p>The ingredient for Tory success is not a patched-up job on Europe. It is for an economic recovery that is generally perceived. This elusive 'feel good' factor has been subject to endless and conflicting comment. My instinct is that there has been a modest and intermittent recovery for at least two years or more.  <p>  <p>On the other hand, the recession has bitten so deeply that the consumer is now more cautious, and more inclined to save. That pleases the Chancellor in that he can fund more easily the enormous government borrowing that now sustains public expenditure. More recently there have been signs that rising income is leading to greater spending. The housing market is brighter. The Heseltine thesis is that this will lead to political recovery. It is plausible but it is also very late.  <p>  <p>It is just possible that the public, whatever the pay packet, would not be averse to a switch after 18 years of Tory government - provided the change was to a party that has been dry cleaned of its long-standing socialism. And this is precisely what the Tory radical Euro-sceptics fear.  <p>  <p>John Biffen is Conservative MP for Shropshire North  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Matthew Engel</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>Daily newspapers are not, day by day, much concerned with history. At a rough guess, 90 per cent of journalistic effort goes into producing the next day's paper; seven or eight per cent into planning a day or two ahead; and two or three per cent into bitching about what went wrong the previous day. The ancient past is a matter of concern only if you are delving into the files for historical background.  <p>  <p>Most particularly, daily newspapers are not much concerned with their own history. This is especially true of the popular press, but we are all guilty. Very few journalists on this paper will ever have leafed through the bound volumes of old Manchester Guardians. It would be an indulgence, bearing no relation to the job.  <p>  <p>When I was the Guardian's cricket correspondent, people would often ask me whether I was not intimidated "following in the footsteps of Neville Cardus and John Arlott". The only honest answer was No. The men who intimidated me were my rivals on the Times and the Telegraph. My concern was to make sure I did not do my job conspicuously worse than they did theirs: you are judged by reference to your peers, not your journalistic ancestors. And yet a newspaper's business is history, or the first rough draft of it. And its output is its own history. The story of this newspaper is really contained within its 46,544 different issues, not in books recording the machinations about who should succeed CP Scott.  <p>  <p>Tomorrow the Guardian is exactly 175 years old. By coincidence this weekend also marks the centenary of the Daily Mail. Their achievement is the more resonant; ours by far the more impressive. We are not going to make much of a fuss, because it is not that sort of anniversary (there is not even a word for it) and it is not that sort of newspaper, though maybe the management will give everyone a glass of cheapish Chardonnay and a few nibbles if we make it through to the bicentenary in 2021.  <p>  <p>But it is a moment to take stock, and think about what we do and why we do it. There is a difference between the Mail and the Guardian, aside from all the obvious ones. The Mail, started by Lord Northcliffe, was widely mimicked by John Edward Taylor, never has been copied, certainly not successfully. All institutions are unique, but there really is nothing like this one. There are nine surviving general national daily papers. Two of them (the Independent and the Daily Star) are less than 20 years old and may yet prove transient, like the ill-fated Today, closed by Rupert Murdoch last November - here yesterday, gone tomorrow.  <p>  <p>The other six have been participants in the long, historical process whereby papers have captured the public mood for a generation or so, risen to be the top-seller, then fallen away again: in order, the Times, Daily Telegraph, Daily Mail, Daily Express, Daily Mirror and the Sun.  <p>  <p>The Guardian has never been part of that game. It has never been number one. It has never even threatened, and heaven help us all if it did. What it has instead is a special relationship with those who do read it, a relationship no other paper can match.  <p>  <p>Any writer who sees someone reading their own paper, especially in unexpected circumstances, naturally feels a little encouraged. What makes the Guardian special is that its readers, spotting each other, often feel the same frisson of recognition. We all belong to the same club, less exclusive than White's or Boodle's, but more desirable than either: a sort of fellowship. From the paper's point of view, it enabled our circulation to survive, virtually unscathed, even when Rupert Murdoch, by ruthless cross-subsidisation, temporarily reduced the price of the Times to less than half that of the Guardian. Do Times readers feel uplifted at the sight of one another? I doubt it.  <p>  <p>The Guardian represents three separate but related traditions. One quite obviously is that of radicalism. Other papers have been protean in their beliefs. The Telegraph achieved initial success as a youngish, liberal, almost subversive paper of the mid-Victorian era; the Mirror was very Tory in the 1920s; the Sun is heir of the old Daily Herald, the TUC paper, and was itself pro-Labour, even under Murdoch.  <p>  <p>The Guardian began as a pro-Reform paper in response to the Peterloo massacre; it was a Liberal paper through the 19th century; it achieved intellectual leadership of the Left by its opposition to the Boer war; it sustained that into the 20th century, as the Liberal party faded, by being open, if not slavishly devoted, to the new force of the Labour Party; it denounced Hitler, early and often; it opposed Suez and Thatcherism. Sometimes the trumpet has given off an uncertain sound; sometimes the paper has simply missed the point. But over 175 years and billions of words, there has been an intellectual consistency that, given the exigencies of newspaper production, remains extraordinary.  <p>  <p>The second strand is that of, not provincialism exactly, but non-metropolitanism. The paper began in Manchester. From 1821 to 1959 it was called the Manchester Guardian. The weekly edition still keeps the title in the US (the Americans are quite happy to move their football and baseball teams from city to city, but newspapers, they think, have to stick to their roots).  <p>  <p>Throughout the 19th century it was competing far more fiercely with a stack of other Mancunian papers, all long forgotten, than with any of the London papers, which sent copies north in the same sort of belated and haphazard way that modern London papers permeate the further reaches of Europe. Only a handful of provincial morning papers now survive. Outside their own areas, they sell only to the most determined exiles. The Manchester Guardian broke its bounds, partly because CP Scott gave the paper a national reputation; partly because it voiced thoughts that were muted in the London papers; and partly because of the quality of its journalism. Britain, as we all know, is a horribly centralised country. There are very few fields of endeavour in which it is possible to scale the commanding heights without being in London: academe is one - but then Oxford and Cambridge are merely outer suburbs anyway - football is another. Journalism is most emphatically not among them.  <p>  <p>It is hard to know what would have happened to the Guardian had it taken the soft option and chosen to remain a Manchester paper. Perhaps it would have settled into a cosy local existence like the Yorkshire Post; maybe it would have vanished. But I suspect only a Manchester paper could have transformed itself the way the Guardian did: the Yorkshire papers were too inward-looking, the Scottish ones too particularist.  <p>  <p>A paper that sold largely to cotton traders necessarily gazed out to sea rather than just at its own city and the route south, and thus developed the outlook - urbi et orbi - that made it possible for the Guardian to match the London papers and then join them.  <p>  <p>Curiously, the Guardian now has a higher proportion of its sales within the M25 than any other national paper. This is partly because so many of its natural readers gravitate to London, just as the paper itself did. It retains a residual but diminishing strength in the north-west. One of its characteristics over the past quarter-century has been to pay more attention to its branches than its roots, and the decline of the northern base has been one of its failures.  <p>  <p>The third distinctive feature is literacy. Anyone who has actually read the turgid and pedantic writing that fills most of the New York Times will know that a great newspaper is not necessarily a well-written one. From a very early stage, the Manchester Guardian always had a reputation as a writers' paper.  <p>  <p>In the 19th century the Daily Telegraph believed that good writing had to be verbose; the Times thought it had to be pompous. Guardian pieces were usually written with far less affectation, and stand the test of time better as a result.  <p>  <p>The paper has often been less clever at the simple business of gathering news. CP Scott's most famous dictum - "Comment is free, but facts are sacred" - has often been disrespectfully sub-edited: delete 'sacred', substitute 'expensive'; and the tradition that Guardian accountants have a lower pain threshold than anyone else's is among the most enduring. These days the news desk works hard to eradicate the perception that the Guardian's news judgments are often whimsical, bordering on the eccentric. In a way it seems a shame. One change of the past 25 years is that the tabloids (and the royal story is the most spectacular example) have often set the news agenda while the broadsheets struggle like mad to catch up. But another change is that the Guardian style and method has begun to spread. The humorous, irreverent, writing that took the paper to its highest-ever circulation in the mid-1980s (before the brief incandescence of the Independent) is now more widely accepted elsewhere. In that sense, it is the Guardian that is now being mimicked. Lord Rothermere has even been dropping hints that the Mail will support the same party as us at the next election. It is, however, frightfully hard to eradicate people's ideas about newspapers. It is still possible to get a cheap laugh from any audience in the country by making a joke about The Grauniad and mipsrints. The technical problems were solved a full decade ago (shortly after Ronald Reagan won his second presidential election in what we referred to, in a 72-point headline, as a 'landside') and this paper is now no better or worse than any other. Does anyone give us credit? Do they heck!  <p>  <p>Newspapers change and develop. This is a very different product, in its look and tone, from the one that celebrated its 150th birthday in 1971. But it is still recognisably the same old Guardian, produced by people with political and journalistic beliefs in line with those of the paper's founders. sometimes the Guardian has helped to change them - than through instability of character," wrote the paper's historian David Ayerst. "The paper's views have developed in a fairly straight line. Admittedly they have sometimes wobbled, but not often."  <p>  <p>When, after four generations of family ownership, Taylor's heirs, the Scotts, handed the paper over to the Scott Trust in 1936, the trustees were given only one instruction: to run the paper "on the same lines and in the same spirit as heretofore". When Alan Rusbridger was made editor in January 1995 he was given the same instruction, and no other.  <p>  <p>At the time, amid all the conflicting emotions one always feels about one's employers, it made me immensely proud that such a newspaper exists and that I work for it. I think we all share that pride. Yes, it is unique. Matthew Engel's history of the popular press, 'Tickle the Public', was published this month.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>San Marino and Sweden to declare end of 17th century war</b><br><br><br><b><h2>4 May 1996</h2></b><br><h2>War is almost over after nearly 400 years</h2><h3>Ancient European conflicts have been raging for centuries, but no one told those involved  </h2>
  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>John Glover</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>Life can be tough for Europe's tiddler states. They are liable to be trodden on in times of war and forgotten when the peace treaty rolls around. That means conflicts can continue for centuries.  <p>  <p>San Marino, the tiny republic perched atop a mountain not far from Italy's Adriatic coast, is a victim of just such an oversight. The republic, which boasts a centuries-long tradition of neutrality, may be at war with Stockholm, some Swedes believe.  <p>  <p>And Andorra, a principality in the Pyrenees, between France and Spain, as ancient as it is tiny, might technically still be at war with Germany. Sweden and San Marino will informally declare their friendship tonight, live on Italian television.  <p>  <p>San Marino is known abroad partly because of the Formula-1 Grand Prix that bears its name. But for reasons of space - the republic has an area of 23.5 square miles and just 25,000 inhabitants - San Marino holds its grand prix at Imola, about 40 miles away and firmly in Italy.  <p>  <p>But San Marino has a seat at the United Nations, conducts its own foreign policy, sits on the International Olympic Committee and fields its own international football team.  <p>  <p>The supposed state of war between San Marino and Sweden arises from the Peace of Westphalia. This was signed in 1648, putting an end to the Thirty Years War, a conflict that racked much of 17th-century Europe. San Marino's neighbours, Venice and the Duchy of Milan, fought with the Habsburgs against the Swedes. San Marino did not, and so did not attend the peace conference or sign the documentation ending the conflict.  <p>  <p>"This has led some people in Sweden to declare our countries are still at war," said Torsten Orn, Sweden's ambassador to San Marino.  <p>  <p>A similar twist, it is sometimes whispered, affected Germany and Andorra. The principality is represented abroad by the French president and the Bishopric of Urgell. Thus, when France went to war aginst Germany, Andorra may, in effect, have done so too. Unlike France, it has never made peace with the Germans.  <p>  <p>But the Spanish bridle at the suggestion. "Andorra has been a co-principality for the past 730 years and could not have gone to war unless we agreed. We didn't," said a spokesman for the Spanish embassy in Rome. San Marino insists that the last time it went to war was in 1462, when it took the field against the troops of the Malatesta family from nearby Rimini.  <p>  <p>Sweden also has a long-standing pacifist tradition. The Congress of Vienna in 1815 marked the end of its last military adventure.  <p>  <p>"I'll be taking part in the programme to demonstrate that relations with San Marino are friendly, diplomatic and commercial," said Mr Orn. No peace treaty signing ceremony will be held. "It's just not necessary," he insisted.  <p>  <p>Swedish citizens living in San Marino should not be concerned, he added. "There are only six or eight, and I think they are mostly ladies married to San Marinese. They're certainly not prisoners of war."  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Bomb hoax in Dublin</b><br><br><br><b><h2>7 May 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Loyalist bomb hoax in Dublin  </h2>
  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>David Sharrock</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>The loyalist ceasefire continued to disintegrate yesterday after an Ulster Volunteer Force bomb hoax at Dublin airport.  <p>  <p>A controlled explosion was carried out on a car at the airport early yesterday, after a telephone warning using a recognised code word was received by a Belfast newspaper. Irish army spokesmen confirmed that there were no explosives in the vehicle.  <p>  <p>In the warning a man said mid-Ulster UVF volunteers had planted two 10lb Powergel bombs on the airport runway and in a car park.  <p>  <p>The caller said the UVF "had overcome very high security" to plant the bombs. "Your government have laughed off our words but they will not mock our deeds. The people of the Irish Republic will pay a very high price," the caller said.  <p>  <p>David Ervine, leader of the Progressive Unionist Party, which has UVF links, said the hoax had "undoubtedly" emanated from that organisation. "My hope is that they will rein back. There is still a loyalist ceasefire," he added. Senior loyalists described the Dublin hoax as "a shot across the bows", although this could have been meant as much a warning to the UVF leadership as to the Irish government.  <p>  <p>Loyalist dissent has been steadily growing since the IRA bombed Canary Wharf on 9 February.  <p>  <p>It has also exacerbated tensions between the UVF and the Ulster Defence Association, the larger paramilitary grouping, who together operate a council-style leadership known as the Combined Loyalist Military Command. A senior UDA figure said there was considerable anger with the UVF for failing to consult them before the Dublin hoax.  <p>  <p>Powergel is a commercial explosive used by the UVF in a number of bomb attacks before its October 1994 ceasefire.  <p>  <p>In May that year it planted a bomb in a Dublin pub where a republican function was being held.

  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Ian Katz</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>It is one of the immutable verities of modern urban life: buses always come in threes, the weirdo always takes the seat next to yours, and cabbies in New York are always rude.  But now the city's authorities are attempting a feat no less ambitious than moving the Statue of Liberty to the Bronx. They aim to teach New York taxi drivers good manners.  <p>  <p>Henceforth, trainee cabbies - whose grasp of English rarely matches their command of obscenity - will be taught 50 courteous phrases such as: "I'm sorry if you think I am driving too fast, sir/ madam. I will slow down immediately."  <p>  <p>The Taxi and Limousine Commission's initiative is the latest in its long battle to smarten up the image of New York's yellow cabs.  <p>  <p>It has incorporated the use of phrases such as "Thank you for hailing me, sir/madam" into the two-hour exam which all cabbies must pass. Instead of the volley of expletives which typically follows the proffering of a large denomination bill, cabbies will be encouraged to say: "I am sorry but I am not required to change a $50 bill."  <p>  <p>News of the initiative had, by yesterday, evidently not reached some cabbies who responded to inquiries on the subject with the screech of spinning tyres.  Others replied with impeccable manners, but had difficulty deciphering the commission's recommended phrases.  <p>  <p>Mohamad Hassan, who has driven a cab since arriving from Egypt nine years ago, said: "Taxi driver treat the people very nice but people treat the taxi driver very bad."  He said that drivers were occasionally tetchy because they had been assigned "junk car".  <p>  <p>M D Hossain, a six-year veteran cabbie from Bangladesh, said: "I talk to passengers all the time, but I have a lot who get in the cab and treat me like an animal."  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Bosnia war crimes trial of Dusko Tradic</b><br><br><br><b><h2>7 May 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Were they just obeying  orders?</h2><h3>A new international court must be seen to be independent  </h2>
 <br>
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Leading  article</b>    <p>Today Dusko Tadic takes his place in history. He is the first individual since Nuremberg 50  years ago to stand trial in an international court on charges of crimes against humanity.  Tadic, the 'butcher of Prijedor', is charged with systematic brutality against Muslim  civilians, including murder, rape, and torture. He is among more than 50 individuals indicted  by the international criminal tribunal for the former Yugoslavia. Others include Bosnian Croats  and Muslims, as well as Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, and General Ratko Mladic,  his military commander, who are indicted on 16 counts, including genocide. <p> <p>Before the  international community congratulates itself on this initiative, potentially of huge  significance, we should consider the legacy of Nuremberg. Lord Shawcross, Britain's chief  prosecutor, hailed the Nuremberg trial as a "milestone in the history of civilisation". It  established the principle of individual responsibility for state crimes, that it was not enough  to say "we were just obeying orders". Yet, as Richard Goldstone, the South African judge and  chief prosecutor at the Hague tribunals for both Yugoslavia and Rwanda, has said: "The hope of  'never again' became the reality of again and again." Atrocities indicted as crimes at  Nuremberg have gone unpunished, in Algeria, Cambodia, Vietnam, east Timor, Iraq, and elsewhere.  The permanent members of the Security Council have supplied arms to governments knowing they  would be used, not only in war but also against ethnic minorities. So why did the Security  Council agree to act on the former Yugoslavia? The short answer is embarrassment tinged,  perhaps, with guilt. Here, in Europe, was ethnic cleansing, photographs of concentration camps  reminiscent of the Holocaust, harrowing accounts of massacres, torture, and rape.  Non-government organisations and public opinion demanded action. <p> <p>The very title of the  Nuremberg trial, of 'German Major War Criminals', gave away its limitations. Goldstone  describes his strategy as investigating "lower-level persons involved in carrying out the  crimes to build cases against the leaders". Time will tell if the tribunal will succeed,  whether diplomatic and economic pressure will lead to the handing over of Karadzic and Mladic.  The tribunal has no police force and relies on international arrest warrants. <p> <p>It is an  ad hoc tribunal, set up by the Security Council. Defence lawyers are already arguing that it  will hand down "victors' justice", ignoring the "dirty hands" of their prosecutors. In talks at  the UN about the setting up of a permanent international criminal court, the US, Britain, and  France  are laying themselves open to the charge that they intend to pick and choose which case  the court should take up. The court, they insist, must be a creature of the Security Council.  To be credible and effective, a permanent court must be self-standing and independent. <p> <p>  <p> <p> <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td  width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td  width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td  width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td  width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr> <td  align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td> <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A  HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td> <td align=right  valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td> </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Bosnia war crimes trial of Dusko Tradic</b><br><br><br><b><h2>8 May 1996</h2></b><br><h2>"Tadic stood where no man has since Goering and Hess"</h2><h3>The first Bosnian war-crimes trial in the Hague  </h2>
  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Ed Vulliamy</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>The Bosnian Serb Dusko Tadic yesterday stood where no man has since Hermann Goering and Rudolf Hess at Nuremberg - charged with "crimes against humanity" as his trial opened in The Hague.  The case before the United Nations war-crimes tribunal is the first in Europe since the Allied court established itself among the ruins of the Third Reich.  <p>  <p>The historic status of the moment was not lost on the prosecution as it opened its case. Grant Niemann QC, of Australia, said the tribunal bore a heavy burden and that "when it is the state that commits the crime, then the community of nations must judge. Otherwise evil has no bounds." At the core of the case is the Omarska concentration camp for Muslim and Croat prisoners, uncovered by the Guardian and ITN in August 1992. There, Mr Tadic was alleged to have been one of the perpetrators of what Mr Niemann yesterday called the most horrific Serbian violence.  <p>  <p>Mr Tadic is the first suspect indicted or held by the tribunal to enter the dock of the special courtroom housed within the headquarters of a Dutch insurance company.  He has pleaded not guilty to a litany of killings, torture, sexual assaults, and other physical and psychological abuse and to persecution. He is accused of playing a pivotal role in the ethnic cleansing that swept across north-western Bosnia during 1992.  <p>  <p>However, Mr Tadic's defence warned that the tribunal was working to rules that have not yet been worked out. His counsel, Michail Wladimiroff, said his client had tried to broker peace in his own village of Kozarac and, having failed, had left to become a traffic policeman in neighbouring Banja Luka.  <p>  <p>Mr Tadic entered court cutting a very different figure to the man who had appeared at pre-trial hearings. He had exchanged his sports jacket and white polo-necked sweater for a solemn navy suit and tie.  <p>  <p>The prosecution outlined the horrors of north-west Bosnia uncovered by "Western media" - the Guardian, ITN and Newsday. First, there was the razing of the mainly Muslim Kozarac, then the infamous camps at Kereterm, Trnopolje and, "the most horrific", Omarska.  <p>  <p>Mr Niemann claimed Mr Tadic was prominent in the story, initially as a fifth columnist who nurtured Muslim friends in Kozarac so as to furnish information to the amassing Serbian army.  <p>  <p>The prosecutor said that, once the destruction of Kozarac was over, columns of Muslims who emerged from their basements with white flags were herded down the main street while Mr Tadic took aside men and shot them. Mr Niemann said there had been a pile of 20 corpses beside the road: all innocent civilians.  <p>  <p>The prosecution claimed that, although he was neither a camp guard nor a commander, Mr Tadic enjoyed a special status which gave him a free run of camps, along with others who were "sadistically predisposed towards violence". Mr Niemann said Mr Tadic, who became a reserve policeman, would arrive at Omarska with lists of names of Muslims singled out for especially brutal treatment.  <p>  <p>In one incident, Mr Tadic was alleged to have forced prisoners to perform oral sex upon each other before they were sexually mutilated. One man was said to have been made to bite off the testicles of another, who died. In Trnopolje, another camp revealed by the Guardian in August 1992, Mr Tadic was alleged to have taken part in the killing of at least 30 prisoners, tortured 12 women and participated in gang rapes.  Mr Tadic is also accused of leading mobs which stormed Muslim villages and killed residents.  <p>  <p>Mr Wladimiroff, a Dutch-Russian, portrayed his client as a victim of mistaken identity, a scapegoat and guinea-pig plucked from the chaos of war. The accused man has sacked two Serbian lawyers in favour of British barristers to assist Mr Wladimiroff. The defence counsel said "the thirst for revenge must not be set aside at the well of polluted justice". He warned of the dangers of high media exposure and low-quality justice. Mr Wladimiroff said: "Dusko Tadic is being promoted as the prototype war criminal. I hold the leaders of all parties in the former Yugoslavia as responsible."  <p>  <p>He questioned the veracity of prisoners due to testify against their alleged torturer. Conditions in the camps "provided the stuff of rumour and the need for a scapegoat".  <p>  <p>The epic trial is expected to last several months, and will bring former camp inmates face-to-face with their alleged torturer.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Gillian Shephard  criticises "trendy teaching" methods</b><br><br><br><b><h2>8 May 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Shephard  attacks "trendy" teaching</h2><h3>New powers for inspectors as controversial report finds poor  reading standards in three inner London boroughs  </h2>
 <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Donald Macleod</b><br><br>      <p> <p>Gillian Shephard, the Education and Employment Secretary, yesterday launched an attack  on "trendy" teaching methods in schools and teacher training colleges. <p> <p>She gave  inspectors new powers to test children in the classroom and called on governors to sack  ineffective staff. <p> <p>A highly critical report yesterday by the Office for Standards in  Education on the way reading was taught in three inner London boroughs is to be followed by an  investigation of the teaching of numeracy in three other low-performing authorities as part of  a back to basics drive. Ofsted and local authority inspectors found nearly eight out of 10  seven-year-olds in Islington, Southwark and Tower Hamlets were behind in reading, and four out  of 10 11-year-olds were two years behind. The gulf in pupils' reading performance was serious  and unacceptable. <p> <p>Mrs Shephard said she would introduce legislation to give Ofsted  powers to test children in schools where they suspected standards were low, and to inspect  local education authorities as well as individual schools. "The report clearly identified poor  leadership and poor teaching as the main reasons why hundreds of children in these London  boroughs are being so badly let down. <p> <p>"I would expect these authorities and the  governors who are the employers concerned to consider very seriously whether they can go on  failing children." <p> <p>Promising league tables of teacher training colleges and university  departments based on Ofsted inspections, she endorsed the conclusion of Chris Woodhead, the  Chief Inspector, that ineffective teaching methods were to blame. <p> <p>The report, which was  redrafted by Mr Woodhead to the anger of the three authorities which collaborated in the  survey, said: "At the heart of the problem is a commitment to methods and approaches to the  teaching of reading that were self-evidently not working..." <p> <p>Mrs Shephard said: "There  could be no clearer indictment. It will not do." The report found a quarter of schools were not  resourced effectively to teach the national curriculum requirements for reading, but Mrs  Shephard said resources were not the problem. <p> <p>Her campaign marks the growing influence  of Mr Woodhead, the head of Ofsted, who will issue back to basics guidelines on teaching  methods, emphasising the need for phonics and whole-class teaching. <p> <p>The report says that  direct, systematic work was rare, especially in the final primary year when many pupils still  needed it. Teachers spent too much time simply listening to individual children read. "While  teachers worked hard at the teaching of reading, too much of their effort was wasted because  either the organisation and management of the work was too complicated or their own knowledge  about the teaching of reading was weak." Many teachers were critical of their own training to  teach reading. <p> <p>Black African pupils performed best in the standardised tests at seven  and 11.

<!--INFOLINE--><b>MPs refuse to declare interests in new register</b><br><br><br><b><h2>8 May 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Still economical with the truth</h2><h3>The register of MPs interests is better, but not good enough  </h2>
<br><b>Leading article</b><br>  <br><br>      <p>Members of Parliament have had to declare their outside interests for more than 20 years. But this worthwhile exercise has lately become an increasingly uninformative ritual, concealing almost as much as it reveals, and inadequate as a public mirror to the networks which influence our legislators. It is, of course, in the public interest to know that Bloggs MP is a director of Bloggs plc, or gets paid as a consultant to Bloggs UK. However until we know what Bloggs MP actually gets for his trouble such an exercise does not really tell anyone very much - which is why it has taken a crisis to change a system that suited MPs very nicely. This year, the first following the Nolan report, the details covered by the Register of Interests have therefore been much extended. MPs have been asked to give more detail about the services they perform as consultants and advisers and have been instructed to declare (within certain bands) the sums that are involved. So, does the latest report, published yesterday, now transform our knowledge and understanding?  <p>  <p>Yes it does, but only up to a point. The new register is undoubtedly more informative than its predecessor. It gives us some important details about the financial interests of MPs, many of whom have conscientiously revealed what was asked of them. But the results are at once both fascinating and banal. It is useful to know that Brian Mawhinney gets a car from Rover or to read the list of organisations which fund Tony Blair's office. It is intriguing to know that Douglas Hogg owns a hotel in Luzern or to learn how much Roy Hattersley earns from his journalism (much more than most journalists). Some will be scandalised by the tickets to Wimbledon, the air trips to exotic places (and Ireland), the ticket upgrades, the silver statuettes, the gift rugs and the shooting. Others will see a faintly Pooterish quality to the proudly recorded acceptance of Prison Officers Association hospitality at the TUC or the scrupulous confession that the local MP was given a pair of tickets by British Gas to an Eisteddfod. But the new system goes only so far. It is riddled with inconsistencies which make it impossible to use the register to make an accurate assessment of the importance of money in politics, either in individual cases or in general. There are still no figures attached to most of the categories in the register, so we can never learn the worth of MPs' directorships, other employment or shareholdings. Shareholdings of under &#163;25,000 are not covered at all. Many Conservative MPs (and a few others) have exploited their continuing right to be niggardly with the actualite. The result is an inadequate form of accountability which in some ways is actively misleading. Under the new rules the dutiful MP can appear shifty for revealing everything while the shameless can still get away with saying virtually nothing. Both MPs and the public deserve something better than this.   <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>MPs refuse to declare interests in new register</b><br><br><br><b><h2>8 May 1996</h2></b><br><h2>High-earning MPs refuse to disclose interests  </h2>
  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>David Hencke</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>A dozen former ministers, from David Mellor to Douglas Hurd, have decided not to declare income from lucrative directorships in the first register of members' interests which requires MPs to disclose outside earnings. Roy Hattersley, the former Labour deputy leader, emerges as the top earner - receiving &#163;104,300 from two contracts with the Mail on Sunday and the Guardian - in a guide to MPs' outside earnings. Others include Patrick Nicholls, Conservative MP for Teignbridge, who receives nearly &#163;60,000 from his directorships, and Sir Dudley Smith, Conservative MP for Warwick and Leamington, who earns &#163;45,000.  <p>  <p>Some 40 Conservative MPs and a handful of Labour MPs have not declared earnings.  David Mellor, reputed to earn &#163;350,000 a year from 10 directorships including British Aerospace, Racal, Vosper Thorneycroft and Ernst and Young, declares &#163;5,000 a year from the London Weekend Television's political programme, Cross Talk.  Douglas Hurd, the former foreign secretary, reputed to earn &#163;250,000 a year from Natwest Markets and a directorship with Natwest Bank, declares no income.  <p>  <p>Other ex-ministers not declaring income include Tristan Garel-Jones, an adviser to British Gas, BP, Biwater and the Union Bank of Switzerland; Norman Lamont, with seven directorships; Richard Needham, with four directorships including GEC and Gleneagles; Nicholas Scott; Tim Sainsbury and Kenneth Baker; John Butcher, David Howell and Sir Norman Fowler. Sir Edward Heath, the former prime minister and a strong opponent of the new rules and register, also makes no declaration.  <p>  <p>Mr Mellor justifies his decision in his entry. "It is not now, and never has been a contractual duty... that my services are provided in my capacity as an MP. The existence of these contracts is not dependent in any way upon my being an MP."  <p>  <p>Among those declaring their income, money from journalism dominates. As well as Roy Hattersley's &#163;104,300 - &#163;75,300 of it from the Mail on Sunday - Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, receives &#163;320 per column from the Scottish Daily Record, bringing in up to &#163;15,000 a year. His contributions are ghostwritten by his spin doctor, Charlie Whelan. Helen Liddell, Labour MP for Monklands East, earns a similar sum from the Glasgow Evening Times. Paul Flynn, Labour MP for Newport West, earns up to &#163;5,000 a year from the South West Echo.  <p>  <p>Journalism aside, the going rate appears to be between &#163;15,000 and &#163;25,000 for a banking consultancy and up to &#163;10,000 for other work. Jack Cunningham, Labour's national heritage spokesman, earns up to &#163;30,000 from three consultancies.  <p>  <p>Among the lighter items declared are the gift of a Fender Stratocaster guitar to Tony Blair, 12 jars of honey from the London Beekeepers' Association to Tony Banks, MP for Newham North West, and a declaration from Peter Bottomley, Tory MP for Eltham, that he gets invited to many events only because of his better-known spouse: Virginia Bottomley, the Heritage Secretary.  <p>    <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>"Honest" portrait of  Queen, by Antony Williams</b><br><br><br><b><h2>9 May 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Queen - warts and  all</h2><h3>Reactions to latest royal portrait  </h2>
 <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Sarah Boseley</b><br><br>      <p> <p>The latest portrait of the Queen was unveiled yesterday to a mixture of criticism and  acclaim for its depiction of the monarch as a wrinkled, care-worn mortal, denuded of majesty.  <p> <p>Antony Williams, aged 31, who won the commission from the Royal Society of Portrait  Painters after being judged the best young portraitist of 1995, defended his work as "an honest  painting of someone who is 70". He added: "The lines are there. I painted what I saw." <p>  <p>Art critic Brian Sewell led the offensive against the portrait, now hanging in the Mall  Galleries in London. He said the Queen deserved better than to be "perpetuated as an old age  pensioner about to lose her bungalow." The figure had "no symbolism, no soul, no majesty." The  hands, with "swollen fingers and fat wrists, the worn and ill-trimmed nails, are those of  Murphy's men, relieved of the pneumatic drill, next to grasp a pint of Guinness. Not a wrinkle,  crumple, pit or sag is omitted from the Queen's skin, the pink touches scarcely enlivening the  undead grey of her complexion." <p> <p>But Daphne Todd, the society's president, said: "Artists  think it is tremendous. It is full of dignity. At first sight you are aware of all these  imperfections in her flesh, but underneath it is an icon. <p> <p>"The Queen may be a little  upset by it at the moment, but this is the painting that will last in 100 years' time." <p>  <p>The Queen, who sat for Mr Williams six times, has not seen the portrait, although Ms Todd  said Sir Robert Fellowes, the Queen's private secretary, was "intrigued" by the artist's  technique. <p> <p>Mr Williams paints in egg tempera, using tiny brush strokes because the  colours will not blend. "It is quite a hard-edged effect", Ms Todd said, which might contribute  to the impression of wrinkles. <p> <p>She compared the detail in the work - a snagged  fingernail and a small wound from a diamond bracelet - to the mark of stockings on one of  Rembrandt's nudes. <p> <p>June Mendoza, a member of the society who has painted the Queen five  times, was not surprised at the controversy. But she thought the portrait was excellent. "It's  not just a photographic expression, it's a painting. The Queen is extremely difficult to paint.  When she smiles, every single thing in her face changes - she has a radiant smile - but this  painting is her iron face." <p> <p>Virginia Bottomley, the Heritage Secretary, who unveiled the  painting, said: "It's a strong statement about Her Majesty... It's not a chocolate box picture,  and I expect some people will be sorry about that." Lord St John of Fawsley, a constitutional  expert who was at yesterday's private viewing, was less enthusiastic. "It's a powerful painting  but it hasn't got the essence of the Queen, which is a serenity, benevolence and a happiness. A  portrait should have the whole person." <p> <p>Mr Williams found the experience of painting the  Queen overwhelming, although he said he liked her and found her easy to talk to. "My opinion of  her as a person went up quite a lot." <p> <p>"The resemblance is unmistakable, but so is its  similarity to home-made bread waiting for the yeast to rise. The Queen deserves better than to  be perpetuated as an old age pensioner about to lose her bungalow" - Brian Sewell, art critic  <p> <p>"It's very powerful, it's very striking. It's a very strong statement about Her  Majesty... It's not a chocolate box picture and I expect some people will be sorry about that"  - Virginia Bottomley, Heritage Secretary <p> <p>"We're delighted. I think artists think it is  tremendous. It is full of dignity. At first sight you are aware of all those little  imperfections in her flesh, but underneath it is an icon" - Daphne Todd, Royal Society  president <p> <p>"It's an honest painting of someone who is 70, really. I painted what I saw .  . . I wasn't setting out to promote the monarchy or create a piece of propaganda or anything  like that" - Antony Williams, the artist <p> <p> <p> <p> <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td  width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td  width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td  width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr> <td align=left  valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td> <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A  HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td> <td align=right  valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td> </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>John Hooper</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>Looking elegant, buoyant and implausibly fit for a man of 82, Erich Priebke, a former SS officer, strode into court here yesterday at the start of what is expected to be the last Nazi war crimes trial.  <p>  <p>The hearing opened the day after a court in The Hague began proceedings for 'crimes against humanity' for the first time since Nuremberg. The ex-captain is accused of multiple homicide. He has admitted playing a key role in Italy's most notorious wartime massacre - the killing of 335 people at the Ardeatine Caves outside Rome.  <p>  <p>His trial, by a military tribunal, began in chaotic and emotional fashion in a courtroom measuring 20 feet by 44.  <p>  <p>One lawyer complained he had had to stand throughout yesterday's session and had been unable to set out his trial brief. Reporters were escorted in small groups into the court to witness the proceedings for a few minutes. Most of the victims' relatives had to watch on closed-circuit television. One fainted from heat and emotion.  <p>  <p>A woman said: "I was 15 when I lost my father. We were hiding some American PoWs. Because of a tip-off from a fascist, the Germans came and took my father. They told us he'd been taken to Germany. It wasn't true. He'd been imprisoned in Rome, then killed at the Ardeatine Caves. Priebke? They should send him to the toughest possible jail. I shall never forgive him." Outside, Communist demonstrators chanted: "Fascists. For you, there is no tomorrow. The new partisans are forming up." Wartime guilt has become a burning issue since the rise of the neo-fascist-led National Alliance which took one vote in seven at last month's election.  <p>  <p>Priebke was extradited to Italy after being tracked down in Argentina by a United States television network. He admitted at his indictment hearing that he had killed two of the victims and called out the names of 100 of those who were shot.  <p>  <p>He expressed sorrow but described the massacre as "perfectly legitimate" wartime retaliation. He argued that if he had refused to carry out his orders he would have been killed.  <p>  <p>The dead - including a boy aged 14, Roman Catholic priests and 75 Jews - were shot in reprisal for a bomb attack by partisans in which 33 German soldiers died.  <p>  <p>The chief rabbi of Rome, Elio Toaff, sparked outrage among the city's 15,000 Jews last month when he said that, if found guilty, Priebke should serve out his sentence under house arrest.  <p>  <p>Yesterday, the case was given another twist by Il Giornale, the newspaper owned by the family of the media magnate Silvio Berlusconi. On its front page, it published a photograph of the severed head of an Italian boy who, it said, had been killed in the partisan attack.  <p>  <p>Il Giornale quoted the boy's twin brother, Giovanni Zuccheretti, now aged 65, as saying the partisans allowed the bomb to explode knowing it would kill an innocent child.  <p>  <p>In fact, Priebke was rather more than an ordinary soldier faced with an impossible dilemma. Documents unearthed in the US and reported for the first time yesterday indicate that even before the war he belonged to a Gestapo unit which kept lists of Nazis' perceived enemies.  <p>  <p>The papers also suggest that, shortly before the end of the war, Heinrich Himmler, the SS chief, assigned him to special, though tantalisingly ill-defined, duties.  <p>  <p>According to Robert Katz, author of a book on the Ardeatine Caves massacre, Priebke was in the commando group which located and rescued Benito Mussolini after the former dictator's overthrow.  <p>  <p>Writing in yesterday's La Stampa, Mr Katz said Priebke was also implicated in the arrest and deportation to Auschwitz of many of Rome's Jews. The Italian news agency AGI reported that papers in the national archives in Washington showed that, on 2 December 1936, Priebke enrolled in a special Gestapo section known as the Gestapa. It quoted the historian Heinz Hohne as saying the Gestapa kept "a card file known as 'A' which included the particulars of all dangerous subversives".  <p>  <p>The 'A' file was used to prepare the March 1937 round-up of 2,000 opponents of the Nazi regime who were sent to Dachau and Sachsenhausen. The documents showed that Priebke joined the SS on 30 September 1937 and was assigned to Office IV of the Sicherheitsdienst, which specialised in dealing with opponents of the regime. A letter of 31 August 1944 informs him he has received a "special assignment from the Reichsfuhrer-SS and should proceed for further instructions to the nearest secretariat of Office IV". The first evidence in the trial will be given tomorrow.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Britons would reject a single  currency</b><br><br><br><b><h2>9 May 1996</h2></b><br><h2>A big "No" to the  euro</h2><h3>What to do if Europe goes ahead without us  </h2>
 <br><b>Leading article</b><br><br><br>      <p>Our ICM opinion poll today showing that 64 per cent of people disapprove of Britain joining  the proposed single European currency is a body blow for Euro-federalists of all parties. It  shows how near the mark John Major was when he admitted last month that voters would reject a  single currency if a referendum were held now. The poll reflects rising scepticism among  ordinary people (though not so much the young) and industrialists - fanned by the media - about  the advantages of rushing into a closer federal union with Europe. It would be absolutely barmy  for this or any other government to abandon the pound for the proposed 'euro' when the majority  of the people are against it. This doesn't mean that Britain won't, or shouldn't, join later  on. Public opinion over Europe is far too fickle to base a decision on one opinion poll. But it  does elevate procrastination into a viable policy. This is a once-in-a-lifetime decision with  awesome implications for unemployment and sovereignty if we get it wrong. What is needed, and  what may at last be happening, is a real debate after which the nation can make its decision  away from the pressure of European timetables. <p> <p>The barometer of monetary union changes  week by week. At the moment it looks as though a core of European countries led by France and  Germany is determined to join European Monetary Union (EMU) on 1 January 1999 for the three  year period of irrevocably fixed exchange rates prior to adopting a single currency by 1  January 2002. The financial markets are already assuming that this is what will happen even  though hardly any of these countries look likely to meet all of the Maastricht criteria and  Germany, and to a lesser extent France, are facing growing internal opposition to the project.  In Britain, curiously, both the present chancellor, Kenneth Clarke and his likely successor in  a Labour administration, Gordon Brown seem increasingly enthusiastic for EMU despite the  counter-currents among the electorate. Speaking in Bonn this week Mr Brown stressed the  substantial benefits proffered by a single currency in terms of stability, reduced currency  speculation and lower interest rates while giving the impression that the objections were  mainly of a practical nature. In particular he would have to be convinced that monetary union  wouldn't lock the UK into uncompetitiveness or unemployment. <p> <p>That is exactly the  judgment that has to be made, but we are less sanguine than Mr Brown that the British economy  has changed its spots. If Britain gave up the option to devalue before curing its propensity to  become uncompetitive then - without US-style labour mobility - we could be locked into higher  unemployment requiring very large transfers of resources from the EU which may not be  forthcoming. But won't life outside EMU be unbearable? Not necessarily. For the past two years  the pound has been remarkably stable against the Deutschmark, almost as if we have been  shadowing it. Protagonists of monetary union say that if you are shadowing the Deutschmark  anyway you might as well be in EMU as out especially as interest rates may be lower. They have  a point but the argument can be turned on its head: why not stay outside long enough to prove  your ability to stay in? If this results in mildly higher interest rates (not at all  inevitable) then that would be a small price to pay for ensuring that we get this decision -  arguably the most important economic decision this century - right. Who knows: a period of  watching and waiting may even swing public opinion more in favour. Without that all bets are  off anyway. <p> <p> <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td  width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td  width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td  width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td  width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE  height=30 width=400 border=0><tr> <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A  HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td> <td  align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td> <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Martin Kettle</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>British voters are overwhelmingly opposed to joining the planned European single currency, according to a Guardian/ICM poll published today - Europe Day.  <p>  <p>Opposition to the replacement of the pound by the euro is running at more than two to one, confirming John Major's remark last week that a referendum would decide against British participation in the single currency. The pollsters asked voters whether they approved or disapproved of Britain joining the European Union's planned replacement of existing currencies in 1999. Only 29 per cent said they approved, compared with 64 per cent who disapproved. Seven per cent were don't knows.  <p>  <p>This tide of public opinion poses serious problems for all the British political parties. The poll underlines that there are clear majorities against the single currency among supporters of all parties. Conservative voters oppose the move by 73 to 21 per cent, Liberal Democrats by 65 to 28 and Labour voters by 57 to 36.  <p>  <p>The only encouraging news for supporters of the European currency is that tomorrow may belong to them. There is a narrow lead in favour of the euro among young voters. Among those aged 18 to 24, British participation is supported by 48 per cent, with 44 per cent opposed. All older age groups disapprove of British involvement.  <p>  <p>The results follow a survey last week for the European newspaper, showing that German voters currently oppose the single currency by 52 to 40 per cent, in contrast to their French counterparts, who support it by 67 to 29 per cent.  <p>  <p>As if to confound the party strategists still further, there has been a sharp fall in Labour's lead over the Conservatives, cancelling out the rise in last month's ICM survey. The current state of the parties in the new poll shows Labour on 45 per cent (down five per cent compared with April), Conservatives 28 (down one), Liberal Democrats 21 (up four), and others five (up one). Labour's lead over the Conservatives, which rose seven points in April to 21 per cent, has now slid back to 17.  <p>  <p>Labour's rating underlines the softness of the party's opinion poll support, and will confirm Tony Blair in his repeated warnings that Labour victory in the general election cannot be taken for granted.  <p>  <p>Nevertheless the overall picture remains very good for Labour, because there is no sign of any Conservative recovery to offset Labour losses. The big gainers this month are Paddy Ashdown's Liberal Democrats, whose strong showing in the English local elections last week has helped to boost the party's opinion poll rating to its second strongest showing in the past year.  <p>  <p>* ICM interviewed a random telephone sample of 1,200 adults aged 18 and over between 3-5 May 1996. Interviews were conducted across the country and the results have been weighted to the profile of all adults.  <p>    <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Ian Katz</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>The summit of more than 700 black American dignitaries and African government officials at the Club Med resort in Senegal was going swimmingly until a pair of entertainers took to the stage at a reception. The performers were white but had been made up with black faces and white lips. To the horror and fury of the all-black crowd, they launched into a minstrel routine.  <p>  <p>Now the black civil rights group that staged the summit is suing Club Med for the display of insensitivity which it says left "a dark cloud" over the meeting and damaged its reputation in the black community.  <p>  <p>"Times have changed and portraying black people as ignorant fools who stumble around and don't speak the language properly just isn't acceptable," said Robert Cohen, the lawyer representing several delegates and the Phoenix-based International Foundation for Education and Self-Help. Twenty-one African heads of state joined African-American leaders including the Reverend Jesse Jackson, the late United States commerce secretary Ron Brown, and the mayor of Washington DC, Marion Barry, at the gathering in May 1995 to discuss how US blacks could help solve Africa's economic problems. According to the $5m (&#163;3.3m) lawsuit filed in a Manhattan federal court this week, many in the crowd reacted with "shock, humiliation, anger and outrage" to the performance at the Club Med resort in Les Almadies, outside Dakar.  <p>  <p>The Reverend Leon Sullivan, a prominent African-American activist who drew up the so-called "Sullivan principles" for US and European engagement with South Africa during apartheid, quickly ushered the entertainers from the stage.  <p>  <p>Rev Sullivan apparently managed to calm the crowd but the summit organisers claim in their lawsuit that "repercussions from the black face incident... tainted much of what we achieved".  <p>  <p>The plaintiffs added that Club Med staff "did absolutely nothing to avoid the presentation of the... skit or help ease the tense situation created by the incident." No Club Med spokesperson was available for comment yesterday.  <p>  <p>Some who attended the summit said the black-face skit was reminiscent of Amos and Andy, the popular television and radio show about two caricature black men that was pulled off the air in the 1950s for being racially insensitive.  <p>  <p>Minstrel shows were extremely popular throughout the 19th century, but are now seen as the height of political incorrectness.  <p>  <p>"It would be unacceptable to perform one in just about any context," Mr Cohen said. "It was painfully inappropriate at a conference of African-American and African leaders."  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Jack Schofield</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>Artificial life will reach new heights in September when computer owners will not only be able to play with 'virtual pets', they will be able to 'breed' them as well.  <p>  <p>Since 'breeding' works as in real life, only with digital DNA, no one knows what might ultimately result. Stephen Grand, senior programmer on the project, admits: "We've no idea what we've started."  <p>  <p>The 'pets', furry, cartoon-like 'virtual creatures' called norns, are said to be no harder to care for than hamsters, but cost nothing to feed and don't make a mess or smell.  They will be distributed on floppy disk as 'virtual eggs' for users to hatch and feed.  <p>  <p>Norns are said to respond to being slapped or tickled, and can even learn simple words. After six to 10 hours of computer time they reach adolescence and become interested in the opposite sex - which should result in the female producing an egg. But there's nothing salacious about their breeding. "They just kiss for a bit longer," says Mr Grand. "We have the Americans to consider."  <p>  <p>The norns can also get drunk, or sick. They exhibit a range of groans and cries, shake or sneeze, and perhaps die. Toby Simpson - one of Mr Grand's colleagues at Millennium, the British firm developing the program - says: "If they're really ill, there's no reason why you shouldn't send them to us to look at, perhaps for a small fee."  <p>  <p>Mr Simpson says people who use the program will be able to exchange eggs or send creatures to one another over the internet. "If you are going away you'll be able to send them on holiday," he says. The drawback is that other people "invariably teach them to swear".  <p>  <p>Although 'virtual pets' have a long history - Mindscape's Dogz is just the latest in a series that goes back through Activision's Little Computer People to abstract things called 'cellular automata' - Millennium's creatures are far more complex than anything attempted before. They have a complete but simplified biochemistry, and you can even examine their brains to see neural patterns developing. This is of great interest to computer scientists trying to develop thinking machines.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p><b>Cyber-Fido: the benefits</b>  <p>  <p>No walking in the rain    <br>No hair on your clothes    <br>No veterinary bills    <br>No pooper scoopers    <br>No saying sorry to postmen    <br>No need for air freshener    <br>No disappearance of food    <br>No bereaved children    <br>No chewed slippers    <br>No bones under the bed  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Sarah Boseley</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>The family of a 44-year-old woman who died of Creuztfeldt-Jakob Disease is seeking legal aid to sue the Government, alleging that the public were misled by ministers and officials who told them eating beef was safe. Ilja Andrews, 23, from Banbury, Oxfordshire, is convinced that her mother, Dutch-born Fonnie Van Es, died as a result of eating beef infected with BSE. With her brothers, Tjark, 21, and Tjobbe, 14, and her father, Terry Andrews, she met the families of about 20 other CJD victims in Banbury yesterday. Ms Andrews said of her mother: "She had always been healthy - one of those people who never seem to fall ill." But after an attack of shingles, from which she recovered, she was having difficulty getting to sleep and was showing signs of depression.  <p>  <p>"We thought she was overworked. Her GP prescribed Diazepam, but then she developed twitches in her right hand. The medication was stopped, but the jerking continued and her depression got worse."  <p>  <p>Ms Van Es's health declined rapidly over three months. CJD was not diagnosed until about two weeks before she died, in June 1994. "Towards the end, me and my brothers were feeding her, dressing her, bathing her and putting her to bed. We had to do everything for her. She knew she had CJD but she did not know then, thank God, that it had anything to do with mad cow disease. "At no time was she mad. She always remembered who we were, but she lost control of her body, and all her dignity had gone."  <p>  <p>Her mother ate beef. "Our diet was like anyone else's."  <p>  <p>Her solicitor, David Harris, from Sale in Cheshire, said they had taken leading counsel's advice. If there were a proven link between BSE and the strain of CJD from which Ms Van Es died, then her family would be entitled to compensation, he believed.  <p>  <p>There would have to be investigations to establish whether there was a link of which the Government was aware at the time it was advising the public that beef was safe to eat.  <p>  <p>Mr Harris acknowledged that he would need disclosure of government documents to fight the case. Speaking on BBC Radio 4, he denied that it was inappropriate to use legal aid to try to force an issue that the scientific community was still investigating.  <p>  <p>"All I am saying is that there is a duty of care owed by the Government. It's all very well for the Government to contend that there is no proven link - there are suggestions, indeed, that have been put in the press and the media over a considerable period of time that there is a link." The most that could be won in compensation was &#163;7,500, but the action was worth taking not for financial gain but because of the wider emotional considerations.  <p>  <p>"We are applying for legal aid alleging that there is a duty of care owed by the Government and that there may well have been a breach of that duty... "We also have to prove individual causation on my client's behalf. In other words, did her mother actually die from eating infected beef?"   <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>New Tory ad campaign:  'Yes it hurt. Yes it worked'</b><br><br><br><b><h2>15 May 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Not only did it hurt, it didn't work</h2><h3>The problem with the new Conservative slogan is  that it isn't true  </h2>
 <br><b>Leading  article</b><br><br>      <p>'Yes it hurt. Yes it worked,' say the Conservative Party's latest Maurice Saatchi-inspired  posters, unveiled yesterday. Let us hope that our welcome visitor Jacques Chirac does not see  them. For the slogan would doubtless confirm the French nation in its long-held stereotype  about les rosbifs. Even in party politics, it seems, there is an essential place for le vice  anglais. <p> <p>'Yes it hurt. Yes it worked' is a slogan which might have been devised for a  This England column. It absolutely sums up an English upper-class view of the world. It is the  slogan of character-forming cold showers, of compulsory cross-country runs, of short sharp  shocks, of social discipline enforced through corporal punishment, of the philosophy of 'this  may hurt now but you'll be grateful in the years to come' and of the entire sadistic culture  which lurks behind so much of English conservatism. <p> <p>It would be easier to take the new  Conservative slogan more seriously if it were true. But who has made the sacrifices? And who  has got the rewards? Not the same people at all. There is not much reward for the longterm  jobless, the homeless, the deceived pensioners, or the prisoners of negative equity. And it is  bizarre to say that things are working when British Gas can blithely threaten to sack 10,000  people. The slogan's subtext calls to mind the irony of the wartime poster which exhorted: Your  sacrifice can bring us victory. <p> <p>This is not to denigrate the undoubted spirit of  sacrificial fellowship among the British people. This nation has often been prepared to put up  with temporary hardship in order to win a permanent common benefit. But the hurt has always had  to be shared along with the reward. That has not been the case this time. Yes it hurt. But only  for some. And it didn't work either. <p> <p> <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr> <td  width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td  width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td  width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td  width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr> <td align=left  valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td> <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A  HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td> <td align=right  valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td> </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Simon Hoggart</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>The Tories revealed their new slogan yesterday: 'Yes it hurt. Yes it worked'. This acknowledgement is described by advertising pundits as a "high-risk strategy".  <p>  <p>I'll say. For one thing, it must create the high risk of mass hernias as people double up with laughter.  <p>  <p>Do they seriously imagine we believe they meant it to hurt as much as it did? That Black Wednesday, for example, was all on purpose? This is the John Wayne Bobbit school of political persuasion: "Yes, we cut it off. Yes, it's been sewn back on."  <p>  <p>It certainly hurts in Prime Minister's Questions these days. For one thing, all Tory questions appear to have been written out by the whips. Bob Dunn (C, Dartford) declared that the "Labour and Liberal Democrat-controlled Sevenoaks council has just increased council tax by an unprecedented 90 per cent!" (pause, here, for fake disbelieving "Whoas" from the Tory benches, as if a hundred Roy Rogers were reining in a hundred Triggers).  <p>  <p>"Will you confirm," Mr Dunn continued, "that dogs bark, cats miaow, and socialists put up taxes?"  <p>  <p>Could he confirm it? Could he ever! I myself took the opportunity for a short doze at this point, but woke up to hear the Prime Minister still in full spate: "The teenage tax... in Scotland, the tartan tax... " I drifted off back to sleep.  <p>  <p>I woke up with a jerk. The jerk was Tim Yeo (C, Suffolk S). He had noticed reports that the Labour Party wants to make Parliament "less confrontational". As you might expect, Mr Yeo's prescription was for Labour to agree with the Conservative Party on all important issues. "The quickest way to achieve this would be for those parties who claim to be against crime to vote in favour of, and not against, the Government's increasingly successful law and order measures," he said.  <p>  <p>Thinking, not unreasonably, that he had said more than enough, Mr Major began his reply. But nothing, not even the sight of his own Prime Minister on his feet, would shut Mr Yeo up.  <p>  <p>"Will New Labour finally tell the truth and say that the Tories were right all along?" he finally finished.  <p>  <p>Mr Major said that he was glad he had paused for this second part of the question - "it was well worth waiting for" - but so egregiously greasy had it been, that even the Prime Minister could not resist an ironic smirk towards the Labour benches.  <p>  <p>Bernard Jenkin (C, Colchester N) gladdened the hearts of the whips by asking a question as greasy as any oil-slicked seagull. Would the new Divorce Bill not allow time for reconciliation for all members of the shadow cabinet - "a marriage of convenience which has been poisoned by the political gigolo from Hartlepool".  <p>  <p>This was the kind of over-the-top insult which could achieve the impossible, and make Peter Mandelson popular with members of the Labour Party. Anyway, it was Tony Blair's press secretary, Alastair Campbell, who once worked as a gigolo, in the south of France.  <p>  <p>The weirdest moment came when Teresa Gorman asked about the single currency. It would cost Marks & Spencer's alone, she said, &#163;100m to change their tills.  <p>  <p>"Will you bring this to the attention of M. Chirac?" she asked. "Underwear will go up in price, in Paris and Lyon, and all the other places where M&S sells."  <p>  <p>I wonder how the conversation will go. "Er, Jacques, I don't quite know how to put this, but it's about Teresa Gorman's knickers..."  <p>  <p>"Quoi, mon ami?"  <p>  <p>"She wants to make sure they come down. And she believes that you can help." "Zut alors, Jean! Anuzzer slice of that beef, if you please. Now ah accept absolument your assurance zat there is no link between chicken shit in zurr feed and zurr mad cowdisease... "  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

Labour's deputy leader, John Prescott, dubbed it a futile gesture, while advertising experts labelled it arrogant and out of touch.  <p>  <p>The campaign was devised by Maurice Saatchi, the advertising guru credited with winning four consecutive elections for the Tories, and public relations supremo Sir Tim Bell, former adviser to Margaret Thatcher.  <p>  <p>After an acrimonious row last year with the agency they founded, Maurice and his brother Charles set up M & C Saatchi, and are now working with Conservative Central Office. A spokeswoman for the party, which has an estimated &#163;25m  <p>  <p>election 'war chest', said: "The basic message is that life is better under the Conservatives. We are making it clear that the policies we had to follow hurt a little, but they were policies that worked. This is a touch of humility."  <p>  <p>Smaller print on the poster claims 26 million people have had their income tax cut and that Britain has the lowest unemployment of any major European country.  <p>  <p>Future posters will attack Labour, repeating the 1992 theme of a 'double whammy' of more taxes and higher prices.  <p>  <p>John Banks, chairman of the Banks Hoggins O'Shea advertising agency, said the Tories should concentrate on attacking Labour in the absence of a feelgood factor. He suggested the reworked alternative: 'Labour. You know it will hurt and you know it won't work. Vote Conservative.'  <p>  <p>He said: "This slogan is like saying 'It is the age of the train'. You can say it as often as you like, but people don't believe it if the trains are late, dirty and expensive."  <p>  <p>Trevor Beattie, creative director of TBWA and one of the masterminds behind Gossard's Wonderbra campaign, said: "I am absolutely staggered. It is so arrogant, a massive own goal."  <p>  <p>Hugh Burkitt, of Burkitt Edwards Martin (BEM), said: "It sounds to me as if this has been written by the client. It is rather desperate." Alfredo Marcantonio, vice-chairman of Abbott Mead Vickers BBDO, said: "I think it is a bit apologist - it is rather like saying at least Mussolini got the trains to run on time."  <p>  <p>Saatchi and Saatchi declined to comment on an ex-client, but former creative director Tony Brignull said: "It is pretty damn clever. It implies it won't hurt any more - it is like going to the dentist, but now the tooth is out."   <p>  <p><b>In other words</b>  <p>  <p>The Conservative Party. If it ain't fixed, don't break it.    <br>The Conservative Party. So good, Tony Blair wants one.    <br>The damage has been repaired and normal service will now resume. Please do not adjust your Government.    <br>The Conservatives. Better the devil you know.  <br>The Conservatives. We've started. Let us finish.    <p>Slogans supplied by Burkitt Edwards Martin  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Helen Dunmore wins first Orange prize for women writers worth 30,000 </b><br><br><br><b><h2>16 May 1996</h2></b><br><h2>British writer wins women's book prize  </h2>
  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Dan Glaister</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>The National Liberal Club in London reverberated to whoops and cheers last night when the British writer Helen Dunmore was awarded the first Orange prize for women writers of fiction for her novel 'A Spell of Winter'. Ms Dunmore was presented with a statuette, called a Bessie, and a cheque for &#163;30,000 by the actress Juliet Stevenson. The prize for women fiction writers in the English language came down to a choice between Ms Dunmore's novel, the bookmakers' favourite, and 'Eveless Eden', by the American-born writer resident in Britain, Marianne Wiggins.  <p>  <p>Other authors shortlisted were Briton Julia Blackburn, with 'The Book of Colour', and Americans Pagan Kennedy with 'Spinsters', Amy Tan with 'The Hundred Secret Senses', and Anne Tyler with 'Ladder of Years'.  <p>  <p>Speaking before presenting the prize, Ms Stevenson confessed that she "was normally rather ambivalent about prizes and awards." The Orange prize, however, was an exception. "I am not in favour generally of separatism," said the actress, "but I have only worked twice in pieces written by women in 18 years in the theatre."  <p>  <p>Kate Mosse, chair of the judges, brushed aside criticism of the women-only prize, saying that it served to sell books.  <p>  <p>The Orange prize has been dogged by controversy. Born out of the Booker prize, the Orange followed in the best traditions of Britain's most famous literary award when the judges fell out as soon as the shortlist was announced. Val Hennessy, a member of the five-woman panel and chief book reviewer for the Daily Mail, said that of the 146 that had been submitted for the prize, she had "seldom come across books that were so bad". The prize was sparked by the late writer Angela Carter's failure to make the 1991 Booker Prize shortlist for her final novel, 'Wise Children'. Only four out of 30 nominees for the Booker in the last five years have been women, while women have won the Nobel prize for literature on only eight occasions this century.  <p>  <p>Intended to counter perceived discrimination, the Orange prize succeeded in attracting charges of discrimination and political correctness. Organisers argued that the Orange, open to women of any nationality writing in English, was more open than any of the other prizes, pointing out that the Booker is restricted to Commonwealth writers.  <p>  <p>Alarmed by the bad publicity, the initial sponsors of the prize, Mitsubishi, withdrew support in September 1994. It seemed that the project would falter, until an anonymous woman benefactor provided the &#163;30,000 prize money in perpetuity, and Orange, the mobile telephone company, decided to sponsor the award with a commitment to spend &#163;210,000 over the next three years.  <p>  <p>The Orange's &#163;30,000 is the second most lucrative prize on the literary awards circuit. The most prize money goes to the winner of the National Literature Prize, while the NCR Book Award offers &#163;25,000, the Whitbread &#163;21,500, and the Booker &#163;20,000.  <p>  <p>Ironically, the most recent winners of both the Booker and the Whitbread have been women: Pat Barker for 'The Ghost Road', and Kate Atkinson for 'Behind the Scenes At the Museum'.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Dan Glaister</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>'A Spell Of Winter' is the third novel by the Bristol-based Helen Dunmore, writes Dan Glaister.  <p>  <p>The story of a middle-class family in the run-up to the first world war, it deals with sensitive issues, including incest. Reviewing the novel in the Guardian, Marianne Brace described her as "an electrifying and original talent, a writer whose style is characterised by a lyrical, dreamy intensity".  <p>  <p>Dunmore, aged 43, married with a stepson, a son and a daughter, said that she had not been disconcerted by the furore surrounding the women-only prize. "I don't think the fact that women won the Whitbread and the Booker have affected what the Orange prize set out to do," she said. "We have a unique tradition of women's fiction in the English language. We are very foolish if we don't celebrate the achievements of women's fiction." <p>The Yorkshire-born Dunmore came to attention as a children's writer and as a poet. "I wouldn't define myself as a children's writer, a poet or a novelist because I want to feel that we can push the boundaries of what we are. When I was 25, people said to me I was a poet," she said. "Now they say to me that I am a novelist. Maybe one day I will be a playwright." Her two earlier novels, 'Burning Bright' and 'Zennor in Darkness', were both highly praised. Her poetic style has been compared with Pat Barker and with Jeanette Winterson.  <p>  <p>Her poetry collections include the 'Sea Skater', which won the Poetry Society's Alice Hunt Bartlett Award.  <p>  <p>Asked how she planned to spend the &#163;30,000 prize money, she said: "I suppose I shall spend it very easily," adding: "People are always surprised when writers receive money, as if they don't have mortgages to pay." Dunmore has already completed her next novel, 'Talking To The Dead'. It is to be published in July.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Gary Younge</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>A mother who brought her two children to school late every day for four months has been fined &#163;200 after ignoring warnings from teachers and the local council to be punctual, it emerged yesterday.  <p>  <p>In what is believed to be the first case of its kind, magistrates in Camberwell, south London, convicted the mother under the 1993 Education Act for "failing to ensure her children's full-time education". The case was heard in her absence last month after she failed to turn up at two court hearings.  <p>  <p>The children, aged five and 10, sometimes arrived at school at 10.30am. The woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was given two formal written warnings and several verbal ones but failed to respond, says the council, which is launching a campaign to encourage regular school attendance. John Guest, the head of Southwark council's education and welfare attendance service, said: "The severity of the fine suggests that the magistrates found the matter at least as serious as we did. A parent who does not bring a child to school on time is not just disadvantaging the child but is also causing disruption that harms other pupils.  <p>  <p>"Since the hearing there has been a dramatic improvement in the children's attendance record," said Mr Guest.  <p>  <p>Nigel de Gruchy, general secretary of the National Association of Schoolteachers Union of Women Teachers, praised the action. "It is a helpful precedent in forcing parents to take greater responsibility for their children's education," he said.  <p>  <p>A spokesman for the Department for Education and Employment said yesterday: "While we cannot expand on the specifics of this particular case, this action is within the guidelines set out in 1994."  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Navy admiral, Jeremy Boorda, commits suicide</b><br><br><br><b><h2>17 May 1996</h2></b><br><h2>US navy chief shoots himself  </h2>
  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Martin Walker</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>Admiral Jeremy 'Mike' Boorda, the first seaman to rise from the lower deck to become the senior naval officer at the Pentagon, shot and killed himself while sitting on the porch outside his official dwelling yesterday. He had left his office at the Pentagon at lunchtime to return to his quarters at the Washington Navy Yard.  <p>  <p>Adm Boorda, aged 56, was pronounced dead on arrival at a Washington hospital after shooting himself in the chest with a .38 handgun.  There was no immediate explanation for what military police were treating as a suicide. Defence officials said privately that Boorda left at least one note which indicated he took his own life.  <p>  <p>At the time his body was found, the admiral had been scheduled to be interviewed by two Newsweek journalists who were inquiring into his right to the medals he had worn. In the past, Adm Boorda had worn a V-shaped clasp, a special award for valour, and there was some question about the incident for which it was awarded.  <p>  <p>Colleagues were said to be baffled by news of the suicide, although one said Adm Boorda had recently undergone a routine medical exam.  <p>  <p>"His death is a great loss for the navy, for the armed forces and for our country," said President Clinton.

  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Alex Bellos</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>Sleazy politicians, fat cat businessmen, greedy farmers pah! The real roots of the country's problems are cynical journalists. So says Lord Hanson, the flamboyant business tycoon, who accuses broadsheets and tabloids alike of weakening the nation through lurid disclosures about minor politicians and public figures.  <p>  <p>In a hard-hitting article in the Spectator, he blames journalists for creating the feeling that ours is a time of unprecedented decline. In fact, he states, this picture is wrong: Parliament is relatively uncorrupt, incomes have increased in average real terms and unemployment is lower than in several similar countries.  <p>  <p>"Destructive journalism fosters the belief that politicians routinely evade the truth and break their promises. It creates a climate in which trust in society as a whole dissolves, in which difficulties are magnified beyond all proportion, in which no one is believed to act except for the most self-centred of motives.  In a way this reflects not so much maturity and worldly wisdom on the part of the media reporters, as an immaturity deriving from their never having had to do anything in the real world."  <p>  <p>Lord Hanson, who as chairman of Hanson plc is a regular contributor to Tory coffers, writes that apart from David Frost, Robin Day and Selina Scott, TV journalists treat legislators and business people as "little more than a visiting cabaret".  He adds: "Television exacerbates the concentration on personality and trivia at the expense of serious discussion and analysis. Its tendency to unbalance... tends to destroy public trust."  <p>  <p>He complains that business people are castigated for seeking profit and damaging the environment. "While we hear a great deal about the damaging effects of roads and cars, we hear far less about the enormous strides made by car manufacturers in reducing pollution or about the benefits of better roads, which the hostile critics continue to use, none the less." He says journalists frequently criticise business practices like downsizing and introducing modern industrial methods into underdeveloped countries. "Protests by businessmen that activities of this sort are the conditions for any jobs at all are dismissed with a knowing smile by those who fail to understand that without the profits made by industry, we would have no prosperity, no education, and no quality of life."  <p>  <p>While Lord Hanson has been spared the wost excesses of tabloid intrusion, this can't be said of his late business partner and best friend, Lord White, who died last year. Lord White was a lover of expensive habits and glamorous women.  <p>  <p>Lord Hanson suggests the media had a vested interest in doom-mongering because it made good copy. But in the long run, he says, it damages everybody.  "Cynicism, by its relentless questioning of the character and motives of those at the sharp end of our problems, weakens our nation by turning attention away from what should really be concerning it."  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Roy Greenslade</b><br><br>      <p>Is journalism in crisis? The question is as old as newspapers, but that doesn't stop people asking it. Consider a handful of the most recent critics. Businessman Lord Hanson warns of "destructive journalism" which shows a lurid interest in the private lives of public figures and is thereby destroying public trust.  <p>  <p>Former Labour party spin-doctor Joy Johnson, in a speech delivered at a conference on Saturday, repents the error of her ways, arguing that the relationship between politicians and lobby journalists have turned into a game which threatens the democratic process. Politician Roy Hattersley laments soundbite journalism, accusing serious television interviewers of indulging in showbiz rather than sensible debate.  <p>  <p>And because navel-gazing is a media obsession, a couple of journalists have joined in too. Independent editor Andrew Marr promotes a law to protect privacy as a way of diverting political debate away from the bedroom. One of Marr's most distinguished contributors, Bryan Appleyard, worries that a corruption of news values means that democracy is in danger of being undermined. All of these arguments echo, both consciously and unconsciously, those of James Fallows, the American journalist whose book 'Breaking The News: How The Media Undermine American Democracy' was featured on these pages some weeks ago.  <p>  <p>The danger, however, is to give all of these critics the same weight and respect. For example, Hanson argued in the Spectator that adversarial interviewing techniques foster "the belief that politicians routinely evade the truth and break their promises." In his view, our politicians are not corrupt. Similarly businessmen are, says Hanson, "castigated for seeking profit". Hanson claims that this cynical approach "creates a climate in which trust in society as a whole dissolves". The nation is therefore weakened.  <p>  <p>When pressed on Radio 4's Today programme - which he appeared, surprisingly, to exclude from his criticisms - Hanson's ringing indictment of journalism was quickly reduced to a tinkle. Surely, said John Humphrys, the public was able to see through the superficial form of an interview to its content. People were too intelligent to be taken in. Hanson agreed. That did not destroy his argument, as Humphrys triumphantly suggested, but merely showed that Hanson had not thought it through.  <p>  <p>No one who believes in the media's power to shape its audience's perspective would maintain that the process is one of cause and effect. Humphrys also failed to point out the self-serving nature of Hanson's attack: fat cat businessmen have become a target even for rightwing newspapers, with the Daily Mail last week running a trenchant leader and a wickedly funny cartoon.  <p>  <p>Joy Johnson, keen to distance her arguments from those of Hanson, thought him guilty of calling for "a timid feel-good press" while she was doing the opposite: demanding a bolder journalism, free from Westminster's cosy relationships between the lobby, the party press advisers and MPs. Her views strike a chord. Journalists don't like spin-doctors; politicians don't like spin-doctors; the public are being encouraged not to like spin-doctors. Now we have a spin-doctor who doesn't like spin-doctors.  <p>  <p>But she overstates her case. To claim that the fall in the esteem of politicians is directly related to the rise in "the arts of the spin-doctors" is plainly wrong in almost every respect. The public's lack of respect for MPs has been growing throughout the post-war period and its acceleration in recent years is only partially due to the press. Many factors have played a part, such as the way in which ex-Cabinet ministers end up with strings of lucrative directorships and sitting MPs make so much money on the side. (Hanson, please note, calls parliament "one of the most incorrupt in the world"). The sexual sleaze revealed in tabloids is probably far less influential.  <p>  <p>Marr also lends too much weight to such intrusion. Unsavoury though some of it is, there is little evidence that it affects voters. It is the establishment which turns it into an issue by blackballing its victims and forcing needless resignations. Those who face it out, such as Paddy Ashdown and Steven Norris, have not suffered. Rather than introducing a privacy law, the best way to divert newspapers is to ignore it. Lack of controversy defeats the sales-building objective.  <p>  <p>This is not to say that Hanson and Johnson, along with Appleyard, have not raised serious issues. The problem with the debate thus far is that too much is made of too little. (How can a soundbite world really affect democracy, Mr Hattersley?) There is no coherent, comprehensive analysis of where journalism is heading. Too many of the critics are too subjective, giving us opinions in the place of evidence. How many times have we been told that investigative journalism is over? How often must we hear that politics has been trivialised because it deals with personalities rather than policies? It sounds fine, but after a moment's thought we realise there has never been a political system - totalitarian or liberal democratic - where politics has been divorced from human beings. Journalism is ill-served by those who think the messenger is always the problem.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Duncan Campbell</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>Two paedophiles who lived out a fantasy of abducting, sexually abusing and murdering a small boy were given three life sentences each yesterday and told they should die in prison. The case has led to calls for a national register of convicted child sex offenders so their moves can be monitored. Timothy Morss, aged 33, and Brett Tyler, aged 30, both minicab drivers from east London, were convicted at the Old Bailey of the murder of Daniel Handley, aged nine, whom they abducted near his home in Beckton, east London in October 1994. They sexually assaulted him above a minicab office in south London, strangled him and buried him near a golf course outside Bristol. Morss pleaded guilty and Tyler was unanimously found guilty by a jury of four women and eight men after deliberations of less than an hour. He had admitted abducting and buggering Daniel, but not strangling him. The trial judge, Mr Justice Curtis, told the men they were evil vultures who sought to satisfy their lusts on other people's sons.  <p>  <p>"No society can tolerate men abducting a child of that age on a street in broad daylight," he told the two men who stared impassively from the dock. "You are both calculating men and I do not believe you are truly sorry for what you have done."  <p>  <p>He sentenced them both to three concurrent life sentences for murder, buggery and false imprisonment.  <p>  <p>"I propose to recommend that you serve exactly that," said the judge as friends of the Handley family wept in the back of the court. Because of the nature of their offences and "the very, very high risk" they posed to small boys, the judge said the pair should never be released.  <p>  <p>Mr Justice Curtis praised the police, who had tracked Tyler down at a hideout in the Philippines and found Morss after appeals on BBC's 'Crimewatch' programme.  <p>  <p>The judge particularly commended acting Detective Inspector Stephen Kavanagh, who heard Tyler's confession in a videotaped interview in the Philippines, because he had "resisted the temptation to attack a man who most men in the street thought should be attacked".  <p>  <p>He added that the video confession and case papers should never be destroyed and should be shown to anyone who ever thought of releasing the men. After the case, Daniel Handley's mother left the court without comment. She was in distress, and in the company of representatives of the News of the World. The National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children also called for a register of convicted child sex abusers. Jim Harding, its director, said: "All relevant voluntary and statutory bodies which work with children should have access to information on the register."  <p>  <p>Both men had been sexually abused from the age of four, and had previous convictions for sex offences involving boys. They had met in a sex offenders' wing in Wormwood Scrubs jail and become lovers. Morss had fantasised about abducting and murdering a small blond boy, and had cruised the streets with Tyler looking for victims.  <p>  <p>A third man, David Guttridge, aged 59, who had been Morss's lover and is also a convicted sex offender, was jailed for 30 months for perverting the course of justice. He had helped Morss flee the country.  <p>    <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Duncan Campbell</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>The group therapy session for sex offenders in the special annexe of Wormwood Scrubs prison listened as Timothy Morss outlined his favourite fantasy. He wanted to pluck a blond boy, aged between eight and 13, from the street, take him somewhere quiet, bugger him, strangle him and then dispose of his body.  <p>  <p>Edward Cook, the prison officer co-ordinating the meeting for those dismissed as "nonces" by their fellow-inmates, recalled Timothy Morss's words long after he had been released from his sentence for indecency. It was his memory of that grim fantasy that finally led to the imprisonment of Morss and his fellow-murderer, Brett Tyler, at the Old Bailey yesterday for the murder of Daniel Handley.  <p>  <p>Cook had long feared that allowing sex offenders to share cells and grouping together Rule 43 inmates - sex offenders, informers and ex-police officers who are separated from other prisoners for their own safety - could reinforce their obsessions. "I always worried about what was happening on the landings in the evenings outside the therapy sessions," he said later. "Even in the therapy session you never really get through to the paedophile. He always thinks he is right." A consultant psychiatrist, who had briefly taken Morss on as a patient, had also warned police of the ex-prisoner's dark desires.  <p>  <p>Tyler was the perfect partner for Morss, both as an accomplice and a lover. Abandoned by his mother as a baby, he was sent to Barnardo's, sexually assaulted at four before returning to his home three years later when his father remarried. He was sexually experienced by the age of 12, when he and a friend had sex on a fishing expedition, in trouble with the police after being found with a loaded air rifle as a teenager and jailed for four years for attempted buggery and gross indecency in 1986.  <p>  <p>In the interim he had survived on odd jobs as a waiter, dishwasher and driver, lying about his catering qualifications to get jobs and hanging about with rent boys in Soho. He was initially impressed by Morss's self-confidence.  <p>  <p>Morss had also been abused as a child and had dabbled in burglary as a teenager before serving briefly in the Royal Corps of Transport. In 1985 he was jailed for seven years, reduced to five on appeal, for buggering nine-year-old twins and an 11-year-old boy. He was the stronger character and suggested that he and Tyler team up when they left prison. This they did, working for Guy's Cars minicab firm in Camberwell, south London, a company owned by David Guttridge, 59, a chemical engineer, whom both had met inside and who had fallen in love with Morss.  <p>  <p>Guttridge was serving a seven year sentence for sexually abusing his 10-year-old son but decided to try to deal with his behaviour. When he left prison he sought psychiatric help and never re-offended. His attempts to persuade Morss to do the same were in vain. Guttridge also owned a florist's in Bristol where Morss worked during the week. Both would spend the weekends at the cab firm.  <p>  <p>But Morss drifted apart from the older man who resented his frienship with Tyler, with whom Morss would spend the weekends having a few beers, smoking joints and cruising working-class areas on a "chicken-hunt", looking for small boys. They chose such areas because they believed the boys would be less chaperoned than in smarter parts of the city. They pointed boys out to each other, dismissing them for being "too small" or "too fat". But on the first Sunday afternoon in October 1994, they resolved to fulfil their fantasy. Their victim was a familiar figure in Beckton, east London. A cheerful nine-year-old with his hair sometimes in a pony-tail, spinning around in a red boiler-suit on his silver BMX bike or hopping on to one of the local buses. For a few pence, he would help people load their shopping into their cars at the local Asda.  <p>  <p>Daniel's home was with his mother, Maxine Williams, aged 34, and her new boyfriend, Alexander Joseph, aged 21, in a cul de sac, Lobelia Close. But his home life was far from ideal: one detective described his house as a tip. Neighbours say that Daniel would often go round to a friend's house for a bath and a hot meal.  <p>  <p>When Daniel Handley disappeared there had, at first, been no panic. But when he had not returned by nightfall, his mother started to fear the worst. At 11pm he was reported missing.  <p>  <p>About 250 police searched the area with a blown-up photo of the boy, asking everyone for a last sighting. Divers went into the nearest docks, flooded gasometers, and the rowing boat lake. By the following weekend, the police had started to dig up the garden of the Handley home, an "elimination procedure" as the police described it at the time.  <p>  <p>It was another six months, however, before the remains of Daniel were found in a shallow grave near the Woodlands golf club at Bradley Stoke, Bristol. As the police investigation developed, it had become clear that two men had approached Daniel on the day he disappeared. They had been seen standing by the open door of a silver or grey car. One had been showing Daniel a map while the other had been sitting in the car.  <p>  <p>The men were Morss and Tyler. Once Daniel had been pulled into the car, they had driven to the flat above the minicab office in Camberwell. There they took him upstairs and told him to undress, trying to get him to drink a vodka. Daniel said he did not want to take part because he had already done it once, did not like it and had been "blamed" for it.  <p>  <p>After they had finished sexually abusing him - and filming themselves as they did - they promised they would take him home. But Tyler went to pick up a spade and pitchfork to dig a grave from his unknowing father's house in east London. Daniel slept on the floor of the car, periodically waking up to ask if they were home yet.  <p>  <p>On the way to Bristol, they pulled off the M4 motorway and into a layby where they knotted a rope. "Are you going to kill me?" asked Daniel. They told him they were not but Morss made a noose round his neck and told Tyler to help him. Tyler, or so he claimed later, apologised to the boy while helping pull the rope tight. They felt his pulse. He was dead. It took them nearly four hours to dig a grave in the hard ground.  <p>  <p>On 30 May last year, following an appeal on the BBC 'Crime Watch' programme, the investigation began to fall into place. The broadcast triggered memories for Edward Cook and the consultant psychiatrist.  <p>  <p>The police had already been looking at known paedophiles, trying to find a link between Bristol and London. By a process of elimination it was discovered that Morss and Guttridge had a home in Bradley Stoke close to where the body was unearthed. Their names went straight to the top of the suspects' list.  <p>  <p>When Guttridge was approached, he confessed that he had been waiting for the police to knock and told them that Tyler and Morss were the killers. Morss had made the chilling remark "one fuck - what a waste" when discussing the murder. It emerged that both had fled to the Philippines with Guttridge's help. But the pair fell out there and Morss returned home.  <p>  <p>Guttridge told the police where they would find him at an address in Rotherhithe, south London. He also told them where Tyler was hiding in the Philippines with his Filipino lover and two children, one, Brett Junior, whom he claimed to have fathered. Both Morss and Tyler claimed to have married Filipino women, Morss saying he was paid &#163;3,000 so that the woman could get into the United Kingdom.  <p>  <p>Friends there recounted how the men had parted: Tyler had confronted Morss and warned him to stay away from children in the house and the two men had fought.  <p>  <p>While Morss was held in London, refusing to admit his guilt on tape, police flew out to question Tyler in the Philippines where he agreed to be interviewed. He recounted in a low voice as he smoked Marlboros how they had abucted and killed Daniel.  <p>  <p>Shortly afterwards, he was deported as an undesirable alien on a plane with the British detectives. On his return to Britain, in late June 1995, he was charged with Daniel's murder, a charge he continued to fight throughout the trial.  <p>  <p>Although media coverage may suggest such killings are increasing, it is not so. The clear-up rate for sex crimes involving children also continues to improve. More than 90 per cent of all gross indecency offences involving children are solved. In the latest annual figures, for 1994, there were 28 homicides in the five to 16 age group, fewer than in 1984 (32) or 1985 (42). Children remain most at risk from their own parents or step-parents. Attempts are meanwhile being made to curtail the activities of paedophiles abroad - particularly in the Philippines and Thailand - through the Sexual Offences (Conspiracy and Incitement) Bill and stricter law enforcement within those two countries. This has led to some 'sex tourists' moving to India and Cambodia. The UN Children's Fund believes that there are as many as 60,000 child prostitutes in the Philippines.  <p>  <p>Morss and Tyler are unlikely to find themselves in the same group again. But they can expect to be shunned by fellow-inmates, who may deal with 'nonces' by pouring boiling water over them or relieving themselves in their food.   <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Woman under police protection made up story about rape by stalker </b><br><br><br><b><h2>18 May 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Rape story was false say police  </h2>
  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Duncan Campbell</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>A woman who claimed she had been raped by a stalker while under police protection is now believed to have invented the story.  <p>  <p>Cambridgeshire police spent &#163;200,000 and five months investigating her claims, and were subjected to ridicule because the stalker had apparently struck while officers were supposed to be guarding the woman. The woman, who is not being named, is understood to suffer from a psychiatric disorder and is receiving medical treatment. She will not be prosecuted for wasting police time.  <p>  <p>In January it emerged that the woman, a married mother in her 30s, had told police she had been stalked for months by a man named Chuck. She said he had savagely raped her on 17 January while she was receiving police protection at her home near Huntingdon. A video camera was monitoring the house. An artist's impression of the man was issued and an investigation launched. Calls were made for a change in the law on stalking.  <p>  <p>Yesterday Cambridgeshire's assistant chief constable David Winser said detectives had concluded that the man did not exist and the entire story had been fabricated. The woman had been told of the police's conclusion in the presence of medical help.  <p>  <p>In January, Detective Superintendent Tony Rogers, who led the inquiry, said the woman had been so savagely raped she had not been able to give details for a number of days. Police said yesterday the injuries were minor. Mr Winser said the case papers were passed to the Crown Prosecution Service two weeks ago. It had decided that no action be taken against the woman and the police supported that decision, he said.  <p>  <p>Detectives were puzzled throughout the inquiry that no one else appeared to have any knowledge of the man despite the woman's claims that she had seen him frequently in specific places and that he had telephoned and written to her repeatedly. There was no evidence on the video camera, but it appeared to have been damaged, it was presumed by the stalker. It was now clear that the camera had not been tampered with. However, in the light of the claims of violence and apparent injuries the police had mounted a big investigation.  <p>  <p>"We did not come to this conclusion yesterday," said Mr Winser. "It was during the course of the inquiry, an inquiry that involved a thorough investigation.  It was almost a no-win situation because we had to believe there was a rapist out there," he added. "It is difficult to prove a negative." He said he did not believe the case would make it more difficult for other women to have their claims taken seriously. The police would not name the woman as she was clearly ill. They had ensured she received medical help. "The message we must give out is that offences will be very, very thoroughly investigated," Mr Winser said. "It has involved up to 40 officers at one time and it has taken over five months."  <p>  <p>Ann Neale, of Women Against Rape, said yesterday she hoped the case would not be used to undermine women who already had severe reservations about reporting rape. Only one in 12 rape victims reported the crime.   <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Mark Tran</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>The FBI yesterday announced its first success in tracking down criminals through the internet - the capture of a fugitive on its Ten Most Wanted list, a bank robber hiding in Guatemala.  <p>  <p>The cyberspace breakthrough came after someone living in Guatemala, who had seen a photo of Leslie Isben Rogge on the FBI's home page on the Worldwide Web, tipped off the Feds that Mr Rogge was living in Guatemala. Armed with this information, the Guatemalan police launched an extensive manhunt with the help of security personnel from the US embassy and Americans living in Guatemala.  <p>  <p>Mr Rogge, "feeling the intense pressure", turned himself in to the US embassy on Saturday.  <p>  <p>He returned to the US in handcuffs yesterday and will appear in a Miami court today.  <p>  <p>The FBI started its home page - http://www.fbi.gov - a little over a year ago. It consists of general information about the bureau, speeches, a freephone number, and the FBI's Ten Most Wanted fugitive list, with pictures of the fugitives and descriptions of the crimes they are accused of committing.  <p>  <p>Mr Rogge, aged 56, appeared on the list in 1990. A convicted bank robber, he escaped from federal custody in Idaho in 1985.

<!--INFOLINE--><b>WPC Karen Wade loses sexual harassment claim at industrial tribunal </b><br><br><br><b><h2>21 May 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Harassment case WPC "has no regrets"</h2><h3>Many policewomen are developing defence mechanisms to cope with sexist colleagues  </h2>
  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Duncan Campbell</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>The case of Karen Wade, the policewoman who lost her sexual harassment claim at an industrial tribunal in Leeds yesterday, will not be the last in which allegations of sexism are raised by officers against their colleagues. She did not regret bringing the case, she said outside the court. "I believe I have given strength to others who find themselves in similar situations to my own, to stand up and challenge the treatment they are receiving." In the past two years the Police Federation has been involved in 250 cases of alleged sexual or racial harassment, and the number is increasing annually.  <p>  <p>Yesterday, the federation, which represents officers up to the rank of inspector, confirmed there had been a significant increase in such actions, which it felt reflected similar civil actions taken elsewhere in society. Fred Broughton, chairman of the federation, said yesterday: "No other staff association or union has spent more on such cases."  <p>  <p>He took exception to suggestions, following the federation's decision not to finance Ms Wade's action, that it did not fight on behalf of women. The federation always acted on legal advice as to whether cases should be pursued. Sometimes it acted for both the officer making the complaint and those against whom it had been made.  <p>  <p>Last night Tony Burden, chief constable of Gwent and spokesman on equal opportunities for the Association of Chief Police Officers, said: "Allegations of sexual discrimination are taken extremely seriously by chief police officers." Individuals might decide they would prefer the matter to be dealt with by an industrial tribunal.  <p>  <p>Women make up 16 per cent of constables and 14 per cent of the service as a whole. The percentage is increasing every year.  <p>  <p>Policewomen who voice complaints about male behaviour are known as "walking ITs" among some male officers. This means they believe the women will eventually go to an industrial tribunal (IT) with an allegation about sexist behaviour. For this the male officers blame the 'equal opportunities industry' and 'politically correct' senior officers.  <p>  <p>Even women who win their cases face problems. Sarah Locker, who won a &#163;32,500 compensation claim from the Metropolitan police and an unprecedented public apology in 1993, said she was shunned when she returned to work, and anonymous calls blamed her for the fact that after her case many male detectives were transferred back into uniform. "No woman officer embarks lightly on an action," Mrs Locker said yesterday. "There's a lot of thought goes into it and a lot of sacrifices made."  <p>  <p>For every Sarah Locker, there are many others who say nothing. Women officers complain that if they play along with male banter too much they are accused of being 'slags' and if they make clear their displeasure, they are called 'lessies'.  <p>  <p>"If you respond to a remark, you are on your hobby horse; if you don't, they take it as agreement," said one woman constable quoted in the report on equal opportunities completed by the Inspectorate of Constabulary last year. The report found a high level of "sexist banter, perhaps more covert and subtle than before but no less destructive". It also concluded that "many women... felt that anyone who raised issues would be denigrated, ignored or dealt with inappropriately, and most had developed coping mechanisms to continue with work which they valued highly."  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>WPC Karen Wade loses sexual harassment claim at industrial tribunal </b><br><br><br><b><h2>21 May 1996</h2></b><br><h2>The accused</h2><H3>A spate of recent cases featuring high-profile men has refocused attention on the question of sexual harassment </h2>
  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Mark Lawson</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>The new biographies of Howard Hughes and Joe Kennedy established once again that prominent, powerful men of the past had a great deal of sex. Events of the past few weeks, however, have suggested that what today's famous males are most likely to get are sexual harassment suits. British tycoon Richard Branson has been accused by a former American employee of improperly fondling her at a party. Nobel prize-winning West Indian poet Derek Walcott faces allegations from a former student at Boston University of marking down her work because she refused to have sex with him. A former personal assistant to the actor George C Scott is suing him for allegedly making sexual advances to her, including the request that she have his baby. In Australia, motorbike star Barry Sheene and racing driver Gerhard Berger have been accused of unwanted intimacy with a teenage shop assistant. Meanwhile, in Washington DC, President Clinton's lawyers continue trying to delay a sexual harassment suit from a woman who claims that, in a hotel room in Arkansas in 1991, he dropped his trousers and ordered her to perform oral sex.  <p>  <p>All the men firmly deny and are contesting the claims. But this spate of cases featuring high-profile men has refocused attention on the question of sexual harassment. Some believe that, as with domestic violence and racial discrimination before it, a long ignored social problem is finally being remedied by the legal system. Others contend that the law has opened up a rich new source of income for American lawyers and litigants and offered a glittering instrument of revenge to women with a grudge against men. It is significant that the cases outlined above are all being pursued outside the British legal system, four in America and one in Australia. America has long had both federal and state laws forbidding sexual harassment (broadly defined as unwanted attention, physical or verbal, of a sexual nature) at work. Most major US companies now bind their male employees to codes of conduct, which forbid, for example, uninvited comment on a female colleague's appearance or a second social request after a first has been declined. The country's system of civil personal injury suits - of the kind being brought by relatives of the victims in the OJ Simpson case - also allows for massive financial claims to be brought against prominent individuals or institutions. The woman in the Walcott case, for example, is seeking several million dollars.  <p>  <p>"We're going to see more and more of these cases in America," says Richard North Patterson, a San Francisco-based attorney and author of legal thrillers. "How the American legal system works is that it identifies a problem - and sexual harassment of women has been a genuine problem - then defines a right enforceable by law. And once lawyers work out how to bring and win a case, you get a flood of them." British law is far less advanced. Sexual harassment cases are covered by the Sex Discrimination Act of 1975, which deals with all prejudice against employees on grounds of gender. Such cases are heard by an industrial tribunal. (Yesterday, Karen Wade, a police sergeant who complained of a "culture of sexual harassment" up to and including "indecent assault" in the West Yorkshire police force, lost her case.) British workers are also covered by two pieces of European legislation: a 1991 Code of Recommendations on Dignity in The Workplace and a 1976 Equal Treatment Directive.  <p>  <p>There are three basic theories of sexual harassment suits: whistleblowing, gold-digging and revenge. The first insists that office monsters are being caged; the second that a new female-only National Lottery has been invented; the third that the law hath no fury like a woman scorned. Masculine popular culture has generally favoured the second and third theories. David Mamet's play and film Oleanna showed a weak student deliberately destroying her professor's career with a false claim of sexual harassment. Michael Crichton's book and film Disclosure suggested the real crisis in the workplace is female harassment of men.  <p>  <p>The reason sexual harassment is such a contentious area of litigation is that the evidence is often merely a matter of opinion. Apart from those relating to marriage and divorce, there are four areas of the law concerning sexual behaviour. These are rape, stalking, 'date rape' and sexual harassment. Although the first two are by no means straightforward prosecutions - parliamentary attempts to introduce a specific law against stalking were recently frustrated - there will generally be some forensic or police evidence.  <p>  <p>The difficulty in both 'date rape' (when assault is alleged to have occurred during an originally consensual encounter) and sexual harassment is that the evidence tends to come down to two conflicting verbal accounts of what took place. This has the effect of permitting - or, some believe, encouraging - vexatious litigation, revenge allegations. Accuse a man of murder and the law will require some proof; allege sexual harassment and your story alone, at least in America, will usually be enough to begin legal proceedings. "Any 'he said, she said' area of law is obviously susceptible to abuse," says Richard North Patterson. However, Mary Stacey - a specialist in equality law at the London solicitors Thompsons - insists that, at least in a British context, the perception that these cases proceed solely by accusation is false.  <p>  <p>"In the case of straightforward sexual harassment - groping against the photocopier, as it were - it will usually be her word against his and it's a question of who is more believable," she says. "But in cases of denied promotion or discrimination against a woman who has rejected someone's advances, there will often be witnesses or evidence. We would usually advise someone in such a situation to keep a diary." Whatever the doubts that have arisen in some cases, there is no doubt that the worlds of business and education have, for decades, housed large numbers of male sexual predators, who used their powers of hiring and grading, promotion and preferment, to demand sex. It may also be the case that these conditions applied even more so on the celebrity circuit. Without commenting directly on the George C Scott case, it is well-documented in the literature of Hollywood that there have been many prominent figures who claimed droit du seigneur. Without commenting directly on the Bill Clinton case, the literature of Washington establishes that the political arena has featured senators, governors and even presidents who asked for sex from female employees. There is, for example, a famous story of the White House secretary who woke to find Lyndon Johnson sliding into her bed, with the words: "Move over, honey, it's your President." There were doubtless many women who were happy to say yes in such circumstances - power can be an aphrodisiac for both sides - but equally there will have been those who felt compelled to submit because of the position of their seducer. Some of the law suits of recent years result from their understanding that they no longer have to.  <p>  <p>"The good news," Richard North Patterson says, "is that increased education and evolving consciousness in this area are ultimately going to make the workplace far more amenable for women. The bad news is that there are going to be bogus law suits. That's the price you pay." Here, gold-digging is less likely, because of the small amounts of gold on offer - average payment from industrial tribunals is &#163;12,712 - and the complexity of the procedure. "It's harder to bring a claim than not to bring one," Mary Stacey says. "I've seen no evidence of vendetta claims in the cases I've handled. I do think, though, that workplace relationships are far more complex than ever comes out at tribunal."  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Martin Wainwright</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>A policewoman who claimed she was subjected to nine months of humiliation and victimisation by three male colleagues lost her case for sexual harassment yesterday.  <p>  <p>PC Karen Wade, aged 27, put her head in her hands and sobbed after complaints of persistent and obscene sexual harassment were rejected by a Leeds industrial tribunal. She is to appeal.  <p>  <p>PC Wade, who intends to return to duty with West Yorkshire police, said she did not regret bringing the case. "I believe I have given strength to other women... in this position, to stand up and challenge the treatment they are receiving."  <p>  <p>West Yorkshire's chief constable, Keith Hellawell, stressed that eliminating sexual harassment was a long-term challenge. "To end harassment of people particularly in relation to their sex or colour of their skin isn't easy. It is something that is going to take generations. This is one step along the road."  <p>  <p>PC Wade had brought the case against the force, PC Dean Mountain, aged 30, Sergeant Ian Devey, aged 32, and Sergeant Paul Fountain, aged 30. The officers were accused of taunting PC Wade, who has been off sick for 10 months, barring her career development, and forcing her to make tea "because she is a woman".  <p>  <p>They denied all the complaints, including a claim that PC Mountain had invited a detained glue sniffer to have sex with PC Wade in a police van. It was also claimed she was nicknamed Stripper, Tart, Cabbage and Bianca after the EastEnders TV soap character she was said to resemble. Hilary McLaughlin, solicitor for the officers, said: "Not one iota of evidence has been offered to support these allegations."  <p>  <p>The case raised disquieting claims of routine sexual bullying in the West Yorkshire force. Its specialist officer for women staff, Sergeant Jane McGill, aged 43, gave evidence of a "hidden culture of harassment", which survived because so few women would publicly complain. She revealed she had been indecently assaulted four times and had enjoyed a good career only by not making a fuss.  <p>  <p>Maureen Baker, representing PC Wade, said: "There is a culture in the police that you do not grass on your colleagues. Listening to the denials in the tribunal, I felt as if there was a ventriloquist in there. Not only did they deny the offences but they did so in identical language." PC Wade had shown enormous courage in bringing the case, and there was considerable consolation in the majority verdicts which cleared PC Mountain and Sergeant Devey. Sergeant Fountain and West Yorkshire police were cleared unanimously. Mrs Baker said: "Since this began, I have been contacted by 11 other women in the force with harassment allegations."  <p>    <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Vivek Chaudhary</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>The Time Lord who turned into a scatty scarecrow died of a heart attack yesterday while on holiday in the United States.  <p>  <p>Jon Pertwee, aged 76, who became known to millions of viewers as 'Dr Who' and then later spent 10 years as the children's character 'Worzel Gummidge' was taking a break in Connecticut between appearances in his one man tour of Britain, which was due to resume on Thursday. He was with his second wife, Ingeborg.  <p>  <p>During a showbusiness career spanning 60 years, Mr Pertwee will best be remembered as a swash-buckling 'Dr Who', who loved gadgets and cars. Before that he had been in the popular radio comedy, 'The Navy Lark', for nine years. Travelling in his Tardis, (Time and Relative Dimensions in Space), the blue police box time machine, 'Dr Who' took on the Daleks and Cybermen, attempting to save the world from destruction on the cult programme during Saturday teatime.  <p>  <p>Mr Pertwee, who was the third 'Dr Who', played the role for four years, wearing his trademark purple velvet smoking jacket and frilly shirt as he raced through time.  <p>  <p>With two hearts, a constant temperature of 60F and the ability to regenerate into a new body, the good doctor first arrived in our time zone and on our television screens in November 1963.  <p>  <p>Mr Pertwee's death comes as a feature length special is to be screened by BBC TV on Bank Holiday Monday with Paul McGann as 'Dr Who'.  <p>  <p>Susan Shaper, Mr Pertwee's agent, said: "He was a unique performer and much loved by the British public."  <p>  <p>Sylvester McCoy, the seventh and final 'Dr Who' in the television series which ended in 1989, said: "When I was a child Jon Pertwee on radio entertained and delighted me, and made me laugh.  <p>  <p>"As a young man he amazed and excited me with his performance as 'Dr Who'." After leaving the 'Dr Who' series and passing on his mantle to Tom Baker, Mr Pertwee continued to attend conventions of the cult series, recounting tales of his epic encounters with foes that threatened the future of the world. He also continued to present television and radio programmes. Commenting once on his heavy work load, despite his age, Mr Pertwee once indicated that he would like to go as only a fearless time traveller can. He said: "Actors don't retire, they fade away, like old generals. I just want to peter out, not rust out. I get desperately bored when I'm not working."  <p><p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Derek Malcolm</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>The British film director Mike Leigh won the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Festival last night for his film 'Secrets and Lies'.  The tragicomic family drama also won the International Critics' Prize, and Brenda Blethyn completed the triumph as best actress for her part as the white mother of an illegitimate black girl.  <p>  <p>Leigh said the prize would encourage independent spirits who made "films about people and relationships, real life and all the things that really matter".  <p>  <p>Blethyn said she found working with Leigh "gruelling but at times very funny. Because you create such a complete character, there's such a feeling of satisfaction at the end."  <p>  <p>'Secrets and Lies' tells the story of a black adopted optometrist, Hortense, who sets out to find her real mother. To her surprise, she turns out to be Cynthia, a white unmarried mother played by Blethyn. A family reunion leads to more revelations and emotional chaos, but in the end 'everybody is changed for the better'.  <p>  <p>With his doleful slouch and bloodhound face, Leigh makes an unlikely star of the glamorous world of Cannes. His career took off with the play 'Abigail's Party' in 1973, which starred Alison Steadman as a monstrous beautician who dominates a social evening. Over 25 years he has directed 12 films and dozens of plays.  <p>  <p>There was a standing ovation for the recipients of the Best Actor award - the French stars Daniel Auteuil and Pascal Duquenne. Duquenne is the first professional actor with Down's syndrome to receive a big film festival prize. He stars, as a Down's syndrome man, in 'The Eighth Day', by the Belgian director Jaco Van Dormael, whose brother also suffers from Down's syndrome. The jury, headed by Francis Ford Coppola, the US director, gave a special prize for daring to the Canadian director David Cronenberg's 'Crash', a film many thought pornographic. The jury was split on the decision, he said, and some wished to be dissociated from the award.  <p>  <p>The awards were a considerable British triumph. The runner-up to Leigh's film was Lars von Trier's 'Breaking The Waves'. The director is Danish but the film was made in Scotland with a largely British cast.  <p>  <p>Lynne Ramsay won the best short film for 'Small Deaths', a study of childhood on a Glasgow housing estate. She said: "The first thing I am going to do is phone my mum and my sister, tell my boyfriend, because I think they are just going to be totally gobsmacked."  <p>    <p>  <p>  <p>  <p><b>The works</b>  <p>  <p>Films: 'Meantime' (1983); 'The Short and Curlies' (1987); 'High Hopes' (1988); 'Life is Sweet' (1990); 'Naked' (1993)  <p>  <p>TV plays and films: 'A Mug's Game' (1972); 'Hard Labour' (1973); 'The Permissive Society', 'A Light Snack' (1975); 'Nuts in May', 'Knock for Knock' (1976); 'Abigail's Party', 'The Kiss of Death' (1977); 'Who's Who' (1978); 'Grown-Ups' (1980); 'Home Sweet Home' (1982); 'Four Days in July' (1984)  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Mike Leigh wins Palme  d'Or at Cannes for film 'Secrets and Lies' </b><br><br><br><b><h2>21 May  1996</h2></b><br><h2>Cannes 96 - A bit of Leigh way  </h2>
 <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Derek Malcolm</b><br><br>      <p> <p>Justice was served: Mike Leigh, designated Best Director for 'Naked' two years ago,  capped his career with the Palme d'Or last night for 'Secrets and Lies'. It was the first time  in a decade that Britain has been given the top award (Roland Joffe's 'The Mission' won in  1986). The international jury, headed by Francis Coppola, for once agreed with the  International Critics, who also gave Leigh their prize. But that wasn't all for the film.  Brenda Blethyn, who plays the mother in this tragicomic drama about family life, also won the  Best Actress award. <p> <p>The runner-up was also a good choice: Lars von Trier's 'Breaking the  Waves', which won the Special Jury Prize, now renamed the Grand Prix du Cannes. The film, shot  in Scotland with a largely British cast, headed by a remarkable young actress, Emily Watson,  would have been a worthy winner too. There was a standing ovation when Pascal Duquenne shared  the Best Actor award with the French star, Daniel Auteuil, for their work in Jaco Van Dormeal's  'The Eighth Day', the story of a Downs Syndrome man. Duquenne suffers from the condition  himself and gives a notable performance in the film. <p> <p>The only real controversy was the  Minor Jury Prize, which was handed to David Cronenberg for 'Crash' by a split jury. Some, said  Coppola, wanted not to be associated with a film that many thought not far from soft  pornography. The film, produced by BFI chairman Jeremy Thomas, had been roundly booed at its  press show. But some call it a masterpiece. Despite the fairly incomprehensible award to 'Crash',  described by Coppola as "original, daring and audacious", the jury covered themselves with  glory, considering the fact that their two predecessors amazingly left out Ken Loach's 'Land  And Freedom' last year and Kieslowski's 'Red' the year before. This time there was no such  blind spot. <p> <p>Looking back at the Cannes Festival as a whole, there's little doubt that  1996 proved to be the year when the films took a front seat and show business trailed in some  way behind. <p> <p>Stars were few and far between - though Liz Taylor hosted a big Aids event,  and Hugh Grant and Liz Hurley came in to preview extracts from their new film, 'Extreme  Measures', a hospital drama which she produced and in which he stars. For this a boat was  moored in the bay on which were so many scantily clad girls that several swimmers almost  drowned trying to reach it. It was dubbed 'the floating brothel' by the more cynical. <p>  <p>But, all this and the late-night parties apart, there was a strong sense that there were  more good films in all sections of the programme than for several years past. "It's  disastrous," said one critic of the competition. "There are fewer and fewer films you can walk  out of to get a coffee." Even the last competition entry - Raul Ruiz's 'Three Lives And Only  One Death' - was one of the best and most accessible of this merrily intellectual Chilean  director's many movies. Typically, Ruiz says it's an attempt at structural cubism, which sounds  difficult but proves great fun as Marcello Mastroianni, playing an old man with multiple  personalities, weaves in and out of what in the end proves to be the same story. <p> <p>There  were, of course, disappointments, like 'Sunchaser', the first Michael Cimino film for six  years. This stars Woody Harrelson as a driven and ambitious cancer specialist who is kidnapped  by a dying young convict and taken on a trip across America to find a mystical healing lake.  Unfortunately a cliched script turns the story into just another over-sentimental road movie.  <p> <p>At least Danny Boyle's 'Trainspotting', presented out of competition, made its mark.  It's been sold all over the world and the Americans are already calling it 'Britain's Pulp  Fiction'. Even the visiting Virginia Bottomley liked it, saying that anybody who thought it was  in favour of the drug culture must be mad. Had it been in competition, it would surely have got  a prize. <p> <p>All the other sections had their successes: Mary Harron's intelligent and  striking 'I Shot Andy Warhol'; Terry George's 'Some Mother's Son', about the hunger strikes of  Bobby Sands and others in 1981; Peter Greenaway's clever 'The Pillow Book'; Al Pacino's lively  'Looking For Richard', described as a meditation on Shakespeare's 'Richard III'; and the  beautiful Iranian, 'Gabbeh', each receiving much praise in the Un Certain Regard section. Among  the highlights of the Directors' Fortnight were John Sayles's powerful Texan racial drama,  'Lone Star', and the two British entrants - Michael Winterbottom's 'Jude', an adaptation of the  Thomas Hardy novel that's more like Truffaut's 'Jules et Jim' than a James Ivory film, and  Hettie Macdonald's 'Beautiful Thing', a gay romance set on a council estate, which received a  standing ovation. <p> <p>Above all, there was Sergei Bodrov's 'Prisoner of the Caucasus', a  dramatic tale of the disastrous Chechen conflict which managed to be both dramatic and very  even-handed in approach. This won the International Critics Prize for films outside the  competition and well deserved its accolade. Most of these films will arrive in Britain,  probably later rather than sooner, together with Angelica Huston's striking if uneven debut  about child abuse, 'Bastard Out of Carolina' - after Cronenberg's 'Crash' and 'Trainspotting',  probably the most controversial film at Cannes. Huston's film has already been taken off the  American television schedules, largely for its depiction of a terrible child rape, but should  have little trouble in the cinemas in Britain, since it is clearly totally sincere. <p> <p>Next  year, the festival celebrates its 50th birthday, which is bound to pull in the stars. Let's  just hope that the films in 1997 are as good as those of 1996. <p> <p> <p> <p><b>The  ones who won...</b> <p> <p>Palme d'Or: 'Secrets and Lies' (Mike Leigh, UK) <br>Grand Prix:  'Breaking the Waves' (Lars von Trier, Denmark) <br>Best Director: Joel Coen (Fargo, US) <br>Best Actress: Brenda Blethyn, 'Secrets and Lies' (Mike Leigh, UK) Best Actor: Daniel Auteuil  and Pascal Duquenne, 'The Eighth Day' (Jaco Van Dormael, Belgium) <br>Best Screenplay: Alain  le Henry and Jacques Audiard, 'Un Heros Tres Discret' (Audiard, France) <br>Jury Prize:  'Crash' (David Cronenberg, Canada) <br>Camera d'Or (best new film): 'Love Serenade' (Shirley  Barrett, Australia) International Critics' Prize: 'Secrets and Lies' (Mike Leigh, UK) <p>  <p><b>And the ones who should have won</b> <p> <p>Palme d'Or: 'Secrets and Lies' (Mike Leigh, UK) <br>Grand Prix: 'Breaking the Waves' (Lars von Trier, Denmark) <br>Best Director: Robert  Altman ('Kansas City' and his career) <br>Best Actress: Emily Watson, 'Breaking the Waves'  (Lars von Trier, Denmark) Best Actor: Mathieu Kassovitz, 'A Self-Made Hero' (Jacques Audiard,  France) Jury Prize: 'Goodbye South, Goodbye' (Hou Hsiao-hsien, Taiwan) and 'Three Lives And  Only One Death' (Raul Ruiz, France) <br>Camera d'Or: Hettie Macdonald, 'Beautiful Thing' (UK)  <p> <p> <p> <p> <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td  width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td  width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td  width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td  width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE  height=30 width=400 border=0><tr> <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A  HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td> <td  align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td> <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

 <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Jonathan Romney</b><br><br>      <p> <p>'Secrets and Lies'    <br>Director: Mike Leigh    <br>With Brenda Blethyn, Timothy Spall, Marianne Jean-Baptiste    <br>140 mins, cert 15 <p> <p>Collecting his Palme d'Or in Cannes, Mike Leigh hoped that his  success would help people who wanted to make films about "real life - love and passion and  caring and all the things that matter". Let's hope Hollywood doesn't get hold of that recipe -  it sounds like the cue for a thousand remakes of 'Terms Of Endearment'. <p> <p>Mike Leigh,  though, is one of the few directors who can convincingly deliver such a formula, and for giving  a sense of everyday Britain, in all its rich awfulness and banality, 'Secrets and Lies' is  nothing short of miraculous. I say this as someone who hasn't always been convinced by Leigh's  films in the past. Either they felt (to use that weary truism) 'televisual'; or like 'Naked'  they had one or two brilliant performances adrift among an uneven array of understatement and  wayward mugging. <p> <p>Secrets and Lies is the first Leigh film in which all the performances  absolutely gel with the world portrayed, from the leads down to a multiplicity of bit parts,  sometimes lasting only a few seconds. They walk an extraordinary tight-rope - they're  self-evidently tour de force performances, and yet you believe in them as real people. The  characters in this film are nearly all acting anyway, all trying to keep their world  functioning, to cover up its cracks and lacks. <p> <p>The only person here who's relatively  clear-sighted is, appropriately enough, an optometrist - Hortense (Marianne Jean-Baptiste), a  young black woman who, now that her adoptive parents are dead, sets out to trace her biological  mother. To her surprise, she turns out to be white - factory worker Cynthia (Brenda Blethyn), a  trembling wreck whose life has collapsed in a wash of drink and disappointment. She can't get  any joy of her pugnacious daughter Roxanne (Claire Rushbrook), and sees nothing of her brother  Maurice (Timothy Spall), who's slogged his way to success as a photographer. Maurice himself  has a chilly relationship with his wife Monica (Phyllis Logan), whose frustrations take refuge  in houseproud obsessiveness. One of the pleasures, as ever in his films, is the way Leigh 'gets  it right', pinning down all the nuances of behaviour and decor that immediately locate a  character socially and emotionally. This is also what most irritates about his work - it's a  device that can easily lead to caricature. But here every detail seems exactly right - even  of-the-moment trivia like an 'X-Files' t-shirt and a 'Barb Wire' poster - and the linguistic  touches are acute as ever. <p> <p>Leigh doesn't opt for the glib worlds-in-collision racial  drama that Lawrence Kasdan gave us in 'Grand Canyon'. Although Hortense's black family and  friends figure briefly, Leigh sticks to the white British discomfort that he knows, and makes  Hortense our guide to its mysteries. Her meetings with Cynthia, at first tentative, later quite  electric with mutual need, manage to be at once richly comic and quite harrowing. <p> <p>Brenda  Blethyn's Cynthia is a terrifying image of how life can accustom itself to a lack, her hollow,  blasted cheer a sort of emotional Blitz spirit in the face of lovelessness. All twitching and  red skin, Blethyn's nerve-end performance goes way beyond the one-liners and mannerisms, all  the 'Allo, sweetheart' business. It's a rather painful pleasure to watch her interact with  Hortense, the woman who can handle life a lot better than her but never had to handle anyone  like this. Jean-Baptiste's easy breeziness, her amused, affectionate grins at Cynthia's  malopropisms, suggest a vast range of confused feeling. <p> <p>Cynthia may hold the centre of  the film, but all the performances are fully fleshed, even the sketchy cameos of the people  Maurice photographs. There are three wonderful walk-on parts - Emma Amos as a scarred beauty,  Ron Cook as an embittered photographer, and Lesley Manville's harassed social worker,  believable down to the last nervy flick of her hair. Everyone knows how intensely contrived the  performances are in the Leigh method, but it's a revelation how this ensemble breathes  together. Towards the end, in a long scene of lunch on the patio, the trivial, nervous table  talk just cascades, line over line: it seems as if it's just happening, but the actors must  have gone through hell to perfect what looks like casual telepathy. This is also, in an oblique  way, the first Mike Leigh film that's partly about film-making. Maurice, after all, is a  director of the Leigh school, standing behind the camera and painstakingly coaxing ideal  split-second performances - a single smile - out of his subjects. And Maurice's house, perfect  in its suburban tweeness, is an empty film set waiting for some awful action to happen. His  haggard bluffness may be undemonstrative, but Timothy Spall gives a great performance as a man  subsiding under his own weight of unstated emotion and dog-tired of holding everyone else's  lives together. <p> <p>Hilarious and gruelling by turn, 'Secrets and Lies' proves that a film  can have a big heart and a harsh edge, and that the British suburban landscape at its most  mundane is a fascinating terrain that our cinema has hardly begun to explore. There aren't many  people apart from Leigh who can do Britain this way; but when he does, it's like a land mine  planted in the heart of sitcom land. <p> <p> <p> <p> <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr> <td  width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td  width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td  width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td  width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr> <td align=left  valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td> <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A  HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td> <td align=right  valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td> </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Sir Hugh Annesley announces retirement</b><br><br><br><b><h2>22 May 1996</h2></b><br><h2>RUC chief steps down after seven years</h2><h3>Top man says he felt duty bound to remain in job for two years longer than intended  </h2>
  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>David Sharrock</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>The RUC chief constable, Sir Hugh Annesley, announced yesterday that he is retiring in November after seven years in the job.  <p>  <p>Sir Hugh said he had intended to serve for five years. "In the middle of 1994, however, a ceasefire was imminent and I felt a clear duty, and a personal desire, to remain to steer the force through that difficult period." It was now time for a fresh pair of hands to lead the RUC into the next century.  <p>  <p>Sir Hugh leaves at a crucial moment for the force and Northern Ireland, as the RUC readies itself for the most sweeping changes since the onset of the troubles necessitated a shift towards military-style policing. A fundamental internal review is near publication, but implementation of its proposals is unlikely in the event of renewed paramilitary violence. Sir Hugh said: "The RUC is, in my view, a quite outstanding police service. Courageous, adaptable and committed, it has made a huge contribution to the stability of this province and to the well-being of all who reside here. Despite the challenges and difficulties throughout my time, it has been an absolute privilege and honour to lead this fine organisation." His replacement - who will be appointed by the Police Authority for Northern Ireland subject to the Northern Ireland Secretary's approval - is likely to be one of his two deputies, Ulstermen Blair Wallace<SUP>1</SUP> or Ronnie Flanagan<SUP>2</SUP>. The latter enjoys a relatively high public profile, and his future may be determined by how he handles this summer's marching season.  <p>  <p>Sir Hugh was born in 1939 into a wealthy Dublin Protestant family. In 1958 he joined the Metropolitan police, fulfilling a boyhood ambition. He commanded virtually every major branch in the Met and Sussex forces, including specialist operations liaising with the RUC on anti-terrorist work.  <p>  <p>He arrived in Ulster in the tense summer of 1989, scoring an immediate propaganda success by walking the length of the nationalist Falls Road at the head of a republican march. But the police authority had wanted someone else, so did the Northern Ireland Office and Sir Hugh emerged as the unhappy compromise.  <p>  <p>He was unfairly nicknamed 'the eternal flame' because, according to his critics, he never goes out. Last year, the Ulster Unionist security spokesman, Ken Maginnis, pointedly asked in the Commons how many nights Sir Hugh had spent in the province.  <p>  <p>Sir Hugh fought off legal attempts to have the Stalker report into shoot-to-kill allegations published. He will be remembered as a sturdy defender of his force, successfully suing Channel 4 when it broadcast a programme which alleged RUC officers were helping to target and murder IRA suspects.  <p>  <p>His policy was to contain terrorism, not to attempt to eradicate it, believing a political settlement was the only real solution to the province's problems.  <p>  <p>He said yesterday that draconian security measures such as internment did not work. "In my view internment may have been a short-term palliative but it would never have been a long-term solution."  <p>  <p>Sir Hugh said he believed the Shankill and Greysteel massacres in 1993 were a turning point and the terms of the IRA ceasefire - a 'complete' cessation - almost a year later had been more than had been expected at the time. "The ceasefire had become almost inevitable. I had always said that on balance I thought it would hold. It was a unanimous view of the intelligence community. But that was always subject to how the political developments would run and when they ran into some difficulties the balanced scenario shifted."  <p>  <p>He had been surprised by the timing of the breakdown of the ceasefire and was not sure it could be restored in time for the June all-party talks. "If [the IRA] have any sense and if they are looking to the future they will call the ceasefire... because if they do not they will remain on the outside looking in."  <p>  <p>Sir Hugh is thought to be privately critical of the Government's handling of the ceasefire, judging its emphasis on the decommissioning of weapons to have no practical benefit.  <p>  <p>His last annual report this year recorded a near-absence of paramilitary activity, falling crime and the number of Catholics applying to join the RUC - an overwhelmingly Protestant force - up by 20 per cent.  <p>  <p>1.

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Report finds Royal Fine Art Commission costs taxpayer 800,000 </b><br><br><br><b><h2>22 May 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Former minister discovers the fine art of living like a lord - at a total cost of 800,000 to the taxpayer  </h2>
  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Dan Glaister</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>It is one of the most exclusive clubs in the country. It pays &#163;280,000 a year in rent, its chairman spends &#163;29,000 a year on car hire, and it produces a glossy annual brochure at a cost of &#163;10,800. Yet, despite appearances, the Royal Fine Art Commission is not a club but 'the ultimate authority for consultation on matters of taste and aesthetics', according to its remit.  <p>  <p>Yesterday that taste came under withering attack with the publication of a Department of National Heritage report, commissioned by the former heritage secretary, Stephen Dorrell, in March 1994. It puts the overall cost of the commission to the taxpayer at &#163;800,000 per year. The commission exists to advise the Government on architectural projects.  <p>  <p>The report, by former civil servant Sir Geoffrey Chipperfield, condemns the lavish style of the commission's chairman, Lord St John of Fawsley, former Conservative arts minister Norman St John-Stevas.  <p>  <p>When not enjoying the attention of his two deputy secretaries, three secretaries, a part-time public relations assistant and his driver, Lord St John, according to Who's Who, is also a member of several bona fide London clubs, including White's, the Garrick, Pratt's, the Arts club, Grillions and The Other.  <p>  <p>The report was completed in the summer of 1994, but has been doing the round of government departments as they attempt to co-ordinate their responses. It had been thought that the delay was to allow Lord St John time to reach the end of his second five-year term before bowing out gracefully. But two weeks ago he was granted a third term of office on the recommendation of ministers.  <p>  <p>Mr Chipperfield singles out the commission's &#163;280,000 accommodation charges in his report, saying: "While these are no doubt reasonable for a building of the size and character of 7, St James's Square, I have questioned the need for accommodation as impressive as this house provides." There are 18 unelected commissioners, including Lord St John. They include architects, planners and designers, ranging from Giles Worsley, editor of Prince Charles's favourite architecture magazine, to property developer Stuart Lipton, traditionalist architect Quinlan Terry and the more modernist Ian Ritchie.  <p>  <p>The full-colour annual report introduced by Lord St John to replace a black and white document has been described as a 'taxpayer-funded version of 'Hello!' magazine'. It includes photographs of Lord St John with royalty and politicians, and contains approving reports on architecture commissioned by Lord St John.  <p>  <p>The Chipperfield report says: "The commission should, as in all things, consider whether the annual report could be produced more economically." The most recent controversy followed Lord St John's condemnation of the proposed 500ft Millennium ferris wheel on London's South Bank. Despite the plan's approval by leading architects, including Sir Richard Rogers and Sir Norman Foster, he dismissed it as "wholly unsuitable" and was reportedly rude to the architects concerned at a meeting.  <p>  <p>This led to an apology from the then secretary of the commission, Sherban Cantacuzino, who wrote to the architects saying: "I am sure that he enjoys putting people down, all of us have suffered from his bullying." David Marks, one of the architects behind the ferris wheel, said yesterday: "It is a reflection of the quality of its membership and chairman rather than the institution. As a concept it is quite a good idea." Lord St John was unavailable for comment yesterday. In a statement, however, the commission, established in 1924, welcomed the report's 'helpful recommendations'.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Alan Travis</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>Britain's most senior judge, Lord Taylor, will today launch his most comprehensive onslaught yet on the Home Secretary's new sentencing proposals by warning that they sacrifice justice and are based upon tainted statistics.  <p>  <p>The attack by the Lord Chief Justice, Lord Taylor of Gosforth, who is leaving the post because of illness, marks the deepest breach yet in the constitutional clash between the judiciary and Michael Howard since the Home Secretary unveiled the outlines of his new law and order package at last October's Conservative Party conference.  <p>  <p>Lord Taylor will be backed by a battery of senior judicial figures and former Conservative cabinet ministers when he makes his valedictory attack on the US-style 'three strikes and you're out' minimum sentencing package in a House of Lords debate today.  <p>  <p>Lord Taylor, in an article in the Times, says the Government's criticism of the sentencing record of the courts is wholly unjustified and that the evidence cited by Mr Howard misrepresents the true position. The introduction of minimum sentences of three years for third-time burglars and seven years for third-time drug dealers will 'ratchet up' prison terms for violent criminals as well, and possibly all other prison sentences. It will sharply increase the prison population, above the official forecast of another 10,800.  <p>  <p>His criticism follows a growing chorus of similar warnings from experts, most recently from the new director-general of the Prison Service, Richard Tilt.  <p>  <p>Lord Taylor says that he sees "no merit in adopting a macho attitude regardless of its efficacy" and warns that "certainty in sentencing can only be achieved by sacrificing justice".  <p>  <p>He warns Mr Howard to heed the "humiliating fiasco" which surrounded the 1991 Criminal Justice Act "which collapsed under the weight of its own contradictions". The Government's White Paper, Protecting the Public, published in April, suggests ministers have learned no lessons, he says. Key parts of the 1991 act, including the discredited unit fines system and not taking previous convictions into account when sentencing, were repealed within three years. The Act's underlying presumption of developing alternatives to custody was overturned.  <p>  <p>Lord Taylor goes on to launch a fierce attack on the factual foundations of Mr Howard's policy. The Government's figures showing little difference between average jail sentences for first-time burglars of 16 months and the 19 months handed down third-time offenders are based on flawed evidence, he says.  <p>  <p>The figures quoted in the White Paper were based on a sample of unpublished cases which the courts dealt with in 1993 and 1994. Lord Taylor points out that some of these related to the period when judges where forbidden to take account of previous convictions when sentencing.  <p>  <p>"For the Government to criticise the judiciary for lenient sentencing when they were prevented from taking previous convictions into account by statute is wholly unjustifiable," he writes.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Michael Howard criticised in House of Lords debate by Lord Taylor </b><br><br><br><b><h2>24 May 1996</h2></b><br><h2>"A perversion of justice"  </h2>
  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Alan Travis</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>The Tory Establishment combined last night with Britain's most senior judges to launch a persistent and devastating attack on Michael Howard, sealing his reputation as Britain's worst home secretary for nearly 40 years. The unprecedented onslaught yesterday from the legal establishment was led by the retiring Lord Chief Justice, Lord Taylor, and was combined with accusations of his betrayal of 12 years of Conservative policies by former Tory ministers.  <p>  <p>The three and a half hour attack in the House of Lords marked the day that the Establishment made plain it would no longer tolerate a shameless Home Secretary whose three years in office have been marked by repeated prison fiascos, US-style authoritarian penal policies, and repeated defeats in the courts.  <p>  <p>Not since Henry Brooke in the 1950s, whose repeated blunders over capital punishment and prison escapes led to his defeat at a general election, has there been a home secretary whose policies have provoked such widespread criticism within and without the criminal justice system.  <p>  <p>Mr Howard's refusal to apologise or change course - on display again last night - further underlined the knowledge that John Major cannot sack him without opening up an internal party dispute which would threaten to engulf the Government. Mr Major, at a Police Bravery Awards dinner in London last night, defended Mr Howard. "Michael and I have decided to introduce a regime of tougher sentences to make sure that when a criminal is locked up he stays locked up." The sustained onslaught in the House of Lords centred on Mr Howard's white paper proposing the introduction of a US-style 'three strikes and you're out' law and order package. Lord Williams of Mostyn, former chairman of the Bar Council, said: "It is a perversion of justice." The valedictory speech from Lord Taylor, who is seriously ill, gave a clear warning to Mr Howard that he faces huge difficulties in getting his flagship law and order bill on to the statute book before the general election. The Lord Chancellor, Lord Mackay, tried to defend the home secretary's policy last night, saying it was justified by public opinion. But he admitted that "some 25 or 30 letters" from the public since the white paper was published in April "divided almost equally between those who support the proposals and those who find fault".  <p>  <p>Mr Howard, who believes the policy remains a vote winner, was unabashed. He admitted he was limiting the discretion of the courts but said the judges were being soft.  <p>  <p>"My over-riding responsibility is to give the ordinary citizens the protection they need and deserve from the actions of some of the most dangerous and persistent criminals. I do not believe they are getting that protection from the courts," he said.  <p>  <p>Lord Taylor said he had decided to stage the special House of Lords debate despite his illness because he believed "it was important for me, while still holding the office of Lord Chief Justice, to inform the House directly of the very grave consequences" of the Home Secretary's package. His successor will be announced today.  <p>  <p>The introduction of mandatory minimum sentences for repeat burglars and drug dealers "quite simply must involve a denial of justice". It amounted to the jettisoning of government policy spelled out five years ago which rejected minimum sentences as they would result in more guilty people going free. That policy was "self-evidently wise, fair and just" and he went on to ask "why every one of those propositions of government policy so recently propounded is now to be jettisoned and replaced by its exact opposite?" The package was based on inadequate research: "Never in the history of our criminal law have such far-reaching proposals been put forward on the strength of such flimsy and dubious evidence.  <p>  <p>"The shallow and untested figures in the white paper do not describe fairly and clearly the problems the Government seeks to address - still less do they justify the radical 'solutions' it proposes.  <p>  <p>"Judges need the ability to tailor the sentence to the offence - to make the punishment fit the crime. It cannot be right for sentences to be passed without regard to the gravity, frequency, consequences or other circumstances of the offending."  <p>  <p>The real public concern about the risks of releasing a tiny minority of dangerous criminals could be better met by other ways of assessing their risk to the public.  <p>  <p>The Lord Chief Justice found support from every corner of the House of Lords with the former Master of the Rolls, Lord Donaldson, arguing that Mr Howard's white paper demonstrated an unprecedented and deplorable message from the Government to the public not to trust the judges.  <p>  <p>Former Tory cabinet ministers, the chairman of the Criminal Injuries Compensation Board, the president of Victim Support and former and current chairmen of the Parole Board gave similar acerbic warnings of the devastating consequences on crime, on the prison population and on the criminal justice of the introduction of Mr Howard's package. Lord Carr, former Tory home secretary, went further and felt the Home Secretary owed Parliament and the country a personal explanation. His package overturned the policies announced in 1990 of a Conservative government in which Mr Howard had served.  <p>  <p>"I do not believe the Government, on such a vital matter, can just go into reverse like this without explaining to us in Parliament and to the public as a whole, very much more deeply... why they were wrong, not just a little bit wrong, but fundamentally wrong, six years ago and are now fundamentally right."  <p>    <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Jaymee Bowen, Child B, loses fight  against leukaemia</b><br><br><br><b><h2>23 May 1996</h2></b><br><h2>When rights collide -  Jaymee's to fight, the NHS's to resist  </h2>
 <br><b>Leading article</b><br><br>      <p>Fulsome and eloquent tributes were rightly paid yesterday to the courage and spirit of  Jaymee Bowen, the schoolgirl refused further NHS treatment for leukaemia, who lived for another  year partly because of experimental palliative treatment bought privately thanks to an  anonymous donor. She had an indomitable spirit, which all those who watched her on BBC Panorama  quickly observed. In her words: "I would rather go through life struggling to live than do  nothing and die. I say never give up." She was true to her word. Given only eight weeks to  live, she survived for more than a year. But tributes, rather than brickbats, also need to be  paid to the Cambridge and Huntingdon Health Commission, the authority which took the decision  to stop further treatment. <p> <p>Asked what she thought about the authority, Jaymee said she  would like to meet the chief executive, Stephen Thornton, and "whack him one". Perfectly  understandable. There should be no criticism of Jaymee, or her father, fighting for every bit  of available treatment no matter how remote the chance of success. But health authorities have  to be more impartial. The &#163;75,000 which a second bone-marrow operation for Jaymee would  have cost would also have been &#163;75,000 less for other patients. The decision which they  took was based on medical advice, which found the chances of Jaymee recovering from a second  bone-transplant were virtually nil - a clinical decision which was upheld by two of the  nation's top hospitals, the Royal Marsden and the Hammersmith, to which her father turned. It  was only a private doctor, with no background in children's cancer, who thought it might work  and then he changed his mind. <p>  <p>Her extra year needs to be celebrated, but the Cambridge  authority needs protecting from castigation too. Yesterday one of its critics, Professor John  Goldman, suggested Jaymee should have been treated differently because of her lust for life.  Implicitly this already happens in the NHS, but to turn it into a concrete principle would be  to make the already tough and troublesome task of rationing NHS resources into a nightmare. It  is bad enough trying to measure clinical need, likely effectiveness, and cost in the task of  Solomon which health authorities are required to undergo, but Prof Goldman would only make the  distribution of resources an even more jesuitical operation. Imagine trying to measure people's  spirit as well as their physical condition. <p> <p>Rationing is as old as the NHS. It has been  carried out implicitly (queues, waiting lists, waiting times) and explicitly, though always  until recently in a covert manner: elderly people denied access to intensive care, alcoholics  denied liver transplants. Now, under the restructured NHS, these decisions have become much  more overt. This should be welcomed, not least because it could generate more resources for the  under-funded service. What is wrong is the lack of a national framework. Ministers have pushed  rationing down to local health authorities - so that they take the blame for unpopular  decisions - but then intervene when local services begin to diverge to insist there must be  national minimum standards. There must, but the only people able to set them are the very same  ministers who are refusing to do so. It is no use the Health Secretary interfering in an ad hoc  manner. Recently, for example, he insisted health authorities should not ban the use of a new  controversial drug for multiple sclerosis which costs &#163;10,000 per patient. But one-off  interventions don't work. What is needed is a coherent and comprehensive framework. Ministers  must come out of their bunkers. <p> <p> <p> <p> <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr> <td  width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td  width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td  width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td  width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr> <td align=left  valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td> <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A  HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td> <td align=right  valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td> </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Jaymee Bowen, Child B, loses fight against leukaemia</b><br><br><br><b><h2>23 May 1996</h2></b><br><h2>"Never give up unless you are just on the last little drop of life you have in you"</h2><h3>Her name was Jaymee Bowen, but she will probably always be remembered as Child B</h2>  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Edward Pilkington</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>At 9.40pm on Tuesday night, while much of the nation was watching the latest episode of 'Murder One', a drama of a different sort was reaching its conclusion. A girl aged 11 was letting go after a six-year fight. Her name was Jaymee Bowen, but she will probably always be remembered as Child B. And that pseudonym will probably always be seen as a symbol of a youthful determination to live.  <p>  <p>The name was imposed by the courts in an attempt to preserve her anonymity and allow her to lead as normal an existence as she could for the little time she had left. The plan failed - Jaymee's life was not normal. It wasn't just that she threatened to whack an NHS executive after he refused to pay for further treatment for the leukaemia that was killing her. Nor that she prompted deep soul-searching within the health service over its approach to patients diagnosed as terminally ill.  <p>  <p>It was that in the face of repeated radiation treatment and courses of chemotherapy, with their horrible side-effects, she fought so patiently, for so long, and so hard.  <p>  <p>She got close to making it. A month ago observers were speculating that if she lasted another six months her chances of long-term survival were good. Then last week she began to experience breathing difficulties and was admitted to Brompton Hospital, central London. Later she was transferred to the Portland Hospital for further tests.  <p>  <p>They revealed that myeloid leukaemia had relapsed and her condition was deteriorating fast. On Tuesday afternoon she was conscious and chatting happily; by the evening she had developed bleeding on the brain, slipped into unconsciousness and died.  <p>  <p>On the face of it, the death of Jaymee Bowen supports the contention of NHS doctors that extra treatment would have been pointless. In January, after an earlier bone marrow transplant had failed to stem the cancer, they decided that a second such operation would serve no useful purpose and would merely put her through unjustified pain from intense radiation doses and chemotherapy.  <p>  <p>There was no gloating by the NHS yesterday that its prediction had come true. "Today is not a day for us to have any sense of vindication. This is a day for grieving; it is a desperately sad day," said Stephen Thornton, whose title is chief executive of Cambridge and Huntingdon Health Commission but who will be remembered as the bureaucrat Jaymee threatened to whack. Vindication aside, he added that he stood by the commission's stance. "If the question is, 'do we feel the decision not to fund the second operation was the right one?' then the answer is yes. We feel that decision was right."  <p>  <p>In the black and white world of tabloid newspaper journalism, that decision was lambasted as a callous choice of accountancy over human compassion. To save &#163;75,000 the NHS was sacrificing the chance to prolong a young girl's life.  <p>  <p>It made great copy, and the column inches and gushing prose ran and ran. "Girl sentenced to die by the NHS," blared the Daily Mirror. "What value is put on a child's life?" pontificated the Daily Telegraph.  <p>  <p>But it was never quite that simple. The NHS did agree to pay the full cost of Jaymee's care in the private sector over the past nine months, supporting the therapeutic relationship she had built up with her Harley Street consultant, Dr Peter Gravett.  <p>  <p>Jaymee's NHS doctors concluded that the probabilities of her benefiting from a second bone marrow transplant didn't stack up. "We never at any time said we would not pay for her care, but it was not the right thing to do," Mr Thornton said.  <p>  <p>Logically, the NHS line was coherent. Given the constraints of health service funding, it was deemed better value for money to invest &#163;75,000 on the well-being of many rather than on a high-risk, pain-inflicting attempt to save a dying girl.  <p>  <p>But in this case the health service greatly underestimated one factor in its logical equation. It might not make sense to spend &#163;75,000 on what was medically deemed a lost cause. But it does if it is your own life at stake - more so if it's that of your child. As Mr Justice Law, the High Court judge who first deliberated on the Child B case, put it: "To anyone confronting the prospect of extinction in a few weeks, such a chance of longer survival must be unimaginably precious."  <p>  <p>In Jaymee Bowen and her father, David, the NHS had met a formidable duo. David, aged 32, a divorced computer engineer from Sawbridgeworth, Hertfordshire, was born in Georgetown, Guyana, moving to this country with his parents when he was five.  <p>  <p>Jaymee, born on August 5, 1984, was his oldest child. "Jaymee has always had a special place in my heart because she was my first child and I think there's a different bond between you and your first-born," he told Sarah Barclay, a Panorama reporter who has written a book on the Child B story. Father perceived daughter as the flagship of the family and was fiercely proud of her spirited independence. "You get your fingers burned with Jaymee if you upset her; she has a very analytical mind, very inquiring, very probing."  <p>  <p>She lived up to her reputation in October last year when she commented for the first time on her battle. "I say never give up, unless you are just on the last little drop of life you have in you. Never give up." Asked what she would do if Mr Thornton were in the room with her, she replied: "I wouldn't sit there and say anything; I would go over and whack him one." The earliest signs of her illness were spotted in December 1989, when Jaymee was five. She developed a swelling on her left cheek that grew into a lump the size of a golf ball. Her doctor diagnosed mumps. It was almost a year before cancer was diagnosed.  <p>  <p>It is an acute irony that when she first fell ill her father had a booming property business. On a whim he bought a new Rolls-Royce for &#163;90,000 in which he used to drive Jaymee to school.  <p>  <p>But soon after cancer was diagnosed, his firm foundered and he was made bankrupt. When he needed cash to pay for his daughter's treatment, none was at hand.  <p>  <p>In January 1995, when David Bowen was told by doctors his daughter had eight weeks to live, he refused to accept it. "I will walk over anything and anyone," he told Sarah Barclay. "I'll continue like a machine - I won't eat, I won't sleep. I will achieve the task. That's the way I am." He spent his time scouring medical tomes and contacting specialists in America. After a month of striving he was put in touch with Professor John Goldman of Hammersmith hospital.  <p>  <p>If Jaymee could survive chemotherapy, Prof Goldman put her chances of longer-term survival at 10 per cent. "We are doctors, not robots," he said. "It's not appropriate to refuse treatment - you should always keep your options open."  <p>  <p>Having failed through the courts to force the NHS to fund a last-ditch attempt to save his child, Mr Bowen eventually received a gift for the &#163;75,000 from an unnamed donor. The money paid for treatment from Dr Peter Gravett, a private Harley Street haematologist who gave Jaymee a controversial second bone marrow and white cell transplant from her sister. The NHS dubbed the treatment 'experimental'; Dr Gravett called it "the most promising option around".  <p>  <p>Yesterday Dr Gravett said Jaymee had been given a year of relatively good health as a result of his care. "Conventional treatment would have allowed her a few more weeks. Is it worth &#163;6,000 a month to have an  <p>  <p>11-year-old girl running around for a year? The expenditure was justified." There is no way of finding a compromise between these polarised positions; no half-way ground. The logic of the NHS's position, its insistence that all that sensibly could have been done for Jaymee was done cannot be squared with David Bowen's desire to keep his child alive. This is the black hole where commonsense and the craving for existence collide.  <p>  <p>There is some comfort, perhaps, in Jaymee Bowen's death. Despite her seemingly insatiable yearning to cling on, it appears she had grown tired. "I can't face it any more really," she said to Sarah Barclay, adding she was now prepared to die. If there was an afterlife, she wanted to come back as a butterfly. "There's nothing to be scared of, and hopefully it won't be painful."  <p>  <p>It wasn't. Dr Gravett said she was in no discomfort at the end, and her family was at her bedside. As David Bowen emerged from Jaymee's room he said to the consultant: "Don't let anyone tell you that we failed." The funeral will be held in a few days' time. Cambridge and Huntingdon health commission are considering whether to send a representative.   <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Jaymee Bowen, Child B, loses fight against leukaemia</b><br><br><br><b><h2>29 May 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Farewell to Jaymee, the child who said "don't forget me"  </h2>
  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Nick Varley</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>A steel drum provided a fitting accompaniment. Like the girl at whose funeral it was played, it is more readily thought of as uplifting and lively, but yesterday it rang out a mournful lament to mark the death of Jaymee Bowen, aged 11, and said to be 'an example to all of us'. The last time the family and friends of the girl who will always be remembered as Child B enjoyed such sounds, their happiness was as deep as yesterday's sorrow at Croydon parish church, south London.  <p>  <p>At a special birthday party last year - a celebration her doctors once said she would not see - a rejuvenated Jaymee even showed family friend Aubrey Bryan how she thought he should play his drums.  The gathering in the back garden of the family home came a couple of months after the leukaemia which she had fought for six years was found to be in remission.  <p>  <p>Yesterday, a week after the disease returned to claim Jaymee, Aubrey played again - a piece specially written for her - in front of the 200 mourners. Sarah Barclay, the BBC reporter who spent six months preparing a 'Panorama' programme on the family's fight, told them Jaymee's one wish was to become an ordinary girl. But she added yesterday: "Even if you weren't ill, you couldn't have been just an ordinary girl.  <p>  <p>"Your words of courage made the nation sit up and listen. What words they were: 'I say never give up hope unless you are on the last little drop of life'."  <p>  <p>The most touching wreath was one in the shape of a butterfly. Jaymee said that if there was an afterlife she wanted to come back as a butterfly. The Reverend Colin Boswell told the congregation: "I think the worst thing that can happen to us is to lose a child. However, our lives are properly judged not by their length, but by what they contribute.  <p>  <p>"Her life gave many people courage and hope, hope in the life that perhaps they struggled with as they saw her struggle to find life and to find a way through that which is painful and difficult and hard.  She has been an example to us - not only to other children who are sick, but to all of us - an example of what it is to rise above pain and difficulty."  <p>  <p>That pain and difficulty came to a head in January last year when doctors said that Jaymee had eight weeks to live.  Her father David refused to accept the prognosis and found a private specialist prepared to try further treatment. He failed in a court battle to win NHS funding for it.  Only an anonymous gift of &#163;75,000 allowed Jaymee to undergo further operations and enjoy another year of life.  <p>  <p>As the service drew to a close and mourners filed past the open white coffin, Mr Bowen leaned over and kissed his daughter.

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Book by Social Affairs Unit says Britain is loutish and lacks good manners </b><br><br><br><b><h2>24 May 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Bad behavioural fallacies</h2><h3>Right-wingers can only scratch the surface of rudeness  </h2>
  <br><b>Leading article</b><br><br>      <p>Road rage is merely the latest manifestation. Noisy neighbours, about whom complaints have trebled in the last decade and whom the House of Lords also debated yesterday, are another. Other frequently cited examples include the spread of litter in the streets and of bad language on stage and screen. To many people, the evidence that Britain has become a ruder, cruder society seems all around them. Most adults are certain that manners and behaviour have got worse in their lifetime. Many young people think their elders are stressed about nothing. Yet a succession of critics including David Selbourne, Gertrude Himmelfarb and Amitai Etzioni continue to warn that without radical changes in moral codes and personal behaviour, civic order will crumble further.  <p>  <p>Yesterday the right-wing Social Affairs Unit added its own pack of worries to this mounting pile of anxiety. The contributors to 'Gentility Recalled' have targeted a range of real and not-so-real problems: loutishness in the streets, the spread of spitting, 'inappropriate' dress such as baseball caps (worn forwards as well as back), disrespectful behaviour towards the elderly, failing to act one's age, and that favourite of English men of a certain background - the decline of sportsmanship on the cricket field. It is not an intellectually impressive collection, and as an indictment of contemporary manners it is far inferior, for instance, to Mr Selbourne's 'The Spirit of the Age'.  <p>  <p>Yet there is no denying that the Social Affairs Unit is on to some genuine themes. Bad behaviour, in the broadest sense, is a real problem in contemporary society, not a phoney one. There is a need to remoralise the relations not just between generations, genders and within families but especially between strangers. Selfishness, denial of responsibility and aggression are genuine problems of the age. The language and the culture have been debased. Courtesy, deference and consideration for others ought to be valued not derided. Individuals do need to accept more responsibility for their behaviour towards others.  <p>  <p>The trouble with the Unit's approach is that it is obsessed with proving that all these troubles can be laid at the door of progressive liberalism. Their writers - like others down the ages - constantly hark back to a supposed golden age of manners and decency which never really existed. These ones try to blame everything on feminism, multi-culturalism and the wizened chestnut of political correctness. There is no place in their analysis for the cult of possessive individualism, greed, the Me Generation, dutiless rights, the privatisation of public duty and order - or even for the Murdoch press. The Social Affairs Unit have raised some real questions and provided some entertaining reading, but this old-hat, nostalgic fogeyism is a trivialising way of addressing the need to build a modern civic and moral culture in Britain.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Martin Wainwright</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>Presided over by the benign, sculpted figure of William Cobden, St Ann's Square in Manchester seemed a comprehensive reproof to the Social Affairs Unit yesterday. Britain's favourite word - sorry - was much in evidence as Mancunians politely skirted one another.  <p>  <p>But on closer inspection, the wisdom of the unit's advisory council proved somewhat less in doubt.  <p>  <p>"Yes, I'm afraid they're right, especially about my generation," said John Fitzgerald, aged 23, sporting Geldof stubble and a lanky ponytail. "Young people've got the idea that they'll only get on in life if they're more aggressive than the next guy."  <p>  <p>John's father, Roger, agreed with a muffled: "That's right" from behind the flower stall which the family has run for 101 years. "Two words have got forgotten," he said. "Please and thank you."  <p>  <p>Then 31-year-old David Anthony pottered up and used both words several times as he spent his weekly &#163;2.40 on freesias for his mum.  <p>  <p>Mrs Anthony was not the only Mancunian to benefit yesterday from the 'position of being a lady', which the Social Affairs Unit defined as an historic protection for women. Rachel McAllister, speeding back to the office, said: "I just winged a bloke with my carrier and he was about to eff and blind when he saw my skirt and long hair."  <p>  <p>But Mr Anthony said: "In the tram or bus, people rush for a seat and don't care about anyone else. Yes, we are getting more rude."  <p>  <p>As John Duffy, street-sweeper on the local beat for 25 years, trundled into view with his handcart, Roger Fitzgerald said: "I don't know what we're going to do when he retires on Saturday."  <p>  <p>Mr Duffy was cheerfully upbeat about 1990s Britons' ways with litter, saying Manchester's pavements were probably less fouled and paper-strewn than ever before. But he added: "I'm not so sure about the people."  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<h3>'Clumsy codes of correctness are no replacement for good manners'  </h2>
  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Gary Younge</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>Courtesy costs you nothing. But Britain is paying dearly for its persistent bad manners which are making everyday life "unpredictable, uneasy and unpleasant", according to a book published yesterday by a right-wing think tank. "Loutishness on the streets, slovenly and aggressive dress, swearing, cheating sportsmen, parents aping the style and slang of teenagers and a false chumminness from doctors and other professions point to a crisis in manners," said a spokesman for the independent Social Affairs Unit yesterday.  <p>  <p>The book, 'Gentility Recalled: Mere Manners and the Mankind of Social Order', comprises essays by 12 academics.  <p>  <p>The book claims that, "when it comes to civilizing men's treatment of women, the young's behaviour to the elderly or even smokers treatment of non-smokers, artificial and clumsy codes of political correctness are no replacement for old-fashioned good manners."  <p>  <p>"Leather jackets, studded leather boots, pierced noses and aggressive tattoos... are declarations of war, the war of the sexes, the generations, the classes, the war of all against all," claims Athena S Leoussi, a sociology lecturer at the University of Reading.  <p>  <p>Predictably, most of the blame lies at the door of the 1960s generation who have been passing their filthy habits down to their children. "Small wonder that the young are bad-mannered if the old do not act their age," writes Professor Anthony O'Hear of the University of Bradford.  <p>  <p>And when it is not predicting the society collapsing under the weight of its own foul-mouthed tearaways the authors are reminiscing about the good old days.  <p>  <p>"People of my generation well remember an age when the terms ladies and gentlemen were common usage," writes Rachel Trickett, former principal of St Hughes College, Oxford.

<!--INFOLINE--><b>American researchers find playing music helps raise maths standards </b><br><br><br><b><h2>25 May 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Musical pupils score notable maths success  </h2>
  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Donald Macleod</b><br><br>      <p><I>  <p>Brian May, guitarist of the rock group Queen, studied astrophysics at Imperial College, London, which now offers a physics/music performance degree with the Royal College of Music  <p>  <p>Courtney Pine, the leading British jazz saxophonist, according to his agent "can't count when it comes to recording budgets"  <p>  <p>Albert Einstein, was a violinist and played duets with the pianist Artur Rubinstein, who once exclaimed: "The trouble with you Albert is that you can't count"  <p>  <p>Galileo, the son of a musician, might have stayed out of trouble with the Inquisition had he taken up his father's trade</I>  <p>  <p>Playing music improves children's maths results, according to American researchers who put long-held theories of a link to the test. Their findings suggest recent drastic cuts in music tuition in schools are backfiring on ministers and school inspectors as they preach the need to raise standards of basic mathematics.  <p>  <p>Classes of five- to seven-year-olds given special music and arts lessons performed better in maths tests than control groups who were not. Eight out of 10 of the children given tuition in music and arts skills had started behind the control children when they were tested in kindergarten, but overtook them after seven months.  <p>  <p>The same effect was clear the following year, with the highest scores among children with two years' music and arts development, researchers found in Providence, Rhode Island.  <p>  <p>Once the children found playing music and doing visual arts was pleasurable they became motivated to acquire skills, reported Martin Gardiner and his colleagues in the journal 'Nature'.  <p>  <p>The children realised they could learn challenging skills and this improved their general attitude to learning and school. "Learning arts skills forces mental 'stretching' useful to other areas of learning."  <p>  <p>In England and Wales education authority music services have been cut back, but the picture is confused, said Richard Hickman, chief executive of the Federation of Music Services. In some areas the number of children learning instruments has held up or increased, but only because parents are paying more in fees, leading to fears that children from poor families are missing out on the chance to play music.  <p>  <p>Results of national curriculum tests at ages seven and 11 have shown clear links between poverty and the levels reached by children.  <p>  <p>George Odam, music education professor at Bath college of higher education, said the national curriculum had improved schools' awareness of art and music but teacher training in music was being cut to focus on the basics. Boys in cathedral schools performed better in all subjects even when they were not academic because they were learning music. "The left brain and right brain have to interact strongly together with a movement response in music. It is a very unusual activity," said Prof Odam.  <p>  <p>"But those that do give attention to the performance of music are places where something special happens."  <p>  <p>Claims that listening to Mozart improved spatial reasoning skills were tested earlier this year in Britain when 11,000 children in 250 schools were randomly split into three groups. One group listened to a Mozart quintet on Radio 3, one to pop music on Radio 1, and one to conversation on Radio 5 Live.  <p>  <p>In the tests of spatial reasoning the pop listeners scored 56 per cent compared with 52 per cent for the others.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>David Sharrock</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>Ireland's greatest living man of letters, to use Bob McCartney's phrase, was standing on the spot where Sir Edward Carson, Ulster's greatest hero, signed a Solemn Covenant pledging to oppose Home Rule by all means. Conor Cruise O'Brien didn't look all that impressed with the lavish interior of Belfast City Hall but he did admit: "I've come a long way to get here." The Cruiser, as friends and foes call him, once batted for the Irish Republic. Now he's a member of Mr McCartney's United Kingdom Unionist Party. If he is elected next Thursday in the Northern Ireland elections, the former Irish cabinet minister who faced Unionist leaders across the table at the 1974 Sunningdale negotiations will have completed an extraordinary journey. Facing him on June 10 will be his erstwhile compatriots as, this time around, he argues the Unionist case.  <p>  <p>But he hasn't been cold-shouldered by the Irish establishment for his act of heresy. "Such flak as has been forthcoming has been from people who disliked me before I was a unionist. I didn't expect them to stop!"  <p>  <p>Yesterday morning, as his wife, Maire, drove him up from their home on Howth Hill, north of Dublin, a petrol attendant at a border garage had wished him luck in his Northern Ireland campaign.  <p>  <p>It was a message he brought to Eric Smyth, Belfast's Lord Mayor and a Paisley follower. "I'm here to tell you that there are very few people in the Irish Republic who want to thrust a united Ireland upon you." Mr Smyth looked greatly relieved.  <p>  <p>Dr Cruise O'Brien says that his conversion began during the ill-fated Sunningdale talks. He still believes that what almost emerged from that experiment remains Northern Ireland's best hope for stability and peace. "I argued in cabinet that we shouldn't be emphasising the Council of Ireland and that the important thing was to get the cross-community executive which would be an absolutely historic achievement."  <p>  <p>He believes that his party leader and friend, Bob McCartney QC, the integrationist MP for North Down, is the inheritor of Brian Faulkner's legacy, an anti-sectarian brand of Unionism.  <p>  <p>"After Sunningdale I became the first member of an Irish government to say that I was not working for a united Ireland. That didn't make me a unionist all of a sudden but I did have a good deal of sympathy with them." But in the past three years, with the development of the relationship between the SDLP leader, John Hume, and Sinn Fein president, Gerry Adams, "and the rising influence of Sinn Fein in the politics of the republic I became very alarmed and still am at the direction that things are going." The Irish peace process was aimed at securing a united Ireland "against the known wish of the majority of the population of the province. I side with the unionists in resisting that project. I feel very much at home with the United Kingdom Unionists."  <p>  <p>After tea with the lord mayor he sauntered down Royal Avenue with Mr McCartney and his campaign team. The frail-looking 78-year-old politician, diplomat, newspaper editor and internationally recognised essayist swam into the view of two immaculately coiffed ladies.  <p>  <p>Deep in conversation, they paused as one said to the other: "Jesus Nora, that's Conor Cruise O'Brien!"  <p>  <p>"Ach, I wouldn't give him the light of day Mary, nobody likes a turncoat." "I know, but aren't you sick of hearing from all of them? Nora, I swear, if I see or hear one more politician I will throw up!"  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Elections to all-party talks held in Northern Ireland</b><br><br><br><b><h2>28 May 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Ulster parties exchange insults</h2><h3>Sinn Fein branded fascist in forum poll acrimony  </h2>
  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>David Sharrock</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>The Northern Ireland election campaign descended into acrimony yesterday with Unionists rounding on one another, and Sinn Fein labelled 'fascist and sectarian' by the Social Democratic and Labour Party.  <p>  <p>With three days to go before Northern Ireland votes for all-party negotiators and forum members, the Ulster Unionists launched a bitter attack on their rivals the Democratic Unionists, accusing them of undermining their common cause by backing an election system which will divide the pro-union vote among as many as 10 different parties.  <p>  <p>The Ulster Unionists had wanted a proportional representation system - the common method in Ulster - instead of the list system, under which voters vote for a party rather than a candidate. Party leader David Trimble said: "There's a serious danger because of this list system that's been foisted upon us as a result of an unholy alliance between Dr Paisley, (the DUP leader) and Mr Hume, (the SDLP leader)."  <p>  <p>But Ian Paisley immediately countered by accusing Mr Trimble's party of treachery for saying the 1920 Government of Ireland Act - which led to partition - was up for negotiation.  <p>  <p>"The split has come in Unionism because Mr Trimble and Mr Taylor have split away from traditional Unionist philosophy."  <p>  <p>Robert McCartney, UK Unionist MP for North Down, said the Ulster Unionists' failure to grasp an opportunity offered by him to forge a single pro-Union body for the purposes of the elections and thereby avoid the splintering of its vote, was evidence that they were rank amateurs. Mr Trimble had committed an "enormous error of judgment" in the first test of his leadership capabilities.  <p>  <p>In an interview to be broadcast tonight the SDLP MP for West Belfast, Joe Hendron, attacks Sinn Fein, which will be challenging him on Thursday. Dr Hendron, speaking on Irish television, says of Sinn Fein: "They make the odd comment about fellow Protestant Irishmen, but basically they are a sectarian, fascist organisation."  <p>  <p>He believes Gerry Adams is trying to get a permanent peace "but the problem about his organisation, be it Sinn Fein or IRA, is that I don't know who leads whom."  <p>  <p>The Northern Ireland Secretary, Sir Patrick Mayhew, will go to Dublin today to try to resolve differences with the Irish government over the decommissioning of paramilitary weapons once the talks begin. Yesterday senior republican Gerry Kelly said: "No doubt the IRA are watching this as much as any other people involved in this conflict, so let's see what sort of agenda is produced and what attitude is taken to Trimble and his threats, and we will take it from there."  <p>  <p>* Mary Robinson is to visit Britain next week, the first official visit by any Irish president.  <p>    <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>UK falls to 19th in  world competitiveness league</b><br><br><br><b><h2>28 May 1996</h2></b><br><h2>UK slides in  world league  </h2>
 <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Sarah Ryle</b><br><br>      <p> <p>John Major's ailing government last night sustained another pre-election body blow when  an exhaustive study revealed that Britain has been overtaken by Chile and Finland as 17 years  of Thatcherite economic medicine fails to stop the slide down the global competitiveness league  table. The United Kingdom fell from 15th to 19th place this year on the international  scoreboard, behind four other members of the Group of Seven major industrial nations - the  United States, Japan, Germany and Canada. Seven years ago, Britain held 11th place in the  league, according to the International Institute for Management Development's new 'World  Competitiveness Yearbook'. <p> <p>Most significantly for Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, as the  Labour Party seeks to persuade voters that its emphasis on education and training can make a  real difference to the economy, the international institute concludes that one of Britain's key  weaknesses is its failure to invest in training and re-training of workforce. <p> <p>On the  'people' criterion, Britain comes 27th out of 46 countries - compared with 18th in 1989. This  criterion is generally regarded as a significant pointer to long term growth potential. <p>  <p>The institute's claims will be hotly contested by ministers who are accustomed to  disparaging international reports which, they say, fail to acknowledge underlying improvements.  <p> <p>But, with Europe's economy as a whole again faltering, the Chancellor of the Exchequer,  Kenneth Clarke, is set to revise downwards his bullish three per cent growth forecast for 1996.  <p> <p>In the new study - which a rival report from the institute's former partner, the World  Economic Forum will challenge on Thursday - countries are ranked on hundreds of criteria  ranging from employment to public trust in bankers. Despite a relatively good score in some  sectors, including technology and telecommunications, Britain's weaker record on investment in  people held it back. <p> <p>In addition to slipping behind Luxembourg and Belgium in the past  year, Britain is now trailing many of the Asian 'Tiger' economies on a scoreboard which was  again headed by the United States. Yet Conservative ministers look to Asia and America for  inspiration - not to Europe with its Social Chapter costs. High-cost Germany and Switzerland  both fell four places to 10th and 9th, the institute says. Overall, China rose from 31st place  in 1995 to 26th, while Taiwan slipped from 14th to 18th. Russia was last (46th), while Latin  America's star economy, Chile, came 13th. <p> <p>Yesterday the director of the institute  report, Professor Stephane Garelli, said that despite reduced unemployment and improved  techonology and finance in Britain, "none of these successes seems to be sufficient to  constitute a global picture of competitiveness". <p> <p>Professor Garelli added: "This uneven  development, over a period of many years now, has caused Britain to have a lower standard of  living. Consequently, it has to reassess the viability of its social model and, ultimately, the  role of the state." <p> <p>Even Britain's traditional pride in its entrepreneurship suffered a  heavy blow as the institute reported that the country was placed only 23rd in the management  category this year. <p> <p>Coincidentally, in a separate report published today, the think-tank  Demos argued that the image of the 1980s entrepreneur 'young, white, male, swashbuckling and  using macho management styles', is outdated and potentially dangerous. <p> <p>The authors  called for a new approach to management based on employee motivation as the key to long-term  productivity. Last night's survey was the first to be published solely by the institute after  seven years when it was produced jointly with the influential Geneva-based World Economic  Forum. The latest findings provoked an immediate row between the two former partners over the  validity of the institute's research. Under the institute's new calculations, based on 225  criteria instead of 378, Britain did better last year, at 15th, than the joint survey recorded.  The joint World Competitiveness Report had placed the UK 18th in 1995. A spokeswoman for the  forum, whose competitiveness report is out on Thursday, said: "Our report is substantially  different," suggesting that the UK might not do as badly in its scoring this year, and is  likely to modestly improve its ranking. <p> <p>The institute warned that the diverse  performance of European Union member states could influence monetary union, as it reported that  smaller nations were beginning to outshine bigger countries like Germany - about which it is  also gloomy. <p> <p>"This trend will put severe constraints on the Maastricht objectives to  achieve unity, or will call for more flexible goals," Professor Garelli predicted. <p>   <p>

  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Erlend Clouston</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>The names of the 16 children and their teacher were read out to a crowded but silent chamber in Stirling's Albert Halls.  <p>  <p>In a firm voice, the Lord Advocate, Lord Mackay of Drumadoon, went at a measured pace through the list of victims of the gunman, Thomas Hamilton, whose suicide brought the deaths to 18. He then listed the 17 others injured in the gym of Dunblane primary school.  <p>  <p>Presiding over the inquiry was a judge, Lord Cullen. But the most important people were in the balcony above the chamber. Given the ordeal before them for possibly the next three months, it was surprising that so many relatives and friends of the victims turned up. But for the past 11 weeks they have had to tread a narrow path between shunning publicity and the need to discover the truth about 13 March.  <p>  <p>Lord Mackay told the inquiry that information about all the victims, including biographical details and post-mortem reports, were in three red folders. But the details inside would not be read out to respect the privacy of the families concerned. "As far as is humanly possible, the evidence will be given in a manner which protects the identity of the individual victims," said the Lord Advocate. If it became possible to identify any victim, he hoped the media would not publish their name.  <p>  <p>Some of the detail of the death of the gunman, Thomas Hamilton, would, however, be read out and discussed, said Lord Mackay.  <p>  <p>The chamber has been re-carpeted so no footfalls disturb the atmosphere of inquiry, exemplified by Lord Cullen's courteous voice.  <p>  <p>"Shall we begin again?" he asked at the start of the afternoon session. Oddly, the public had mainly stayed away. There were barely two dozen disinterested parties in the rows of seats shared with lesser legal representatives.  <p>  <p>The Scottish Office had gone out of its way to make the proceedings available to those who were curious. Thirteen TV monitors enabled everyone to inspect aerial photographs of the school. On an architect's drawings was shown the alcove where the injured staff, Mary Blake and Eileen Harrild, cowered, and where an unidentified boy had kept muttering: "What a bad man." More than 100 journalists are registered for the inquiry, and the Lord Advocate's questioning was piped into a pre-fabricated media centre erected at the back of the halls. Particulars of the suicide of the 'caucasian male' spilled out of the loudspeakers.  <p>  <p>"A fountain of blood followed the line of the bullet from the top of his head and sprayed in the same direction on to the floor behind him," a forensic scientist, Malcolm Chisholm, reported.  <p>  <p>In contrast, and in deference to the balcony, the deaths of his 17 victims were presented in as painless a way as possible. A pathologist, Anthony Busuttil, told the Lord Advocate that their wounds could be ranked from one to seven.  <p>  <p>"Am I right in understanding that some of the wounds were fatal, and some not fatal?" Lord Mackay pressed gently. In a low voice Professor Busuttil confirmed that he was.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Dunblane inquiry begins</b><br><br><br><b><h2>30 May 1996</h2></b><br><h2>"I was about to ask him what he wanted. I saw the gun and he started shooting"  </h2>
  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Erlend Clouston</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>"There was a period of time when everything seemed to be very quiet. It seemed to last a long time." Although nobody at the inquiry except Eileen Harrild, the part-time PE teacher, had heard the shots in the gym at Dunblane Primary, they reverberated then in their heads.  <p>  <p>Mary Blake, the supervisory assistant whose statement transfixed the opening day of Lord Cullen's investigation into the Dunblane massacre, had had a similar, hallucinatory experience, during the nightmare of 13 March. Describing the moment when 'the dark figure' was framed in the doorway of the gym, initially pumping a total of 105 bullets into primary one, she said: "The screaming seemed to be inside my head." She made the point twice in a statement that was read out on her behalf.  <p>  <p>The first day of the inquiry into Britain's worst murder case held some sinister revelations: the reported discovery of 63 pairs of boys' swimming trunks in Thomas Hamilton's home; the fact that he had cut the telephone line to the school before heading in with four guns and a total of 743 bullets.  <p>  <p>But the testimony of the two staff members brought the inquiry to the heart of the tragedy. One minute Mrs Harrild was laying out ropes and beams for the children; the next she was stumbling into the gym store, bullets in her chest and arms. One moment Mrs Blake was looking after her pupils; the next she was lying in a pool of her blood, trying to hide terrified youngsters under a gym mat.  <p>  <p>Mrs Harrild, aged 43, testified first. She told the inquiry she had dropped her own two children at the school then walked to the gym to arrange the equipment for Gwen Mayor's class. They had arrived shortly after 9.30am. Mrs Mayor had said that she hoped to be relieved "in a couple of minutes" by the assistant head teacher. Instead, the shape that came through the door was altogether different.  <p>  <p>"He had a woolly hat on and a gun in his left hand, extended," said Mrs Harrild. "He immediately began to shoot at us. I was within a few feet of him. I was about to ask him what he wanted. I looked and saw the gun and he started shooting at us."  <p>  <p>Unfalteringly, Mrs Harrild described how she stumbled, bleeding, towards the storage alcove set into the side wall of the gym. She did not see what Hamilton was doing behind her. "The shooting did not stop. It was continuous and very rapid."  <p>  <p>After Mrs Harrild had struggled into the alcove, she told the inquiry, she was joined by four wounded children and Mary Blake.  <p>  <p>In her statement, the supervisory assistant described how, after hearing a noise behind her, she turned round and saw "a dark figure" framed in the doorway. "He started firing. I think Mrs Mayor was on the floor. The children were screaming. I am not sure if he had a gun in both hands. I was hit and I realised something terrible was happening. He was pointing the gun all around and shooting. The screaming seemed to be inside my head." Both women told how Hamilton's fusillade continued, faltered briefly then picked up again at a slower rate as he proceeded up the hall. The women concentrated on stopping the children betraying to Hamilton the fact that he had six more targets just around the corner.  <p>  <p>Miraculously, the injured pupils' intuition signalled the gravity of their situation. "The children were amazingly calm," Mrs Harrild reported. Then, equally miraculous, Hamilton transferred his empty Browning pistol to his left hand, pulled out his Smith and Wesson, put the muzzle in his mouth and fired. The bullet, a ballistics expert revealed, went through his head, hit the ceiling and fell to the floor.  <p>  <p>Mrs Harrild spoke for 32 minutes; Mrs Blake's statement lasted 10. Mrs Harrild said she had received letters from Hamilton but did not know or recognise him. Mrs Blake had no idea who he was. She may be haunted by the words a little boy kept muttering in their hiding place: "What a bad man."   <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Dunblane inquiry begins</b><br><br><br><b><h2>31 May 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Private life of child killer Hamilton</h2><h3>Inquiry hears of son's devotion to his mother  </h2>
  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Erlend Clouston</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>The Cullen inquiry into the Dunblane massacre was told yesterday of the two sides of the gunman Thomas Hamilton.  His mother, Agnes Watt, aged 64, spent 35 minutes in the witness box outlining a model relationship with a loving son who would telephone every night and periodically present her with &#163;50 gifts.  In contrast, the detective in charge of the police investigation revealed how the 43-year-old part-time youth worker shot his infant victims at close range as they lay on their gym floor.  <p>  <p>A possible factor behind Hamilton's act was suggested with the disclosure that his string of boys' clubs was running a &#163;15,000 deficit, and he had a personal debt of &#163;11,000.  Mrs Watt told the second day of the inquiry that her son had made no complaints about debts or hinted at his private life when he visited her the afternoon before the killings.  <p>  <p>Despite a dislocated domestic background, which saw Hamilton adopted by the same couple who had adopted his mother, he was a caring son who visited twice a week, sometimes handing over part of the profits from his small-scale camera business.  <p>  <p>Earlier in the day, however the headmaster, Ron Taylor, told the inquiry that he had warned parents against enrolling their children in Hamilton's sports clubs after he became uneasy at reports of "inappropriate clothing and photography".  <p>  <p>Mr Taylor revealed that 18 months before the killings on 13 March, Hamilton had once challenged him at the school about his deteriorating reputation. "He complained that members of staff had directed children away from his boys' clubs, and would I disabuse them of the idea that he was a pervert," Mr Taylor said. He had given a 'neutral' reply.  <p>  <p>The details of Hamilton's killing of Dunblane's primary one pupils emerged from the morning evidence of Detective Chief Superintendent John Ogg. Up to then, the tribunal had skirted round the particulars of Hamilton's four-minute rampage through the school gym.  <p>  <p>However, questioned by Iain Bonomy QC, the policeman agreed that Hamilton had stood over a group of pupils who had been either disabled or thrown down and shot them "from a distance which must have been the height of his hand above the children".  <p>  <p>In his evidence, Mr Taylor, aged 46, explained how he had initially assumed that builders were responsible for the "indistinct bangs" that interrupted a telephone call he was making from his office. He only discovered his mistake when the deputy headteacher, Agnes Awlson, crawled through the door and shouted that there was a man with a gun in the school. The headmaster ran down to the gym where he saw a scene of "unimaginable carnage". "The air seemed to be thick with bluish smoke, and the smell of cordite was quite strong," Mr Taylor said. He noticed Hamilton moving at the far end of the gym where he had just shot himself. The head asked the newly-arrived janitor to kick away the pistol still clutched in Hamilton's left hand. The gunman's mother told the inquiry how she had married Thomas Watt, a bus driver, in 1950, but the marriage broke up soon after their son Thomas was born in 1952. She moved back in with John and Kathleen Hamilton who had adopted her shortly after her own illegitimate birth.  <p>  <p>According to the written statement of Mr Hamilton senior, a widower, a condition of the divorce was that baby Thomas was adopted by the Hamiltons. Thomas was a teenager before it was explained that Agnes was his mother and not his sister.  <p>  <p>It has been speculated that Hamilton's family background laid the foundations for an estrangement from society which finally induced him to attack the school.  <p>  <p>An alternative cause was suggested in the testimony of chief inspector Paul Hughes. A trawl through Hamilton's finances had found that they were "worse than bad", with his only official asset 3p in a Clydesdale Bank account. Because of council tax debt, a sheriff's warrant had been issued and he faced the prospect of having possessions and money seized. His debts of &#163;11,000 included &#163;737 on a Debenhams account and &#163;1,300 on the Barclaycard he had used to buy guns, meals and rail travel. Mr Hughes said that Hamilton, who had been a draughtsman and then ran his own woodworking shop before turning to camera dealing, had sold a house for &#163;30,000 in the 1980s and received &#163;24,600 from the insurance of a boat destroyed by fire. Despite this, he was having difficulties with tax and national insurance. After a neighbour reported his camera business to the authorities, his income support was stopped.  <p>  <p>Mr Hughes said that according to Hamilton's accounts, his chain of boys' clubs had suffered substantial losses "which, if the accounts are accurate, amounts to &#163;15,907".  <p>  <p>Mrs Watt said she knew nothing about her son's sports clubs, but had been aware of his interest in guns. "I saw them once in his home," she said. Mr Hamilton senior, a retired heating engineer who had quarrelled frequently with his adopted son before moving out of their shared Stirling home in 1992, revealed in a written statement that Thomas had joined a Stirling rifle club at 16. "All the time I lived with Thomas I never saw him bring guns to the home," he said.  <p>  <p>Both Mrs Watt and Mr Hamilton senior mentioned a male friend, a Jim Gillespie, who used to visit Thomas Hamilton's home in Stirling. Mrs Watt did remember him once having a girlfriend, "but she was too serious, and he didn't want to know".  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>FA criticised for failing to drop Gazza from England squad over 5,000 damage to plane </b><br><br><br><b><h2>31 May 1996</h2></b><br><h2>League gains Nationwide support  </h2>
  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Russell Thomas</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>The Football League yesterday put itself under &#163;5.25m Nationwide protection, only for the building society to find negative vibes already rattling the windows.  <p>  <p>Even such a solid financial institution as Nationwide, it seems, cannot escape the fall-out from the scandal of England's aeroplane vandalism. The fact that the prime suspect is such a high-profile player as Paul Gascoigne, whose 29th birthday celebrations allegedly resulted in &#163;5,000 damage, has inflated the adverse publicity.  <p>  <p>After the record three-year sponsorship deal was announced, Nationwide's chief executive Brian Davis admitted: "Our timing was a little bit unlucky with this story."  <p>  <p>Davis joined the widespread criticism of the FA's fumbling response to the aerial episode. "What's happened is very silly and should have been better managed," he said. "By the sound of it they had a bit of a wild party on the plane. It sounds very bad news. The FA will have to look into it and take the right action."  <p>  <p>But, overall, "this is the right time to join forces with the national game," Davis insisted. "We're aware that in business, as in sport, there will be incidents. But we have to look on the positive side." The Nationwide deal represents a 75 per cent increase on the League's previous &#163;1m-a-year three-year contract with Endsleigh Insurance.  <p>  <p>The League's bargaining power was strengthened by the recent five-year, &#163;125m television deal under which more than 60 live games a season will go out on Sky Sports from August. ITV will show highlights. Davis said the TV deal was "a real bonus" and added: "The national game has a very strong image. And the audiences all round are getting bigger." Gordon McKeag, the League president, conceded that the financial gap with the Premier League was "not bridgeable" but he believed that the TV and sponsorship deals would give the 72 member clubs a sounder financial base and help end talk of a breakaway to a Premiership second division. "We certainly hope that any dissension will be in the past," said McKeag, "And we hope these deals will cement things between all the member clubs. We've put together a package that gives our clubs the opportunity to stand on their feet."  <p>  <p>* England Under-21s lost any chance of reaching the Toulon tournament final after falling 3-1 to Portugal last night. Manchester United's Terry Cooke was sent off after 64 minutes for violent conduct and there were eight bookings, five for England. Dani, loaned to West Ham last season, scored Portugal's third goal after helping create the others.

  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Duncan Campbell</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>It could take up to a year for the killer of a young man on the M25 two weeks ago to be traced, the  detective leading the murder hunt warned yesterday.  <p>  <p>Detective Superintendent Nick Biddis, of Kent police, said neighbours of owners of the type of car  driven by the murderer should contact the police if the vehicle has disappeared within the past 10  days. In another murder investigation, also involving a minor traffic incident, witnesses to the car  chase preceding it have come forward.  <p>  <p>Mr Biddis said in Canterbury that his team of 40 officers was now trying to trace all the owners of  the 7,500 L-registered Land Rover Discoveries in Britain. Initially, it had been reported that there  were 1,000. "We are not ringing them up, it is a case of actively visiting people. I want the offender  to know that because we could be banging on his door and I want him to worry about that.  <p>  <p>"It could take months or it could take the best part of a year to trace every single owner  currently on the police national computer." He remained confident that the man who fatally stabbed  Stephen Cameron, aged 21, on 19 May would be caught.  <p>  <p>Mr Biddis suggested that the murderer may have suffered injuries because blows were exchanged  before the knife was pulled. There was no evidence that Mr Cameron knew his attacker.  <p>  <p>In the other murder investigation, witnesses to a car chase in north London last Monday night have  come forward following appeals on Thursday, a police spokeswoman said.  <p>  <p>A Ghanaian man aged 35, on holiday from Germany, was shot dead after a driver pursued the car in  which he was travelling. There had earlier been a minor collision.  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Man named in hunt for M25 road rage killer</b><br><br><br><b><h2>21 June 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Alias  theory over man named in M25 killing  </h2>
  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Duncan Campbell</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>Detectives yesterday named the man they want to interview over the M25 'road rage' murder as  Anthony Francis of Bexley, Kent. But police sources last night suggested that the name might be an  alias used by members of the underworld.  <p>  <p>The detective leading the investigation urged Kenneth Noye, who was cleared of the murder of an  undercover policeman but jailed over the &#163;26m Brink's Mat robbery, to come forward and eliminate  himself from the inquiry. He has been reportedly sighted in Cyprus, Marbella, Tenerife and Paris since  the investigation started.  <p>  <p>Stephen Cameron, aged 21, an electrician, was knifed to death on 19 May at the M25/M20 intersection  in Kent, following a minor altercation. His fiancee, Danielle Cable, aged 17, watched in horror as he  was attacked. Someone with the name Anthony Francis used to live at Brigden Road in Bexley although he  has not been seen there since last month. Detective Superintendent Nick Biddiss, who is leading the  investigation, said at a news conference in Canterbury that he believed Mr Francis might have  important information.  <p>  <p>Mr Francis was described as aged between 20 and 30, 6ft tall, and stocky. But detectives said they  had been unable to find anyone in the area who knew him although two women at his address had been  interviewed.  <p>  <p>"We have to find Mr Francis, who is shown as the registered owner of the vehicle," said Mr Biddiss.  Police also gave details of the vehicle they want to trace: a dark blue or grey Land Rover Discovery,  registration L794 JTF. Police sources last night confirmed that it was possible that 'Mr Francis' was  a 'ghost', a name of convenience used by local criminals. Mr Noye, from West Kingsdown, Kent, left the  country shortly after the murder. Reports have placed him in Spain, France, and the Turkish area of  Cyprus. He was released from prison in 1994 after serving eight years of a 14-year sentence for  handling proceeds from the 1983 Brink's Mat bullion robbery near Heathrow airport. In 1986, he was  acquitted of murdering Detective Constable John Fordham, who had been hiding in his grounds on  surveillance duty. Mr Noye said he had acted in self defence. No one at Mr Noye's home wished to  comment last night.  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Resignation of Rod Richards, junior Welsh Office minister</b><br><br><br><b><h2>3 June 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Paying the price of hypocrisy</h2><h3>Sleaze issue returns to haunt Major as Welsh minister quits over affair  </h2>
  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Patrick Wintour</b><br><br>    The politically damaging image of sleaze and personal hypocrisy returned to  haunt John Major's government last night when Rod Richards, the junior Welsh  Office minister, resigned over allegations of an extra-marital affair, so  becoming the tenth serving member of this administration to be forced to  quit in the wake of a personal scandal.<p>  The timing of Mr Richards's resignation is a personal blow to Mr Major, as  the Prime Minister appeared to have at last removed the stigma of sleaze  from the Conservative Party, partly by taking an intolerant stance towards  sexually miscreant ministers and partly by implementing the Nolan Committee  report calling for a tougher code of business conduct for MPs.<p>  No member of the Government had been forced to quit in disgrace since April  last year when Richard Spring, a parliamentary aide, resigned.<p>  The allegations about Mr Richards were particularly embarrassing for Tories  in his Clwyd North West constituency in north Wales, where he has been  spearheading a campaign for a return to traditional family values. In Dod's  Parliamentary Companion he lists 'family' among his recreations and his last  election manifesto contained pictures of him with his wife and children.  Mr Richards, once seen to be on the fast track to high office, tendered his  resignation yesterday afternoon after the News of the World ran a front page  story accusing the 47-year-old minister of an affair with a public relations  adviser and divorcee 20 years his junior, Julia Felthouse, a former press  officer for the National Canine Defence League. She left her job four weeks  ago.<p>  Mr Richards, one of the most combative ministers in the Government, has been  married to his wife Liz, a speech therapist, for 19 years and has three  children.<p>  Downing Street, dropping the usual courtesies of an exchange of letters,  merely announced in the briefest of statements that Mr Richards had offered  his resignation and it had been accepted.  It appears that the Welsh Minister rapidly lost the support of William  Hague, the Welsh Secretary, as well as the government whips. The statement  added only that his successor as parliamentary under-secretary would be  named in due course.<p>  David Evans, a rightwing member of the powerful backbench 1922 committee,  said: "People who accept high office, a minister of the Crown, wear an  England shirt. You have to set an example. There are standards to be set and  if a minister of the Crown misbehaves in this way, that's it. No problem."<p>  Mr Major has anyway instituted a policy of demanding immediate ministerial  resignations from any frontbencher caught compromising their morals. He has  learnt from bitter experience, notably the resignation of David Mellor, that  delay compounds the political damage to the Government since efforts to  protect an exposed minister inevitably fail, only leaving the Prime  Minister's authority weakened and the tabloid press claiming another scalp.  <p>Mr Richards's constituency party officers in Clwyd North West had initially  insisted the story must have been a fabrication, despite the News of the  World's possession of photographs of Mr Richards entering Ms Felthouse's  London flat, but later, Sir Eric Howells, president of the Conservative  Party in Wales, accepted the inevitable.<p>  "I am sad because Rod Richards was doing a superb job and his departure from  the Welsh Office will leave a vacuum which must be filled quickly," he said.  Within the Welsh Labour Party, often reviled by Mr Richards in the most  vitriolic language, there was little mourning at his departure from office.  Rhodri Morgan, the shadow Welsh minister, said: "Mr Richards wanted to be  the Binyamin Netanyahu of Welsh politics, the tough guy fighting off Welsh  devolution."<p>  There was speculation in Labour circles that Mr Richards may also have to  stand down at the next election. Despite boundary changes, his seat remained  one of the safest for the Conservatives in Wales, and the Conservative Party  cannot afford Mr Richards to lose it because of a backlash from a  church-going electorate.<p>  In the short term Mr Major may have difficulty in finding a suitable  replacement for Mr Richards at the Welsh Office, where he was the last  Welsh-speaking minister. There was speculation that the veteran Sir Wyn  Roberts - who also speaks Welsh - could return as a caretaker until the  general election. The other two Welsh MPs of ministerial material - Roger  Evans (Monmouth) and Jonathan Evans (Brecon and Radnor) - are already in  government departments.<p>  Sir Wyn, aged 65, MP for Conwy, stood down as Minister of State for Wales in  1994 after holding office since 1979. Due to retire at the next election,  Sir Wyn was replaced at the Welsh Office by Mr Richards, who was appointed  by Mr Major in 1994 after winning his seat with a majority of 6,050 at the  last election.  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Resignation of Rod Richards, junior Welsh Office minister</b><br><br><br><b><h2>3 June 1996</h2></b><br><h2>The MP who took pride in being the "most hated man in Wales"  </h2>
  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Patrick Wintour</b><br><br>  Rod Richards, according to his opposite numbers on the Labour front bench,  revelled in the sobriquet of "the most hated man in Wales".<p>  In his first major speech in the Commons, in March 1993, he provoked a  walk-out by Labour and Liberal Democrat MPs and had to be restrained three  times in 26 minutes by the Deputy Speaker, Janet Fookes, for his language  about Welsh nationalists and the corruption of Labour councillors.  In June 1994 he was hauled over the coals and forced by Speaker Betty  Boothroyd to withdraw the claim that Peter Hain, Labour MP for Neath, was a  liar.<p>  In December 1995, he was also rebuked by the Speaker for attacking Tony  Blair's choice of a grant maintained school for his son, provoking Ms  Boothroyd to say: "The people of this country are sick and tired of the  personal attacks that go across this House."<p>  One Labour MP said yesterday: "You could just about have a civil chat with  him about rugby or Glamorgan cricket club, but get within 1,000 miles of  politics and he becomes incredibly aggressive."<p>  He used an interview in an obscure Welsh language magazine, Barn (Opinion),  to say of Welsh Labour councillors: "They are all the same. They're short,  they're fat, and they're slimy, and they are fundamentally corrupt."  One Labour councillor responded: "That's not true. I am not short." Others  did not see the funny side: the Clwyd county council Labour group threatened  to sue.<p>  Such language lost him friends in the Welsh Office when John Redwood, then  Welsh secretary, was trying to run a PR offensive with Labour local  government. Mr Redwood was forced to tell him to apologise.  Mr Richards won one of the few safe Conservative seats in Wales with a  majority of 6,050 in 1992. Never scared to take on Labour, he was one of the  Tory MPs of the 1992 intake that decided to penetrate the then exclusively  Labour Strangers Bar at Westminster.<p>  In recent months, his more frequent appearances there led some to speculate  that he was undergoing a personal crisis. There had been rumours that his  marriage of 19 years was on the rocks. The speculation grew when he was one  of the few Tory ministers not to vote on divorce reform.  Mr Richards also has an unusual background for a Tory MP. He was thrown out  of university at Aberystwyth after a year in which he devoted more time to  sport than his books. He joined the Royal Marines between 1969-71 before  returning to university in 1974, this time to Swansea where he achieved a  first in economics.<p>  There followed fours year with the security services in Northern Ireland, a  period of employment listed in Dod's Parliamentary Companion as Ministry of  Defence (Defence Intelligence Staff).<p>  After a period as a mini cab driver in east London, he became a newsreader  for the new SC4 Welsh language channel, a role he had to relinquish when he  fought and lost the Vale of Glamorgan by-election.  He also ran a pub, subsequently leased to John Humphries, the man who leads  the choir on Welsh Night at Labour Party conference. The pub landed him in a  court battle over the non payment of a bill, a dispute that cost him heavy  legal costs and a rebuke from the judge.<p>  For a short time he was the special advisor to the Welsh Secretary, David  Hunt, but in 1989 he was selected to stand for Clywd North East, the former  seat of Tory rebel Sir Anthony Meyer.

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Resignation of Rod Richards, junior Welsh Office minister</b><br><br><br><b><h2>4 June 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Welshing on the Welsh</h2><h3>The Tories risk losing their shirts outside England  </h2>
  <br><b>Leading article</b> <br><br>  People who accept government office, opines the right-wing Conservative MP  David Evans, must recognise that they "wear an England shirt". This is not  an entirely happily chosen metaphor right now, given recent events in a Hong  Kong nightclub. But it is particularly inappropriate in the case of the  errant Welsh-speaking junior Welsh Office minister Rod Richards who, if he  wore a shirt at all (and we could of course be getting into deep water  here), would surely wear a Welsh one.<p>  In spite of his own Welsh name, Mr Evans is very much a Londoner. This  probably explains why he seems to have forgotten so readily that some of his  Conservative colleagues still actually represent distant lands called  Scotland and Wales. Not many, admittedly; there are only 10 Tory MPs in  Scotland and six in Wales, and they survive on some of the smallest  majorities in the business. But at least Mr Richards would have been well  able to speak authoritatively in Wednesday night's Commons debate on the use  of the Welsh language in parliamentary proceedings. His successor Jonathan  Evans (no relation to David) is not similarly endowed.<p>  There was a time - not so very long ago either - when both Scots and Welsh  Conservatives were powers in their respective lands. No longer. A  Conservative electoral wipe-out in Wales next time round is by no means  impossible (and if only one Welsh Tory survives it is likely, ironically, to  be Mr Richards). But Mr Evans's England-shirt jibe is indicative of why his  party is on the slide there. The Conservatives are busy reincarnating  themselves as the English National Party. They no longer seem to have a  place for Wales or Scotland. It will hardly be surprising if the Welsh and  the Scots decide to reciprocate the feeling.    <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Donald Macleod</b><br><br>  Top universities are threatening to impose fees of &#163;3,000 a year  unless the Government pumps more money back into higher education.  The war of nerves between ministers and university vice-chancellors will be  stepped up this week, with the official entrance guide warning students not  to delay applying for a year in case they are faced with tuition fees in  1997.<p>  "If you have a place this year you should take it, otherwise you might be  caught out by a fee next year. Our recommendation is don't waste a year  improving grades," said Tony Higgins, chief executive of the Universities  and Colleges Admissions Service.<p>  Universities were furious to lose 30 per cent of capital funding for  equipment in the November budget. Faced with a threat by the Committee of  Vice-Chancellors and Principals (CVCP) to levy a &#163;300 fee on new  students to make up for cuts in the budget, Gillian Shephard, the Education  and Employment Secretary, set up an inquiry headed by Sir Ron Dearing into  higher education funding.<p>  The levy was not implemented but many universities say they cannot wait for  Sir Ron's inquiry which is widely expected to recommend tuition fees from  1999 coupled to an Australian-style graduate tax.<p>  "Unless the Government does something about the budget we will be forced to  consider fees in 1997. This would certainly be more than &#163;300 - it  would be nearer &#163;3,000," said a spokesman for the committee yesterday.  The London School of Economics is to publish costings of the kind of  graduate loan proposed by the Labour Party showing a student who borrowed a  total of &#163;12,000 would pay less than &#163;2 a month over 20 years.  Such a system would make it much easier for individual universities to  charge fees, although David Blunkett, Labour's education spokesman, has  ruled out introducing tuition fees nationally.<p>  In the short term only the top 20 universities would be in a position to  charge fees without seriously diluting the quality of their intake. These  members of the Russell Group - socalled because they started meeting at the  Russell Hotel in Bloomsbury, central London, near the CVCP headquarters to  plan tactics - believe they are losing ground in the international research  league and must take urgent steps to boost income.<p>  However recent attempts to bring in fees at the London School of Economics  and University College London were defeated by staff and students.  Most of the new universities oppose the move on practical as well as  idealistic grounds.<p>  Piecemeal tuition fees would mark the entrenchment of a two-tier university  system only four years after the distinction between polytechnics and  universities was officially abolished. Research funding is becoming more  concentrated on Russell Group universities and this has a knock-on effect on  staffing levels and teaching.<p>  A survey by Manchester University for the committee out this week will show  universities are short of money for equipment, and are spending more on  maintenance than rival researchers in the United States and Europe.  Multinational companies are relocating collaboration with universities  outside Britain, and vice chancellors will argue at least &#163;400 million  is needed over the next five years.    <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Compensation awards to police officers after Hillsborough disaster </b><br><br><br><b><h2>4 June 1996</h2></b><br><h2>1.2m  for Hillsborough police provokes anger  </h2>
  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Duncan Campbell</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>The award of more than &#163;1m to police officers traumatised by the Hillsborough football stadium disaster in 1989 provoked  warnings last night of "floodgates" opening for similar claims. Senior officers are warning that such awards could have serious  ramifications for policing and other emergency services. Fourteen junior officers who dealt with the dead and dying and suffered  psychological problems as a result have accepted &#163;1.2m. The highest awards are for more than &#163;200,000, which include  lost earnings and pension rights. The smallest awards were less than &#163;10,000 for officers still serving. The highest award for  stress was nearly &#163;40,000. The officers include those who entered the pens in which many of the 96 fans at the  Liverpool-Nottingham Forest semi-final died.    <p>  <p>In a settlement agreed at Sheffield High Court, the Chief Constable of South Yorkshire, Sheffield Wednesday FC and the club's engineers admitted liability. Last night, a spokeswoman for South Yorkshire police said the force's  insurers had advised them to make an out-of-court settlement. Simon Allen, the officers' solicitor, insisted last night that the awards  were consistent with court guidelines for damages for psychiatric illnesses. "Members of the emergency services are no different from  anyone else in that when their emotions are subjected to the gruesome scenes of a tragedy such as Hillsborough they are likely to be  mentally affected as a result," said Mr Allen. "They accept the reasonable risks of their service, but they should not be expected to deal  with the appalling consequences of the negligent actions of others." Privately senior officers expressed dismay at the awards which  they believe will set a precedent and "could open the floodgates" to other claims from emergency service workers. Senior officers fear  that the size of the settlements, which come from police budgets, will affect staffing levels.   <p>  <p>The chairman of the Hillsborough Families Support Group, Trevor Hicks, who lost two teenage daughters in the disaster, said he and other families were appalled at the news.  "Obviously we accept that these police officers are human beings and they have human emotions the same as anyone else," Mr Hicks  said. "But these officers chose to be police officers. We did not choose to be victims... Now every member of the emergency services  could claim compensation for seeing something horrific." Local Labour MP Peter Kilfoyle said: "I don't doubt some of the police have  suffered great stress and in law are entitled to compensation but there can be no adequate compensation for the loss of children and  other members of families." <p>  <p>Ian Westwood, the vice-chairman of the Police Federation, which backed the legal action, expressed his  sympathy for those who had lost relatives and friends but said that the officers were also victims. The action had been brought partly  because the tragedy had been avoidable. A police officer accepted sudden death and tragedy but did not accept injury and illness as a  result of negligence. Six other officers involved in the disaster but to a lesser extent failed in similar claims for damages last year and  are appealing. According to lawyers the grounds for post traumatic stress disorder claims are specific. Claimants must have been  involved in or personally witnessed a traumatic event and re-experienced it in recollections; there must be persistent evidence of trauma  (eg fear of crowds) with symptoms lasting for more than a month.   <p>  <p><b>Compensation</b>  <p>  <p>Hillsborough relatives:  <p>Loss of son or daughter under 18: &#163;3,500 (1989 figure)  <br>Loss of son or daughter over 18 but without dependents: zero loss of 35-year-old factory worker earning &#163;15,000 with  dependent children: &#163;150,000   <p>Post-traumatic stress:  <p>Train driver witnessing suicide on line: &#163;2,000  <br>Zeebrugge ferry trauma victims: &#163;7,000 to &#163;20,000  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Compensation awards to police officers after Hillsborough disaster </b><br><br><br><b><h2>4 June 1996</h2></b><br><h2>"This  is not blood money. Part of me died that day"  </h2>
  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Melanie McFadyean</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>Fourteen junior police officers were yesterday awarded a total of &#163;1.2m damages for psychiatric stress suffered tending  victims of the 1989 Hillsborough disaster in a ground-breaking case with profound implications for members of all the emergency  services. The families of the 96 who died strongly criticised the size of the payments last night as outrageous.  <p>  <p>Five of the 14 officers who went into the fenced pens to save Liverpool fans have left the force because of post traumatic stress  disorder. All 14 are still suffering the effects of what they saw that day. One of the men was PC David Frost, who for the first time  gives his detailed account to the Guardian. Former policeman David Frost has a snapshot of himself in which he is every inch the officer  - that was seven years ago. Today he has shoulder length hair and a five o'clock shadow. He wears jeans and a homespun top of the sort  worn by mountaineers and hippies. There are pink friendship bracelets on his wrist. "I lost my faith in that uniform and what it  represents after the Hillsborough disaster."   <p>  <p>On 15 April 1989, the day 95 people died at Hillsborough, PC Frost was on duty at the football ground. Like other policemen he was no stranger to death and disaster, like others  he was used to suppressing emotion after a gory day by drinking with his mates. But no amount of drinking - and there's been plenty of  that - has helped him since Hillsborough. He has never recovered his peace of mind and suffers from the emotional turmoil of Post  Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). "You've got me on a good day," he tells me when we meet.

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Compensation awards to police officers after Hillsborough disaster </b><br><br><br><b><h2>5 June 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Putting safety first - at last</h2><h3>The Hillsborough case will reduce risks at public events  </h2>
  <br><b>Leading article</b> <br><br><br>      <p>Bereaved families of the Hillsborough stadium disaster have every reason to feel affronted. Many grieving relatives of the 96 people  killed by the crush of fans at the Sheffield Wednesday stadium in 1989 have received no compensation. Others have been awarded paltry  sums by the courts ranging from &#163;2,000 to &#163;7,000 for losing sons, daughters, or parents. Yet now 14 police officers,  who suffered psychological damage rescuing victims, have been awarded &#163;1.2m in damages - ranging from &#163;10,000 to  &#163;200,000 per officer. In the words of Trevor Hicks, chairman of the Hillsborough Families Support Group, who lost two teenage  daughters in the disaster: "These officers chose to be police officers. We did not choose to be victims..."  The award at the door of the  Sheffield High Court carries all the defects of such out-of-court settlements: doubt over the principles on which the award was made;  dire warnings by police chiefs on the repercussions on their budgets; and the danger that the decision could open a floodgate of claims  from other emergency service officers. A lawyer-directed damages system is always going to be more arbitrary than a no-fault  compensation scheme advocated years ago by a royal commission.   <p>  <p>Yet, as our exclusive interview with one of the officers demonstrated yesterday, the award is not as arbitrary as it might seem. There are three obvious grounds on which police officers could  seek compensation: their personal injuries involving post-traumatic stress; their loss of earnings and reduced pension rights (five of  the 14 having had to leave the police); and the mismanagement of the South Yorkshire police, Sheffield Wednesday FC and the club's  engineers.  Contrary to the views of Mr Hicks, in the eyes of the law the police officers had less choice than the fans. As disciplined  officers, they had no choice but to accept their posting to patrol the football ground. At least the fans could have chosen not to go.   <p>  <p>There is one heartening part of the award in terms of public interest: the decision by the chief constable of South Yorkshire, on the advice of  his service's insurers, to admit liability. With luck, this could transform the attitude of the service to policing private and public events.  Until now, the police have been patsies always ready to provide what traditionally has always been done. After this week, police chiefs  are going to be more rigorous about the safety standards of events which they are asked to police. There are already officers - including  architectural liaison officers - who are supposed to assess the safety of such events. Now they are going to have to be more  professional about assessing dangers. Senior officers will be asking more awkward questions. It should not have needed a Hillsborough to  force football clubs, with their multi-million pound turnovers, to pay more attention to the safety of fans. This week's award will force  them to be more responsible.  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Ariane 5 rocket explodes after launch </b><br><br><br><b><h2>5 June 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Billion-dollar hiccup</h2><h3> Despite the  spectacular failure of Ariane 5, the space race will continue at an ever more furious pace</h2>  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Tim Radford</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>Ten years ago, US, British and European scientists dreamed up a set of space probes and set the controls for the heart of the Sun.  Yesterday a decade of effort exploded in a &#163;5bn firework display over French Guiana. The nine planets of the solar system - and  all life on one of them - are a gift from the Sun: a vast, dense thermonuclear furnace 91 million miles away which showers the planet  with 100 billion watts-worth of energy and kick-starts atmospheric circulation, the hydrological cycle, and plant growth every day,  everywhere in the world. The idea was simple: to find out how the local star worked, why it had spots and why it had them in 11-year  cycles. <p>  <p>By the time engineers in French Guiana were ready to launch yesterday, part of the research was already in place. There was  already a satellite called Soho, in orbit in a kind of gravitational hammock called a Lagrangian point (where the pull of Earth and Sun  cancel each other), watching the Sun 24 hours a day. The Americans had inaugurated Gong, short for Global Oscillation Network Group,  to 'listen in' to seismic waves in the Sun. The British had also just turned on Cutlass, a Collaborative Twin Location Aurora Sounding  System, to learn more about the northern lights: another pyrotechnic effect of the Sun's rays. And the star turn was to be Cluster:  &#163;500m in all to build, launch and operate four identical satellites that would orbit in formation in the solar wind, monitoring the hot breath of the heavens.  <p>  <p>As British space scientists point out, when the Sun sneezes, the Earth catches a cold. Sudden surges of solar power can screw up radiocommunications, shut down television and navigation satellites and short-circuit power grids. Each time this happens, the cost  runs into hundreds of millions.  <p>  <p>Cluster was on board Ariane 5 because it was, in effect, a cheap ride. Yesterday's launch was to have been a test flight: instead of  ballast, it carried a scientific experiment. Experimenters used to make satellites in pairs, with a spare in case the first one went  wrong. But today's experiments are so complex, and so expensive, that research budgets could not stand the duplication. And anyway,  since 1968 the European space engineers have taken 14 consecutive science experiments and lobbed them into perfect orbit. Cluster  would have been the 15th.  <p>  <p>And it was aboard Europe's giant: a new, ultra-heavy-duty space truck originally to do duty as part of Europe's ambitions for  manned flight, and Europe's contribution in the international space station - itself a grandiose cold-war project that echoed '2001: A  Space Odyssey'. Britain, then and now, did not want to get involved in manned flight. The cold war ended, the space station underwent a  series of metamorphoses and is now a multinational partnership led by the US and Russia, and Ariane 5 turned into a different kind of  rocket: one designed to catch a bigger share of the satellite-launch market. Its predecessor, Ariane 4, had put around 100 bits of  hardware into orbit, but Europe needed a giant because satellites are becoming bigger, and so are ambitions in space. Ariane 5 was  designed to kick seven tons of payload up to a speed of five miles a second. It was designed for a growing market. The Russians and the  Americans dominate it, but the Chinese have ambitions and Europe, too, has always wanted part of the action. <p>  <p>Networks of satellites  will provide hundreds of channels of television from Irkutsk to Indianapolis, and satellite phone links from Timbuctoo to Timaru.  Air-traffic controllers, shipping operators and Arctic explorers can place themselves to within 50 metres using global-positioning  satellites. Earth-resource satellites are finding buried rivers in Rajasthan, warning of drought in Africa and - using radar which can  identify crop reflections - spotting massive farm frauds in Europe. The investment will go on: the world now needs instruments in space  just to keep itself in business. Even Britain has made a tiny promise of investment in Ariane 5. Yesterday's explosion will be seen as a  hiccup. The experiment on board - ironically conceived in the year of the Challenger disaster which took seven astronaut lives - is  probably lost forever. But research won't stop. Keep watching that space.  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Paul Webster</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>Despite the spectacular destruction of the Ariane 5 space rocket on its first flight, French officials bullishly declared yesterday that  Europe's satellite launching programme would be back on course soon.  <p>  <p>"This is not a disaster, but rather an incident. It will not delay the second mission for a long time," said Yves Le Gall, head of  strategy at the French space agency CNES.  <p>  <p>A second Ariane 5 is under construction and is due to be launched in the autumn from the European Space Agency (ESA) base at  Kourou, French Guiana, where the first rocket of the series blew itself up on Tuesday 66 seconds after lift-off.  <p>  <p>Experts' confidence that the problem was less serious than expected stemmed from preliminary reports showing it was most likely a  computer software fault that sent the rocket veering off course. This triggered its self-destruct mechanism.  <p>  <p>Ground controllers set off a second explosion to break up the wreckage, scattering debris over land and the Atlantic.  "Something went wrong with the electronic brain which sent the wrong command to the booster engines," one expert said after  studying information sent back from the ill-fated rocket.  <p>  <p>The belief that there was nothing fundamentally wrong with the launcher, which was carrying four uninsured satellites worth about  &#163;500m, has convinced the ESA headquarters in Paris that the second test flight will go ahead as scheduled in late October or  early November.  <p>  <p>References to what is being called a "cerebral accident" have also reassured the French government, which finances 46 per cent of  the Ariane 5 programme, that the consequences were less serious than feared. President Jacques Chirac told cabinet ministers  yesterday he was confident the programme would go ahead as planned.  <p>  <p>The French media were less sanguine, and many criticised the cost of the Ariane programme. The Liberation daily carried the  headline 'The 37 billion franc firework display' next to a picture of the burning debris falling to earth.  <p>  <p>Although the conclusions of an official inquiry will not be known until 15 July, the first analysis was viewed optimistically by the  Ariane 5 development manager, Jacques Durand, who said he believed the initial findings would be proved right.  <p>  <p>"We planned two test launchings and the first has ended in failure," he said. "If a computer fault is confirmed then the problem will be  much easier to solve. The launch programme will continue and when we are ready there will be another blast-off."  <p>  <p>Ariane 5, which has taken 10 years to develop, was intended to maintain Europe's lead in commercial satellite launchings after the  highly successful Ariane 4 was phased out in 1999. Ariane 4, which has ensured ESA about 60 per cent of the international launching  business, has failed only seven times in 86 launchings since 1979.  <p>  <p>But before yesterday's spectacular setback, Ariane 5 scientists predicted a 98.5 per cent success rate for the new rocket,  equivalent to one failure in every 70 attempts.  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Peter Hetherington</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>A thin haze hung over the small lake beside the maze of flyovers. Swans, grebes, Canada geese and a few brave souls lazed in the sun, and Winifred Sherrington tried in vain to fan away the exhaust fumes as she lounged on the grass under Spaghetti Junction, Birmingham.  <p>  <p>"I suppose it must do you some harm, some complain of asthma and chest problems; but it's a good amenity none the less," she said.  <p>  <p>Two hundred yards away the men from the British Waterways Board and landscape architects were talking about grander plans for the dark wasteland below Britain's busiest interchange.  <p>  <p>They would like to create a beach bang under the M6 overlooking a confluence of canals and the river Tame, complete with artificial sunlight courtesy of large pylons.  <p>  <p>As part of a &#163;3m European Union-supported plan to revitalise canals in the area, the waterways board is sparing no expense to transform the underside of the Graveley Hill interchange.  <p>  <p>Artists will be employed to paint over the huge concrete columns, while sculptures and other works of art could provide the final touch, turning, they hope, a motoring nightmare into a tourist attraction by next summer. "No, it's no joke," the man from the waterways board said as Wendy Hopper enthused about a long overdue project to revive a much maligned area.

  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Nick Varley</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>Rowdy holidaymakers who take their in-flight enjoyment too far are to face a new deterrent: the mile-high cuffs. Airlines are introducing handcuffs to restrain passengers who become disruptive and potentially dangerous mid-flight.  <p>  <p>Crews have been assaulted and flights diverted to eject drunken travellers in previous incidents.  Now two of the biggest charter airlines, Air 2000 and Leisure International Airways, which will carry nearly four million passengers between them this summer, are hoping to prevent any repeats by threatening the use of the cuffs. A number of other airlines are considering whether to follow suit. A spokeswoman for Air 2000 said: "We are not talking about cuffs as seen on American cop shows - these would be plastic restraining devices." Leisure International Airways, formerly Air UK Leisure, which flies to the Mediterranean, Florida and the Caribbean, said it was introducing the cuffs after cabin crews had expressed concern about violence and verbal abuse from passengers.  <p>  <p>A spokeswoman said it was not the youngsters who generally caused problems. "Often it is the older ones. We do carry a lot of football supporters and we don't get trouble." A British Airways spokesman admitted it already carried restraints. "Staff are all trained to operate these devices but they are used very rarely and only then with the permission of the captain." But Richard Hedges, of Britannia Airways, the largest charter operator which carries eight million passengers a year, said it preferred other methods of dealing with in-flight problems. "We have no evidence there is a rise in incidents which require this sort of measure," he said.  <p>  <p>Perhaps if his airline carried England footballers, he would hold a different view.  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>David Sharrock</b><br><br>    <p>  <p>Appearance: US version of Sir Patrick Mayhew - definitely very patrician.  <p>  <p>Occupation: As of Monday, Northern Ireland talks chairman.   <p>  <p>Objective: To get his buddy Bill Clinton re-elected... oops, sorry, I mean to end the countless centuries of conflict in Ireland and unite Protestant, Catholic and dissenter in the  bonds of friendship, etc, etc.   <P>  <P>Wow, so everybody must think he's a really great guy?: Nope. Ian Paisley calls him a "sort of Pope" and a "crony of Gerry Adams", which probably has something to do with him having Irish grandparents and encouraging President Clinton to  give Mr Adams a US visa.   <p>  <p>Oh dear, this is the same Ian Paisley who did so well in last week's Northern Ireland elections?: Correct.   <P>  <p>So the ex-senator from New England is of the wrong persuasion?: Well, he was brought up in the Lebanese Christian Maronite town of Waterville, Maine. Work that one out.   <p>  <p>Doesn't Sinn Fein like him?: Apparently not enough to join him at the talks on Monday by getting its military wing, the IRA, to call a ceasefire.   <p>  <p>Aren't these the all-party talks that the Shinners have been demanding for so long and the reason why the IRA called a ceasefire in the first place?: Correct.   <p>  <p>I'm confused: Don't worry, Mr Mitchell will be joining you. There must be historical precedents. Whose boots is Mitchell pulling on?: Well, Gladstone comes to mind. He spent his decling years trying to  solve the Irish question. And, yes, whenever he was getting warm they secretly changed the question.   <p>  <p>The way John Major did?: Well, the Mitchell Commission - set up by Mr Major - reported in January that all-party talks should go ahead asap and the same Mr Major  chose to ignore this advice and call elections instead. And now he's had to call Mitchell back: Yep.   <p>  <p>Why is Mitchell so special?: When he left the Senate after 14 years in 1994, Bill Clinton offered him a seat on the US Supreme Court and he turned it down. Then he was  offered the lucrative job of Commissioner of Baseball - which carried the not insubstantial perk of free tickets to his beloved Boston Red  Sox - and he turned that down too.   <p>  <p>To do what?: To do Bill's Irish work.   <p>  <p>What's likely to be the biggest problem facing him on Monday?: Jatleg.   <p>  <p>Don't you mean jetlag?: This is Belfast, mate, if you can't understand what we're saying you can go and fry yer bap. <p>Least likely  to say: 'Why don't you all just catch yerselves on'.      <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>George Mitchell appointed chairman of Northern Ireland all-party talks </b><br><br><br><b><h2>7 June 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Mitchell role angers Unionists  </h2>
  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Patrick Wintour</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>President Clinton's aide, Senator George Mitchell, was handed a key role yesterday in next Monday's Northern Ireland peace talks, provoking a furious reaction from Unionists and a threat by one Tory backbencher, Terry Dicks, to resign the whip and turn John Major's government into a minority administration.  <p>  <p>There was also unease among other Unionist Tories about the degree to which the American administration had become embedded in the peace process. Mr Mitchell's key role as one of the chairmen, however, is vital to intensive arm-twisting of Sinn Fein by the Irish government and the US administration in their effort to persuade the IRA to announce a ceasefire and open the door to Sinn Fein for the peace talks.  <p>  <p>Both the Irish prime minister, John Bruton, and John Major will attend the talks' opening ceremonies, the culmination of negotiation since the initial IRA ceasefire in August 1994. There is a strong chance of the opening day descending into farce with Sinn Fein excluded at the gates and Unionists kicking up over the presence of Mr Bruton and the role afforded to Mr Mitchell. The three main unionist parties plan to meet before Monday to agree a common strategy.  <p>  <p>Dick Spring, the Irish foreign minister, speaking at the end of three days of intensive negotiations in London, emotionally urged the IRA to change its mind, saying the talks represented the best chance for peace. Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein president, kept his counsel, in marked contrast to the recent war-mongering remarks by the IRA.  <p>  <p>Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland Secretary, took a less sanguine view saying: "It is manifest that Sinn Fein have excluded themselves from these negotiations. We regret that greatly. But good faith negotiations cannot take place in a democracy if one group is inextricably linked with those who threaten to carry out atrocious acts of violence while negotiations are proceedings."  <p>  <p>Mr Dicks told Channel 4 News tonight: "Why do we need a foreigner, who happens to be an Irish-American Catholic from the Clinton-Kennedy school? Why do we need him sitting there at all?"  <p>  <p>The detailed package gives Senator Mitchell the role of chairing the opening plenary session as well as the crucial sub-committee responsible for overseeing the best means of handing over paramilitary weapons. But in a compromise arrangement, Senator Mitchell's colleague on the arms decommissioning committee of last year - Canadian General John de Chastelain - will chair the vital second strand of talks dealing with relations between Northern Ireland and the Republic, including the future of the border. The British government will chair the first strand of talks on an internal settlement for Northern Ireland. Both governments will chair the third strand of talks on Dublin-London relations.  <p>  <p>The Democratic Unionist deputy leader Peter Robinson condemned the appointment of Senator Mitchell.  <p>  <p>"What degree of impartiality can unionists expect from a Catholic Irish American from the same stable as the Kennedys?"  <p>  <p>The Ulster Unionist leader David Trimble said the peace process would grind to a halt without decommissioning.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Pol Pot rumoured to have died</b><br><br><br><b><h2>7 June 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Pol Pot is dead, claim reports  </h2>
  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Nick Cumming-bruce</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>Pol Pot, the ruthless guiding spirit in one of the century's most brutal regimes, is seriously ill and may already be dead according to a flurry of reports from Cambodia's capital, Phnom Penh, and the Thai-Cambodian border. Pot, who came to personify a reign of terror that killed at least one million Cambodians and probably many more, suffered an attack of malaria and is dying, according to intelligence released yesterday by the Cambodian interior and defence ministries.  <p>  <p>Although the government in Phnom Penh could not confirm reports of his death it said it would, if true, be good news for Cambodia. The head of state, King Norodom Sihanouk, predicted that the Khmer Rouge guerrilla movement might fragment, and said: "This will then be the end of one of the most terrible tragedies of our history."  <p>  <p>The reports, based on accounts of government agents and villagers living near Khmer Rouge strongholds along the border with Thailand, echoed those from Beijing in recent days.  <p>  <p>But in a chance encounter with a Thai reporter working for the French news agency AFP near the border town of Aranyaprathet, a group of Khmer Rouge guerrillas said yesterday that Pol Pot had died on Tuesday.  <p>  <p>Even so, it could emerge that Pot, aged 68, is still in good health. The shadowy Khmer Rouge leader, who has haunted the Thai-Cambodian border for the past 18 years, has been reported dead before.  <p>  <p>Sources in the Thai military, which supported the Khmer Rouge in the 1980s and after, said yesterday that Pol Pot was sick, but not in danger. His sickness was normal for an old man, a Thai intelligence officer said, and not that serious.  <p>  <p>Such uncertainty and secrecy are part of the armoury of a guerrilla leader, driven as much by paranoia as by the Maoist fanaticism Pol Pot inflicted on Cambodia after the Khmer Rouge seized power in Phnom Penh in 1975. Reports of Pol Pot's death will fuel debate about the guerrilla movement's future. It faces the prospect of waging a rearguard action as much against changing political and economic conditions in Cambodia, as against the dismally-led troops dispatched by a corruption-riddled government. Since the guerrillas rejected UN-run elections in 1993 which were supported enthusiastically by Cambodians, an increasingly isolated Khmer Rouge has pulled back to strongholds along the border with Thailand.  <p>  <p>Battle-hardened guerrillas continue to hit government forces. But the quest for power has given way to a battle for survival.  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Northern Ireland all-party talks begin at Stormont</b><br><br><br><b><h2>10 June 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Time to offer hands of peace</h2><h3>Guilt and blame on every side, as Ulster faces another moment of truth  </h3>  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>David Sharrock</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>There is so much history pressing down upon Ireland, it seems almost surprising at times like this that the island manages not to  sink below the Atlantic.  <p>  <p>Today, however, genuinely deserves the epithet 'historic', for at two o'clock this afternoon the British and Irish governments will  open the widest ranging negotiations on Northern Ireland's future ever to be held. The Union with Great Britain (in a formal if not a  practical sense) will be on the table within the talks chamber at Castle Buildings in the grounds of the Stormont estate. The chairman  of the talks will be an internationally respected American advocate and politician, a close friend of President Clinton.  <p>  <p>Barring a one-minute-to-midnight announcement by the IRA that it is restoring its 1994 ceasefire 'unequivocally', we know what will  happen later today. Sinn Fein will turn up at Stormont in order to be turned away, generating the most memorable images of the day. It  will do them little good and they know it. Getting here was not easy. John Major is guilty of mishandling crucial moments since that  ceasefire announcement in September 1994 which brought a tidal wave of change to the ordinary detail of everyday life in Northern  Ireland. Others are guilty of similar misjudgments. Both governments, and the main Unionist and Nationalist parties, are entitled to  be satisfied that they have preserved the essentials of their positions while at the same time having set out a fair route towards a  final agreement.  <p>  <p>There will be a lot of huffing and puffing from the Unionists today about the appointment of the 'Irish American' George Mitchell  as chairman - the Ulster Unionist leader David Trimble yesterday warned of the "bumpy" ride ahead - but it is scarcely credible that  they will get up and walk away from the table now.  <p>  <p>Some senior republicans privately concede that the Irish government has managed to broker the best circumstances for Sinn Fein's  entry into real negotiations, a fact acknowledged by Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein president, at a noisy and colourful rally on Friday to  celebrate its greatest ever electoral success - in Belfast's Ulster Hall, a former bastion of Unionism. Publicity stunts are all very  well - and there isn't a political party in Ireland which doesn't admit that Sinn Fein are unbeatable at them - but certainly not in  today's circumstances.  <p>  <p>In the Irish Republic, 133,000 children will be sitting school examinations that are vitally important to them and their parents.  In Limerick, a Garda detective will be buried with full state honours, attended by a solemn-faced John Bruton before he travels north.  <p>  <p>In spite of the IRA denial, the police are convinced that some of its members shot Gerry McCabe dead in circumstances which one  local officer described as "an execution".  <p>  <p>These are the stories that will dominate the news agenda of the South and on such days the impact of media stunts relating to  Northern Ireland is blunted, particularly after weekend opinion polls showing an overwhelming desire for a restoration of the IRA  ceasefire.  <p>  <p>What then is the alternative for the republican movement? A return to 'armed struggle' and the murder of hundreds more fellow  countrymen and women, bringing the inevitable loyalist retaliation and a new generation of funerals, broken hearts and poisoned minds?  <p>  <p>The IRA can and does talk tough; its people have suffered too and in darker times sustained themselves with the belief that it is  not he who can inflict but endure the most suffering who will emerge the victor.  Nevertheless, the Sinn Fein lexicon underwent stealthy restructuring in the late 1980s and the talk today is of peace and not  victory.  <p>  <p>In the end they would be faced with the finality and reality of the arrangements of today's Stormont talks, but the task of coaxing  the main political participants once more to the table would have been made all the more gruelling.  The republican movement's chief strategists surely know that it would be better to go now and lock everybody into negotiations than  risk losing the chance.  <p>  <p>If today is inauspicious, then so be it. It is a start. The IRA appears to be undergoing an agonising reappraisal of its tactics,  with last Friday's murder of an Irish policemen just the tip of the iceberg.  The gut instinct, however, says that the question of a ceasefire is more one of when than if.  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Northern Ireland  all-party talks begin at Stormont</b><br><br><br><b><h2>11 June 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Opening  the peace gate</h2>
<h3>A renewed ceasefire is still the key to success  </h3> <br><b>Leading  article</b><br><br><br>      <p>British politicians and public opinion should not take pleasure from the shutting of the  gates against Gerry Adams yesterday. There is a tendency in this country, following all the IRA  bombs and the Sinn Fein evasions, to want to see Mr Adams and his colleagues taken down a peg  or three. That tendency is very understandable in its way, but it is politically short-sighted.  The goal for which British policy over Northern Ireland has been aiming ever since 1993 has  been to see Mr Adams come walking through the gates, not to have them barred against him yet  again. Yesterday put the clock back to the politics of the long years before 1993 which in the  end solved nothing. Yesterday was not a victory but a setback. <p> <p>Yet it was a setback  rather than a disaster. The talks which began yesterday, amidst considerable posturing on all  sides, are on a wider and more hopeful basis than those which have gone before. There has not  been a time when quite so many of the real players in Northern Ireland have been willing to  gather under one roof. To see the British and the Irish governments working so closely together  lends genuine strength to the rest of the process. It was important too that Ian Paisley, who  represents more people in Northern Ireland than Sinn Fein, did not carry out his threat to  boycott the discussions (even though he may very easily do so in future); his Democratic  Unionists should be inside the process not outside. The presence of the new loyalist parties,  the Progressive Unionists and the Ulster Democratic Party, was an important new step in  Northern Ireland talks as well. <p> <p>The substance of the talks is also more firmly based  than it would have been had the peace process not taken place. Three points cannot be  dismissed. First, the meat of the agenda is the Framework Document produced by London and  Dublin last year, the most substantive blueprint for an equitable and democratic compromise  settlement of the Northern Ireland question to have emerged in the last quarter of a century.  Only the most pessimistic of pessimists would dismiss it as a basis for future progress.  Second, the IRA may have chosen to remain at war, but the agenda now also includes, for the  first time, the prospect of substantive multilateral steps towards the disarmament and  decommissioning of the Ulster conflict. That has not happened in earlier talks either. Third,  the responsibility for resolving the dispute is now more solidly internationalised than it ever  was before. <p>  <p>The 1992 talks broke down over exactly this question; now there is a three-person  chairing team under George Mitchell, all with a proven record in this field, who together offer  a better chance of progress than some of the more ambitious notions on which earlier talks have  foundered. None of this is to fudge the real failure which Sinn Fein's non-involvement  represents. This stage of the peace process was predicated upon Sinn Fein's presence under  ceasefire conditions, and that ought still to be the case. Nothing is more desirable in  Northern Ireland than the restoration of that ceasefire. It ought to be a priority for the two  governments to find ways of helping to achieve that goal on a principled basis, and no  politician should be too proud to explore all the ways of doing it. Even now, there is still a  case for harnessing the enormous popular support for the peace process to put pressure on the  IRA. The end of the ceasefire was the event which locked the gates against Mr Adams. A  resumption would turn the key to open those gates once more. It is overwhelmingly in our  interests to try to help that come about. <p> <p> <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr> <td  width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td  width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td  width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td  width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr> <td align=left  valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td> <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A  HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td> <td align=right  valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td> </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>David Sharrock</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>"The road to get this far has been long and difficult. I have no illusions about the future; that  too, may be difficult. But together we have overcome so many obstacles in the past, and I believe we  can do so again in the future" - John Major  <p>  <p>"Ultimately the best service we can render to the victims of the conflict is to tackle the causes  in such a way that the nightmare of violence will never return" - John Bruton  <p>  <p>"Today we have heard strong views put by all the different sides, as we would expect, and we will  consult with the parties individually and bilaterally to see how best we move this process forward" - Michael Ancram  <p>  <p>"We are here to take our part with others in the collective task of building a peace settlement. We  are here as peacebuilders" - Gerry Adams  <p>  <p>"There may be some arguments. There will be arguments about procedures and agenda but we will sort  those out. We will approach this process in a positive manner" - David Trimble  <p>  <p>"We have succeeded in preventing the two governments from proceeding to hijack these talks,  strangle these talks and destroy these talks and get the republican agenda into motion. That will not  happen and it cannot happen" - Ian Paisley  <p>  <p>  <p>The Northern Ireland all-party talks were close to deadlock late last night as Unionists fought to  block the appointment of President Clinton's special Irish envoy, George Mitchell, as overall  chairman.  <p>  <p>There were chaotic scenes at the Castle Buildings venue at Stormont in east Belfast as the talks  got under way, 21 months after the IRA called a ceasefire and four months since it was ended with the  bombing of Canary Wharf, east London.  <p>  <p>As Sinn Fein demonstrated outside the gates at their exclusion from the talks, the British and  Irish prime ministers, John Major and John Bruton, affirmed that only an unequivocal ceasefire  announcement by the IRA would get them inside.  <p>  <p>The two premiers also made a joint appeal for progress beyond the day-long procedural wrangling by  Unionists which was still keeping Mr Mitchell from taking his place inside the talks chamber by early  evening.  <p>  <p>Mr Major held a private meeting with Unionists before the talks opened in a bid to get them to  accept Mr Mitchell as chairman. Unionists are objecting to him because they believe he will lean  towards an Irish-American nationalist agenda.  However, when the hardline Democratic Unionist leader, Ian Paisley, and the UK Unionist leader, Bob  McCartney, emerged to brief the press at 6pm there was little sign of a breakthrough.  <p>  <p>Mr Paisley said that Unionists had "succeeded in preventing the two governments from proceeding to  hijack these talks, to strangle these talks and to destroy these talks and get a republican agenda  into motion." Mr McCartney said that for once Unionists had demonstrated a considerable degree of  cohesion. "We have seen democracy at work." The Ulster Unionist leader, David Trimble, was more  circumspect, only saying that he was reserving judgment on Mr Mitchell's role.  <p>  <p>An hour earlier, Mr Major, looking relaxed and happy with the day's developments, said: "I think at  the end of the day George Mitchell will prove to be acceptable."  <p>  <p>The Prime Minister said another opportunity for a peace settlement might not come as easily. "The  eyes of people, not just in Northern Ireland but in the Republic and elsewhere in the United Kingdom  and right around the world are on these negotiations. There is a great deal of hope residing in the  belief that these negotiations offer the best opportunity for a peaceful settlement in Northern  Ireland which we have seen for many decades.  <p>  <p>"We cannot afford to fail because the opportunities now being opened, having reached this far in  discussions, may not easily re-emerge were this opportunity not to be taken."  <p>  <p>He said that people were sick and tired of the wrangling. "They want their politicians and the  governments to come together and actually see if they can find a solution. I think there is a powerful  imperative, an obligation on the governments and all the parties to do everything they can to reach a  settlement."  <p>  <p>If the parties failed they would not have to answer to the British and Irish governments. "They  would have to answer to the people of Northern Ireland." Mr Bruton made history by speaking to elected  Unionist politicians at negotiations held in Northern Ireland without protest. He stressed the  changing face of Irish nationalism and the need to accommodate differing identities and allegiances.  <p>  <p>He took the opportunity to put the two governments' proposal for a settlement at centre stage -  even though Unionists have rejected it. "Both governments have accepted that we share a responsibility  to lead the process of overcoming the divisions of the past and the search for a new accommodation.  <p>  <p>"In exercise of our leadership role the two governments have described a shared understanding of  the parameters of a possible outcome to the negotiations in the framework document, A New Framework,  for agreement. Both governments having acknowledged our responsibility, it is essential that we  discharge it fully."  <p>  <p>The talks offered the first chance for over 70 years for all involved, including those who have  traditionally relied on physical force, to get round the same table to map out a future of peace, of  justice, of hope. "The campaigning demand of the republican movement has been 'peace talks now'. Today  is now. It is a matter of grave disappointment to my government that Sinn Fein are not at this table  today. The responsibility for ensuring that Sinn Fein can now take part rests clearly on the IRA, who  have the capacity to restore unequivocally the cessation of violence of August 1994. "There will be no  change in the position of the two governments. That position is rooted in democracy," he told the  delegates.  <p>  <p>Earlier he attended the funeral of Garda detective Gerry McCabe, who was shot dead on Friday by  paramilitaries, believed by Irish police to be IRA members.  <p>  <p>Outside the gates of the talks, the Sinn Fein president, Gerry Adams, said he led his delegation  "not to protest but to participate". But after a Northern Ireland Office official read out a joint  government statement explaining that they would not be allowed in until the ceasefire was restored, Mr  Adams said: "We feel cheated that we have been denied the right to be part of a collective process to  build peace."  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>John Major scores own-goal for criticising lottery grants</b><br><br><br><b><h2>12 June  1996</h2></b><br><h2>PM blunders with lottery grants jibe  </h2>
  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>David Brindle</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>The Prime Minister last night seemed to have scored an own-goal when he launched an outspoken  attack on the National Lottery Charities Board for giving "ill-judged" grants to groups working with  gays, prostitutes and asylum-seekers.  <p>  <p>It emerged that two of the four groups cited by John Major's office had been government-funded. A  third has been consulted regularly by the Metropolitan Police.  <p>  <p>Mr Major told the Commons that the boards distributing lottery good-cause money "from time to time  make awards that are ill-founded and ill-judged". Speaking at prime minister's question time, Mr Major said: "A small number do not in my judgment reflect the way Parliament and the  public expected lottery money to be spent."  <p>  <p>His comments came after the lottery charities board awarded a total &#163;159m to 2,229  organisations working with young people and those on low income. Recipients include Scout and Guide  groups and large, mainstream charities like Help the Aged, the Samaritans, ChildLine and the NSPCC. A  spokesman for Mr Major said his remarks had been prompted by grants totalling almost &#163;225,000 by  the board to the Scottish Prostitutes Education Project, the West Midlands Anti-Deportation Campaign,  the Leicester Lesbian, Gay and Bisexual Centre, and Gay and Lesbian London Policing.  <p>  <p>Although not named by Downing Street, the Reading-based Reach Out Lesbian, Gay and Bisexual Youth  Group received &#163;111,681 for a three-year research and development project. The Milton Keynes  Lesbian, Gay and Bisexual Youthline also got &#163;67,472 for three years.  <p>  <p>As further details of the groups emerged, it was confirmed that the Scottish Prostitutes Education  Project had been funded by &#163;8,460 a year for the past three years by the Scottish Office with the  aim of "minimising the spread of Aids among prostitutes in Scotland".  <p>  <p>It also emerged that the Leicester group had been funded under a Home Office scheme, launched by  Margaret Thatcher, and had received grants from the Department of Health.  <p>  <p>Gay and Lesbian London Policing has regularly been called on by the police for advice on the gay  community. It is said to be well respected by the Metropolitan force.  <p>  <p>Mr Major's comments brought echoes of the embarrassment suffered last autumn by Brian Mawhinney,  Conservative Party chairman, when he ridiculed a Labour council's funding of the Hopscotch Asian  Women's Group in north London - only to find it was also supported by the Home Office.  <p>  <p>Downing Street said Mr Major's attention was drawn to the four groups by Virginia Bottomley, the  National Heritage Secretary, who has overall responsibility for the lottery. She had asked for a  report from David Sieff, who chairs the charities board.  <p>  <p>The board, which has full autonomy to make awards of its choosing, last night defended the schemes  as having been chosen on merit.  <p>  <p>Mr Sieff said: "Projects assisting gay people, lesbians and deportees account for less than one per  cent of the &#163;159m awarded today. The board will be willing to explain the benefits of the  particular schemes it has approved to ministers and the media."  <p>  <p>The board has been under fire for its awards, which have so far concentrated on poverty and youth  issues, since it started making grants last October. It yesterday announced it was to seek the views  of the public on which charities should benefit. "Public focus groups" are being set up this summer in  each English region and in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland to supplement voluntary sector  consultation.  <p>  <p>Of the &#163;159m awarded yesterday, &#163;68m is going to 964 charities working with people on low income and &#163;91m to 1,265 youth issue groups.  <p>  <p><b>On the list</b>  <p>  <p>Scottish Prostitutes Education Project: Provides support and information to young male and female  prostitutes; has been funded by Lothian health board and the Scottish Office; based in Edinburgh.  &#163;81,553 lottery cash over three years will pay for a staff member, office, training and running  costs.   <p>  <p>West Midlands Anti-Deportation Campaign: supports and provides information for asylum-seekers,  refugees and others affected by the Immigration and Asylum Act; based in Birmingham. &#163;65,858 over  three years to produce information material.  <p>  <p>Leicester Lesbian, Gay and Bisexual Centre: provides counselling and support; has been funded by  Home Office and Department of Health. &#163;49,586 over three years will pay for part-time and  sessional youth workers, and fund related running costs.  <p>  <p>Gay and Lesbian London Policing (Galop): civilian group which monitors the policing of the  capital's gay community and advises the Metropolitan Police. &#163;26,100 for one year to employ a  full-time 'outreach' worker and meet running costs of a support service for young victims of  homophobic abuse and attacks.  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>John Major scores own-goal for criticising lottery grants</b><br><br><br><b><h2>13 June  1996</h2></b><br><h2>No easy prizes in the obstacle race for funding </h2>
  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Martin Wainwright</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>Funding gay help groups with lottery money is an excellent subject for a public ding-dong, but the  Prime Minister's use of "ill-judged" is unlikely to be borne out by any examination of the application  process. To succeed in the obstacle race of a National Lottery Charities Board application - beating  odds of some 9-1 - an application must show more than ordinary merit and convince a succession of  generally cautious judges. Room for whimsy or political correctness is negligible in the basic marking  scheme, the product of much consultation with the voluntary and charitable sector, which provides the  initial league table.  <p>  <p>Applying groups must be financially sound and well-managed with relevant and thoroughly planned  projects, organised and properly staffed, cost-effective, designed to include regular monitoring of  progress and with a strategy ready for the day when the lottery grant runs out. They are then marked  systematically on relevance to the theme of each round (youth and low income in this week's grants,  health disability and care in the next), equal opportunities and the involvement of users.  <p>  <p>The application form provides the initial data. Next comes the detailed investigation by an  assessor, usually from the charity or social work field, and the rock on which the whole operation  stands.  <p>  <p>There are weaknesses in this rock: it is early days for effective moderation of those assessors who  tend to mark on either the high or low side; and the sheer weight of applications means some projects  are assessed by telephone rather than a visit. But every assessment I have seen is impressively long  and detailed; and each must go for further scrutiny by an NLCB grants officer at headquarters and - in  any large and most complicated or potentially controversial cases - for a second assessment by a  different assessor.  <p>  <p>And so, classified into a league table of merit, it reaches panels like mine, which are naturally  loath to muck about too much with the basic marking pattern. Among our highest-scoring projects this  time was the Bradford Lesbian and Gay Youth Project, whose &#163;16,884 was not singled out by John  Major. Rightly, because it had received the second-highest mark (equal) of all Yorkshire and  Humberside's 169 successful applicants. It was not agonised over by the panel. There would only have  been two reasons for rejecting it: a belief that gays should not receive lottery money, and fear of  headlines taking one small grant (0.13 per cent of the regional total of &#163;12,800,000) out of  context.  <p>  <p>The application went on for yet more checks: scrutiny by the England board member with an informal  brief to watchdog our region (Julia Kaufmann, director of BBC Children in Need), and final  consideration by the NLCB's England Committee which carries the official can.  <p>  <p>I understand the kneejerk reaction. Shock: Bradford gays win grant, North Yorkshire scout group  gets nil. But the situation looks different when you know that the gays scored 20 times higher than  those particular scouts. And another West Yorkshire gay and lesbian group failed in its bid, while  Bradford sea cadets got &#163;30,500.  <p>  <p>Martin Wainwright is chair of the Yorkshire and Humberside regional advisory panel of the National  Lottery Charities Board.  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Gary Younge</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>After the wife swap, the house swap. A bizarre truce which may end public feuding between Paula  Yates and her ex-husband, Bob Geldof, will allow her to live in his house - while he gets to live in  the home of her boyfriend, pop star Michael Hutchence.  <p>  <p>"After three days of complete bloody nightmare in the High Court of Justice, Bob and Paula have  with collective sighs of relief arrived amicably at a half-decent solution to their housing  arrangements," read a handwritten statement confirmed by their lawyers.  "Paula and the kids will move into the house in Chelsea. Bob will move into Michael's house down  the road. Thanks very much."  <p>  <p>In a postscript they warned journalists that any future squabbling between the estranged couple  would carry on in private.  "Neither of us will talk about this any further so please don't doorstep us. Thanks."  <p>  <p>But scarcely had the ink dried on the deal before the couple were breaking their own rules. Amid  raised voices Ms Yates was heard to say: "Nineteen years and you just wanted to see me out on the  street." She then went on to describe one of Mr Geldof's friends as a "slapper".  <p>  <p>For a consummate self-publicist like Ms Yates, 36, who has told the world she was not potty trained  until she was five, anorexic at eight and sexually intimate with an Argentinian at 12, the devil was  always going to be in the detail.  "We are like the Addams family," she said yesterday.  <p>  <p>In his green tweed three-piece suit, neatly knotted silk tie, razor thin sideburns with goatee to  match, Geldof was clearly playing Lurch to Ms Yates's Morticia.  Outside the courthouse Geldof attempted to inject a note of sobriety into the occasion. "There's a  world outside, a very serious world, and where Paula and Bob's life is of no significance."  <p>  <p>But the serious world has so far found it difficult to look kindly upon the couple whose  relationship started more than 18 years ago with oral sex in a taxi, produced three children called  Fifi Trixibelle, 12, Peaches, six, and Pixie, four, and ended yesterday in a hand-written agreement on  a scruffy piece of paper.  <p>  <p>Nor was their seriousness enhanced by Ms Yates's ante-natal pregnancy squats at Geldof's feet as  they discussed accountants and furniture. Ms Yates is nearly seven months pregnant by Hutchence, of  the Australian rock band INXS, and plans to call her fourth baby Heavenly Hirani. She claimed the  right to move back to the &#163;750,000 Chelsea house she shared with 41-year-old Geldof during their  marriage, which was dissolved a month ago. She was due to have to move from her current Victorian home  in Clapham, south-west London, where she lives with her children. Ms Yates, who is reported to have  &#163;100,000 in debts, almost had that house repossessed. <p>  <p>Geldof, reputed to be worth &#163;20m,  lives with French actress Jeanne Marine, aged 25 at his &#163;1.2m mansion in Faversham, Kent. Today's settlement means he  will have temporary use of Hutchence's Cheyne Walk home, which has a commercial owner. Hutchence is in  France. It was suggested last night that the agreement was about accommodation rather than ownership  of the Geldof house, giving Ms Yates somewhere to stay while she is pregnant. The couple may return to  court later this year to hammer out a final settlement.  <p>  <p>After the two brief private hearings yesterday afternoon the couple posed for photographers on the  steps of the Law Courts before driven away. This time in separate taxis.  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Guernsey votes to legalise abortion</b><br><br><br><b><h2>14 June 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Guernsey votes to make abortions legal  </h2>
  <br><br>      <p>The parliament of Guernsey yesterday voted to legalise abortion almost 30 years after it became legal in Britain. The move follows months of debate which has divided the island.  <p>  <p>After two days of debate, the States of Deliberation agreed to a proposal to repeal a law that makes having an abortion punishable by life imprisonment. The grounds for allowing abortion are similar to those on the mainland but slightly stricter.  <p>  <p>Unlike Britain, which places no time limit on abortions where there is a strong possibility of a serious risk of physical or mental abnormality in the child, Guernsey has placed a 24-week limit.  <p>  <p>It is also proposed that abortions should not be carried out after the 12th week of a pregnancy except where the health of the woman or child is at significant risk.  <p>  <p>In Britain abortions can be carried out up to 24 weeks, where it is thought the continuance of a pregnancy would cause greater harm to a woman or her family than if it was terminated.  <p>  <p>The parliament divided only on this clause. Voting was 22 for and 18 against. The proposals will now go to the island's law department which will draft a bill. This will then go to the Privy Council for final approval. Anti-abortionists, led by Cynthia Kennedy, a veteran of the American movement, have distributed graphic leaflets to thousands of homes. Pro-choice campaigners have responded with petitions.  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Guernsey votes to legalise abortion</b><br><br><br><b><h2>18 June 1996</h2></b><br><h2>An island divided</h2><h3> Last week, Guernsey  voted to make abortion legal. End of story?  </h3>  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Jonathan Rugman</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>Many people on Guernsey are proud of their quaint island traditions; their manicured lawns, 35mph speed limit, low taxes, massed  churchgoing and the fact that you can't buy a drink or hire a video on Sundays. It is the kind of place where restaurants still call salt and  pepper 'condiments' and where a condom remains 'something for the weekend'. On the seafront there is a Morris Minor parked outside a sweet  shop, where a familiar Walls sign swings reassuringly in the breeze.  <p>  <p>But go inside and ask the customers about last week's decision to decriminalise abortion - the last part of the British Isles to do so -  and all agree that nothing has done more to shatter Guernsey's peace since the German Occupation itself.  <p>  <p>"I think they're a miserable bunch of sods," says one man, describing those deputies in the island's parliament who opposed the vote.  <p>  <p>"Who do the politicians think they are?" agrees the woman who runs the shop. "If you don't want the child, don't have it." But then an  older man explains that his half-sister was the product of a scandalous liaison with a German officer and that even during those dark wartime  days, there was no talk of abortion. "If a woman's pregnant, she's got to have it," he concludes. "The Guernseyman is a very reserved,  stubborn kind of local. We don't want your English ways." Last week's abortion debate was so fraught that priests were praying in the public  gallery before the 33-18 result in favour was announced. BBC Radio Guernsey mounted a rolling news service to keep pace with the  heart-searching. One deputy likened abortion to Hitler's final solution; when another wanted to describe the process of removing a foetus  from the womb, several others walked out.  <p>  <p>"I received so much hate mail that I dreaded the post coming," says Pat Mellor, one of those deputies who supported the motion. Another,  Mary Lowe, received a telephone call warning her that Guernsey's streets would be "strewn with blood". Feelings are still running so high  that normally law-abiding citizens have threatened not to pay their social insurance and health scheme contributions if the law is ratified.  <p>  <p>This is not the first time debate over women's rights has caused rancour. Statutory equal pay was debated and rejected in the Eighties.  "We were told to be patient, girls, your time will come," says Jean Pritchard, a senior parliamentarian and owner of a vegetarian cafe. In  1993 came a vote against a UN Convention on sexual equality, while three months ago a proposal for unpaid statutory maternity leave was  thrown out.  <p>  <p>"If you say you support women's rights, they think you're either a troublemaker or a Leftie," says Mary Lowe, pointing out that up to now,  at least 150 women a year have had to travel to the mainland for abortions. "All we are saying is that women should have the choice here  rather than exporting their problems." The new legislation permits abortion up to the 12th week where the mother's physical or mental health  is at risk, up to 24 weeks in cases of severe foetal abnormality, and without time limit to save the mother's life. Two of the island's 30 or  so doctors must give their permission.  <p>  <p>While the pro-choice lobby may have won the vote, however, the fight is far from over. Oliver Le Tessier, a deputy and Baptist Church  'elder', says he and his colleagues will now do what they can to ensure the bill is not ratified until after the next election, in nine  months' time. He hopes the new parliament will by then be so full of pro-lifers that abortion will never make it to the statute books.  <p>  <p>"People love this island and don't want it to go the way of the UK," Le Tessier says "Once a baby is born, I've never known it to be  unwanted. I've got many friends with disabled children and they are lovely." Le Tessier's objections extend from his conviction that abortion  is murder to his concern that if Guernsey legalises it, a whole host of unpleasantnesses - from euthanasia to road rage - will soon follow.  <p>  <p>Down the coast at the King's Centre, one of several evangelical churches on the island, the Reverend Jonathan le Tocq regrets the result  but says the debate has helped Guernsey's churchgoers focus on what their faith is all about. No one has left his 200-strong congregation  over the issue; if anything, his church has gained new followers. The Reverend is praying the law will never be ratified. "If a rapist feels  it's now easier for a woman to get an abortion, then maybe he won't mind what he does," he warns, recommending the "joy of adoption" rather  than termination as the way forward.  <p>  <p>Meanwhile, for Ruth (not her real name), who undertook a miserable trip to a Bournemouth clinic for her abortion 18 months ago, last  week's vote spells the beginning of the end of the attitude among Guernsey men that women are a sub-species who need to be protected from  themselves. "They don't realise how barbaric it is, having to fly to another country for an abortion, with none of your family around to  support you," she says.  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>IRA bomb explodes in Manchester</b><br><br><br><b><h2>17 June 1996</h2></b><br><h2>  Violence beyond belief</h2>
<h3> Sinn Fein's credibility shattered  </h3><br><b>Leading article</b>  <br><br><br>      <p>IRA bombs are political acts and a serious attempt must always be made to examine them as such,  especially by those of us for whom such forms of political violence are tactics beyond belief. This  applies just as much to the bomb that went off in central Manchester on Saturday morning, injuring 200  wholly innocent people, as to any of its predecessors. But how, even trying to put all indignation  aside, are we to interpret this largest bomb ever to be detonated on the British mainland as anything  other than the deliberate burial of the 1993-96 Northern Ireland peace process? The bomb in Manchester  (a city full of Irish connections) is a classic republican statement. It was a reassertion that the  'armed struggle' (against Saturday shoppers and their children?) continues to be absolutely central to  republican strategy. <p>  <p>Whether that message was intended for the IRA itself or for the British  government is academic. The IRA may indeed intend such bombings to reassure its 'volunteers' that  theirs is a movement which ultimately subsists upon the cult of blood sacrifice. It may also intend  the British government to understand that it will not be able to guarantee security to its own  citizens for as long as Northern Ireland remains part of the United Kingdom. But the principal message  is that the republican movement has not renounced the use of violence and never will. It is also a  broader reminder that the IRA is a law unto itself. <p>  <p>In this sense the bombing is exactly parallel to  the murder of Garda detective Jerry McCabe in County Limerick 10 days ago. Hours before the bomb went  off in Manchester, the IRA finally admitted what it had denied for the previous eight days, that a  seven-man IRA team had killed Det McCabe during an unsuccessful post office van robbery. Det McCabe  was Irish and the weekend's injured Mancunians were mainly British, but they are all victims of an  organisation which operates to its own rules, outside the laws of all countries, not just those of the  'occupying' British. On one level the IRA may exist to liberate Ireland from the hated Brits. On  another it exists, like Bonnie and Clyde, to rob banks and kill people.  <p>  <p>Yet the Manchester bomb is presumably also an act with intended political consequences. There is  much speculation at the moment that republican strategists were impressed by the speed with which the  Canary Wharf bomb in February was followed by an announcement of all-party talks for 10 June. By that  analogy, the Manchester bomb may also be intended to be both an expression of displeasure at Sinn  Fein's exclusion from the talks and a means of focusing attention (particularly of the British  government, which is axiomatically always the villain in republican eyes) on the desirability of  getting them into the process that started a week ago this morning. If so, it is hard to see that  happening, not least because the two situations are very different. <p>  <p>The British government mishandled  events in January, especially around the release of the Mitchell Report, and its delaying tactics  forfeited its credibility and allies. When the Canary Wharf bomb exploded, there was a genuine sense  in which British tactics had contributed to the end of the ceasefire, even if the failure did not  excuse it. None of that is remotely true today. The British government is not isolated; indeed it is  more solidly aligned with the Irish government, the Northern Ireland parties and international opinion  than at any stage in the process. Nobody outside the immediate republican movement holds John Major  even partially responsible for the Manchester bombing. Nor, after Manchester, is there any discernible  feeling in this country that the ball is in Mr Major's court.  <p>  <p>Yet supposing that it was, with whom should Mr Major deal? With Gerry Adams? Even with the best  will in the world, this is not credible at the moment. A lot of people have stuck their necks out on  behalf of Gerry Adams, from Bill Clinton down to the Northern Ireland people who took the slogan A  Vote For Sinn Fein Is A Vote For Peace at face value less than three weeks ago. The Manchester bomb  has made those sometimes well-intentioned and occasionally brave folk look stupid. The ending of the  ceasefire in February and the renewal of the bombing campaign this weekend mean that Mr Adams's word  is practically worthless. <p>  <p>At the end of last week, Mr Adams denounced the killing of Det McCabe as  "totally and absolutely wrong" and indignantly attacked those who sought to link the killing to Sinn  Fein. Two days later, the IRA admitted responsibility. Did Mr Adams therefore condemn the IRA as  totally and absolutely wrong? Was that a pig flying past the window? Take another, even more  important, example. Four weeks ago, Mr Adams confirmed that Sinn Fein was fully signed up for the  "Mitchell principles" and was therefore available for all-party talks. Yet those principles include  the endorsement of exclusively peaceful means of resolving issues, the renunciation of force and the  opposition to its use by others, not to mention the disarmament of paramilitary organisations and the  end to violent punishments. If being 'signed up' to those principles means anything at all, it must  mean the direct denunciation of the Manchester bomb and of the organisation which exploded it. Mr  Adams will not and cannot do that. That is why Sinn Fein could not possibly be allowed into the talks  without an IRA ceasefire.  <p>  <p>Some observers speculate that the bombing in Manchester will shortly be followed by an announcement  of a ceasefire. If so, that will no longer be enough to allow Sinn Fein immediate entry into talks.  Michael Howard was right, for once, to say that the real world is not like that. If there had been no  Manchester bombing it would have been a different matter. In that case, those who argued that there  was still a ceasefire in Ulster and that there had been a de facto cessation in Britain since April  would have had a right to be listened to with respect. The breaching of the ceasefire in February and  March could have been treated as an aberration. But the Manchester bombing shows it was not an  aberration but an upfront continuing tactic. How can anyone, whether disposed in favour of Irish  nationalism, let alone against it, rely on a word that Sinn Fein now says? There is no evidence that  they can deliver for peace, and plenty of evidence that they intend to continue with war. Unless and  until that changes, there is no point in talking to them in the current process. Sadly, we could be  waiting a long time. If so, let it be clear that on this occasion the delay is not our government's  fault.  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Michael Durham</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>Part of Manchester could be sealed off for up to a week, police said yesterday. Damage was  estimated by one insurance assessor at more than &#163;100m. Yesterday a large area of the city  remained cordoned off as police forensic experts and fire crews searched the area at the centre of the  blast and engineers inspected damage. More than 400 businesses are affected.  <p>  <p>Later police allowed small groups of keyholders and residents into an outer security zone under  escort to recover property and vehicles. However, an inner zone of about half a mile square remained  sealed off.  <p>  <p>Chief Inspector Peter Harris of Greater Manchester police said that the damage was appalling. "The  blast seemed to carry round corners and travel huge distances."  He told a meeting of 500 shop keyholders and residents in Manchester Town Hall that the aim was to  restore the city to normal as soon as possible. "But don't ask me how long that will take."  <p>  <p>Amid the devastation yesterday, dozens of German football fans appeared unperturbed by the scenes  of destruction. However, there was a subdued air in the city, punctured by the continual crash of  glass as glaziers set about replacing windows.  Malcolm Sanford, Manchester council's chief executive, said surveyors estimated that two thirds of  the buildings in the outer cordon were badly damaged with masonry and glass hanging over streets.  <p>  <p>Police were also concerned about looters. Several people had been arrested. The 112,000 sq ft Marks  & Spencer store, which bore the brunt of the blast, is one of the retail group's biggest and busiest.  The &#163;200m Arndale Centre across the road contains most of the leading high street names among its 200 shops,  including BHS, Littlewoods, WH Smith, Argos and Boots. Bomb damage has left a question mark over the  future of the 20-year-old centre. Phil Clark, store director of Lewis's department store, said:  "Shopkeepers in the central zone have been told to go home because there is no chance of getting in  for a couple of days."  <p>  <p>Keyholders allowed in spoke of acres of broken windows, collapsed ceilings, and devastated shop  fittings.  A security manager at the Cooperative Retail Society said: "We had to knock out 83 panes of glass.  There was glass all over the place and ceilings were down. We expected a bomb after the police warning  but nothing as big as this."  <p>  <p>A manager at a National Westminster Bank regional centre said: "Luckily we had put in bomb-proof  glass, and damage could have been worse. Police only allowed us half an hour to collect essential  files."  <p>  <p>In Albert Square, glaziers' vans queued all day to be allowed in. One man said he was unable to  return to his flat.  "'I have been told I must get a pass from the council but I have no proof of identity with me so  they won't give me one. All I've got is the clothes I'm wearing."  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Family Law Bill </b><br><br><br><b><h2>19 June 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Mediation is  the message</h2>
<h3> But it is vital that the service is properly funded  </h3><br><b>Leading article</b>  <br><br><br>      <p>Five years ago there would have been celebrations: the first serious reform of the divorce laws for  25 years. Rational observers would have been describing the new divorce procedure as a logical  sequence to the 1969 Children Act in putting children's interests first. But that was before  back-to-basics moralists seized the Conservative agenda and ended any chance of a bipartisan approach  to a much needed social reform. Instead, the Family Law Bill passed through its final hurdle in the  House of Commons late on Monday with divisons within both liberal and conservative camps over the  outcome. In one of the most bitterly disputed legal reforms in a decade, liberals are in danger of  minimising the benefits which the new procedure will bestow.  <p>  <p>A generation ago the 1969 Act aimed to introduce a 'no fault' system, backed by 'Putting Asunder',  a report from the Archbishop of Canterbury's Committee which argued there should be only one ground  for divorce: irretrievable breakdown. Unfortunately, three grounds by which the irretrievable  breakdown could be demonstrated, continued to apportion blame: adultery, intolerable behaviour,  desertion. Twenty-seven years on, the grounds which the 1969 architects hoped would be used - a period  of separation - will now come into force. Couples will be required to register their intent to  separate, be advised on the availability of marriage counselling or mediation, but finally be granted  a divorce after 12 to 18 months of separation depending on whether they have children.  <p>  <p>The reason the old system needed reform was the damage it was wreaking on children. Rarely has  there been so much humbug, distortion and plain misrepresentation of social research. There are  roughly 150,000 divorces every year, just over a half with children. Partly due to the bitterness  generated by the present procedure, as many as 40 per cent of children lose touch with one of their  parents within two years. That is almost one million children cut off from a parent in the last  decade. No one suggests divorce is good for children, but the research shows unequivocally that  parental conflict causes more damage than divorce. Thousands of children have been hurt in the current  acrimonious lawyer-led process, which is now to be replaced by a mediator-directed procedure.  <p>  <p>The new procedure is designed to reduce conflict between separating couples and ease the  arrangements over finance, property and, most important of all, parental contact with children. The  crucial task now for reformers is to ensure that the legal aid savings in lawyer costs, which the new  mediation process should generate, is invested in comprehensive counselling and mediation services.  Both these services have been surviving on peanuts. Both will need to be transformed. If marriage  counselling is to achieve ministerial goals then waiting times must be drastically reduced. For too  many couples, counselling comes too late. Mediation comes into operation where counselling is rejected  or proved fruitless. Mediation has nothing to do with conciliation - or reconciliation - but is  designed to help couples make decisions about their divorce. Currently about 6,500 couples use the  service. When the new Act is in force, mediators could be handling 50,000. It won't be compulsory but  policy-makers believe at least 40 per cent of couples with children will opt for the mediator-directed  process. This should be celebrated. Research shows that it reduces the acrimony, bitterness and  hostility of the current process. What would be unforgivable, given the delay in this long overdue  reform, would be a shortage of mediators. Reformers will need to remain vigilant.  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Family Law Bill </b><br><br><br><b><h2>19 June 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Divorce rebels vow to fight on</h2>
<h3>  Baroness Young to lead diehards in battle for 'fault' statement after MPs endorse Family Law Bill   </h3>  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Rebecca Smithers</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>The campaign by Tory diehards to wreck the Lord Chancellor's divorce reform bill refused to take no  for an answer yesterday.  Faced with a Commons third reading majority of 418 for the Family Law Bill, the diehards pledged to  fight on when the legislation makes its final appearance in the Lords.  <p>  <p>For those who have followed every twist and turn of Lord Mackay's controversial bill, the  determination expressed by former ministers like Baroness Young, John Patten and Edward Leigh, came as  no surprise. They had undermined the flagship of the Government's legislative programme with an  orchestrated campaign enthusiastically backed by the Daily Mail, triggering wider unease about  'anti-family' reforms which they feared would push up divorce rates.  <p>  <p>These fears surfaced again in the Commons on Monday night, when 20 ministers - including five  cabinet ministers - voted against a government-backed amendment to reduce the waiting period for  divorce from 21 months to 18 months.  <p>  <p>Labour wrenched a last-minute concession on pension splitting as the price for its support,  allowing the legislation to receive its third reading. Just minutes before the debate, Labour's legal  affairs spokesman, Paul Boateng, could be seen in intense negotiations with Gary Streeter, the  minister in the Lord Chancellor's Department. Mr Streeter only agreed to accept the change after Mr  Boateng dramatically threatened that there would be "no Family Law Bill" unless ministers caved in.  <p>  <p>The divorce reforms will come into force some time in 1998. They allow 'no fault' divorce after a  waiting period of 18 months - or 12 months in certain cases. Provisions strengthening protection for  victims of domestic violence are likely to be introduced sooner.  <p>  <p>The bill is expected to receive royal assent shortly after the Lords endorses the Commons  amendments - probably next Thursday - when there will be scope for some, albeit limited, change. The  reforms are designed to stem the rising tide of divorce in Britain, where on current trends one in  nine couples will divorce before their fifth wedding anniversary. England and Wales now have the  highest divorce rate in Europe - almost twice the average.  <p>  <p>Yesterday Baroness Young - the former Conservative leader of the Lords who spearheaded the earlier  Lords rebellion - was seeking government support for a statement that could be written on to a final  divorce notice, stating that a spouse was divorced against his or her will. Rebels failed to get  support for a religious beliefs clause which would have blocked divorce in certain cases where  ostracisation or hardship could be proved, but believe that the Government may back the idea of the  statement.  <p>  <p>She acknowledged there was no chance of forcing any significant changes and that the bill would go  through, but stressed her strong objection to scrapping the giving of reasons for ending marriage.  "It's quite wrong to abolish fault," she said. "We have undermined the status of marriage." Even  Tories were privately claiming that it was Labour that was clearly in control of the bill on Monday  night.  <p>  <p>Labour will continue its assault on the Government over certain aspects of the bill, including the  failure of ministers to provide any costings of the provision of free marriage counselling services.  <p>  <p>Yesterday the Lord Chancellor, Lord Mackay, insisted that the principles of the legislation had  survived. "The main structure of the bill is as it was," he told BBC Radio 4's 'Today' programme.  "The provision of a cooling-off period, its emphasis on trying to save saveable marriages with  mediation available, and much improved protection against domestic violence and in respect of the  matrimonial home - all of these are as the bill was."  <p>  <p>And the Social Security Secretary, Peter Lilley, sought to play down the significance of the  concession on pension splitting by claiming that the Government's acceptance of Labour's demand had  not changed its position. But the Law Society - which withdrew its support for the bill last month -  warned it would create a system that was "complex, lengthy, inflexible and uncertain". "Amendments  made during the final stages have not delivered any significant improvements," it said in a statement.  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Dowser in demand in drought-stricken Yorkshire</b><br><br><br><b><h2>19 June 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Dowser offers drought solution  </h2>
  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Peter Hetherington</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>Armed with a forked whale bone as a divining rod, Edwin Taylor earnestly paced the car park behind the soft drinks company in Featherstone, West Yorkshire.  <p>  <p>"I've found one, 50 metres down," he announced as the rod dipped abruptly. "Should be plenty there for you."  <p>  <p>An incredulous works engineer rushed forward to mark the spot with a big white cross. "You've got to believe it, haven't you?" smiled Graham Ladlow. "We'd like to get to this tomorrow but, realistically, it could take us four months or so."  <p>  <p>By acting as a water dowser for local firms, Mr Taylor has brought hope to parts of drought-stricken Yorkshire, where reservoirs are still 35 per cent below capacity.  <p>  <p>The Featherstone company, which produces 130,000 two litre bottles a day and supplies supermarket chains, brought him in when it decided that drastic action was needed to safeguard supplies and guarantee consistency. "Our problem is the changing quality, varying between hard water and alkaline - it tastes different, depending on the day," said Mr Ladlow. "This could be the answer."  <p>  <p>Since last year's water emergency, when Yorkshire Water had to replenish reservoirs with tanker convoys from Northumbria, Mr Taylor, aged 77, has never known such demand for his services. He began as a water dowser 40 years ago on his farm near Shotley Bridge in Northumberland. "I suppose it's something you're born with, a sixth sense," he said. "You get this sensation in your arms, muscles twitch, and that's it."  <p>  <p>Ralph Barton, a water analyst from Wakefield, who advises many companies including the soft drinks factory, said he had been won over. "I didn't believe it would work, but he's never been wrong. There's an air of mysticism - a bit like faith healing."  <p>  <p>Many companies, dependent on large volumes of water, were showing interest.

  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Maev Kennedy</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>Techno-Druids and internet New Age Travellers are invited to download Stonehenge today, and  celebrate the summer solstice on the internet. "People will be able to walk among the stones -  virtually," Sir Jocelyn Stevens, chairman of English Heritage, said yesterday. "To walk virtually is  better than not to walk at all."  <p>  <p>No actual foot has been allowed into the circle, to watch the sun rise over the heelstone marking  the longest day, since a four-mile exclusion order was granted in 1986.  The order came after years of confrontations with the police over attempts to hold solstice free  festivals led to the Battle of the Beanfield in 1985, when hundreds were injured or arrested.  <p>  <p>Every year since then has seen arrests, as various people, ranging from scholars to King Arthur  Uther Pendragon, Hampshire biker turned once-and-future-king, have tried to get to the stones.  English Heritage has abandoned its custom of inviting a few hundred guests, including some  carefully screened journalists and druids, to watch the sunrise from inside the stones.  <p>  <p>The weather forecast suggests the real sunrise may be blotted out today by the first cloudy skies  and heavy showers in weeks in southern England. Virtual Stonehenge, which has just been completed by  the computer firm Intel, was put on to the internet yesterday.  The programme, developed by archaeologists, scientists and computer technicians, includes many  features invisible to the real eye. Millennia of development of the World Heritage site can be peeled  back on the screen, to the earliest circle on the site 5,000 years ago.  <p>  <p>Details of the very first structures on the site, wooden totem poles 10,500 years old, similar to  modern North American Indian poles, were published for the first time yesterday.  On the ground they are marked only as white discs in the Tarmac of the public car park, part of the  much reviled visitor centre, which was condemned as "a national disgrace" by a Commons committee some  years ago. On screen, the four poles, made from whole pine trunks, rise again to 3.4 metres high in a  heavily wooded landscape.  <p>  <p>A much more complex virtual reality model of the site, for headsets or high resolution computers,  is still being developed, and will eventually allow viewers the sensation of touching the stones.  It will be available, with virtual reality versions of other monuments in the area, like Avebury  and Old Sarum, at the planned new visitor centre. English Heritage and the National Trust, which  jointly own and manage the site, are applying for Millennium Lottery funds to restore the stones to a  4,000 acre parkland setting, without roads or electricity cables, and with all the fences and barriers  removed.  <p>  <p>Virtual Stonehenge was launched yesterday as archaeologists and conservators agonised over actual  access to ancient sites, in the wake of the vandalism of eight stones at Avebury earlier this week.  The stone circle, huge ditch and stone avenue at Avebury are part of the same World Heritage site  as Stonehenge, but are kept open and unfenced. The stones were completely covered with New Age symbols  in black and white paint on Tuesday night.  <p>  <p>Technical experts and archaeologists met at the site yesterday to study the damage. Initial studies  suggest that the white paint is water-based and the black bituminous, but neither can be removed  without damaging the lichen which cover the stones.  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Sex Pistols' first British gig in 18 years</b><br><br><br><b><h2>24 June 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Sex  Pistols spit out nostalgia  </h2>
  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Caroline Sullivan</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>"They've changed everything," said Paul Dickens, a 32-year-old Hull civil servant, fluffing a  newly-spiked hairdo yesterday at the Sex Pistols' first British gig in 18 years. You wouldn't have  known it to look at the four beer-bellied market traders on stage in Finsbury Park, north London, but  these were the erstwhile swearing, gobbing punk rockers who invented a genre.  <p>  <p>Since their 1978 split, Johnny Rotten, Steve Jones, Glen Matlock and Paul Cook have never failed to  profess their mutual hatred. Every band has its price, though, and for a reported &#163;6m, the  Pistols are prepared to put on their best sneers and hit the road.  With customary frankness, they've titled the 20-date European leg, which began Friday in Finland,  the Filthy Lucre tour.  <p>  <p>Since announcing the temporary reunion in March, the group, now all 40-plus, have reverted to type,  boasting about the fortune they'll make. But this is not at all certain: Finsbury Park failed to sell  out, despite months of advertising and a bill featuring fellow old-timers Stiff Little Fingers and the  Buzzcocks.  <p>  <p>Rotten, who reverted to his real name of John Lydon when he moved to California in the 1980s, had  expressed the hope that reviewers' wheelchairs would get stuck in the mud. One presumes that he meant  the decades of mud encrusted in fans' grubby leather jackets. Some of them must have been in storage  for years, awaiting this moment. Their owners were a combination of multi-earringed diehards, 40-ish  accountant types and the odd incredulous youth, who peered at Stiff Little Fingers pityingly.  <p>  <p>Perhaps surprisingly, the Buzzcocks' balding singer, Pete Shelley, seemed to agree: "Haven't you  had enough nostalgia yet?" he asked at the beginning of a set composed mostly of new material.  <p>  <p>The few safety pins on display last night were worn nostalgically, not rebelliously and there were  certainly none anywhere near the Pistols. Lydon had made an effort to be Rotten, teasing his hair into  gummy blue tufts, but the others looked every bit the middle-aged home-owners they are. Compared to  the rippling hemispheres of muscle of the support act Iggy Pop, the headliners eloquently epitomised  the dangers of too much lager and too little anarchy.  <p>  <p>Introduced by the England footballer Stuart Pearce, they didn't so much walk onstage as spill  through a paper screen of old news headlines. Lydon went into 'on' mode as if he'd been plugged in,  staring, flailing and pretending to masturbate. Not to be outdone, Jones croaked: "Oo wants a quick  shag?" With those shiny trousers? Forget it.  <p>  <p>Lydon's dog-attracting yelp sent the crowd into paroxysms of pogoing. They grew dangerously  frantic; as the band churned through 'Bodies', 'I'm A Lazy Sod' and 'God Save The Queen', it was every man  for himself - pogo or die. Soundbites? Johnny obliged. "It's only Uncle Johnny and the boys here -  fat, 40 and back. How you longed to see the day," he cackled. "Any journalists here? Send 'em to me  and I shall deal with them." Despite that, however, he was hardly confrontational, and of what use is  a mellowed-out John Lydon? He was more than mellow, he was positively showbizzy, asking us good people  to sing along to the corporation-toppling EMI. Well, he did say fat and 40. The former scourge of  Finsbury Park has come home, and he's a rather endearing pussycat.  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Sadler's Wells theatre closes</b><br><br><br><b><h2>24 June 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Sadler's Wells  closes before next encore  </h2>
  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Dan Glaister</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>"How we all detested Sadler's Wells when it was opened first!" That was John Gielgud in 1931, the  year he acted in the London theatre's first production with the Old Vic company. He was not the only  one. Since it opened, Sadler's Wells has provoked exasperation and love from its performers, backstage  and administrative staff in not quite equal measure. Last night that changed. A 1,500-strong sell-out  audience for a cabaret finale performance saw the last curtain fall. It is to be replaced by a  state-of-the-art, 1,600-seat theatre, which will host dance and opera, in 1998.  <p>  <p>The Sadler's Wells plan has been aided by &#163;30m of lottery money without which the theatre  would have had to close, according to Ian Albery, the chief executive.  Last night couples with Thermos flasks queued to say goodbye in the frugal spirit of its founding  genius Lilian Bayliss, who started an opera and ballet company 'for the masses' there in 1931.  <p>  <p>Inside bits of the stage were on sale as &#163;50 paperweights. In the old practice room where  Ninette de Valois discovered the schoolgirl Margot Fonteyn, Alicia Markova's old theatre programmes  were on offer for a few pounds to raise funds for the new theatre. A shawl bequeathed by the late  Tatiana Troyanos to her fellow-singer Kiri Te Kanawa had an &#163;800 price tag. Miyako Yoshida's tutu  for the Sleeping Beauty was up for &#163;1,500. It was a jumble sale of performing history.  <p>  <p>In the main theatre Godfrey Kenton - an actor with Gielgud in the inaugural 1931 production - led  the company in the sad and proud finale. Sadler's Wells was originally built on the site of a popular  summer visiting place. Two workmen discovered a fresh water spring in the garden of Mr Sadler's Musick  House in 1683 when digging for gravel, and Sadler's New Tunbridge Wells was born.  <p>  <p>Early entertainment included music, dancing, singing, melodrama, pantomime, tumbling and  wire-walking. Dr Johnson was impressed by 'The Learned Pig'. 'The storming of the Bastille' was staged six  weeks after the event itself, and the 'Battle of Gibraltar' inaugurated the new-fangled water-theatre. A  version of the 'Magic Flute' by Mozart, 'The Daughter of the Air', was first performed at Sadler's Wells a  decade before the opera we know today was introduced in Britain. The legendary clown Joe Grimaldi made  his first appearance at Sadler's Wells aged two and a half.  <p>  <p>The theatre was saved from the low reputation by Samuel Phelps, who staged 31 Shakespeare plays  during 18 years running the venue. It was saved from roller skating by Miss Baylis.  <p>  <p>Sadler's Wells has played host to many famous companies, but they have all been forced out by the  poor conditions. The Royal Ballet was born when the Sadler's Wells Ballet moved to Covent Garden; the  English National Opera came about when the Sadler's Wells Opera moved to the Coliseum. Star dancers  have appeared at Sadler's Wells in recent years, from Michael Clark to Margot Fonteyn, but the theatre  is possibly best remembered for the eccentric productions of mime artist Lindsay Kemp.  <p>  <p>Before the new Sadler's Wells opens the company will decamp to the Royalty Theatre, Kingsway, to be  renamed the Peacock Theatre.  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Judith Mackrell</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>Sadler's Wells has always attracted a large and dedicated crowd of lobbyists who believe the  theatre should have been burnt down at birth. It's included all those who have shouldered painfully  through the Wells's crowded foyer to buy a ticket or a drink. It's included all those who've suffered  sciatica from sitting in the cramped auditorium. And it's been swelled by the snobs who regard EC1 as  just too long and undignified a trek from the West End.  <p>  <p>But the Wells - at least the current theatre - has always been more about gallant survival than  glamour. It has thrived on enthusiastic making-do. It was here that Lilian Baylis, the hockey mistress  of English theatre, chivvied our national opera and ballet companies through their formative years. It  was here that a depleted Sadler's Wells Ballet danced bravely as German bombs fell over Islington. It  was here that countless dance companies squeezed themselves on to a tiny stage, rehearsed in dingy  studios and shivered for lack of hot showers. It was here in all the Wells's various incarnations that  the neighbourhood has been entertained with an extraordinary range of goings-on. In recent years it's  seen male swans in AMP's gender-bending 'Swan Lake' and Michael Clark's bare bum. <p>  <p>In the early 19th  century, it saw mock water battles staged in a 90ft-long water tank, and in 1699, 16 years after  Richard Sadler first opened his small Musike House, it saw the Hibernian Cannibal eating a live  cockerel. So it was entirely fitting that the Wells's closing gala, 'Finale', was neither a grand nor a  glitzy affair. There were no dinner jackets to be seen except on stage, and though the star quotient  was high the emphasis was firmly on local talent - actors, singers and dancers who'd been most closely  associated with the theatre. The water in the titular well obviously possesses restorative powers  since the theatre's veterans seem to live astonishingly hearty lives. On Sunday night we saw  94-year-old Godfrey Kenton who spoke the first lines ever uttered on the current stage. There was Anna  Pollak, once principal singer with Sadler's Wells Opera, who is a mere slip at 81 and, of course,  Ninette de Valois, founder of the Royal Ballet, who was 98 this month and got a standing ovation from  her seat in the stalls.  <p>  <p>Unfortunately De Valois's own legacy was thinly represented at the 'Finale', since both the Royal  Ballet and Birmingham Royal Ballet were touring abroad. This must be the first dance and opera gala  without a tutu or a triple pirouette in sight. But since the tone of the evening veered deliberately  towards the whacky it probably made better sense to have Wayne Sleep dancing Charlie Chaplin than  Darcey Bussell performing Aurora. It gave us a really enjoyable reminder, too, of just how sharp  Sleep's timing is and how witty a physical mimic he is. His ex-Royal Ballet colleagues Wayne Eagling  and Derek Deane also tapped through their comically po-faced double-act in the Popular Song from  Ashton's 'Facade'. Ironically, two of the starriest dancers in the rest of the dance programme, Marion  Tait and Roland Price, dressed up as tramps and sang a rather successful duet.  <p>  <p>Yet if the programme's emphasis was on opera, it was opera taking the night off. Peter Grimes may  have been premiered at the theatre, Sadler's Wells Opera may have performed a rich repertoire of Verdi  and Mozart, but the highlight of Sunday night was 'The Three Divas' singing a blissfully wicked parody  of the Three Tenors' theme tune. Rosemary Ashe, Anne Collins and Della Jones competed shamelessly with  each other for the big notes of Nessun Dorma, and in a perfect imitation of overwrought and overpaid  Pavarottian emotion, added a unison routine of brow-wiping, arm-waving and ponderously wobbling  jowels.  <p>  <p>Almost as wonderful was Donald MacIntyre's air-shattering rendition of 'The Calf Of Gold' from  Gounod's 'Faust'; a clutch of singers, including Richard Van Allen, singing light-opera arias; plus, to  remind us that the Wells was the birthplace of British panto, a line-up of seven transvestite  principal boys singing filthy lyrics to 'The Boys Of The Old Brigade'.  <p>  <p>The demolition squad arrives at Rosebery Avenue on 15 July, and in less than two years time we  should see a brand new theatre. Though there will be a community base in the Lilian Baylis auditorium,  the new Wells proper will be a startlingly less cosy affair than the old. Ian Albery, its chief  executive, has orchestrated plans for a 21st-century venue with computer-controlled lighting and stage  technology, and a capacity for multimedia displays both inside and on the facade. Not only will the  theatre be large and well-equipped enough to attract the world's most interesting companies back to  London - particularly those presenting dance - but, as Albery says, the only limits on a newly created  performance will be those of the artists' imaginations. How comfortably the commercial and artistic  policies of the new Wells will rub together hasn't much been discussed. But we still have nearly two  years to enjoy the unsullied prospect of its future plans and dreams.  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Bosnian woman found alive after more than three years living in wild </b><br><br><br><b><h2>24 June  1996</h2></b><br><h2>Four winters with wolves and bears</h2><h3>A 'dead' woman has survived  </h3>  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Julian Borger</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>Rajko Pejic was hunting for wild pigs, but kept an eye out for the bears and wolves that flourish  in the forests and abandoned villages of the central Bosnian highlands.  The last thing he expected to see was the crouching form of a woman. She froze in terror when he  called out to her.  <p>  <p>In the dawn light he saw a sinewy dark-skinned woman dressed in rags, who seemed oddly familiar.  When she said her name was Zejna Elkaz, he almost fainted.  <p>  <p>Ms Elkaz, aged 46, had last been seen more than three years ago running from the scene of a  massacre. That was on 2 November 1992, the day Bosnian Serb militiamen laid waste to the village of  Cvitovici.  Some of the villagers who escaped found their way to refugee camps from where a few, like Mr Pejic,  are returning. Ms Elkaz disappeared and after four bitter winters was given up for dead.  <p>  <p>Hers is one of the most extraordinary survival stories in a war of brutal extremes. She lived for  44 months among the bears and wolves, eating mushrooms, walnuts and berries, practically hibernating  in a shelter made from branches and plastic sheeting.  "Sometimes it would be so cold that when I took off my socks, skin would come off with them," she  says, at a friend's house in Jajce, where she is recovering.  <p>  <p>She says the wolves and bears never attacked her. "Some of the bears were huge - 200 kilos (440lb)  at least - and there were times when they came within one and a half metres of me. But I would bang on  a piece of plastic and they would run away.  "I was never scared of them. We learnt to live with one another. The bears would climb up the trees  and break off a branch, and then sit on the ground eating the fruit. But they always left some fruit  behind and I think that was for me."  <p>  <p>Her fear was reserved for the Chetniks - the Serb fighters. In November 1992 they crowded 11  Cvitovici villagers - Muslims and Croats - into a house and threw a grenade through the open door,  killing Ms Elkaz's mother and six others. Ms Elkaz escaped by jumping out of a window.  <p>  <p>Her dread was so intense that she refused to believe Mr Pejic when he told her when they met in the  forest that the Serbs had been driven out of the area and a peace agreement had been signed.  Ms Elkaz could not understand why, if the Serbs had been driven out last autumn, there were only  Croats and no Muslims in town. In her isolation she had heard nothing of the Muslim-Croat war which  tore apart central Bosnia for most of 1993.  <p>  <p>She talks quietly, occasionally drawing her hand across her face and half turning away in shyness.  Her only conversation in the woods was with the birds which she fed dried fruit and nuts.  <p>  <p>She is now staying with a former Muslim neighbour, Rifet Mesinovic, who insists that he always  believed she would turn up.  "Most people from Cvitovici said she was dead. But there were about 30 per cent of us who felt she  had survived. She was always a tough person, a loner. She never married, or had children - just lived  with her mother," he said.  <p>  <p>The doctor who first examined her, Enes Ribic, a fellow Muslim returnee, was astonished at her  quiet determination.  <p>  <p>"She is very sharp. She understands everything," he said. "Is she normal? I would say she is a  little more normal than the rest of us.  She is a biological phenomenon. I have looked at the books and found no record of any woman living  wild for that length of time.  There were Japanese soldiers in the Philippine jungle for 20 or 30 years, but that was on the  equator. Here in Bosnia, we have winters when the temperature drops to minus 20 degrees."  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Men complain to Equal Opportunities Commission over barriers to work </b><br><br><br><b><h2>25 June  1996</h2></b><br><h2>Men losing battle for lowly jobs  </h2>
  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Sarah Boseley</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>For the first time, more men than women complained about finding doors closed to them when they  went looking for work last year, the annual report of the Equal Opportunities Commission revealed  yesterday.  <p>  <p>But the doors men were pushing against were often those they would have shunned in the past. Those  in their 50s, made redundant from male-dominated industries like shipbuilding, manufacturing and  construction, are pursuing the low-paid, sometimes part-time jobs that used to be left to the women.  While women have, in small numbers, broken into such hard-hatted domains as the building industry and  the fire brigade, stereotyping persists in the realms of 'women's work'. Jobless males are not  generally the preferred candidates in the retail, tourism and catering trades - let alone nursing and  secretarial work.  <p>  <p>Usama Tariq, now 18, applied for a job as an office junior with the Halifax-based textile  manufacturers, Samuel Lumb and Son, straight from school with a two-year course in keyboard skills and  business studies under his belt, as well as English and maths GCSEs. The letter invitation to an  interview was addressed to 'Miss Tariq'.  When he rang to confirm the date, Mr Tariq said that the interviewer was surprised. "He said they  were looking for a young female and it wouldn't be suitable for a male."  <p>  <p>The careers office, which had told him of the job, brought the case to the attention of the EOC.  Samuel Lumb paid Mr Tariq &#163;4,000 in settlement of his claim for sexual discrimination. "I think  it is a lot easier for women to get typing and clerical work," said Mr Tariq, now a part-time sales  assistant at Marks & Spencer.  <p>  <p>Vadivel Venkatasamy, a male nurse, who won &#163;2,500 from the Ministry of Defence in an  industrial tribunal case, was interviewed for a job as a staff nurse at Wellington barracks in London.  He was runner-up to a woman who then turned down the job, but the MoD failed to contact him in spite  of assurances that he was on the reserve list.  <p>  <p>Complaints from women still predominate in other areas - especially equal pay, maternity rights and  sexual harassment, said the report which noted a steady rise in complaints about pensions and  recruitment from men. Kamlesh Bahl, EOC chairwoman, said: "Stereotyped attitudes about the jobs men  and women can do still persist despite the changes in the workplace."   <p>  <p>*Don't put your daughter on the stage, Mrs Robinson. Your son, however, is a different matter. Actresses earn an average of 85 per  cent of men's pay in a year, and work 20 per cent longer, writes Dan Glaister.  <p>  <p>The report, Unequal Pay For Equal Parts, showed that a woman playing a lead role in the West End  earns an average of &#163;166 per day, compared with &#163;250 for a man.  <p>  <p>A spokesman for Equity said the report confirmed that the situation had not improved in the four  years since its last survey of pay. "We are going to go to the employers and say it's still bad and we  want to work with you to agree a joint programme to address the problem."  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Men complain to Equal Opportunities Commission over barriers to work </b><br><br><br><b><h2>27 June  1996</h2></b><br><h2>Him indoors</h2><h3>Reports this week suggest that men are finding it harder  than ever to get jobs. For some, the solution is to stay at home   </h3>  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Yvonne Roberts</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>John Gullis is a Superman. According to Tracey, his wife, he has many strengths and only two  weaknesses: he doesn't know how to make money and he doesn't know how to look after it. A 'natural'  breadwinner he ain't, but John - a 45-year-old Essex builder reconstituted into a Surrey house-husband  - keeps his wife happy.  <p>  <p>Tracey Rogers works for a cosmetics company. She has a staff of 80, earns a salary "in the  stratosphere" and within a few weeks of having Tess, now seven months old, she found herself  "climbing the walls".  <p>  <p>John decided to take over. He finds the loneliness a problem, he misses "the crack" of being with  his mates and he objected to his wife's Christmas present - a saucepan - but he has no regrets. "If  Tracey is well-fed, well-slept and warm, if I can keep these balls juggling, she's happy," he says and  smiles.  <p>  <p>House-husbands sound as if they might be the pioneers of sexual politics - men who have eagerly  opted to take a slip road off the traditional route to masculinity. But what emerges when you talk to  couples in which a man has the main responsibility for the children isn't always a new and healthier  balance between work and family. Instead, it's often the repetition of the old dilemmas. Except, of  course, that the workaholic breadwinner and absentee parent is now the mother, while the undervalued  carer at home is Dad. Progress? Well, yes and no.  <p>  <p>Yvonne Berman, 39, is a barrister in industry who enjoys her job. She was "desperate" to resume her  career after a year at home with Jessica, who was unplanned. Her husband, Jonathan, also 39, was an  insurance lawyer and hated it. They disliked the idea of a childminder, so he took over as  house-husband.  <p>  <p>The knowledge that she is the single breadwinner, combined with the 12-hour days, exerts a strain,  Yvonne Berman says. "I worry that if I lose my job, we've nothing to fall back on. Then sometimes I  feel, this isn't fair. Women don't do this sort of thing, they are cared for... "  <p>  <p>Now Jessica is almost five and at school, Jonathan is developing a business from home. He is, says  his wife, "an ebullient personality". While some house-husbands are isolated, Jonathan has become one  of the 'mothers' who meet and occasionally complain because partners fail to appreciate just how much  they do, at home all day.  <p>  <p>"To my shame, I did begin to undervalue Jonathan's contribution," Yvonne Berman admits. "I'd  forgotten what it was like to be in the house. We went through a rough patch. It was the separateness  of it all. He had his day, I had mine. Now we try to intermesh our lives. I told myself, sod it, we're  getting into a terrible twist about something which is quite basic. We've got to raise our daughter,  earn enough money and make our relationship work. The rest can go hang."  <p>  <p>"If you're not honest," Jonathan Berman adds, "you can say being a house-husband works terribly  well. If you tell the truth, of course, there are tensions and resentments. It's impressive how much  dust women can see, where I see none...  <p>  <p>"Among the issues you have to face are which partner feels they have sacrificed more? What changes  occur when there is only one income, not two? It may be that men don't feel the same pull when they  come home and their child is in bed, while the idea of the husband as main earner is still more  acceptable. But I've no regrets. I have enjoyed being with Jessica enormously.  <p>  <p>"At some point," he concludes, "you realise that you may want everything but you can't have it.  Then you decide what you are prepared to forfeit. Nothing is perfect."  <p>  <p>Most men who find themselves house-husbands do not have the luxury of choice. According to a report  produced by the Equal Opportunities Commission this week, men are finding it increasingly difficult to  get jobs. With the decline of male-dominated heavy industry, more men than women are now complaining  about sex discrimination in job applications, with employers increasingly turning to women to fill  vacancies - 49 per cent of the workforce is now female.  <p>  <p>Given a choice, home is an increasingly attractive option. A recent MORI poll indicated that if  there were sufficient money, a staggering eight out of 10 men would stay at home. Another study  indicated that eight out of 10 women would choose to combine part-time work with family life. What  might go some way to meeting both aspirations, of course, would be more flexibility in the workplace.  Instead, we have almost none.  <p>  <p>Part-time work has no career structure; only 16 per cent of jobs offer flexi-time; British men have  the longest working week in the EU and career women are following the same route. A recent Institute  of Management survey demonstrated that working fathers increasingly resent the marginal role they have  in family life. Still, only two per cent of families, so far, have a man in charge of the children.  <p>  <p>In this shaky period of social transition, house-husbandry is not for the fainthearted. Having  accorded low status and no prestige to full-time domesticity, men who take up the role now find  themselves not only inhabiting an alien country of mother and toddler groups but competing in the  hitherto female domain of second-class citizenship.  <p>  <p>Traditional stereotypes have an alarming fortitude but this is because in some parts of the  country, they are reinforced by economic reality. Twelve million women work - but eight million are  part-time, their money used to 'top up' their husband's earnings.  <p>  <p>Gail, 39, married David Millard, 42, when she was 18. They have two children, 12 and 16. David was  a miner for over 20 years, then two years ago he was made redundant. He was at home until February,  while she continued to work part-time in a clothes factory. The Millards live in Doncaster, where 400  vacancies produce 4,000 applicants.  <p>  <p>"We were brought up on the idea that a husband goes to work, so it was sheer hell when he was  home," Gail Millard explains. "He did all the jobs all right but I felt less respect. I tried not to,  but it was there. His morale hit rock bottom.  <p>  <p>"We got through the bad time because we've always been a team, but the job has given him back his  self-esteem. A man at home, in my opinion, can lose his mind, literally."  <p>  <p>David is now paid &#163;93 a week as a full-time driver and labourer - but at least the status quo  is restored. Even with Family Credit, the Millards between them bring home only &#163;170 a week -  hardly resources that allow the luxury of 'choice'. They both work because they must.  <p>  <p>So what does make a happy house-husband? Philip Crayford shares four assets with John Gullis: their  wives' earning power; the knowledge that they have already proved their worth in the workplace; a  positive desire to be with their children; and a maturity that means they don't give a stuff what  others think.  <p>  <p>Philip, now 55, has two adult children from his first marriage. When they were young, he had three  jobs simultaneously (computers, building and heating), working "all the hours". Why? "To provide...  Now I understand far more what it must have been like for my wife at home."  <p>  <p>Ten years ago, he married Hazel Wright, 39. She is a solicitor, sits on a number of boards and is  passionate about her career. In the morning, she dresses the children, commutes for an hour to London  and may not return until 10 at night.  <p>  <p>Phil, 'The Majordomo', cares for Beatrice, five, and Tom, seven. He also has three weeks a year  alone in France. His wife, Philip acknowledges, has no time for herself.  <p>  <p>"Sometimes being at home can be rocky, sometimes it's fine, but we keep talking," he says  cheerfully. "On a Friday night when the kids yell 'Yippee, Mum's home' - well, that took a bit of  getting used to, but I wouldn't have it any other way."  <p>  <p>Hazel is equally positive. While she'd like a five-day weekend, she is that rare being, a happy  workaholic. "Women still hold the master plan. We can juggle 16 balls in the air, men are not going to  do it," she says. It's Hazel who remembers Beatrice's ballet shoes on a Tuesday.  <p>  <p>Who should stay at home? If money is no problem, common sense says the parent best suited to the  task. Better still is if both parents can play a role without being shadowed by stress or debts or  resentment about a forsaken career.  <p>  <p>Still, there remains that deep and primitive conviction that 'real' men earn money. Tracey Rogers  has an answer: "I believe men should be doing physical work. They should be tilling the soil or  building houses, this (house-husbandry) is a natural extension of that. There's something earthy about  looking after and protecting the family. I know I can protect myself economically but not physically.  That's what I want."  <p>  <p>It is Yvonne Berman, however, who perhaps touches on the most important question of all. "What I'd  like to know now is why have men put up with the stress of being the main breadwinner for so long  without trying to make changes?"  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Christiane Amanpour becomes world's highest-paid foreign correspondent </b><br><br><br><b><h2>26  June 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Frontline reporter makes news with $2m deal  </h2>
  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Andrew Culf</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>Christiane Amanpour, American television's answer to Kate Adie, became the world's highest-paid  foreign correspondent yesterday after an unprecedented bidding war between the United States networks.  The 38-year-old, dubbed the Queen of Bosnia for her coverage of the conflict in former Yugoslavia,  has signed a contract estimated to be worth nearly $2m (&#163;1.3m) a year.  <p>  <p>Ms Amanpour, born in London and educated at a convent school in Essex, was courted by the four big  American networks - and signed deals with two of them.  She will continue to work for CNN, Ted Turner's 24-hour global news network, as chief international  correspondent.  But she will also be seen on 60 Minutes, the flagship CBS News programme, contributing five special  reports a year.  <p>  <p>Martin Bell, the BBC's veteran foreign correspondent, whose salary is estimated to be less than a  tenth of Ms Amanpour's, said: "I always called her the million-dollar woman, and CBS is lucky to have  her - however much it costs."  <p>  <p>Mr Bell, who was wounded by a mortar in Bosnia four years ago, has worked alongside Ms Amanpour for  much of the conflict.  "She is the best field reporter in American TV news," he said. "She has spent much of the last four  years in Bosnia and was very lucky not to have become a casualty. Unusually for an American TV  reporter, she accompanied the camera crew everywhere they went."  <p>  <p>Ms Amanpour, who joined CNN 13 years ago, came to prominence during the dramatic changes in central  Europe during 1989-90, and through her coverage of the Gulf war from the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait to  the post-ceasefire Kurdish refugee crisis.  <p>  <p>Her reputation was sealed in the Balkans when she accused President Bill Clinton during a live  link-up of "flip-flopping" over Bosnia. Ms Amanpour said of the new deal: "I am very flattered that  there is so much interest and I was fortunate to have some wonderful choices. But this is the closest  to a journalist's dream.  <p>  <p>"It would be very difficult for me to leave CNN when it faces new serious competition, because I  have been with CNN since almost from the beginning... This lets me have my cake and eat it too."  <p>  <p>It is rumoured that she is being paid at least $1m (&#163;650,000) by CNN - four times the norm for  senior foreign correspondents. Some estimates put the figure nearer $1.5m.  CBS is said to be chipping in a further $500,000.  <p>  <p>The deal allows Ms Amanpour to remain loyal to CNN while increasing her profile in the US, where  her work is not as closely followed as it is abroad.  <p>  <p>Andrew Heyward, the president of CBS News, even flew to her home base in Paris to secure a deal  before her contract expired at the weekend. He said: "This is a win-win-win, for Christiane, for CNN  and for CBS." However, Ms Amanpour's decision is a blow for the two other networks. Roone Arledge of  ABC News was said to have offered her a job on the network's prestigious Nightline, while Andrew Lack  of NBC had also been in the race. CNN will be particularly buoyed up by NBC's failure, because NBC, in  alliance with Microsoft, is due to launch a rival 24-hour cable news network - MSNBC - next month.  <p>  <p>Tom Johnson, the president of CNN, said: "Christiane Amanpour is the finest international  correspondent of her generation. I am delighted she is remaining with CNN in an expanded and  extraordinarily challenging role." He added: "Ideally we would have wanted an exclusive contract, but  this is quite new and innovative."  <p>  <p>Ms Amanpour, who has filed from some of the world's most dangerous trouble-spots including  Afghanistan, Algeria, Rwanda and Somalia, said the new arrangement would not mean an end to her work  on the frontline. "I am by no means coming in from the cold," she insisted.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p><b>Pay-as-you-view: what the media stars earn</b>  <p>  <p>Barbara Walters-$9m ( &#163;6m)  <br>Highest-paid American anchor. The veteran presenter, aged 64, of ABC's high-rating 20/20 show.  Known as "our national interviewer" and "the snoop laureate" in the US press, she was the first to  break the $4m barrier.  <p>  <p>Dan Rather-$5m ( &#163;3.3m)  <br>Succeeded Walter Cronkite as host of the CBS evening news, which has fallen behind ABC and NBC  bulletins in the ratings. The 64-year-old was in the headlines last year when his co-anchor Connie  Chung was dropped after their on-screen chemistry was judged too volatile.  <p>  <p>Martin Bell-&#163;80,000- &#163;100,000  <br>Veteran BBC war reporter has covered conflicts in Bosnia, Vietnam, Beirut and the Gulf. Honoured  two years ago by the Royal Television Society for coverage of 11 wars and reports from 80 countries in  30 years. Aged 57, and easily recognisable with his trademark lucky white suit. Has pledged not to  return to Bosnia.  <p>  <p>Kate Adie-&#163;80,000- &#163;100,000  <br>The BBC's chief news correspondent and best known female reporter. She was awarded the OBE in 1992. Aged 50, she covered the Iranian  embassy siege, the Tiananmen Square massacre, the bombing of Tripoli and the Gulf war, and has filed  regular dispatches from Bosnia.  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Owen Bowcott</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>Violence erupted in several areas of the country following Britain's defeat, with the worst in London's Trafalgar Square where hundreds of riot and mounted police fought with nearly 1,000 England fans goading officers. By 1am 41 arrests had been made across the capital.  <p>  <p>Reporters and TV crews were attacked in Trafalgar Square. There were 18 casualties treated at the scene. One man was reported to be seriously hurt. The hooligans smashed up cars including a police car. Two cars were set ablaze. Northumberland Avenue was littered with wrecked cars after police cleared the square at around 12.15am.  <p>  <p>Several hundred fans tried repeatedly to break through police cordons to get to Leicester Square and the West End.  German fans skirted the square on their way to Soho, some wearing England hats to avoid attention.  <p>  <p>Hundreds of fans brought mayhem to towns and villages across the Thames Valley, running through streets smashing up cars and shop windows. Police said there had been outbreaks of fighting across the West Midlands. In Brighton, coastguards rescued seven England fans after they leapt off the end of a pier after the defeat.  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Violence erupts around the country as England are knocked out of Euro 96 </b><br><br><br><b><h2>27  June 1996</h2></b><br><h2>In a nation that distrusts success they have a place of honour</h2><h3> In the third  minute, England fans thought it might be all over  </h3>  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Matthew Engel</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>The great resurgence of English football, which had lasted all of 11 days, ended at Wembley last  night when the history England did not want repeated itself and they were knocked out of the European  Championship by Germany in a penalty shoot-out.  <p>  <p>Gareth Southgate will have to live with the mantle worn for the past six years by Stuart Pearce.  After 10 kicks from both sides had gone in, he hit the 11th only just right of goalkeeper Kopke and it  was comfortably saved. He returned to join his team-mates in despair; Andreas Moller, the German  captain, calmly took the kick that gave his team victory. And, after a brief eruption from the German  contingent, the mass of the crowd left the ground in near-silence.  <p>  <p>Germany, as ever, will now be hot favourites to win the tournament on Sunday night. They meet the  Czech Republic, who beat France at Old Trafford in the other semi-final - also on penalties.  <p>  <p>That was a terrible match. In contrast, the game at Wembley was a night of heroes. Alan Shearer  scored for England after only 132 seconds, leading to chants of "What A Load of Rubbish"; Nemesis came  after Hubris and Germany equalised after 15 minutes. The game itself produced no more goals, but it  was a night of terrific, skilful and unexpectedly attacking and fluent football.  <p>  <p>The most heroic performance, however, probably came after the game when Southgate gamely faced the  media and admitted: "I feel I've let everyone down. I just have to live with that." His team-mates had  all tried to tell him otherwise. But Southgate, regarded as a nice and intelligent man, understands  how the public mind works.  <p>  <p>The match ends a manic period, which began only with Paul Gascogne's amazing goal against Scotland  two Saturdays ago. It is hard to remember but, before that, the England players were regarded as  drunken louts. They will be remembered now among the gloriously vanquished which, in a nation which  traditionally distrusts success, can still be an honoured position. The population of England, most of  whom were believed to be watching on television last night, can now resume the normal summertime  business of watching Wimbledon and washing their cars. The result was especially disastrous for anyone  with a ticket for the final and thoughts of selling it; they will be difficult to give away now.  <p>  <p>The long-term consequences of this adventure cannot be immediately assessed. It may be assumed that  English sport as a whole will return to normal after its brief flourish and the cricketers and  tennis-players will start losing again. However, the excitement created may lead to a lasting upsurge  in interest in routine football. If that happens the winner - even more predictable than Germany -  will be Rupert Murdoch, whose satellite company holds the television rights to the Premiership. That  seems a more probable outcome than a continuing boom in St George's flags and patriotic anthems. The  sun will probably still rise this morning and the birds will carry on singing. But the fervent English  jingoism, most of it not unhealthy, that came from England's three previous victories will have gone -  at least until the 1998 World Cup in France or the sudden discovery of a small, just, distant,  winnable and uncomplicated war.  <p>  <p>The result will confirm the pessimism of those who said England should have played in the red in  which they won the World Cup and not the dreary grey used last night.  <p>  <p>The atmosphere was far tenser than at the fiesta of the Spain match last Saturday, as though people  sensed that this was the real final.

<!--INFOLINE--><b>David Sharrock</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>An award-winning crime journalist and scourge of Dublin's drugs underworld was shot dead in the  Irish capital yesterday, apparently by contract killers.  Veronica Guerin, who has exposed a number of Dublin's criminal godfathers in the Sunday  Independent, was shot in her car on the Naas dual carriageway in Co Dublin at around 1pm.  Two men on a motorbike, wearing white crash helmets, intercepted Ms Guerin's car at traffic lights  on a slip road in Clondalkin. One fired a handgun, killing her instantly.  <p>  <p>The shooting bore a chilling resemblance to the murder of one of Ms Guerin's journalistic subjects,  Martin Cahill, known as the General, who was shot dead by the IRA in August 1994. The deputy prime  minister, Dick Spring, said no effort would be spared to bring her killers to justice.  <p>  <p>Ms Guerin was 36 and married to a builder, Graham Turley. They have a seven-year-old son, Cathal,  and live at Cloghran, near Dublin airport north of the capital.  It was there that she was shot in the thigh last year by a lone gunman, riding a motorcycle and  wearing a black crash helmet.  <p>  <p>Ms Guerin was on her way back from Naas district court when she was killed and minutes before had  telephoned her deputy editor, Willie Kealy, to discuss an article about another Dublin criminal.  <p>  <p>Mr Kealy said: "We are all shocked. This is a tragedy and an outrage." Police Superintendent Bryan  O'Higgins said: "We have a description of the pillion passenger who did the shooting. He is about 30  years of age, fair complexion with blue eyes. He had a moustache and a tubby build. The driver of the  motorbike was smaller. Both wore white helmets."  <p>  <p>Friends and colleagues said Ms Guerin had been increasingly concerned about her safety following a  warning shooting in February 1995.  <p>  <p>Ms Guerin described that shooting: "The door was pushed in on top of me and I fell back. There was  a figure standing in front of me... and the first thing my eyes were drawn to was a handgun. I  looked up to his eyes to appeal to him - don't, don't shoot me. I remember noticing for the first time  that he had a black motorcycyle helmet on. I just put my hands up to my head and and went down on to the ground and went into a foetus-like  position. I felt a roar come out of me and he just seemed to bring the gun down across my body and it  was on my leg and then there was a shot.  <p>  <p>"I suppose I thought somebody was angered by something I had written. Until that moment, even  though shots had been fired into the house in October, I never believed my life was in danger. I  haven't given up because I genuinely think it is a job that has to be done. I just would not give in  to them." She was given police protection and had a &#163;25,000 security system installed, but  continued to write about criminals.  <p>  <p>She was awarded the prestigious International Press Freedom Award. Then in September she was  assaulted and threatened by a man just released from prison. He told another journalist: "Listen pal,  I'll find out who you are and I'll kill you, too."  <p>  <p>Ms Guerin famously scooped colleagues by getting the first interview with the Bishop of Galway,  Eamon Casey, after he fled to South America following revelations about his son.  <p>  <p>Her final article, in last weekend's Sunday Independent, was about how the operations commander of  the IRA's southern division sanctioned a robbery which resulted in the murder of a Garda detective. Ms  Guerin's last words read: "The IRA used the ceasefire to prepare for a bombing campaign in England.  The ceasefire put an end to regular observation of IRA activists. "Special Branch officers who, up to  the ceasefire, were working exclusively on IRA investigations, were now also assigned to working on  Dublin's criminal underworld."  <p>  <p>Ms Guerin was due to take part in a conference in London this week on the theme: Journalists under  Fire, Media under Siege. John Owen, executive director of the Freedom Forum, which is organising the  conference, said: "Much of this conference is to do with journalists killed in war zones, but  Veronica's death shows that you don't have to go to a war zone to get killed pursuing the truth."  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<h3>Veronica Guerin's tragic death  reminds us why we are here  </h3><br><b>Leading article</b>  <br><br><br>      <p>More than 20 journalists around the world have been assassinated since 1996 began. They have mostly  died in Africa or South America or amid the chaotic detritus of the old Soviet empire. They were doing  what they perceived to be their job: reporting, investigating, turning over stones. We salute them, of  course: but a touch ritually. They do not report from the democratic comfort of the European Union.  They work for papers far away. But Veronica Guerin reported in Dublin, for the Sunday Independent. And  now she is dead too, murdered in her car - shot for the second time in her short career, and this time  over and over again, to kill.  <p>  <p>Veronica Guerin was a brilliant reporter. She, more than any other, exposed the brutal sub-world of  Dublin gangland, a terrain of drugs and terror which the police seem unable to cross. Her stories made  Ireland think afresh about the kind of country it is becoming, with dire echoes back across the sea to  cities like Liverpool. Her work was necessary. She discovered what nobody else had discovered. She  discomfited and shamed authority in so doing. She made terrible enemies.  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Duncan Campbell</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>A British army barracks in Germany was hit by mortar fire last night, raising fears that the IRA  had yet again switched tactics.  <p>  <p>The attack, apparently the first IRA operation in mainland Europe for six years, came as security  sources warned that the IRA was planning to step up operations despite talk of resuming its ceasefire.  The peace process may have been dealt a knock-out blow.  <p>  <p>The mortars were fired at the Quebec barracks in Osnabruck, the largest British army base in  Germany, less than 24 hours after the seven heads of state of the Group of Seven countries issued a  statement condeming terrorism. There were no injuries.  <p>  <p>John Major learned of the news as he sat down to dinner in Lyon. He relayed the news to Germany's  Chancellor Helmut Kohl and US President Bill Clinton. The news seemed to astonish Sinn Fein. But hours  before the attack, Mitchel McLaughlin, the party's chairman, had told a London press conference: "The  IRA cessation is over. They could strike at any time and any place." Although there was no immediate  claim of responsibility, the German authorities were in no doubt the IRA was behind the attack.  Osnabruck, where 4 Armoured Brigade is based, is home to 10,700 military personnel and their families.  The IRA tried to bomb it in 1989 during a three-year terror campaign on mainland Europe.  <p>  <p>German police said last night two mortars exploded in the air. The target appeared to be a petrol  pump. The blast damaged roofs and buildings. The mortars were fired from a Ford Transit van with  British number plates parked 200 yards away at 6.50pm local time. The van was being examined by  forensic experts last night.  <p>  <p>German police said that although three explosions were heard, one mortar was found in the vehicle.  A spokesman said: "We are not sure about the nature of the mortars yet. The two which went off might  have exploded more than once." Lieutenant-Colonel Jan-Dirk Merveldt, a British army spokesman, said:  "At the gates of the barracks there appeared to have been a pantechnicon kind of vehicle which appears  to have let off two mortars into the camp. Apparently one of the projectiles fell near a petrol pump.  There is no fire or anything like that."  <p>  <p>Security sources had been predicting another IRA attack after the Manchester bombing two weeks ago.  They believe the IRA is committed to an extensive campaign and will be varying methods and locations.  <p>  <p>Dick Spring, the Irish deputy Prime Minister, condemned the attack as "an inane act of violence  which will serve no purpose and has no contribution to make to the search for peace". But he said he  would not close the door on Sinn Fein.  <p>  <p>The Irish police a week ago raided an IRA bomb factory in farm buildings at Clonaslee, Co Laois,  and arrested several men, uncovering dozens of mortars which were primed and ready to be used. The  mortars were said to be of a new type.  <p>  <p>The question being asked in Dublin last night was whether the renewed Gardai operations had come  too late, and whether the mortars used in last night's attack had been manufactured in the Clonaslee  factory. Special Branch sources have revealed that during the 17-month ceasefire they were told not to  continue surveillance of IRA suspects.  <p>  <p>If the attack does prove to be the work of the IRA, it may well be the death-knell of the peace  process. From the perspective of Mr Clinton, by whose involvement the republican movement has set so  much store, there would appear to be no further merit in pursuing what, for the foreseeable future, is  a busted foreign policy flush.  <p>  <p>In June 1ast year, four members of an IRA bomb squad were convicted of the attempted bombing of the  Quebec barracks, 135 miles north of Frankfurt, on 19 June 1989. The bombers were disturbed by a night  watchman, and four of the five charges were defused. No one was injured.  <p>  <p>Donna Maguire, one of those convicted, was sentenced to nine years, but was freed as she had spent  nearly six years in jail on remand.  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Sue Quinn</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>The IRA last night admitted responsibility for the mortar attack on the British army base in  Osnabruck, Germany.  <p>  <p>A coded telephone call to RTE, the Irish Republic's broadcasting network, confirmed the IRA had  launched three bombs at the Quebec base in the group's first assault on British troops in mainland  Europe for more than six years. No one was injured in Friday's attack, which came less than two weeks  after 200 people were hurt in the massive IRA van bombing which devastated a shopping centre in  Manchester.  <p>  <p>The unidentified male caller said: "The attack mounted against the military installation in  Osnabruck was carried out by one of our units." As usual in IRA statements, the declaration used the  pseudonym P O'Neill. Osnabruck, where Four Armoured Brigade is based, is the largest British base in  Germany and home to 10,700 military personnel and their families.

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Teenager Jason Lidbury fined for taking 475 pigeons from Trafalgar Square </b><br><br><br><b><h2>2  July 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Youth fined for taking Trafalgar Square pigeons  </h2>
  <br><br>      <p>A teenager who whisked away boxfuls of pigeons from Trafalgar Square was yesterday fined &#163;475.  Jason Lidbury, 18, unemployed, put up to 40 of the birds in a box at a time, Bow Street magistrates  heard.  <p>  <p>Andrew Wiles, prosecuting, said a licensed pigeon food seller, Bernard Rayner, observed Lidbury  taking birds on a number of occasions. "He saw the man position a box and put food in front of it and  when the pigeons came, he took hold of them and put them in the box.  <p>  <p>"He estimated 40 or so birds would be in the box at one time. He remonstrated with the defendant  but the defendant indicated he would not stop doing it and at one stage Mr Rayner released some  birds." Police arrested Lidbury in the square on 5 March. "He said he was collecting the pigeons and  taking them to his uncle who had racing pigeons to see if any were suitable for breeding. He went on  to say he would try to sell some of them."  <p>  <p>Peter Caldwell, defending, said: "Mr Lidbury was seen on five occasions and on his account the  number of birds in the box never exceeded 25. He was giving those birds to his uncle and his uncle  would pay 20p a bird. His view was these animals were vermin and he did not think he was doing  anything wrong at the time."  <p>  <p>Lidbury, an unemployed painter and decorator, of Stockwell, south London, made about &#163;20 from  the deals. "He recognises, whatever he thinks of the birds, they do add character to London and what  he did was selfish. It was an act out of character."  <p>  <p>He pleaded guilty to six summonses brought by the RSPCA. He was fined &#163;100 for being in  Trafalgar Square on 5 March with intent to take wild birds and &#163;75 on each of five summonses,  including possessing wild birds for sale, and having wild birds in his control.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Gazza marries Sheryl</b><br><br><br><b><h2>2 July 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Little people left  disappointed in the rain as Gazza stars in another big match</h2><h3>High security and blacked-out limos for  soccer star's wedding  </h3>  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Sarah Boseley</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>The skies wept and very probably Gazza did too, being a sentimental sort. It was an occasion to  touch the hardest heart. Just a month ago, the Sun revealed that ex-model Sheryl was briefing lawyers  to file a palimony claim, yet yesterday there she was, in acres of shoulderless peach tulle, vowing to  cleave to the man from Rangers for evermore.  <p>  <p>Most of the England football team were probably there, shedding a small tear if not in happiness  for their mate then perhaps at the lingering smart of Germany's European Championship victory the day  before, in spite of all their glorious efforts. But it was difficult to tell through the dark glass of  eight white limousines which stretched silently through the main gate of the Hanbury Manor Hotel and  Country Club.  <p>  <p>Gazza had slipped through in identical style earlier. Two local women, Valerie Knight and Tracey  Kenny, swore he had wound down his window and toasted them with champagne and a huge grin.  <p>  <p>If it is love Paul Gascoigne craves, then he already has more than most ever enjoy. He is adored by  the little people who do not make headlines - those who cheer themselves hoarse at matches or wait in  the rain outside the Hertfordshire hotel where their hero is getting married.  <p>  <p>"I found out where he lives," confided Chris Beech. "It was when he had that record out - Fog on  the Tyne. I knocked on his door and he answered it. I said: 'Is Gazza there?' and he said: 'Who wants  him?' and I said: 'I do'. He signed his autograph." And what then? "Then I went away."  <p>  <p>James Kember, aged 13, had been allowed to skip school. He was wearing his England shirt with  Gascoigne and 8 on the back. "They cost &#163;40," he said, "but it was &#163;11 more with the name. I  put &#163;20 towards it and my mum and dad paid the rest." He had arrived at 9am. "I'm a bit  disappointed," he said.  <p>  <p>They cheered Terry Venables when he arrived five minutes late, but there was to be no balcony kiss  nor even a glimpse of the happy couple through a car window. Sorry - Gazza and Sheryl's big day was a  Hello! magazine exclusive. The man from the Mirror was turned away. The Sun was rumoured to have  infiltrated somebody on to the golf course, but security men, in Gascoigne's pay, were everywhere. He  had booked every room in the hotel to keep out unwelcome guests, the rumour ran, at a cost of  &#163;15,000.  <p>  <p>Many were rooms vacated on the wedding morning by Umbro - the makers of those shirts that had cost  young James such a slice of pocket money. Eighteen of its executives and their guests had been staying  at Hanbury Manor to do Euro 96 in style. "They've been drinking until six every morning," said one of  the staff. So Gazza's nuptials would hold no surprises.  <p>  <p>Perhaps it was as well the civil ceremony could not be held on deconsecrated territory,  disappointing the couple's first plans. The Poles Hall was a chapel in the 18th century when Hanbury  Manor was a convent. The shades of the nuns, buried in the gardens, would surely have walked.  <p>  <p>Instead, Gazza in a cream and gold frockcoat with matching baby (Regan - the couple's  four-month-old son) and Sheryl in her little number by Isabell Kristensen were married in a room with  zodiac signs in the ceiling. Sheryl's daughter Bianca-Jade and son Mason from her previous marriage  wore cream. How long will it last? The answer, one can only suppose, is in the stars.   <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Gazza marries Sheryl</b><br><br><br><b><h2>  19 July 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Right royal  splicing</h2><h3>The wedding of the year saw Gazza finally submit to the charms of his Sheryl  </h3>  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Jaci Stephen</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>As a glamour soap, it is a story that has everything. A beautiful blonde, a chunky sportsman who  weeps with sorrow and joy, and a plot crammed with all the drama of a Dallas or a Dynasty. A story of  love, separation, of thwarted ambition, recovery, disappointment, violence and power. Most importantly  of all, it is a story with a happy ending.  <p>  <p>The Gazza and Shezza epic reached its joyous climax on 1 July, and this week, the full, fluffy tale  has been captured in Hello! which had exclusive rights to the ceremony. The bride wore the kind of  frock you could venture into on safari and not see daylight before Christmas. Two hundred metres of  tulle buoyed her up over a pair of Jimmy Choo lace shoes; her bosoms, rising over the lace and beaded  cups of her bodice, looked as if they would need a separate visa to leave the country. The groom  matched her inch for inch, from the white-blond dyed hair to the brocade of his jacket and waistcoat.  They made a lovely couple. They really did. They have had their problems, both personally and  professionally, and they have come through. As Sheryl says, in the Hello! interview, they will  doubtless have many more arguments; the difference now, is that their commitment to each other will  give them the security to "resolve them and get over them". Call me naive, but I believe them. I want  to; I need to. We all do.  <p>  <p>The British are big on fairytales. In the Eighties, it was the Charles and Diana soap that  satisfied the public's insatiable need to believe that love conquers all. As they stumble towards a  divorce that has been as ugly as the union was joyous (on the outside, at least), we have lost faith  in fairytales. The marriage of Shezza and Gazza has restored it and they have taken over from the  royals as the nation's number one family. Gazza, Shezza, Bianca, Mason (Sheryl's children from a  former marriage) and Regan, her child with Gazza. God bless 'em all, and long may they reign over us.  It is not, however, a marriage made in heaven, and as fairytales go it stands somewhere between wolves  eating little girls who visit their grandmothers, and wicked witches luring children to candy houses  deep in the forest. Gazza is exceptionally volatile and has admitted taking out his frustrations on  Sheryl, which makes this a fairytale much tempered by reality.  <p>  <p>The basic fairytale plot is there, however: boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy gets girl; or, in  Gazza's case, boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy gets girl, boy loses girl, boy gets girl again, boy  loses girl again, etc. The only way for the boy to get the girl was to change his ways: the wild boy  had to be tamed.  <p>  <p>The Princess of Wales could have learned a lot from Sheryl, and maybe it is not too late for  Gazza's bride to be brought in as one of the Princess's confidential advisers. Get your act together  or get out, is Sheryl's philosophy; and it works.  <p>  <p>Unlike the royal story, the Gazza and Shezza show is one of unpredictability and real emotion. We  had already seen Gazza's geyser during the World Cup in Turin; last week, having held back in the  ceremony, he finally overflowed when DJ Chris Evans hugged him.  <p>  <p>The story is also one of redemption. Gazza places much of the blame for their problems on his  feelings of anger at losing his single lifestyle. Sheryl too accepts responsibility and explains her  feelings of resentment at the power she felt Gazza had over her. Sartre and de Beauvoir they ain't,  but the simple, honest way they express their self-discovery and discovery of each other makes a  refreshing change from the New Age nonsense the royals foist upon us.  <p>  <p>Gazza's joie de vivre has caused him more than a few problems, both with Sheryl and the press. The  Hello! picture of him in a urinal in his wedding clothes, champagne glass in hand, is yet further  evidence of this (as if we needed it) and the Hanbury Manor Hotel where the wedding took place, must  be thrilled that the gleam of their toilet furniture was caught so beautifully by the camera.  <p>  <p>Underneath the nonsense, however, is the story of a man who is growing up and, rather touchingly, a  man who is very much in love and not afraid to tell everyone. The Gazza and Shezza story may yet  restore the feelgood factor. And when the great man finally hangs up his football boots? He and his  new bride might make a lovely king and queen.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Tim Henman reaches quarter finals at Wimbledon</b><br><br><br><b><h2>2 July  1996</h2></b><br><h2>Wimbledon: Bold Henman battles into the last eight  </h2>
  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Stephen Bierley</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>Tim Henman provided a shaft of light yesterday the like of which has not been seen for 23 years.  Repeating the brilliant tennis that had swept away the French Open champion Yevgeny Kafelnikov in the  first round, he reached the quarter-finals in glorious sunshine as the showers finally abated. It had  been a frustrating day for Britain's Number One. His fourth-round match with Magnus Gustafsson started  just after 3pm and did not finish until nearly 7.45. The two men were on and off the Centre Court four  times as showers interrupted play.  <p>  <p>Henman eventually won 7-6, 6-4, 7-6 to become the first British player to reach the last eight  since 1973. That was when Yorkshire's Roger Taylor went on to defeat Sweden's Bjorn Borg, making his  Wimbledon debut, to reach the semi-final. What a stir there would be if Henman equalled that.  Britain's last finalist was Bunny Austin in 1938; the last winner the incomparable Fred Perry two  years earlier. But this is getting into realms of fantasy.  <p>  <p>When the match finally began at 3.13, Henman won his opening service game to love with an ace  thrown in for good measure. On Saturday the Swede had been a touch churlish about the British player's  serve.  <p>  <p>An improvised overhead, taken at an awkward angle, opened up two break-points on Gustafsson's  opening serve. The Swede saved both but was broken on the third deuce. This was the best of all  possible starts by Henman, and the Centre Court purred.  <p>  <p>The British Numbr One held for a 3-0 lead but ever thickening clouds were rapidly losing any  semblance of summer whiteness and filling grey with imminent rain.  <p>  <p>Two excellent Henman volleys drew a tap of the racket from Gustafsson in appreciation but then in  the seventh game came the break back. The Swede hit a forehand winner off Henman's first serve and  then a couple of errors suddenly opened up three break-points. Henman saved a couple but not the  third, Gustafsson belting over another forehand winner. Then, with the score at 15-15 in the eighth  game, one of the day's many showers swept in. At this point there had been precisely 23 minutes' play.  About half an hour later the players returned, knocked up and departed. Henman waved the clouds away  but to no avail. The rain was very light and the British player, no doubt knowing a thing or two about  matters meteorological, hesitated. Alan Mills, the referee, ushered him off gently but firmly.  <p>  <p>By now Dickie Bird would have been apoplectic. Where would it all end? Would it ever end? They were  back just before 5pm, to play another 12 minutes. Henman led 6-5.  <p>  <p>This time it appeared the rain was here to stay. The Centre Court cover had been hoisted and there  were steady drips of water falling from the saturated supporting ropes. The crowd huddled and hoped.  <p>  <p>But the clouds suddenly lifted and a rainbow signalled renewed hope. Enough grey-blue to make an  England shirt appeared and the sun shone. Gustafsson levelled at 6-6 but Henman rattled through the  tiebreak, climaxing with an ace to win it 7-2.  <p>  <p>The Swede showed off his forehand early in the second set. Two pulsatingly struck passes flew  diagonally past Henman as he lost his serve to love to go 2-0 down.  <p>  <p>But Henman is a fighter. His backhand began to flow, uninhibited shots that had Gustafsson swiping  at thin air as he scurried to retrieve. The British player's concentration was intense; this, allied  to his quality of shot, saw him get back level, cracking the Swede's serve with a sprawling, diving  forehand volley at the net.  <p>  <p>Gustafsson was in trouble now; he lost his serve again and Henman duly took a two-set lead. The  third set also went to a tiebreak, although not before Henman had been 5-3 down.  <p>  <p>At this sniff of danger Henman unleashed a marvellous array of telling shots, finishing the  tiebreak at 7-4 with a kicking serve that Gustafsson returned wide. The Centre Court rose to its feet.  It was wonderful to behold.  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Tim Henman reaches quarter finals at Wimbledon</b><br><br><br><b><h2>2 July  1996</h2></b><br><h2>Henman breaks tennis mould</h2><h3>New hero ends long run of British under-achievement  at Wimbledon  </h3>  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>John Duncan</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>Tim Henman beat the rain, the cold and the inbred tennis pessimism of a nation to reach the quarter  finals of Wimbledon yesterday, the first British man to do so since Roger Taylor in 1973.  <p>  <p>Then Taylor beat Bjorn Borg on his way to the semi-finals. Yesterday Henman faced another Swede,  Magnus Gustaffson, and won with gusto and untypically British nerve, 7-6, 6-4, 7-6. In the next round  he faces the only seed in the bottom half of the draw, Todd Martin, or another Swede, Thomas  Johansson. The emotion of the crowd was high though the temperature on centre court was low. "It must  be difficult for my opponents," mused Henman. "It must feel sometimes as if they are playing against  15,001 people. You can play three terrible shots and the crowd makes you forget them straight away and  that is an advantage."  <p>  <p>It was tough for both players to get going with four frustrating interruptions for rain before the  second set was even through. "When I was young I understood that Wimbledon was the biggest event in  the season," said Henman, "and I saw good performances from British players who never went as far as  they should. That was an incentive to put the record straight."  <p>  <p>He did that and more. With the final match-point on Henman's serve in the tiebreak Gustaffson  returned weakly and the crowd erupted to salute Henman's win.  <p>  <p>"I feel very confident in the way I'm playing," he said. "There are still good players in the draw  but I am just going to concentrate on what I am doing. I was in the last 16, now I'm in the last  eight. That's it."   <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Mystery over Margaux Hemingway's death</b><br><br><br><b><h2>  19 July 1996</h2></b><br><h2>  Body of model Margaux found on anniversary of grandfather's shotgun suicide  </h2>
  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Ian Katz</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>A dark new chapter was added to the Hemingway legend yesterday when the badly decomposed body of  the model and actress Margaux Hemingway was discovered in her California apartment, on the eve of the  anniversary of the shotgun suicide of her novelist grandfather.  <p>  <p>A coroner's office spokesman said a preliminary investigation suggested that Ernest Hemingway's  granddaughter had died of natural causes, most likely related to her history of epilepsy.  <p>  <p>But speculation that she may have committed suicide by taking a fatal drug overdose was fuelled by  reports that she had been severely depressed. A neighbour, Peter Osterlund, said Ms Hemingway, aged  41, looked "distressed and unhappy" when he saw her walking through Santa Monica on Saturday evening,  two days before her body was found by friends.  <p>  <p>Once the highest paid model in the world, the statuesque Ms Hemingway's less than stellar acting  career slumped as she battled with alcoholism and bulimia. Last January she was admitted to a  psychiatric hospital after shaving her head and announcing she could hear 'voices'.  <p>  <p>Ernest Hemingway and his brother, Leicester, both shot themselves to death. The novelist's sister  and father also died by their own hands. Ernest Hemingway once declared: "There are only two things  that can really kill a man, suicide and gonorrhoea." The family has been cited in studies on whether a  predisposition to suicide may be transmitted genetically across generations.  <p>  <p>Ms Hemingway's agent, David Mirisch, said she had recently finished narrating a television wildlife  series but had seemed depressed. "Until we get this diagnostic report, we don't know if it was an  epileptic seizure or if it was an overdose." An autopsy was scheduled for today.  <p>  <p>"There is no sign of forced entry or foul play," said a Santa Monica police sergeant, Gary  Gallinot. "We have no evidence of suicide, no note or anything like that. But we're not ruling it  out."  <p>  <p>But other officials said the mystery was far from solved. If Ms Hemingway died from a drug  overdose, either intentional or accidental, it would take up to six weeks to get the results of  laboratory tests, a coroner's investigator, William Grace, said.  <p>  <p>The body of Ms Hemingway, who lived much of her life in the shadow of her younger sister, Mariel,  was discovered after friends failed to get an answer at her apartment. A labourer climbed a ladder and  spotted her body, bloated by the 90-degree heat, through an upstairs window.  <p>  <p>Ms Hemingway was a little girl when her grandfather, as famous for his prodigious drinking as his  novels, killed himself with a shotgun at his Idaho home on 2 July 1961. Six years later her family  moved into the same house.  <p>  <p>Standing 6ft tall and blessed with striking features and lustrous blonde hair, Ms Hemingway shot to  prominence in 1975 when she was awarded a $1m contract to promote Faberge perfumes. In 1976, she  starred with Mariel in Lipstick, a forgettable saga of a young model who is raped and later publicly  humiliated during the trial of her attacker. She never managed to land another big screen role. Her  biggest gift to posterity may have been a California law, named in her honour, prohibiting the mention  of a rape victim's sexual history during trial.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Dalai Lama's visit to UK</b><br><br><br><b><h2>6 July 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Smear campaign sparks  safety fears over Dalai Lama's UK visit  </h2>
  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Madeleine Bunting</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>Members of a British-based Buddhist sect are behind an aggressive international smear campaign to  undermine the Dalai Lama - one of the world's most revered religious figures and political leader of  Tibet - ahead of his visit to the UK this month.  <p>  <p>The Dalai Lama is accused of being a 'ruthless dictator' and an 'oppressor of religious freedom' in  direct contradiction to his message of religious tolerance, according to a spokesman for an  organisation called the Shugden Supporters Community, based in Pocklington, Yorkshire, which has been  distributing press releases to 400 worldwide news outlets.  <p>  <p>Members of the Shugden Supporters Community (SSC) belong to one of the fastest-growing and richest  sects in the UK called the New Kadampa Tradition (NKT) whose headquarters are in Ulverston, Cumbria.  <p>  <p>The sect has expanded dramatically since it was founded in 1991, and is now the biggest Buddhist  organisation in the UK with more than 200 affiliated centres at home and more than 50 abroad.  Membership is put at about 3,000. The founder of the NKT is a Tibetan monk, Geshe Kelsang, who has  lived in Britain since the late Seventies. NKT members believe they must obey, worship and pray to  Kelsang because he is the Third Buddha.  <p>  <p>Kelsang is in almost permanent semi-retreat in Cumbria and speaks little English, although he is  the author of 16 books on Buddhism, two of which have reached the UK bestseller lists.  <p>  <p>Former members maintain that the Department of Social Security has unknowingly played a critical  part in funding the NKT's rapid expansion. NKT associates have acquired at least five large properties  in the last year and a significant proportion of the 300-odd residents of their centres claim housing  benefit of up to &#163;60 a week.  <p>  <p>The benefit is paid as rent and used to service the large mortgages on properties. Among the  properties acquired recently is Ashe Hall in Derbyshire, a neo-Jacobean mansion in 38 acres.  <p>  <p>Organisers are concerned for the safety of the Dalai Lama during his week-long visit to the UK,  starting on 15 July. There have been threats from the SSC of demonstrations in London and Manchester  where he is scheduled to speak before large audiences.  <p>  <p>At a demonstration last month outside the Office of Tibet in London, hundreds chanted anti-Dalai  Lama slogans and carried placards saying 'Your smiles charm, your actions harm.'  <p>  <p>The SSC maintains that the Dalai Lama has banned a centuries-old Buddhist practice and claims that  Tibetans in India have been dismissed from their jobs, monks expelled from their monasteries, houses  searched and statues destroyed.  <p>  <p>The Tibetan government-in-exile's London representatives at the Office of Tibet vigorously deny the  allegations. Amnesty International says the SSC has yet to substantiate its allegations.  <p>  <p>At dispute between Kelsang and the Dalai Lama - the latter has the backing of the majority of the  Tibetan religious and political establishment - is the spiritual practice of worshipping a deity  called Dorje Shugden. To supporters of the Dalai Lama, this practice can become demonic. The Dalai  Lama has warned his students against it and says this spiritual practice threatens his life and the  future of the Tibetan people. The NKT and SSC maintain Dorje Shugden is a Buddha.  <p>  <p>In the last few weeks, the SSC has launched a letter-writing campaign to the Home Secretary asking  for the Dalai Lama's visa to be stopped; draft letters have been distributed by NKT trained teachers  to their students, claiming that his visit will "do nothing other than harm" and accusing him of  "persecuting his own people".  <p>  <p>The concern among British supporters of Tibet is that the SSC campaign will play directly into  Chinese hands. As a Nobel Peace Prize winner, the Dalai Lama has had enormous success in raising the  profile of the cause of a free Tibet - the country has been occupied by the Chinese since 1950. The  Chinese see the undermining of his reputation as a world religious leader as an effective way to  weaken support for Tibet.  <p>  <p>The UK's Tibet Society, one of the hosts for the Dalai Lama's visit along with 27 UK Buddhist  organisations, accuses the SSC of being "sectarian" and of "going directly against the basic premise  of Buddhism, which is compassion and benefit of others".  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Dalai Lama's visit to UK</b><br><br><br><b><h2>17 July 1996</h2></b><br><h2>China issues stern  rebuke over Dalai Lama's visit</h2><h3>British Buddhists demonstrate against "religious persecution" by  Tibetan leader</h3>  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Madeleine Bunting</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>The Dalai Lama began his week-long visit yesterday amid a flurry of protests from China that  Britain was encouraging Tibetan 'separatism', and confronted by demonstrations by British Buddhists  accusing him of religious persecution.  <p>  <p>But the Dalai Lama, the political and spiritual head of Tibet, refused to be downcast. At a packed  press conference in the House of Commons before addressing MPs, he cracked jokes about his English  worsening with age, before making an impassioned plea to the Chinese to negotiate over the future of  his country.  <p>  <p>He appealed to Britain's sense of moral responsibility to bring pressure to bear on China.  <p>  <p>Referring to the "cultural genocide" being inflicted on Tibet and the recent wave of repression  which has seen images of the Dalai Lama banned in Tibet, he said a political settlement was the only  answer and offered talks "without any preconditions". He went on to meet the Foreign Secretary,  Malcolm Rifkind, and Labour's foreign affairs spokesman, Robin Cook, to press Tibet's case.  <p>  <p>The Chinese warned of the danger of a deterioration in Sino-British relations. A Chinese foreign  ministry spokesman said: "By inviting the Dalai Lama to visit Britain and offering him a forum, the  Tibetan group of the British House of Commons... abets the Dalai's action to split the motherland."  <p>  <p>But it was the activities of a British Buddhist sect, the New Kadampa Tradition, opposed to the  Dalai Lama, which concerned the organisers of the visit.  <p>  <p>More than 100 demonstrators gathered outside the Buddhist Society in central London, where the  Dalai Lama was attending a reception yesterday, to chant slogans and prayers.  <p>  <p>They accuse him of persecuting fellow Tibetans in the refugee settlements in India for devotion to  a deity called Dorge Shugden.  <p>  <p>The Tibetan government-in-exile in Dharamsala, northern India, has announced the creation of a  special committee of inquiry to look into the allegations, although it insists they are "entirely  baseless".  <p>  <p>Asked by journalists about the accusations yesterday, the Dalai Lama's response was simple: go to  India and look for yourself.  <p>  <p>He then launched into a lengthy explanation of why he had decided to speak out against Dorge  Shugden, after admitting that, in his younger days, he too had followed this spiritual practice.  <p>  <p>He said that Tibetan Buddhism, if misused, could degenerate into "spirit worship". His purpose in  speaking out against Dorge Shugden was to bring to an end the sectarianism historically associated  with this practice. "I have said what I believe in my heart. Whether people listen or not is up to the  individual."  <p>  <p>In a private interview, he carefully picked his way around the controversy which has engulfed many  of Britain's 130,000 Buddhists in an uncharacteristic and unseemly dispute involving deities,  divinations and oracles. "If you want to be a genuine Buddhist, you must know the historical  background to Dorge Shugden. Do more research."  <p>  <p>His warnings against this deity had been to Tibetans to whom he had a responsibility as their  spiritual leader. "British Buddhists are outside of my jurisdiction."  <p>  <p>He has offered to meet members of the NKT, which has 200 centres around the UK and about 3,000  followers, but the founder, a Tibetan monk called Geshe Kelsang, has rejected the offer, saying there  was nothing to talk about until the Dalai Lama removed the prohibitions on Dorge Shugden. The NKT  campaign has been to attack the Dalai Lama's personal integrity, accusing him of "hallucinations".  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Dalai Lama's visit to UK</b><br><br><br><b><h2>20 July 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Lecture: Dalai Lama -  Megatripolis, London  </h2>
  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Garth Cartwright</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>Megatripolis claims to be a lifestyle rather than just a club. While it remains best known for  pioneering Goa Trance - essentially techno - its Thursday night residency offers face painting, palm  readings, shiatsu massages and information on the latest road protests alongside the usual dance floor  mayhem. Allen Ginsberg has spoken there, Timothy Leary's dying internet messages were followed with  reverence in the main bar, and on Thursday afternoon Megatripolis was opened for that most unlikely of  fellow travellers, his Holiness the Dalai Lama.  <p>  <p>Actually, the Dalai Lama didn't enter Megatripolis's dark interior. Instead, his speech from the  Barbican centre was to be broadcast live here via a video-screen link-up.  <p>  <p>The motley crew - mainly casual clubbers with a smattering of office workers and fortysomethings -  reflected the hold Eastern mysticism has on the young and restless. In India, after the Goa party  season finishes, it's now a propos to head north to the Tibetan settlement of Daran Sala. Meeting the  Dalai Lama and learning Tantric law has replaced Kashmir's houseboats as the ultimate off-season  sanctuary.  <p>  <p>Entering a nightclub on a perfect summer afternoon gives a twist to the term chill out.  Megatripolis had done its best to maintain a meditative atmosphere with cushions covering the dance  floor, incense burning, ambient music playing and information on the Tibetan situation available.  Later in the evening the same venue would pulse to hard, electronic rhythm while revellers imbibed a  variety of contemporary chemicals. Yet an air of tranquillity covered the afternoon's event. Softly,  softly rather than techno terrorism. Transforming a nightclub into a temple is no mean feat. The music  stopped around 1.30pm and a lecture on Buddhism was delivered by a disciple. Initially intended to  last half an hour the failure of the video link-up to connect at 2pm left our lecturer rambling beyond  the call of duty.  <p>  <p>Finally, around 3pm it was announced that the link-up would begin. But only orally. With just a  black and white mug-shot of His Holiness to stare at, around half of the 100 strong audience left. The  rest of us tried to follow the four noble truths, a teaching at the heart of Buddhism.  <p>  <p>Megatripolis's huge sound system is not designed for the subtleties of the human voice, especially  one that is speaking Tibetan and is translated into English. Straining to hear I picked up tips on  meditation practice before having the insight that London sunshine was where I would find most peace  of mind. Enlightenment, as His Holiness has suggested, comes in many different ways.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Nelson Mandela visits Britain</b><br><br><br><b><h2>9 July 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Shameful failure to support the cause  </h2>
  <br>Commentary by
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Hugo Young</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>Nelson Mandela is a hero of the British people, and the compliment is returned. The second part of this takes some explaining. On the eve of the state visit, he spoke of British democracy as his lodestar and of the BBC World Service as a jail house lifeline. Magnanimity is the quality that most distinguishes him from other statesmen. Along with iron courage, it's what gives him a unique place in hearts and minds across the world. But Britain surely exacts a unique demand on his supply of it.  <p>  <p>Britain committed a special crime against Mandela and those who stood with him against apartheid. Being less magnanimous than he, I place this in a neglected catalogue of major foreign-policy errors which history, with its own purblind generosity, has never satisfactorily nailed against their perpetrator, Margaret Thatcher.  <p>  <p>Ten years ago this month, I sat in her room in Downing Street and interviewed her for the Guardian about South Africa. In the face of impressive competition, this encounter ranks among the most ferociously emotional performances she ever gave.  <p>  <p>Mainly she wanted to establish that sanctions against South Africa, then the policy of almost the entire civilised world, were immoral, and that the forthcoming Commonwealth conference would once again be dominated by her unyielding opposition to them. This policy had its hero and its demon. The hero, in Mrs Thatcher's eyes, was Chief Gatsha Buthelezi, the Zulu leader, her source-book for the native case against sanctions. The demon was Mandela, whose opinion, she said, "I totally reject".  <p>  <p>Buthelezi became the centre-piece of her African policy. Not only was he right but, her judgment said, he was going to win. Her loathing of Mandela and the ANC was almost boundless. She invested more resources than anyone in the world in Buthelezi, and by dint of this spectacular misreading let the British national interest be swallowed into her private moral universe. The results deserved to be catastrophic and, in the case of any other leader than our visitor this week, would have been. Her error was not to be mistaken about sanctions. There was a respectable argument against them. The crime was to be wrong about the outcome. Sanctions eventually worked with laser-like effect on the confidence of white South Africans and their bankers. And Mandela won.  <p>  <p>Such railing against the tide of history became the mark of Mrs Thatcher's foreign policy. It was partly due to a category-mistake. Whereas domestic policy can be made to bend to any prime minister in command of a substantial parliamentary majority, foreign policy is bound by different rules. It cannot, without collaboration, become a self-fulfilling prophecy. For a second-rank power, will and outrage are never enough. Mrs Thatcher personalised the targets of these futile feelings in a way that did persistent damage to her country. In retrospect, it is in the diplomatic field that the failure of her Cabinet colleagues to restrain her headstrong, half-baked moralising will be seen as most culpable, from a national point of view.  <p>  <p>Mandela is not the only rejected partner, regrettably, to have had the last, sick laugh. For South Africa in one hemisphere, read Germany in the other. It is not quite clear from the texts and memoirs whether Mrs Thatcher thought she could single-handedly prevent the reunification of Germany after the fall of the Berlin Wall. What is obvious is that her entire conduct at the time was directed towards that outcome. The expansion of Germany, she thought, should be postponed if not prevented.  <p>  <p>She feared and detested Germany, and scarcely minded who knew this. Again she personalised the enemy, with even less prudence than she demonised Mandela, and operated on the near-public assumption that Chancellor Helmut Kohl was a power-crazed lumpenkraut of no great brain. She assembled a learned seminar to support her thesis, which most of its members declined to do - earning marks for fastidiousness, but none for imparting it to their leader.  <p>  <p>The anti-German policy again hoisted prejudice above reason, regardless of the cost. With a clarity seldom available to living commentators, the Thatcher judgment that Germany must not reunite can be deemed as mistaken as the judgment that Buthelezi merited British support against Mandela. It showed deep confusion. So, more as farce than tragedy, does the former leader's insistence that she did not understand what she was doing when she signed Britain into the EU's Single European Act. This is the originating document of the single market, the aspect of Europe she most approves of. It also expands the reach of majority voting which she now abominates. She presumes to resolve this contradiction by simply writing it out of history, depicting it as the evil construct of her enemies. Such is the realism Mrs Thatcher brings to one of her largest foreign-policy decisions. There were global judgments she got right. In particular, she was right about the cold war, and about backing Gorbachev as an architect of its end. She was also right about the Gulf war. These, of course, mattered greatly. She had her own clarity, sometimes making a helpful cut through professional indecision.  <p>  <p>But Nelson Mandela's return recalls one of the bad things she did to Britain's name. And this, note well, is more than history. The Tory right still circles approvingly round Buthelezi. He was here just before the recent Natal elections, in which he didn't do very well, coining in support from anti-Mandela elements in influential quarters, Jimmy Goldsmith in the wings. Lusting after great capitalist politicians is a habit the right never tires of, however ephemeral their grasp on popular support. Remember the last messiah, Silvio Berlusconi?  <p>  <p>Britain was uniquely well placed to assist the apotheosis of Nelson Mandela. British investment and British trade gave London the lever that could have helped open his prison door. It was his, and our, misfortune that the moment of truth chanced to coincide with a British leader who did not want to take it. She preferred to pass by on the other side.  <p>  <p>Evidently he holds no grudge against this country. Perhaps he takes comfort from the disparity of reputation. On the one hand, a former leader fading into dyspeptic insignificance, unloved by any but the coterie: on the other, a hero of the world.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Nelson Mandela visits Britain</b><br><br><br><b><h2>12 July 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Celebrating in the royal box, thanks to the South Africans</h2><h3>Mandela Concert, Albert Hall  </h3>  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Robin Denselow</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>It took a long time coming but there was celebration by the end. Just after 10 last night Nelson  Mandela was in the Royal Box at the Albert Hall, a slick figure in his black tunic shirt, dancing and  waving his fists to urge on the South African bands on stage. The Queen, at his side, looked a little  bemused but briefly clapped along.  <p>  <p>A state visit from Mandela without music would have been unthinkable, for his extraordinary history  both as prisoner and president has been chronicled and celebrated by some of the best political pop of  the past 20 years. So a concert there had to be, but one that would entertain the especially invited  audience that had been told the dress code was 'lounge suits or celebratory' and consisted of a brave  blend of politicians, community workers and anti-apartheid veterans, as well as the royal party and  the president. They were treated to a decidedly patchy show in which the British contingent came off  by far the worst.  <p>  <p>That was the fault of Phil Collins, who used the occasion for the first outing of his Big Band,  helped out with the requisite number of celebratory guests. Brilliant product placing, launching off  on a show like this, especially as it is to be televised, but the result was dire. There were 19 on  stage, most of them a German brass section, and they started by providing an unnecessary, raucous  big-band backing for their first guest, the South African trumpeter, Hugh Masekela. Then on came the  conductor, none other than the legendary producer, Quincy Jones. Even he could not improve the sound,  but he brought on an efficiently unremarkable new soul singer who is unlikely to repeat the success  Quincy enjoyed with Michael Jackson. Next came Tony Bennett, and by now it seemed that the Two Nations  celebrating were the US and South Africa.  <p>  <p>Phil Collins blasted back for Britain and made matters worse with a thin, indulgent set.  <p>  <p>The second half, dominated by South Africans, was thankfully very different. Ladysmith Black  Mambazo's harmony singing was stirring and reliable as ever as the leader, Joseph Shabalala, switched  from an appropriate new song about development and race harmony through to 'Homeless', which they  recorded with Paul Simon.  <p>  <p>Then came Bayete, a band from Soweto, who were the real stars of the night with their blend of  township styles, vocal harmonies and soul. Finally, the veteran Hugh Masekela was back again, this  time sounding far better with his own band in cool, stirring laments. By the time he had invited the  full cast to join the finale the audience were at last on their feet and the president was dancing.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Seven stabbed in infant school machete attack in Wolverhampton </b><br><br><br><b><h2>9 July  1996</h2></b><br><h2>Seven stabbed in infant school machete attack  </h2>
  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>John Carvel</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>A massive hunt was under way last night for a machete-wielding attacker who forced his way into a  Wolverhampton infant school and lashed out at staff, parents and children as young as three in the  playground. Four adults and three children were injured.  <p>  <p>Police last night named a man they were looking for as 32-year-old Horrett Irving Campbell, also  known as Izzie, who lives in Villiers House, a block of flats near the scene of the attack at St  Luke's Church of England School in Blakenhall, Wolverhampton.  <p>  <p>Up to 50 police officers, some in riot gear, raided the block of flats in their search for Mr  Campbell, whom police described as a dangerous man, not to be approached. However, police stressed he  was only a suspect. Police also raided his father's home elsewhere in Wolverhampton. One local  resident said: "He's always been a loner, but he is a kind-hearted man." The assault brought renewed  demands for resources from the Government to implement recommendations for school security after the  murder of a west London headteacher in December and the massacre at Dunblane in March. Last night all  three children were undergoing surgery on what were described as "disfiguring head injuries".  <p>  <p>The children were named as Ahmed Malik, aged 3, Francesca Quintyne, 4, and Rhena Chopra, 4. Rhena's  mother, Surinder Kaur, 29, was also injured, and was last night undergoing an operation. The other  adults hurt were Azar Rafiq, 29, Wendy Willington, 29, and nursery nurse Lisa Potts, 19. The attack  came towards the end of the school day when a man in his mid-30s appeared to become involved in an  argument with a woman outside the school. Many of the children were at school for the first time,  enjoying a teddy bears' picnic party designed to make them feel at home when they began school next  term.  <p>  <p>The attacker jumped over the fence and struck out at a teacher before moving on to the party. He  slashed at the children as they tried to run inside. Bob Jones, the town's chairman of education,  said: "We believe he was chased away by a father of a pupil. If it had not been for those parents,  this could have been much worse."  <p>  <p>Superintendent Pat Wing of West Midlands police said: "This seems to be a totally senseless and  indiscriminate attack."  <p>  <p>The attack came four months after the Dunblane massacre, in which a woman teacher and 16 pupils  were gunned down. The inquiry which followed concluded that schools could not be turned into  fortresses, but that reduced numbers of entry points and installation of closed-circuit TV could  improve safety in some cases.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

  <br><br>      <p>IRA suspect Pearse McCauley, who broke out of Brixton prison in 1991, has jumped bail in Ireland and has not been seen since June 16, police said yesterday.  <p>  <p>Last year McCauley was released on &#163;70,000 bail by the High Court in Dublin while awaiting an appeal against British attempts to extradite him. He was also ordered to surrender his passport, live with his fiancee in Tipperary and sign on at a neighbouring police station every day. But police said he had not signed on in recent weeks.  <p>  <p>McCauley, 31, and IRA suspect Nessan Quinlivan, 30, used a smuggled gun to escape from the London prison while awaiting trial for conspiracy to murder and cause explosions, and fled to Ireland.  <p>  <p>After being jailed in the republic on firearms charges, they were freed last November under Ireland's early release programme during the IRA ceasefire. They were then rearrested over a British extradition request but were released on bail in December.  <p>  <p>Dublin police said: "McCauley has not been signing on daily and was last seen on June 16." They said he is believed to be on the run.   <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Tube strikes</b><br><br><br><b><h2>10 July 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Nine more Tube strike dates set  </h2>
  <br><br>      <p>London Underground drivers are to stage a further nine strikes in their dispute over a shorter working week, their union, Aslef, announced last night.  But Aslef's executive accepted an invitation from the conciliation service Acas to hold talks to try to avert further action. Tony West, assistant general secretary, said he hoped the "serious escalation" of the industrial action would not have to take place.  <p>  <p>Aslef cancelled a strike called for next Tuesday and set nine more dates for 24-hour walkouts: 18, 25 and 29 July; 7, 13, 23 and 27 August; and 5 and 9 September. Today the Rail, Maritime and Transport union is expected to announce that its members who are Underground drivers have voted to strike. The RMT could co-ordinate stoppages with Aslef.  <p>  <p>Mr West said Aslef regretted disruption caused by its three one-day strikes so far, but blamed LU for reneging on a deal to cut the working week by one hour.  <p>  <p>He accused management of making the situation worse by cancelling the rest days of RMT drivers on strike days and then falsely claiming that the action was crumbling. "Nothing could be further from the truth," he said. Ann Burfutt, London Transport's director of human resources, said: "We are saddened that Aslef have notified us of further dates for industrial action which could be linked to potential action by the RMT. We do, however, welcome the opportunity to get round the table at Acas."  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>MPs vote to have 26 per cent salary rise</b><br><br><br><b><h2>10 July 1996</h2></b><br><h2>MPs' pay: Voters say No  </h3>  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Martin Kettle</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>MPs who vote tonight in favour of the proposal for a &#163;9,000 pay rise for backbenchers will do  so in defiance of public opinion. A Guardian/ICM poll today shows that voters are overwhelmingly  opposed to increases on such a scale, whether for MPs or ministers.  <p>  <p>But, with tonight's Commons majority on a knife-edge, ICM brings better news for John Major and his  prospective successor, Tony Blair. More than a third of voters think the award of &#163;143,000 to the  Prime Minister would be 'about right'.  <p>  <p>That is still a clear minority, but significantly more supportive than the public mood towards big  rises for MPs or ministers - whose claim to a 'catch-up' award after a decade of restraint is being  resisted by Mr Major and Mr Blair in favour of another self-denying formula worth three per cent from 1  July.  <p>  <p>It emerged last night, however that shadow cabinet members, including Ann Taylor, David Clark and  Michael Meacher, refused to support Mr Blair's plea for unanimity on three per cent.  <p>  <p>The Prime Minister currently gets &#163;84,217, cabinet ministers get &#163;69,651, which would  rise to &#163;103,000 and MPs currently get &#163;34,000, which would rise to &#163;43,000.  <p>  <p>Some MPs, backed by ministers and Labour frontbenchers, are determined to insist on the full  independent award from the Senior Salaries Review Body, worth around 26 per cent. Others fear that  public pressure - plus the concomitant cut in their lucrative car mileage allowances - makes  discretion the better part of valour.  <p>  <p>Either way three-quarters of the electorate regards the proposed salary of &#163;43,000 for  backbench MPs as too high.  <p>  <p>More than half of all voters think the figure is 'far too high'. Only three per cent think it is too  low. An even larger majority of 78 per cent disapproves of the recommended &#163;103,000 salary for  cabinet ministers, with only two per cent thinking that too low.  <p>  <p>The poll asked voters: 'The Senior Salaries Review Body has recommended that MPs' salaries be  &#163;43,000 per annum from next year. Considering the job done by MPs and the salaries paid for  comparable work elsewhere, what is your view of this level of salary?'  <p>  <p>In reply, 53 per cent said it was far too high and 22 per cent a little too high, a total of 75 per  cent. Two per cent thought it was a little too low and only one per cent thought it was far too low.  Twenty per cent of voters thought that &#163;43,000 was about right.  <p>  <p>Asked about the recommendation that a cabinet minister's salary rise to &#163;103,000, 51 per cent  of voters said such an award would be far too high, with a further 27 per cent thinking it was a  little too high. Seventeen per cent think &#163;103,000 is about right.  <p>  <p>Public opinion softens a little on the proposal that the Prime Minister receive &#163;143,000.  Fifty-five per cent think the figure is too high, 7 per cent too low. However, 36 per cent of voters  say the award would be about right.  <p>  <p>Tonight's votes on a series of options promises to reflect the traditional Commons shambles on MPs'  pay. Nominally these are free votes, but frontbenchers will be expected to back their leaders. Some  MPs resent Mr Blair's stance just as they resented Lady Thatcher's in the 1980s; both have a  high-earning spouse. The result may turn on discreet abstentions. <p>  <p>* ICM interviewed a random sample of  1,200 adults aged over 18 by telephone on 5-6 July. Interviews were conducted across the country and  results have been weighted by the profile of all adults.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p><b>Why I'll vote for the rise</b>  <p>  <p>Brian Sedgemore, Labour MP for Hackney South:  <p>  <p>"MPs are overworked and grossly underpaid for their services. This pay rise has been recommended by  an independent body and I do not see why MPs should demean its findings by voting it down for  hypocritical reasons. If the shop stewards argue that we are worth this rise, we should take it. If I  was working outside the House of Commons as a barrister I would be earning &#163;250,000 a year, not  &#163;34,000. I am fed up with the designer hairshirt hypocrisy of Tony Blair whose wife Cherie as a barrister is bringing in a third  of million a year while he is urging Labour members to vote for 3 per cent. John Major is taking a  similar hypocritical line in arguing for pay restraint.  <p>  <p>"I come to work in a 1.6 litre Rover from Hackney - which does not qualify for the highest car  mileage rate (74.1p). I am a divorced man. I do not have a big house; in fact I would say I have one  of the smallest flats in Hackney, so I am not living in luxury.  <p>  <p>"Under the present rules I can only pay my staff &#163;7,000 a year. I want to be able to increase  this so I shall also be voting for higher office allowances. Then we can pay our staff decent wages  for the essential work in our constituencies. It is time MPs took a stand on this."  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p><b>Why I'll vote against the rise</b>  <p>  <p>David Porter, Tory MP for Waveney:  <p>  <p>"When I first got into Parliament in 1987 I doubled my salary from &#163;9,000 a year, as a Tory  agent to Jim Prior, to &#163;18,000 a year as an MP. Conservative Party agents are some of the lowest  paid people in the country so it was quite a relief to get the MP's salary at that time. I drive to  Parliament in an L-registration Ford Fiesta from my home in Lowestoft. We do have another car, an  M-registered (Renault) Espace, but it's not a top of the range model.  <p>  <p>"I came here to do a job I love so I wanted to devote all my time to it, so apart from two payments  from two political opinion panels, I have never accepted any consultancy work. My only other income is  the rents of a few small shops in Lowestoft and I share this with my sister.  <p>  <p>"My wife does not work now, although she did work part-time for me as my secretary at one time. We  have four children and all of them are educated at state schools. We do have a comfortable lifestyle,  I live in a five-bedroom detached house in a nice but not too posh road in Lowestoft. I really do not  believe MPs should get a 26 per cent pay rise when we are urging other people like teachers and nurses  to accept pay restraint. I know the pay rise has been recommended by an independent body but I don't  think the public will see it that way."  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>MPs vote to have 26 per cent salary rise</b><br><br><br><b><h2>11 July 1996</h2></b><br><h2>MPs take the  cash  </h2>
  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>David Hencke</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>MPs last night rebelled against their party leaders and any notion of pay restraint by voting  themselves a huge 26 per cent salary rise by a majority of 125.  <p>  <p>Although all 126 members of the government payroll vote were supposed to turn out and vote for John  Major's recommendation of three per cent, 16 failed to do so.  <p>  <p>They included Cabinet ministers Michael Heseltine, Malcolm Rifkind, Michael Howard, Peter Lilley,  Sir Patrick Mayhew and William Hague - all of whom were described later as being away on valid  government business. The bulk of Tony Blair's shadow cabinet also either abstained or voted against  the three per cent pay increase - leaving Gordon Brown and his shadow treasury team, and the Chief Whip,  Donald Dewar, among the few supporters of wage restraint.  <p>  <p>Paddy Ashdown faced his own rebellion with 16 out of his 20-strong party opposing his line.  <p>  <p>The vote will transform MPs' pay levels into the next millenium by indexing their pay to senior  civil servants every year and guaranteeing an automatic review every three years, starting in 2000.  <p>  <p>It means an immediate backdated pay rise to 1 July of &#163;9,000 to &#163;43,000 a year for all  651 MPs. Cabinet ministers and junior ministers get a backdated rise worth nearly &#163;17,000 from 1  July, taking those in the Cabinet to &#163;86,991 a year and putting ministers of state on  &#163;74,125 a year and parliamentary under-secretaries on &#163;66,623 a year. Mr Major, who voted  for a three per cent increase, sees his salary rise from &#163;84,217 to &#163;101,557 with a guaranteed  increase after the election to &#163;143,000 for the new prime minister. Tony Blair's salary rises from &#163;65,992  to &#163;83,332 with the new Leader of the Opposition receiving &#163;98,000 after the next election.  <p>  <p>The MPs' 26 per cent increase was tempered by a large vote - 376 to 39 - cutting the top mileage  rate for MPs' cars from 74.1p to 47.2p a mile after widespread criticism because it encourages them to  set an environmentally bad example by buying large gas-guzzling Jaguars and BMWs.  <p>  <p>Only Nicholas Winterton, the Conservative MP for Macclesfield who drives a Range Rover, defended  the present system, claiming that the cuts could put MPs lives at risk by encouraging them to use less  safe cars. He was supported by 38 other MPs, mainly Tories.  <p>  <p>MPs also voted for an increase in their office accommodation allowance by a narrower majority of  26, backdating this to 1 April this year. The changes will also help the 100 MPs retiring at the  election by increasing their allowance to return to normal life.  <p>  <p>The votes came after a two hour debate in which only Chris Mullin, the Labour MP for Sunderland  South and Dale Campbell-Savours, Labour MP for Workington, argued for any restraint.  <p>  <p>The first vote was a crushing defeat, particularly for the Prime Minister, with MPs voting down by  317 to 168 the Government's recommended pay restraint package.  <p>  <p>On top of this, some 170 MPs either abstained or were absent, this rising to 200 when it came to  the crucial 26 per cent pay rise vote. Voting then was 279 in favour and 154 against.  <p>  <p>Alex Salmond, leader of the Scottish National Party, pointed out that the three main party leaders  had managed to assemble only 168 supporters in the first vote. "What test of moral authority is that?"  he asked. He added: "The Commons has made a major mistake tonight and have misjudged the mood of the  country."  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Michael White</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>Downing Street last night insisted that John Major's decision whether or not to accept the MP's pay  rise which he voted against this week will be a 'private matter' for the prime minister.  <p>  <p>As union leaders renewed their criticism of the 26 per cent award voted through by a Commons  majority of 125 on Wednesday night, it also emerged that MPs will not lose their higher 74p a mile car  allowance until next April - to give them time to trade down to less 'gas guzzling' cars in future.  <p>  <p>MPs will get an extra &#163;9,000 a year before tax and ministers around &#163;17,000 each right  away because the new package ends the tradition whereby some of their MP's salary was abated when they  joined the Government.  <p>  <p>They will now get a full &#163;43,000 a year MP's salary, but will wait until after the election  before getting enhanced minister's pay which will take cabinet ministers to &#163;103,000, if they are  still in office by then.  <p>  <p>Mr Major's refusal to say whether he will take the extra money right away was matched by Tony  Blair. Other ministers and shadow ministers will not be so reluctant. Despite public anger, the size  of Wednesday's defeat for the offcial frontbench call for three per cent restraint reflects pent-up anger  on both sides that MPs have fallen behind other groups. A new anomaly emerged last night in the shape  of pay rates for ministers who are peers and thus get no pay as MPs. A parliamentary under-secertary  in the Lords will get only a &#163;1,300 pay rise, putting him or her only &#163;632 a year above a backbench MP.  <p>  <p>Postmen who deliver mail to MPs, and who will be joining strikes in a pay and working practices  dispute, yesterday attacked the politicians' bumper pay increase as 'scandalous'.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>MPs vote to have 26 per cent salary rise</b><br><br><br><b><h2>13 July 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Blair  spurns 26 per cent pay rise  </h2>
  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Rebecca Smithers</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>Labour leader Tony Blair yesterday sought to defuse continuing controversy over the  inflation-busting 26 per cent pay rise which MPs voted themselves by insisting he will accept only a three  per cent rise as Leader of the Opposition.  <p>  <p>Mr Blair became the only one of the three main party leaders - who had all urged their MPs to vote  for three per cent - to publicly disclose his plans after Wednesday's Commons vote.  <p>  <p>While Downing Street has officially described John Major's decision on the issue as 'a private  matter', he was last night described by a senior Cabinet source as having opted 'to follow his own  advice' in accepting only three per cent. He has told the Cabinet and ministerial colleagues that they  must decide personally whether to accept the full 26 per cent increase recommended by the independent  Senior Salaries Review Body.  <p>  <p>But the decisions by Mr Blair and Mr Major were not matched by the Liberal Democrat leader, who had  also urged his MPs to exercise restraint. Sources close to Paddy Ashdown said he would take the full  26 per cent. "After all, he is only on a backbencher's pay, and most of his MPs ignored his advice  anyway. He is not going to feel bad about it."  <p>  <p>MPs ignored their leaders' pleas and awarded themselves &#163;9,000 a year to put backbenchers on  &#163;43,000.  <p>  <p>The board also recommended that from after the general election, the Prime Minister's salary would  rise to &#163;143,000 - an MP's salary &#163;43,000 plus a Prime Ministerial salary of &#163;100,000 -  from &#163;84,217 now. Mr Blair was clearly trying to avoid an embarrassing collision with his shadow  cabinet colleagues when he insisted he was not criticising them for their action.  <p>  <p>The Labour leader, who was on &#163;65,992 as Leader of the Opposition, said: "I am in quite a  different position from my colleagues. I am paid far more than they are. I voted for three per cent - that  is what I shall take. I make no criticism of those in a different position."  <p>  <p>On Wednesday night Mr Blair was joined by only two of his shadow cabinet colleagues - Gordon Brown  and chief whip Donald Dewar - in voting for the three per cent recommendation. Of the 43 Labour MPs who  voted for three per cent the majority were left-wing backbenchers. Mr Major was deserted by more than 30  ministers - who were either absent or abstained.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

Officers were last night maintaining a bedside vigil over the woman's second daughter, who was critically injured.  <p>  <p>They are hoping that nine-year-old Josephine Russell may be able to provide vital clues about the deaths of her 45-year-old mother, Lin Russell, and her six-year-old sister, Megan. Their bodies were discovered early yesterday yards from the body of their pet terrier in scrubland near Chillenden, about 10 miles from Canterbury.  <p>  <p>Post mortems showed both died from head injuries. "This matter is now being treated as a murder," said a Kent police spokesman.  <p>  <p>Josephine was found alive, but with serious head injuries. She was tonight fighting for her life at a London hospital.  <p>  <p>Police said no weapon was found at the scene and detectives are working on the theory that an assailant unknown to the family struck without warning. A police spokeswoman said Josephine could have a key role to play. "Clearly she will be the main witness. Police are hoping to speak to her, though that will depend on her injuries. This girl is probably our greatest hope of finding out what happened."  <p>  <p>Mrs Russell left the family home in the village of Nonington to pick up her children from school in nearby Goodnestone at around 4pm on Tuesday. Staff at the school confirmed that she arrived to collect the girls, and the three were seen to set off.  <p>  <p>The Russell family had moved down from north Wales a year earlier. Shaun Russell, aged 48, was working at the Durrell Institute of Conservation and Ecology at Kent University in Canterbury.  <p>  <p>Dr Russell, described by his boss, Michael Walkey, as one of the nicest men he knew, returned home shortly after seven. He was worried and went to look for his family.  <p>  <p>He called the police at 10.45pm and two hours later detectives, led by Chief Inspector David Stevens, discovered the bodies.  <p>  <p>Yesterday Margaret Friar, aged 62, whose 10-year-old grandson, Nicholas, is a classmate of Josephine, said she watched every day from her kitchen window as Mrs Russell walked her daughters home.  <p>  <p>"That pathway is very overgrown and she did it on her own with two little girls. I know this is a lovely area, but these days you can't feel safe anywhere. I wanted to run down and tell her not to do it, but I never did." Daryl Peek, head teacher of the 78-pupil Goodnestone Church of England primary school, said: "We are in shock, we are in distress. We need to talk to parents."  <p>  <p>Village shopkeeper Barbara Whitley added: "The whole village is absolutely stunned. They were a lovely, close happy family. It is hard to believe that this has happened to them."  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Nick Varley</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>The schoolgirl who witnessed the murder of her mother and young sister may be unable to help find their killer because of the severity of her injuries, police said yesterday.  <p>  <p>Josephine Russell, aged nine, suffered massive head injuries in the attack as she walked home from school along a country lane with her mother Lin, aged 45, and sister Megan, aged six. Last night she remained in a critical condition in hospital. The bludgeoned bodies of her mother and sister were found on Wednesday in a wooded area near Chillenden, Kent.  <p>  <p>"Realistically, it may be unlikely that she is able to remember much, particularly suffering from such massive injuries. We have got to rely on other evidence," said Detective Chief Inspector David Stevens. Women living in the area were advised not to let children out of sight or walk along quiet country lanes until the murderer is caught.

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Lucy Manning</b><br><br>      <p>  <p><I>"In my 23 years of experience this is the most horific, terrible murder I have ever had the  misfortune to come across. The mentality of the person who could do this is beyond my imagination."</I>   - Dave Stevens, Detective Chief Inspector   <p>  <p><I>"People feel very exposed to each other. There is a very strange  atmosphere, everybody is talking about it and the speculation is extraordinary."</I> - Patrick Williams,  chef  <p>  <p><I>"I took my newspaper boy and girl off their rounds this morning, and their parents were very  relieved I had done so."</I> - Duncan Whitley, post office owner   <p>  <p>Police investigating the double murder in Kent of Lin Russell and her six-year-old daughter, Megan,  believe a local man may be responsible and could strike again.  <p>  <p>Detective Chief Inspector Dave Stevens, leading the inquiry, appealed for information yesterday and  said that the killing might have been pre-planned. "Given the nature of the injuries, there would have  been a lot of blood and anyone involved is likely to have been covered with a lot of blood. We would  like to hear from anyone who has been seen with bloodstained clothing." Mr Stevens described the  murders as an "utterly, utterly frenzied attack... by a person prepared to use extreme violence. It  is the work of someone who is clearly deranged." <p>  <p>A post mortem revealed both died from multiple  fractures to the skull, having received more than 15 blows to the head. Mrs Russell's second daughter,  nine-year-old Josephine, also suffered skull fractures and is critically ill in hospital. Detectives  had hoped she would be able to reveal vital information about the attacker, but now believe her head  injuries will prevent her remembering much about the attack. Her father, whom police describe as "a  tremendous help", is at her bedside. The bodies were discovered on Wednesday a short distance from the  family home in Nonington, near Canterbury. Mrs Russell had picked her daughters up from school and was  taking a short cut home through Cherry Garden Lane, a secluded country track.  <p>  <p>Mr Stevens said the pair had suffered an appalling death. "There were multiple injuries to the  skull. In my 23 years of experience this is the most horrific, terrible murder I have ever had the  misfortune to come across. The mentality of the person who could do this is beyond my imagination."  <p>  <p>Forensic scientists were examining the scene, but there was no sign of a struggle or an overt  sexual assault. The murder weapon has yet to be recovered, but police think a metal hammer or ice pick  was used. Police spokesman Mark Pugash confirmed there had been a positive response to their appeals  for information.  <p>  <p>"The response has been good, but it is too early to tell if it will prove to be productive. There  is a high profile police presence in the area and we will continue to interview everyone and conduct a  fingertip search." A criminal psychologist is to draw up a profile of the killer. Mr Stevens said the  nature of the murders meant that it was likely the attacker would strike again. "A person who has done  this must have the propensity to do it again. We must catch this person rapidly before that is allowed  to happen."  <p>  <p>Police have advised villagers not to walk along quiet country lanes, or let their children out of  their sight, and are hoping the police presence will provide some reassurance.  <p>  <p>However residents say information that the murderer may be a local man has already changed  behaviour in the village. "People feel very exposed to each other," said Patrick Williams, 41, a chef  at the Promis Centre, an addiction rehabilitation clinic near the village. "There is a very strange  atmosphere, everybody is talking about it and the speculation is extraordinary." The owner of the post  office, Duncan Whitley, 59, said the problem for the village was that there was no indication the  attacker had gone away. "One woman I know went round her house with the dog, looking in every  cupboard. I took my newspaper boy and girl off their rounds this morning, and their parents were very  relieved I had done so."  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Brutal murders of Lin Russell and daughter Megan in Kent</b><br><br><br><b><h2>13 July  1996</h2></b><br><h2>"Sighting" of village double killer</h2><h3>Report of man "acting furtively" provides  "deeply significant information" in hunt for murderer</h3>  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>John Mullin</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>Police believe the panic-stricken killer of Lin Russell and her six-year-old daughter, Megan, was  spotted dumping children's swimming gear in a remote lane a mile from the murder in Chillenden in  Kent.  <p>  <p>The man, acting furtively, was seen within an hour of Mrs Russell, aged 45, picking up her two  daughters from Goodnestone primary school on Tuesday. The girls had just returned from a swimming gala  in Canterbury. The witness came eye-to-eye with the suspect. Police are keen to keep his identity  secret for fear of reprisal.  <p>  <p>Josephine Russell, aged nine, remains in a critical condition in a London hospital. Police are  withholding its name for similar reasons. She suffered serious head injuries in the frenzied attack  which left her mother and younger sister dead. The family dog, Lucy, was also battered to death.  Detective Chief Inspector David Stevens, leading the investigation, believed the witness's testimony  was a breakthrough. "I consider this to be deeply significant information, vital. I think the witness  saw the murderer." The witness was walking his dog on Tuesday. As he returned to a group of houses  known as Rowling Court at 5pm, he spotted a beige coloured saloon parked in a layby, which looked like  an Escort.  <p>  <p>With Mrs Russell and her daughters last seen leaving the school at 4.10pm, the witness saw the  suspect within 50 minutes.  Mr Stevens said: "The car boot was up, and the man was trotting down the road. He stopped next to a  tree. He was looking around, acting quite suspiciously, and then he walked back to the car, and again  started to fiddle around with the boot."  <p>  <p>The witness returned home, and discussed what he had seen with his wife. There had been several  instances of puppies being dumped, and he returned to check the tree 15 minutes later. He found a net  bag, which police now know belonged to the girls. It is believed to have contained swimming towels and  one swimsuit. Police are sure the girls were carrying the bag when they left the school.  <p>  <p>The witness thought the bag was discarded rubbish. It was only when news of the murders broke the  following morning that he called police. He led them to the tree, and the bag was recovered.  <p>  <p>He described the suspect as between 35 and 40, and about 5ft 5in tall. He was slightly built, with  short, light-coloured hair.  Police believe the witness's testimony strengthens the view the killer is local. The spots where  the killings occurred and where the bag was dumped are isolated.  The bag and its contents were being analysed yesterday. Police have still to find the murder  weapon, thought to be a hammer.  <p>  <p>They believe the murders were premeditated but the getaway was botched. The suspect appeared  agitated. He looked around furtively, climbing over a bank to see if he was being watched.  The witness looked at him for about two minutes. He was about 30 metres away, and said eye contact  was made.  <p>  <p>Mrs Russell's husband, Shaun, who works at the Durrell Institute of Conservation and Research at  Kent University, was at Josephine's bedside yesterday. He is staying at a secret address in Kent.  <p>  <p>Detectives plan to interview all 2,000 residents in the three neighbouring villages of Nonington,  Chillenden and Goodnestone.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Brutal murders of Lin Russell and daughter Megan in Kent</b><br><br><br><b><h2>13 July 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Cosy image shattered  </h2>
  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Alan Travis</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>Shortly before her death, Lin Russell wrote to a friend describing their daily route to school through the Kent countryside as "pretty and very English across fields and woods".  The killer who bludgeoned her and six-year-old Megan to death on that country bridlepath also shattered the cosy image that life is safer in England's small rural communities than in its inner cities.  <p>  <p>The idea that life is now more dangerous in the countryside is borne out by some crime figures - although murders, especially those involving children, remain a rare event.  <p>  <p>Home Office figures for England and Wales show that an average of only seven children a year have been murdered for the last 20 years. Until 10 years ago most crime was committed in big metropolitan areas, but during the 'crime explosion' of the late 1980s - when the number of recorded offences leapt from three million to five million a year - the situation was turned on its head as the 'lager lout' emerged at the centre of rural disturbances. In 1989, non-metropolitan police forces recorded more crime than their metropolitan colleagues. By last year the split had reached 56 per cent for shire forces and 44 per cent for city force areas.  <p>  <p>Home Office research also shows that since 1985 recorded crime has risen by an average of two per cent per year in metropolitan areas, but by six per cent in non-metropolitan areas. By 1993 people faced a greater risk of being mugged, raped or assaulted in Wiltshire and Cambridgeshire than in County Durham, South Wales or South Yorkshire.  <p>  <p>However, a recent study in Leicestershire found that for every burglary in a rural parish, the affluent suburbs of Leicester had four - while a high-crime council estate recorded 14 break-ins.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Helen Nowicka</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>A community was brought together in grief yesterday as prayers were offered for Lin and Megan Russell at their church. Members of the congregation placed flowers on the altar at Holy Cross church, Goodnestone, Kent, during the service in which the Reverend Pat Goodsell described the murder of the mother and daughter as evil.  <p>  <p>Mrs Russell, aged 45, and Megan, six, were bludgeoned to death on Tuesday afternoon in woods near their home at Nonington, near Canterbury. Mrs Russell's elder daughter, Josephine, nine, suffered head injuries and was left for dead. Doctors say she will be brain-damaged.  <p>  <p>In his sermon, Mr Goodsell spoke of the disbelief that such a crime had taken place in the area. "There is anger; there is sadness; there is hurt and pain. There is sheer incomprehension that anyone could be so cruel, so evil, as to do such a thing."  <p>  <p>Jo Passmore, chairwoman of the parish council, said: "There is an awful feeling in the village. We are a close community who stand in the middle of the road and talk to each other. Now we are all afraid."  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Brutal murders of Lin Russell and daughter Megan in Kent</b><br><br><br><b><h2>16 July  1996</h2></b><br><h2>"She doesn't yet know that her mother and sister are dead"  </h2>
  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Lucy Manning</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>The husband of Lin Russell, who with her six-year-old daughter Megan was battered to death, spoke  emotionally yesterday about the murders that had ripped apart his family.  <p>  <p>Shaun Russell, frequently breaking down in tears, told a press conference about his feelings  following the death of his wife and daughter. His other daughter, nine-year-old Josephine, who  survived the attack, remains in hospital with severe head injuries.  <p>  <p>Dr Russell said his main concern was now for his surviving daughter: "I swing between periods of  complete desolation but most of all I am thinking about Josephine. I want to get her over all of this  as soon as possible so that I can get her out of hospital and back to some kind of life." Doctors have  said that Josephine, who has been moved from intensive care into a high dependency unit, is likely to  have brain damage from the hammer attack. Her father said she was off the ventilator and improving,  but was showing signs of impaired mobility.  <p>  <p>It had been hoped that she would be able to help police identify the killer, but Dr Russell said  she had not been told about the deaths. "She doesn't yet know that her mother and sister are dead. I  can't bring myself to tell her. She may be able to sketch the man we are looking for; she is a very  good drawer. But I don't relish the though of having to go through that with her."  <p>  <p>Dr Russell appealed for help in catching the killer, who police believe is a local man who planned  the attack. "I fear for the safety of everybody he is near. He killed my dog as well as my wife and  child," he said, and called on the attacker to give himself up.  "The best thing that that person can do for everybody's sake and even his own is to come forward. I  just hope that anyone who has anything to bring forward will tell the police as soon as possible."  <p>  <p>In the days before the murder Dr Russell had been collecting his children from school by car, but  on the day of the attack he had taken the car into work. "But Lin probably wouldn't have taken the car  anyway," he said, "because she and the girls enjoyed walking so much." They had just thought about  security for the first time, when in the week before the murders a plant pot had been stolen from  their garden and they had decided to vary their movements to deter other thefts.  <p>  <p>Lin and Megan Russell are to be buried in the countryside of north Wales, where the family lived  before moving to Kent. Clutching the hand of a police liaison officer, Dr Russell broke down as he  described how much they had loved the area. "It's what Lin would have wanted, it's what Megan would  have wanted and me and all my family want."  <p>  <p>Recalling life in the Kent countryside, Dr Russell was unsure whether he could return. "I returned  to my house for the first time last night and the lanes and the trees and the gardens look very  different now," he said. "Nothing horrid has ever happened to our family before, we have never had  anything tragic touch us."  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Brutal murders of Lin Russell and daughter Megan in Kent</b><br><br><br><b><h2>19 July  1996</h2></b><br><h2>New lead in Kent hunt  </h2>
  <br><br>      <p>Police yesterday released an E-FIT picture of a suspect in the case of the mother and daughter  found murdered in a lane in Kent last week. The man is white, in his 20s or 30s, with light-coloured  short hair with a fringe. He has fair skin and was wearing a red t-shirt.  <p>  <p>Police also disclosed new evidence yesterday. A local woman driving past the top of the lane, where  Lin Russell and six-year-old Megan were found bludgeoned to death, saw a man in a car around the time  of the murders. The woman remembered the incident after being questioned by police during road checks  near the murder scene in Chillenden on Tuesday.  <p>  <p>Detective Chief Inspector Dave Stevens said the witness had to brake suddenly as a car came from  the lane. The car stopped, and "she says the man looked around apprehensively before driving off".  <p>  <p>The car matched a description given by another witness, who saw a man throw a bag belonging to the  Russells into a hedge. He was driving a beige or light-coloured family saloon with red static strips  hanging from the back. Meanwhile, Josephine Russell, aged nine, in hospital with multiple skull  fractures from the attack, is continuing to improve in hospital. Police said she had been told that  her mother and sister were dead, but it was not clear if she understood.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Suicide of Amschel Rothschild</b><br><br><br><b><h2>12 July 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Rothschild suicide  shakes dynasty</h2><h3>Crisis of succession strikes 250-year-old banking business plagued by deep rifts and  rivalries  </h3>  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Patrick Donovan</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>The wife of 41-year-old multi-millionaire banker Amschel Rothschild, who was found hanged in a  Paris hotel room, yesterday appealed for privacy for herself and the couple's three young children  after the "shocking and devastating" news.  <p>  <p>Anita Rothschild, aged 38, issued the statement after her husband's bank confirmed that Mr  Rothschild had committed suicide in his room at the luxury &#163;500-a-night hotel.  <p>  <p>She said her husband's death had been totally unexpected and asked for the public to respect her  family's "grief and deep sadness".  <p>  <p>The announcement that Mr Rothschild had taken his own life came a day after French authorities had  said his death was due to a heart attack. Earlier yesterday, in response to a short news item in a  Paris newspaper, French police disclosed that Mr Rothschild had been found hanged. The circumstances  in which Mr Rothschild died are thought unlikely to have been made public if they had not been  apparently leaked.  <p>  <p>His body was found by a hotel cleaner on Monday. Mrs Rothschild, who divides her time between the  family's homes in Kensington, London, and a farm in Suffolk, flew to Paris after being contacted by  directors of Rothschild bank.  <p>  <p>The Foreign Office last night was unable to say if the British authorities were likely to be  involved in any investigation into the death. Staff at the Hotel Bristol which is near the Elysee  palace were yesterday ordered not to make any public comment.  <p>  <p>The news has caused huge shock in the City, as Mr Rothschild had been widely regarded as the  heir-apparent to the world's legendary banking dynasty. His death is expected to trigger a succession  crisis at N M Rothschild, the British arm of the family's global banking operations.  <p>  <p>Rothschild yesterday said the company had not yet addressed the problem of a successor.  <p>  <p>Sources say that Mr Rothschild, who is known to have felt under heavy pressure in his role of chief  executive of the bank's asset management operations was on a business trip to the Paris-based  Rothschild operations. His job involved managing investments worth &#163;12 billion and the business  was suffering from competition from larger international rivals. Mr Rothschild was thought to feel  increasingly anxious about the expectation that he would eventually succeed Sir Evelyn Rothschild, the  65-year-old chairman of the London bank.  <p>  <p>Mr Rothschild was described by friends as a shy and retiring man, who was far more at home on his  farm in Suffolk or indulging his passion for motorsport. He married his wife, a member of the Guinness  brewing family, in 1981.  <p>  <p>It is known that his father, the late Victor Rothschild put considerable pressure on him to give up  farming and join the family bank in 1988. Rothschild directors are expected to discuss the succession  problem at a full board meeting. The bank has been suffering a morale problem with six senior  executives recently quitting to take up jobs at rival banks.   <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Suicide of Amschel Rothschild</b><br><br><br><b><h2>12 July 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Reluctant heir who  struggled to live up to the family name  </h2>
  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Patrick Donovan</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>It is impossible to imagine what was going through the mind of Amschel Rothschild when he decided  to end his life in a &#163;500-a-night room at the Hotel Bristol in Paris on Monday afternoon.  <p>  <p>At 41, he was the vastly privileged heir-apparent to one of the world's most powerful banking  dynasties. He appeared to be happily married to Anita Guinness and his social circle spanned captains  of industry, fellow Suffolk landowners and members of the royal family.  <p>  <p>Yet those who knew him well say he was never comfortable with the public position and status heaped  upon him. He was a nervous and diffident man driven by his sense of family obligation to dedicate  himself to a job for which he was clearly unsuited. Former colleagues said yesterday he had been upset  at what he perceived to be his failure to live up to the Rothschild name.  <p>  <p>The forces which drove him to join the family bank are probably impossible to understand by anybody  born outside this banking dynasty which has dominated world banking for more than 250 years.  <p>  <p>Other big Jewish banking dynasties like the Warburgs or the Goldschmidts have come and gone. But it  has been the strength of the Rothschild ties of blood, religion and money which have helped the clan  survive. But the intensity of these relationships has also caused deep rifts and rivalries within the  family, according to those who have worked at the bank. For behind all the glamour there is friction,  bordering on outright animosity between the elders of the clan.  <p>  <p>The death of Amschel throws a huge question mark over the succession to the bank, casting doubt  over whether a bank controlled by a patrician family can survive in a global financial market  increasingly dominated by Wall Street and Japanese banks.  <p>  <p>The saga is as complex as the ownership structure of the Rothschild banking empire, which has its  main businesses in London, Paris and New York. These are loosely-linked family firms, handling  billions of pounds of investments, masterminding takeovers and privatisations in virtually every  international market where money is made.  <p>  <p>Presiding over N M Rothschild in the City of London is the autocratic figure of 65-year-old Sir  Evelyn de Rothschild. He is a bastion of the Tory establishment, close friends with Baronness Thatcher  and Lord Hanson and viewed with a mixture of awe and fear by even senior colleagues. The seeds of  discord within the Rothschild clan were first sowed more than 20 years ago, when Sir Evelyn fell out  with his cousin, Jacob - now Lord Rothschild - over how N M Rothschild should develop.  <p>  <p>After a First in History at Oxford, Lord Rothschild branched out successfully on his own. By the  end of 1983 he had formed a new outpost of the family empire, Charterhouse J Rothschild, capitalised  at more than &#163;400m and one of the City's largest merchant banks.  <p>  <p>He was forced to retrench after failing to take over the insurance firm of Hambro Life, which had  been a key part of his strategy. Today he presides over RIT Capital Partners, a &#163;350m investment  management operation and venture capital giant together with J Rothschild Assurance Holdings and Wall  Street-based J Rothschild Wofensohn.  <p>  <p>Sir Evelyn became the majority family shareholder and took ever tighter control. His masterstroke  was to appoint Sir Michael Richardson, another intimate of Mrs Thatcher. Together they used their  government connections to give N M Rothschild a seeming monopoly on lucrative government  privatisations: the &#163;6bn British Gas flotation, then British Petroleum and the vastly lucrative  electricity supply sales. It was during this period that Amschel was called upon to join the family  bank.  <p>  <p>The half-brother of Jacob Rothschild, Amschel would have been content to continue as a gentleman  farmer in Suffolk, but his late father Victor Rothschild - the MI5 counter-espionage expert and  Cambridge scientist - impressed upon Amschel that his duty lay in joining the bank to be groomed to  take over from Sir Evelyn when he retired.  <p>  <p>But not only was Amschel unsuited to banking, he also lacked his father's intellectual flair,  taking a mediocre degree at London University. Surrounded by high-flying Oxbridge graduates, he felt  his academic shortcomings intensely, particularly when he was appointed chief executive of  Rothschild's multi-billion pound fund management operation six years ago. Although he is said to have  worked 12 hours a day, he failed to turn round the business, losing lucrative investment contracts to  faster-growing competition.  <p>  <p>Not only was the asset management operation failing, but key non-family staff were becoming  increasingly disenchanted with Sir Evelyn's domineering presence and erratic management style.  <p>  <p>Sir Evelyn now has to solve the huge succession crisis following the death of his nephew. With his  eldest son just 19, Sir Evelyn's own children are too young to take up the mantle before his own  retirement in a few years time.  <p>  <p>One solution would be to persuade David de Rothschild, who heads the French arm of the bank to take  over in London. But colleagues say there are too many family tensions for such a unification to work.  <p>  <p>Another solution would be to give the job to Jacob's son, Nathaniel, who is 25 and working in  banking in New York.  <p>  <p>But insiders suggest that there is still too much of a rift between Jacob and Sir Evelyn for this  to work. Others suggest the family may finally have to turn to an outsider.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Orange parades given go-ahead in Belfast, leading to rioting </b><br><br><br><b><h2>12 July  1996</h2></b><br><h2>Ulster on alert for backlash</h2><h3>Orange 'victory' angers Catholics  </h3>  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>David Sharrock</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>Northern Ireland faces a further outburst of violence today with police determined to allow one of  the most emotive Orange parades in the loyalist marching calendar through a Catholic area of Belfast.  <p>  <p>With political talks falling apart under the pressure of this week's violence, Belfast was close to  boiling point last night following bloody scenes on Portadown's Garvaghy Road, where Orangemen were  finally allowed to complete their journey home from a church service five days ago. The decision by  the RUC chief constable, Sir Hugh Annesley, to let yesterday's march proceed was condemned by members  of the nationalist community as a surrender to mob rule. But John Major's ministers insisted that it  had been a purely operational matter.  <p>  <p>The Northern Ireland Secretary, Sir Patrick Mayhew, said there had been no political pressure on  Sir Hugh, who vented his frustration at having to police a hugely volatile situation with thousands of  angry people on the streets.  <p>  <p>Sir Hugh justified the reversal of his decision last Saturday to prevent the parade by effectively  admitting that loyalist violence and the sheer weight of numbers they could command had paid off and  the real danger of loss of life had become too high.  <p>  <p>He added: "I want the Government to look into the issue of how parades and demonstrations are to  run in Northern Ireland and how they can be reconciled between the two sides, because... I am sick  to death of being stuck in the middle of a non-winnable situation."  <p>  <p>Sir Patrick later said: "There needs to be guidance and therefore we will be looking very  sympathetically and urgently at some means by which an independent and external eye can be cast upon  this with a view to making recommendations."  <p>  <p>The Irish prime minister, John Bruton, and Mr Major spoke on the telephone for 20 minutes last  night. A Downing Street spokeswoman said: "They both agreed on the need for restraint on all sides,  and to find ways of stopping such occurrences happening in future."  <p>  <p>But a statement issued by a Dublin government spokesman said: "The Taoiseach told the Prime  Minister that there was widespread anger and deep concern in Ireland about the decision to allow the  Orange march down the Garvaghy Road, a decision on which there was no advance notice or consultation.  "The Taoiseach also told the Prime Minister he was dismayed that the elaborate preparations which were  made to prevent this provocative march were simply thrown aside in the face of massive intimidation."  As the march moved down Garvaghy Road, riot police fired plastic bullets at protesters and batoned  others staging a sit-down in the path of the parade. About 1,300 Orangemen marched to a drum beat,  ignoring the petrol bombs, rocks and abuse of residents.  <p>  <p>Within hours of the Garvaghy skirmishes and with violence erupting in nationalist areas of Belfast,  Armagh and Londonderry, more than 50 RUC armoured Land Rovers moved into Belfast's Ormeau Road in  preparation for today's Twelfth of July parade, putting the largely Catholic area under a 16-hour  curfew.  <p>  <p>The move came as an application by the nationalist Lower Ormeau Concerned Community for a judicial  review of today's parade by an Orange Lodge making its way to the main Belfast march - the highpoint  of the Battle of the Boyne anniversary celebrations - was rejected by the High Court.  <p>  <p>Spokesman Gerard Rice said: "The RUC are powerless, Mayhew is powerless and the courts are  powerless... Thousands of RUC men are swamping this area and beating people off the streets. It's  Orange law."  <p>  <p>The father of the Catholic taxi driver Michael McGoldrick who was murdered early on Monday by  unidentified gunmen yesterday said he had forgiven his son's killers. Urging an end to violence, he  said: "As I bury my son, bury your pride."  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Michael White</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>John Major acknowledged last night the violence which erupted after the fiasco of the Drumcree  Orange parade march had been "a defeat for the peace process". But in an interview with BBC's 'Panorama'  he said a lasting settlement in the province would not be "torn up and thrown away" by the street  confrontations.  <p>  <p>Relations between London and Dublin remained severely strained, however, with both Mr Major and the  Irish prime minister, John Bruton, reiterating their different interpretations of the RUC's decision  to allow the loyalists to march down a Catholic street.  <p>  <p>In the House of Commons, the Northern Ireland Secretary, Sir Patrick Mayhew, conceded the province  had suffered its "worst setback for many years", due to the violence arising from last week's  Portadown clashes.  <p>  <p>Launching a damage limitation exercise, Sir Patrick repeatedly defended the crucial decision by the  Chief Constable of Northern Ireland, Sir Hugh Annesley, to reverse his earlier decision not to let  Orange Order marchers enter the mainly Catholic Garvaghy Road.  <p>  <p>He announced a wide-ranging review of future management of 'controversial parades' as well as a  special inter-governmental conference under the terms of the Anglo-Irish Agreement on Thursday, at  which Sir Hugh will explain his tactics.  <p>  <p>On 'Panaroma' Sir Hugh said he believed that paramilitary influences on both sides of the sectarian  divide had deliberately created a crisis at Drumcree and that people would have been killed if he had  insisted that the march should not go ahead.  <p>  <p>With both the Social and Democratic Labour Party and the Democratic Unionists absent from the House  yesterday, it fell to the Official Unionist leader, David Trimble, to voice the resentment and  suspicions of loyalists that the confrontation was engineered by nationalist forces - even as he  appealed to Protestant paramilitaries "to maintain their ceasefire whatever the circumstances".  <p>  <p>Sir Patrick, who echoed that plea, won ready support from Tory MPs for his insistence there had  been "no political interference" in Sir Hugh's operational decisions. But Labour's Northern Ireland  spokeswoman, Mo Mowlam, made veiled criticisms of the Government's failure to act sooner, and  explicitly criticised Unionist leaders - "constitutional politicians who had not encouraged their  followers to obey the law".  <p>  <p>At a press conference, Mr Trimble insisted their presence in Portadown had prevented the kind of  disturbances which occurred at Belfast and Londonderry.  <p>  <p>In a frank admission that law and order had been at risk, Sir Patrick told MPs that orders made to  prevent "serious organised disorder" had been overwhelmed by "a clear and reprehensible intention to  over-stretch the capacity of the RUC".  <p>  <p>At Drumcree, where Orange activists had been trying to break through, there had been "insidious,  despicable and disgusting threats" to families of RUC officers.  <p>  <p>Meanwhile, in Belfast, Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein president, called on London and Dublin to  reappraise the peace process urgently.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Peter Hetherington</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>Nationalists and loyalists in Londonderry have held informal meetings in an attempt to avoid widespread disorder during the annual Apprentice Boys parade in the city next month.  <p>  <p>Amid fears of a repetition of the province-wide rioting following an Orange parade through Garvaghy Road in Portadown two weeks ago, John Hume, leader of the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP), has met the head of the Apprentice Boys to defuse tempers in Londonderry.  <p>  <p>With local republicans planning to march through the mainly Protestant Waterside area of the city on Thursday night, loyalists appear determined to assert what they regard as a traditional right to parade around the city's recently restored walls on the 10 August parade. They then plan to join more than 12,000 other Orangemen to march through the Protestant enclave of the Fountain on the way to St Colomb's Church of Ireland Cathedral. Both the Ulster Unionist leader, David Trimble, and Ian Paisley, leader of the Democratic Unionist Party, have visited Londonderry to stress they see no need to change the route, which will pass above the nationalist Bogside area. But the local SDLP believes a compromise will be needed to re-route the march from the Bogside if trouble is to be avoided.  <p>  <p>Incensed by the RUC's decision to allow the Portadown march down the Garvaghy Road, some nationalists are threatening to block the Craigavan Bridge over the Foyle to stop the Apprentice Boys crossing into the old city.  <p>  <p>With battle lines being drawn, Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland Secretary, is preparing to meet the Apprentice Boys to reach a compromise. Mr Hume is also planning further talks with Alastair Simpson, the governor of the Apprentice Boys.

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Ceasefire further threatened as 1,200lb bomb goes off in Enniskillen, Co  Fermanagh  </b><br><br><br><b><h2>15 July 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Avoiding civil war in Ulster</h2>
<h3>  Brinkmanship must end now</h3><br><b>Leading article</b>   <br><br><br>      <p>Ulster stands once again at the abyss after the first terrorist bomb for two years. If it tips  over, it won't be down to predestination but because people individually and collectively will act out  the Pavlovian responses of hundreds of years of irrational hatred. It is vital for all parties to lead  and to look beyond the self-gratification of instant revenge. Looking backwards has been Ireland's  fatal obsession. Of course, with hindsight it would have been the lesser of two evils if the Chief  Constable Sir Hugh Annesley had escorted the loyalist march in the first place instead of being forced  to do a humiliating U-turn. But it would have been even better if the loyalists hadn't wantonly  planned a show of strength to protect rites of passage through a Catholic enclave. If the talks are to  succeed there will have to be big compromises among Catholics, Protestants, the Irish government, the  British government and the paramilitaries. If the Protestants' contribution is to refuse to divert the  course of a historic march by a few hundred yards then how on earth can they compromise on much bigger  constitutional issues?  <p>  <p>It is possible to draw a doomsday optimism from the IRA's denial of involvement in the evil bomb  attack on Enniskillen's Killyhevlin Hotel on Saturday night during innocent wedding celebrations. The  IRA - whose abandonment of the ceasefire bears a heavy responsibility for heightened Protestant fears  - doesn't normally lie about its atrocities, with the recent exception of the murder of a policeman in  the Irish republic. If the Enniskillen bombing turns out to have been done by an IRA splinter group,  like the military wing of Republican Sinn Fein, then it has ominous implications but nothing compared  with a renewal of the IRA's bombing campaign in the North. This would trigger Protestant reprisals and  a brutal end to the glimpse of ordinary life that everyone has enjoyed these past two years.  <p>  <p>The vast majority still desperately want peace and their views must prevail either by mass street  demonstrations or by their leaders once more seizing the initiative. Sinn Fein must convert its  pathetic parrot cry that the British government is always responsible for whatever goes wrong into  positive leadership while the British government must give Ulster the priority it demands even in an  election year during which its unionist tail threatens its fragile majority. Perhaps free copies of  Nelson Mandela's autobiography should be distributed to show true Christian values, including his  inspiring ability to see good in his enemies throughout his political life. He displayed the virtues  of charity and forgiveness which have been absent recently from so-called Ulster Christians, whose  arcane theological differences will continue to baffle non-believers everywhere. The lesson both of  South Africa and of Ulster is that where there is a will there really is a way. John Hume may have  been falling into fatal Irish short-termism when he withdrew yesterday from the forum (though he is  staying in the talks process); but he was right to say that the streets of Northern Ireland are  screaming for the implementation of the Anglo-Irish principles. The talks must go on with all parties  prepared to participate before the results are put to a referendum. The alternative - a return to  sectarian civil war - is dangerously close. In the cauldron of Ulster politics even an hour is a long  time.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>David Sharrock</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>The bride and groom were taking to the ballroom floor for the last dance when the warning call came  through to the front desk at 11.40pm. Martina McManus and Thaddeas Turbett, who had earlier exchanged  their vows, led their guests out of the Killyhevlin Hotel, still dressed in white wedding gown and  tails.  <p>  <p>Then the bomb exploded. "It was a most diabolical sound, almost like a flashing light and I just  ran away," Geraldine McManus, Martina's younger sister and bridesmaid, said yesterday. "I must have  blacked out because the next thing I remember is the hospital. "We were enjoying a wedding and it nearly turned into a wake."  <p>  <p>A second call had been taken by a priest in Enniskillen, acording to local reports. Whoever made the call claimed they were from the  IRA. The porter, Declan McGovern, had just brought the hotel's owner, Rodney Watson, back from the  town centre. They examined the four-wheel drive vehicle the bomb was in.  <p>  <p>"At first we didn't take it seriously," Mr McGovern said. "We went over to the jeep. I looked into  the back and just saw pieces of wood, and then I went round to the other side and put my head in  through the open window, when I heard tick-tock sounds. I shouted to the others, 'it's a bomb'." The  doorman, Willie Stinson, said: "We had all the guests out when somebody said there were people still  inside. I went back in with a policeman and we found a woman and child. Within two minutes of getting  everybody out there was a loud explosion."  <p>  <p>In the hotel car park, a crater 12ft across marked the spot where the grey Isuzu Trooper had been  abandoned by the bombers, primed with 1,200lb of home-made explosive. The car had been stolen 11 days  earlier in Dublin, suggesting that whoever was behind the attack was not waiting for Orange Week to  give a pretext.  <p>  <p>Sammy Foster, the chairman of Fermanagh district council and a leading member of the Ulster  Unionist Party, heard the explosion from his home, three-quarters of a mile away. He and his family  were also caught up in the Enniskillen Remembrance Sunday massacre nine years ago.  <p>  <p>"It was a sound like a door slamming shut," said Mr Foster, who nearly failed to regain the  chairmanship after taking part in a controversial Orange parade through the nationalist village of  Rosslea, in Co Fermanagh recently.  <p>  <p>"It's sickening to think what could have happened. In 1987 a bomb murdered 11 good people, and so  many were maimed and still are suffering," he said. A man aged in his 20s, and his wife and two young  daughters, came out of morning mass at St Michael's. "I don't think it was quite unexpected in the  atmosphere of last week," he said.  <p>  <p>"Most people will be saddened by it, especially here in Enniskillen, which is very mixed and both  sides get on very well together. There's no point asking why Enniskillen. Why anywhere?"  <p>  <p>Since 1987, the town has undergone a startling transformation. The main street pedestrianised, the  buildings cleaned, new shops and restaurants opened and the overbearing security restrictions lifted.  But nothing has been done to replace the building demolished by one of Northern Ireland's worst bombs.  <p>  <p>"After the events of last week we see the need to begin again," said the parish priest, Monsignor  Cahill. "It's just too bad that Enniskillen should be visited again by such a calamity."  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Imran Khan brings libel case against Ian Botham and Allan Lamb  </b><br><br><br><b><h2>16 July  1996</h2></b><br><h2>Botham and Lamb hit out at Imran's hat-trick of insults</h2><h3>Former Test stars bring  libel case after being called "racist, uneducated and lacking class"</h3>  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Ruaridh Nicoll</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>Jemima and Imran Khan were looking sweet together as they held hands under the table or flicked  through a coffee table book charting Mike Atherton's career. A few yards away Ian Botham was sounding  aggrieved.  <p>  <p>Pointing out that Viv Richards was godfather to one of his children, he was defending himself  against Imran's claim that he was a racist. "I like to think I could touch down anywhere in the world  and knock on someone's door and, whatever creed or nationality, they would be pleased to see me," he  said.  <p>  <p>Because both cricket stars are beginning to age - Botham's moustache turning grey and Imran  developing a bald spot - court 13 of the Royal Courts of Justice, rather than Lord's, seemed an  appropriate place to do battle. Allan Lamb, or "Lambie" as Botham referred to him, is also involved in  the alleged libel being heard before Mr Justice French.  <p>  <p>Botham and Lambie's lawyer, Charles Gray, explained the case to the jury. He said Imran launched an  "offensive personal attack" on the two. "Firstly, he called them racists," he said. "Secondly, he  called them uneducated. And thirdly, he accused them of lacking class and upbringing."  <p>  <p>Botham was appalled. "I've come to this court because I was very proud of what I achieved in sport  and to be called racist - which is one thing I have fought against for most of my life - and to be  called a cheat is something I take great offence to.  <p>  <p>"I don't quite understand what class has to do with it. The sacrifices my parents made for me to  make it possible for me to achieve what I wanted to achieve in sport have been numerous."  <p>  <p>Mr Gray explained that it had all begun in an authorised biography of Imran when the Pakistani  admitted to tampering with a cricket ball. Botham reacted with disgust and Imran had replied in an  article in India Today magazine. Mr Gray, quoting from the magazine, said the interviewer had asked  what the motive for Botham's attack had been and Imran had replied with venom: "There is a lot of  racism here."  <p>  <p>Imran, a member of the warrior caste in Pakistan, then brought class into it. "Look at the people  who have taken the rational side in the controversy - Tony Lewis, Christopher Martin-Jenkins and Derek  Pringle. They are all educated Oxbridge types. Look at the others - Lamb, Botham, Trueman. The  difference in class and upbringing makes a difference."  <p>  <p>Botham left secondary modern school when he was 15 while Imran attended Oxford.  <p>  <p>Yesterday both Botham and Lamb displayed nothing but good manners; neither picked their noses or  scratched unsavory parts of their bodies. Clothing, however, might provide a clue. While Imran wore a  dashing black suit that matched his raven hair and Jemima sported a luminous blue kameez that flowed  over her pregnancy, both Lambie and Botham managed to look like extras from 'The Bill'.  <p>  <p>Mr Gray said Imran is also being sued because of a comment he made to The Sun.  <p>  <p>"The biggest names of English cricket have all [tampered with the balls] and when I say 'big names'  I mean as big as you can get," Mr Gray quoted him as saying.  <p>  <p>The lawyer pointed out that Botham, who took 383 wickets in his Test career, was certainly one of  the greatest bowlers in English cricket. As Mr Gray continued to examine Botham, and the player told  of his "blinding anger" at Imran's attack, the day drifted to a close.  <p>  <p>The players wandered out into the sea of cameramen on the Strand. According to Mr Gray, all Botham  and Lambie had wanted was a retraction and an apology, not 10 days in court.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Vivek Chaudhary</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>With two of the world's greatest all-rounders and one of England's finest batsmen in court, and a  posse of eminent cricket commentators milling around, there was, perhaps, only one man who could have  up-staged them. Enter Geoffrey Boycott into court 13 of the High Court yesterday, wearing a garish  green tie and sleeveless shirt and holding a cricket shoe. "Your honour, can I say I'm sorry I haven't  got a jacket on but I was rushed from the Test match at Lord's where I was expecting to be  commentating," he said to Mr Justice French.  <p>  <p>After giving his full address in Yorkshire, including post code, he added: "That's in England."  <p>  <p>George Carman, QC, representing Imran Khan, said: "It hasn't declared its state of independence?"  He replied: "We like to think we are a bit different."  <p>  <p>Boycott was giving evidence on behalf of the former Pakistani cricket captain who is being sued for  libel by former England cricketers Ian Botham and Allan Lamb.  <p>  <p>The two are suing Imran over an interview in India Today magazine which quoted him as saying they  were racists, uneducated, and lacking in class. Botham is also suing Imran over an article in the Sun  which he claimed accused him of ball tampering. Imran, who denies libel, claims he was misquoted and  never called Botham a cheat.  <p>  <p>Boycott was asked by Charles Gray, QC, representing Botham and Lamb, about the evidence of his  former Yorkshire colleague, Brian Close, who had earlier said he would not like to answer a question  on whether Boycott was an 'honest man'. Boycott said Close was "bitter and angry".  <p>  <p>He said ball tampering, like picking the seam, had gone on for as long as he could remember. He  compared it to driving slightly above the speed limit. "We've all done it," he said. "I've seen seam  bowlers and spinners do it." He added: "There's a debate because those that won't accept that ball  tampering has gone on keep trying to pretend that it doesn't go on - and it's gone on for as long as I  can remember.  <p>  <p>"You tell me someone has kept to the speed limit all his life. We are all a bit naughty and knock  on over 30 miles an hour when we shouldn't." At the end of his cross-examination, Boycott produced the  cricket shoe, saying he wanted to explain other things that went on apart from ball tampering.  <p>  <p>The judge said he had to play according to the rules of "this procedure", but Boycott held the shoe  aloft and said: "One of the witnesses, Brian Close, said he and his teams played in accordance with  the laws and rules of the game, but..."  <p>  <p>At this point Mr Gray cried "foul play", adding: "I owe a duty to Brian Close to object."  <p>  <p>The proceedings threatened to degenerate into farce as Mr Carman asked if Boycott agreed with  Close's comment: "The game first, team second and players third." He said he did not understand the  comment.  <p>  <p>The judge intervened: "It appears to me that this witness's evidence is in danger of getting out of  hand and I think that having been examined, cross-examined and re-examined, he should now leave the  witness box." Boycott, looking rather sheepish, made his way out of court and back to Lord's.  <p>  <p>The hearing continues.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Vivek Chaudhary</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>The libel action by Ian Botham and Allan Lamb against Imran Khan was "contrived and hollow", George Carman QC, representing Imran, claimed in his closing speech at the High Court yesterday.  <p>  <p>He asked the jury to consider whether the two approached the case with "some kind of personal agenda".  <p>  <p>"You have to consider whether in morality or decency, Imran Khan should ever have to pay them a penny."  <p>  <p>With one England-Pakistan confrontation concluded at Lords yesterday, lawyers at the High Court were preparing for the end of the encounter involving the two countries' most famous cricketers.  <p>  <p>Botham and Lamb are suing Imran over an interview in India Today magazine which quoted him as saying they were racists, uneducated and lacking class. Botham alone is suing Imran over an article in the Sun newspaper, which he claimed accused him of ball tampering.  <p>  <p>Imran, who denies libel, claims he was misquoted in the magazine, and that he never called Botham a cheat.  <p>  <p>Mr Carman told the jury there had been overwhelming evidence during the trial that there were a number of technical breaches of the laws of cricket which were part and parcel of the game. The suggestion that no apology had been offered by Imran was incorrect and the jury had been directed to that effect by the judge.  <p>  <p>In the Sun article, Imran was merely defending himself following a campaign against him by Botham and Lamb.  <p>  <p>Charles Gray QC, representing Botham and Lamb, said in his closing speech that his clients only ever wanted a public apology but had never received one.  <p>  <p>It was a "vile and defamatory" slur to call his clients racist, and ball tampering was "cheating according to anybody's right-thinking definition of that word".  <p>  <p>It was absolute bunkum for Imran Khan's QC to dismiss the libel action against the former Pakistani skipper as "contrived and hollow", he told the court.  <p>  <p>The case continues today.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Diana withdraws from all but six charities as patron</b><br><br><br><b><h2>17 July  1996</h2></b><br><h2>Charity begins at home as Diana cuts back</h2><h3> Princess withdraws support from 100  good causes, but remains patron of six groups</h3>  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>David Brindle</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>About 100 charities were yesterday dealt a blow bigger than anything the competition of the  National Lottery has thrown at them when the Princess of Wales resigned as their patron.  <p>  <p>Princess Diana, whose support has boosted the charities' fundraising by hundreds of thousands of  pounds, said she could not give the commitment they deserved as she sought to reorganise her life  after her divorce. Six charities are to keep the princess as their patron or president. They are  likely to benefit from the concentration of her charitable work on a handful of causes.  <p>  <p>Brian Roberts-Wray, chairman of the Institute of Charity Fundraising Managers, said: "The potential  positive effect for the half-dozen that she is staying with is probably substantially greater than the  potential negative effect for the 100 she is giving up."  <p>  <p>The princess's decision came in letters received by the 100 charities the day after her marriage to  the Prince of Wales was conditionally ended by a decree nisi.  <p>  <p>The letters said: "As I seek to reorganise my life, it will not be possible for me to provide you  with the level of commitment that I believe you deserve. I feel that someone else in the royal family  may now be better suited to support your tremendous endeavours."  <p>  <p>The princess's office put the number of charities involved at almost 100. A listing compiled two  years ago said she was patron or president of 115, suggesting she has resigned from 109, either  yesterday or previously. The six charities with which she is to continue are: the London homelessness  charity Centrepoint; English National Ballet; The Leprosy Mission; the National Aids Trust; and Great  Ormond Street children's hospital and the Royal Marsden cancer hospital, both in London.  <p>  <p>There was dismay among the rejected charities and, below the surface, resentment at the good  fortune of the six established, successful and largely metropolitan groups.  <p>  <p>One organisation in receipt of the dreaded letter was Ty Hafan, in Barry, South Glamorgan, which is  seeking to raise &#163;2m towards building the first children's hospice in South Wales. Last night it  wrote to the princess pleading with her to reconsider. Dominic Jenkins, its chief executive, said:  "The princess became our patron a only year ago, but our donations have increased dramatically."  <p>  <p>Vanessa Gould, spokeswoman for Turning Point, which works with people with drug, alcohol or mental  health problems, said the charity had been surprised to get a resignation letter.  <p>  <p>"She has said before that we are one of her favourite charities. Even as the letter arrived, our  chief executive was writing to her about some work which we thought she might do for us later in the  year." At one time, the princess was doing something for Turning Point every month, Ms Gould said.  "She did a premiere of the Apollo 13 film last year, which raised over &#163;60,000 for us."  <p>  <p>Relate, the marriage and relationship guidance charity, is another loser. It said the princess had  been "immensely supportive" since becoming patron in 1989.  <p>  <p>The charity has estimated that her presence at a film premiere boosted the money raised tenfold, to  &#163;100,000.  <p>  <p>The losses will not be merely financial. The princess has been able to focus attention on issues  not always easy to publicise. In 1989, she invited reporters and TV crews into her sitting-room at  Kensington Palace to meet youngsters with learning disabilities or mental handicap.  <p>  <p>Roger Singleton, senior director of Barnardo's, the charity involved on that occasion and another  of the unlucky 100, said yesterday: "The princess has often commanded mass attention when she speaks  out on issues which affect children."  <p>  <p>Mr Roberts-Wray said not all the 100 charities would suffer equally. Royal patrons were only really  effective if they were active and it was inconceivable that the princess had been truly active on each  organisation's behalf.  <p>  <p>One of the princess' closest friends said last night that she was depressed over her divorce and  wanted to wipe the slate clean.  <p>  <p>Rosa Monckton clearly speaking with the authority of the princess, told ITN: "It's not a decision  which she took lightly but clearly she does want to spend a lot of time with her children and planning  her life ahead."  <p>  <p><b>Royal works</b>  <p>  <p>Top Patrons* - number of charities  <p>The Queen - 215  <br>Prince of Wales - 160  <br>Queen Mother - 150  <br>Duke of Edinburgh - 140  <br>Princess of Wales - 115 (now 6)  <br>Princess Royal - 105  <br>Duke of York - 30  <br>Duchess of York - 25  <br>Prince Edward - 20  <p>    <p>* Patron or president, 1994  <br>Source: Charities Aid Foundation  <p>    <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Wafic Said offers &#163;20m to build new Oxford business school</b><br><br><br><b><h2>17 July 1996</h2></b><br><h2> Wafic Said gives Oxford 20m college</h2><h3>New business  school to attract world's "best and brightest"  </h2>
  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Donald Macleod</b><br><br>      Oxford University yesterday accepted its largest donation for more than half a century - &#163;20m for a business school - from a Syrian-born businessman.  <p>  Wafic Rida Said, an admirer of Lady Thatcher and friend of the former minister Jonathan Aitken, would be immortalised by Oxford alongside other generous benefactors, said Lord Jenkins of Hillhead, the university's chancellor.    <p>The gift is the largest since Lord Nuffield gave &#163;3m in the 1930s (worth an estimated &#163;77m at today's prices) to promote medical science.    <p>The new Oxford Business School will attract the "brightest and best" students and staff, offering a grounding for business leaders from all over the world, said Mr Said, who will take a keen interest in the building planned for the centre of Oxford. It will be the latest in a list of construction projects that have made his name and fortune, notably in Saudi Arabia.    <p>Mr Said admitted that he had never been to business school himself but the Oxford project was the culmination of an ambition. His father had founded Syria's first university in Damascus. "I come from a family and a culture that believes in education. I have spent many years in Britain and I admire this country. Management education plays a vital part in making a country competitive. This is a great opportunity for Oxford to spread its standards of excellence to this new sphere."    <p>His gift will enable the university to catch up with Cambridge in having a business school to take on international competition like Chicago and Stanford.    <p>The Oxford Business School, scheduled to open in 1998 in the city's Mansfield Road, will eventually take 500 students, 150 of them on Masters of Business Administration (MBA) courses. The first 40 places for next year attracted more than 200 high calibre applications.

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Privatisation of Royal Mail to be included in Tory manifesto </b><br><br><br><b><h2>17 July  1996</h2></b><br><h2>Tories to sell Royal Mail</h2><h3>5p cut in letter post to be offered in manifesto   </h3>  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>David Hencke</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>The blueprint for a scheme to break up the Royal Mail into 11 regional franchises - each to be  tendered to private firms - is being planned by ministers for inclusion in the Conservative election  manifesto. The plans to revive the controversial privatisation of the Post Office will be sent to  Downing Street by a team of ministers under the Trade Secretary, Ian Lang, and would be intended to  cut 5p from the cost of posting a letter. The proposals will also include selling off Parcelforce, the  Post Office's carrier, to a private company and an acceleration of the leasing of the remaining Crown  Post Offices to private owners. Post Office Counters Ltd, which has overall responsibility for sub and  main post offices, will remain in the public sector.  <p>  <p>The privatisation of the Post Office, which makes a profit of &#163;420m a year, is likely to raise  more than &#163;1bn. A new regulator, the director of Ofpost, will be created to supervise the  privatised mail service, joining colleagues responsible for rail, gas, water, electricity, telephones  and the National Lottery. The most dramatic impact for the public would be a plan to replace the  present national 26p first class and 20p second class with a new maximum charge set by the regulator  for national mail. Competing companies would offer lower rates inside their regional franchises and  lower national rates.  <p>  <p>The plan is based on what ministers regard as the successful privatisation of British Rail - with  the aim of encouraging different private companies to bid for 15-year franchises to run Royal Mail  regions.  <p>  <p>Contracts will also be let to provide the trunking arrangements between the 11 franchises to keep  the national delivery service in place. The 11 regions are Scotland, Northern Ireland, Wales, London,  North East, North West, Midlands, Anglia, the South East, the South West and South Central (covering  West Sussex, Hampshire, Dorset, Berkshire and Surrey). Ministers believe the break-up will introduce  millions of pounds of productivity savings and cut postal charges. The biggest reduction could be in  London where postal charges within the capital could drop by more than 5p.  <p>  <p>Ministers were emphasising yesterday that the full details of the scheme are still being discussed.  But the biggest gains will come from changing working practices.  <p>  <p>The move comes at a sensitive time. Ministers are planning to suspend the Post Office monopoly of  post under &#163;1 if the next series of strikes by staff, due to begin tomorrow, takes place. But the  privatisation plans suggest that ministers still want to keep a national delivery system for the  foreseeable future, suggesting it would be restored immediately the strike finished.  <p>  <p>Ministers appear to believe that the strikes will change attitudes to privatisation among members  of the public, who have constantly opposed the sale of the Royal Mail.  <p>  <p>Michael Heseltine, the Deputy Prime Minister, can be expected to back the move since he was  particularly angry about being thwarted in his plan to introduce a privatisation bill last year. Tory  rebels refused to agree the plan.  <p>  <p>The separate sale of Parcelforce was dropped by the Government last year because it could not  attract buyers for its loss-making services.   <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>David Hencke</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>Huge pay rises for MPs and ministers  <p>  <p>including a &#163;60,000 annual increase for the next prime minister - are to be rushed through Parliament next week.  <p>  <p>A free vote for MPs to approve a &#163;9,000 increase for backbenchers and pay rises of between &#163;20,000 and &#163;30,000 for ministers is  <p>  <p>expected to be agreed by the Cabinet today. The rises would be the biggest for more than 30 years, but will not come into force until after the next election.  <p>  <p>Tony Blair, who could benefit from the biggest rise in the prime minister's pay this century if he enters Downing Street, declined yesterday to reveal which way he will vote. So did John Major. But Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, is to vote against and will back a 3 per cent rise. Details of the pay rises were revealed yesterday with the leaking to the Press Association of a Senior Staff Salaries Review Board report, which calls for substantial rises to redress a long period in which MPs' pay has been tied to inflation.  <p>  <p>The report recommends salaries of &#163;103,000 per year for cabinet ministers and the Speaker, an increase of more than &#163;33,000 on the present &#163;69,651 a year. Ministers of state would receive &#163;74,125 and junior ministers &#163;66,623, rises of between &#163;15,000 and  <p>  <p>&#163; 20,000 a year.  <p>  <p>The report, however, criticised the mileage rates paid to MPs and recommended a substantial cut. It describes the top rate, 74.1p, as 'unjustifiably generous' and recommends the level paid to peers, 47.2p a mile.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Bomb goes off at Olympics site, Atlanta's Centennial Park</b><br><br><br><b><h2>  19 July 1996</h2></b><br><h2> Games in shadow of terror  </h2>
  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>John Duncan</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>FBI investigators said yesterday they were closing in on the terrorist who detonated a bomb in Atlanta's Centennial Park during the early hours of Saturday morning, as officials scrambled to explain why a warning received by emergency operators never reached the park where thousands of revellers were attending a rock concert.  <p>  <p>Investigators confirmed they were looking for "a white American man" who made a warning call to police 18 minutes before the blast. An FBI spokesman, David Tubbs, said composite sketches of at least one suspect could be released soon. The warning call came from a public telephone outside a hotel adjoining the park. The phone had been taken to Washington for forensic tests, Mr Tubbs said.  <p>  <p>The blast, which sent nails and screws flying into the crowd, killed an American woman, and a Turkish cameraman died of a heart attack as he rushed to the scene. It injured 110 people.  <p>  <p>FBI sources said the pipe-bomb was more sophisticated than initially thought, but that agents were still concentrating on the theory that a local terrorist was responsible. The device was being compared to "other bombs built over the course of the years in this country".  <p>  <p>As the Games continued and attendances at most events remained high, President Clinton hailed athletes and spectators for showing "that they would not be intimidated". He said he had invited congressional leaders to the White House today to discuss expanding wiretapping and chemically 'tagging' explosives to help crack down on terrorism.  <p>  <p>Games organisers said the Centennial Park, designed to be the life and soul of the Olympics, would reopen tomorrow with boosted security, including random bag searches.  <p>  <p>Meanwhile investigators probing the crash of a TWA Boeing 747 off eastern Long Island on 17 July, killing all 230 people aboard, were speculating that the explosion was caused by a bomb in the front cargo section, one of them told Associated Press.  <p>  <p>The theory emerged after officials revealed they had found the front section of the aircraft more than 1 1/2 miles from debris from the rest of the plane.  <p>  <p>"I guess it's fair to say that things that come off first tend to be an indicator of what happened," said Robert Francis, the vice-chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board.  <p>  <p>Atlanta's mayor, Bill Campbell, said investigators were hoping to identify the Olympic bomber from television footage of the explosion and videos taken by surveillance cameras.  <p>  <p>Police confirmed that no other devices had been found.  <p>  <p>Atlanta officials came under pressure to explain why the warning call made to an emergency operator at 1.07am failed to reach the park before the device exploded at 1.25am.  <p>  <p>The knapsack containing the bomb was coincidentally spotted by a policeman minutes before it exploded. Agents were moving people away when the blast occurred.  <p>  <p>The city's police chief, Beverley Harvard, said that an officer was dispatched to 'secure' the payphone before the warning was passed to a unit that co-ordinated responses to bomb threats.  <p>  <p>She said the warning reached the unit at about the time the bomb exploded, but insisted police could not have responded quicker because the warning was not sufficiently specific. "The caller only stated that there was a bomb in the park with no location at all, and basically said you have 30 minutes." For a second day yesterday Atlanta was hit by a wave of bomb scares and hoax calls as the Games continued.  <p>  <p>A sombre International Olympic Committee president, Juan Antonio Samaranch, said he was impressed with the efforts of security forces in the moments before the blast and satisfied that the Games security was tight. "We are very grateful to the authorities for their excellent response and for the security measures they have taken," he said.  <p>  <p>Media speculation about the identity of the bomber has focussed on America's shady network of so-called militia groups. Two members of a local rightwing group were charged in April with plotting a bombing campaign, though Olympic organisers denied that the two had planned to target the Games. Yesterday, however, a spokesman for the self-styled '112th Regiment Militia-at-Large for the Republic of Georgia' insisted that the group had no connection with the attack. "We want to say that we had nothing whatsoever to do with this and we hope that whoever did this is caught as soon as possible," J. J. Johnson said.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Bomb goes off at Olympics site, Atlanta's Centennial Park</b><br><br><br><b><h2>29 July  1996</h2></b><br><h2>Games in shadow of terror</h2><h3> The Atlanta bomb strikes at the heart of American  self-belief  </h3>  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Ian Katz</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>This time it was very different. After the World Trade Centre bombing, Americans shuddered with the  realisation that international terrorism had arrived on US soil. After Oklahoma City, they were  horrified to discover that their own country's wide open spaces harboured a threat just as chilling  and indiscriminate. But after Saturday night's bombing in Atlanta, the shock had been replaced by  dismay. Everywhere, the conversations were the same: oh no, not again.  <p>  <p>There are plenty of reasons why the Olympic attack surprised few. The attractiveness of the Games  as a terrorist target has been so widely reported that Americans might have been surprised if no one  had tried to breach the event's $50m defences. At the same time the boasts of organisers that Atlanta  would be for two weeks 'the safest place in the world', seemed almost to throw down a gauntlet to the  men of terror. On top of that Americans have terror on the brain. The Atlanta bombing came barely 10  days after TWA 800 mysteriously burst into flame and plummeted into the ocean off eastern Long Island,  and just weeks after a car bomb ripped through a US barracks in Dhahran, killing 19 American soldiers.  <p>  <p>Crash investigators are still insisting they have not established the cause of the Flight 800 disaster  but most Americans had reached their own conclusion long before the first pieces of wreckage had been  fished from the Atlantic. Any cabbie will tell you: it was a bomb; jets don't just fall out of the  sky. The readiness of Americans to accept that a US airliner might be bombed out of the sky, or, even  more strikingly, shot down by a missile less than 100 miles from New York, showed emphatically that  the penny of terrorism had finally dropped in the United States. People no longer react to news of the  latest outrage with the bemused admission that they thought such things happened only in London or  Jerusalem. Terrorism, they know all to well, is now an American problem too.  <p>  <p>In fact, however, America's terrorist problem is very different to the one faced by the Israelis or  the British. Here and in Israel, the threat comes largely from known, highly organised groups with  political agendas and rational, if irrationally pursued, objectives. It is possible, if difficult, to  wage a war against Hamas or the IRA. Informers can be planted, intelligence gathered. The same applied  to terror groups of the Seventies such as the Red Brigades in Italy and the Baader-Meinhof gang in  Germany. But the terrorist threat facing the US is at once less coherent and more difficult to combat.  It comes from without, and within, from hitherto unknown Islamic groups such as the self-styled  Movement for Islamic Change, which claimed responsibility for last November's bomb attack on an  American barracks in Riyadh, and from ingenious psychopaths like the Unabomber, willing to wage an  18-year terror campaign in the name of a screwball ideology.  <p>  <p>In the past, Americans were quick to point fingers abroad after any terror struck. The World Trade  Centre bombing taught them that there were no shortage of Islamic fanatics willing to take massive  risks to spill the blood of their imperialist nemesis.  <p>  <p>But the reaction of both officials and the public following the Atlanta bombing showed the lesson  of Oklahoma City had stuck. The FBI said it was working on the assumption that the culprits were  American. The caller who had telephoned a warning a half hour before the blast sounded like 'a white,  American male'. The explosive device had been primitive, if deadly. The chilling truth which the  Atlanta bombing may come to confirm is that the US has become a nation of amateur terrorists. Massive,  lethal bombings of the kind we are familiar with in Britain may be rare, but smaller, frequently  botched attacks have become a chilling commonplace. Just days after the TWA explosion, a pipe-bomb was  found on the runway at Chicago's O'Hare aiport. Barely a month passes without some small explosion  outside a public building in Nevada or Arizona or Washington.  <p>  <p>The number of terrorist plots thwarted by good police work or, more often, happenstance is just as  chilling. Earlier this month it was the Viper Militia, a suitably menacing-sounding crew of rightwing  fanatics which, the FBI claims, planned to mount a massive bombing campaign against government  buildings. A few weeks earlier it was Kelly Sean Spencer, discovered with four pipe-bombs after an  explosion in his Oklahoma motel room. Back in April it was two militia men near Macon, Georgia,  hoarding bomb-making equipment that may or may not have been ear-marked for the Olympics. At the same  time police routinely happen on arms caches that would equip an entire guerrilla army.  <p>  <p>Most of America's new breed of home-grown terrorists are linked to the Patriot movement, a loose  alliance of more than 800 extreme rightwing groups. The groups, as many as 400 of which characterise  themselves as militias, are bound together by their loathing for the federal government and opposition  to gun control. At the wilder shores of the movement, adherents believe that the US government is  trying to disarm ordinary Americans as part of a United Nations plot to take over the world. Some  believe merely that the US Government has overstepped its authority, that it interferes in parts of  people's lives that it was never mandated to regulate. After the botched FBI raids on Ruby Ridge and  Waco, anger and suspicion hardened into hatred and paranoia.  <p>  <p>But the FBI's list of domestic suspects will by no means be confined to members of the militia  movement. The technology of terror has become so cheap and readily available that almost any kook or  criminal can set himself up as a one-man Baader-Meinhof gang. In December 1994 an out of work computer  programmer planned to hold the New York subway hostage by threatening to detonate a series of  firebombs on it. (His plan backfired, literally, when one of the devices went off on his lap.)  <p>  <p>Even as the FBI were celebrating the capture of the man they claim is the Unabomber, New York  detectives were grimly pressing on with their hunt for another serial bomber who has terrorised the  city for more than a decade. The pipe-bomb, the type of device which was reportedly used in Saturday  night's attack, has become the weapon of choice for this new breed of amateur terrorist. Made from  household materials, the most basic of them are as easy to put together as a DIY bookcase.  <p>  <p>Almost every week there are reports of pipe-bombs being found by police. When detectives caught up  with Herberto Seda, the so-called Zodiac killer, last month, they found a cache of them. Earlier this  year one was found in the locker of a high school student in Providence, Rhode Island. They may lack  the organisation and know-how of the kind of terror groups we are more familiar with but America's  freelance terrorists may be even tougher to fight. The US has always placed great faith in technology.  Terrorism, Americans believed, could be beaten with more satellite pictures and fancier bomb sniffing  gizmos. But Atlanta had the biggest security force ever assembled on US soil and the most hi-tech  equipment. They practised for nerve gas and nuclear attacks and hijacks. They wheeled out a command  plane built for a nuclear war. But none of this, it seems, was a match for a few pieces of pipe.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Tories launch negative electioneering campaigns against Labour </b><br><br><br><b><h2>  19 July 1996</h2></b><br><h2> Blair now No 1 Tory target  </h2>
  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Michael White</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>John Major's Cabinet yesterday endorsed the switch towards a more negative advertising campaign in the run-up to the general election after admitting that the Conservatives' propaganda offensive against New Labour has seriously underestimated the scale of Tony Blair's policy revolution. Key advisers on Tory election strategy, Maurice Saatchi, Peter Gummer and Sir Tim Bell, joined forces with the party chairman, Brian Mawhinney, at yesterday's special political session to persuade the Cabinet that recent attacks - including the 'Yes, It Hurt. Yes, It Worked' poster campaign - have failed to land serious blows on Blairism.  <p>  <p>Instead of trying to persuade voters that Mr Blair has changed but his party has not - the Clause 4 win sunk that tactic, officials admit - or that he is too inexperienced to lead yet another bad Labour government - 40 per cent of voters barely remember a Labour government - the Tory machine will insist that New Labour's chosen policies are 'wrong, bad and dangerous'. The switch will be unveiled at a press conference at party HQ in Westminster today, with the expected slogan 'New Labour, New Danger', two days ahead of Mr Blair's launch of the much-hyped 'Road to the manifesto' policy statement, for which 350,000 party members will be asked to vote. The Cabinet's strategic U-turn was immediately signalled by a barrage of ministerial fire against Labour's new statement on health policy and the row which broke out in the wake of Mr Blair's own U-turn in favour of a devolution referendum - which, ironically, his party critics blame on the effectiveness of Tory propaganda, notably the 'tartan tax' campaign. The Health Secretary, Stephen Dorrell, called that "a public humiliation" for Mr Blair, proof that his ideas were "unworkable and dangerous" as well as shamelessly expedient.  <p>  <p>Labour's deputy leader, John Prescott, retaliated by calling it "John Major's 25th relaunch (which) merely confirms the disarray they are in over how to handle Tony Blair. It will flop like all the rest."  <p>  <p>Both sides are braced for a snap election in October or November, although Mr Major told the Cabinet yesterday he hopes to soldier on to the spring and the Chancellor, Kenneth Clarke, repeated his upbeat weekend message that an economic feelgood factor is coming back. But Labour remains 20 points ahead in most polls.  <p>  <p>Although Paddy Ashdown conspicuously refrained from a personal attack, other Liberal Democrats, including Sir David Steel, joined the onslaught on Mr Blair's alleged 'autocracy', fuelled by an outspoken radio attack on "timid and anaemic" New Labour policies by the backbench rebel, Paul Flynn. The row, which swamped Harriet Harman's attack on NHS red tape, is a foretaste of things to come. Tory strategists yesterday identified likely targets as constitutional reform and Europe, the single currency and the social chapter, union power and the miniumum wage, even education and crime on which Labour's rightwards policy shifts have been conspicuous. In the wake of the two and a half hour cabinet meeting senior Conservative officials tried to put a positive gloss on the implicit admission that a series of advertising campaigns have missed their intended target: the Blair leadership which has swept aside Clause 4 and other perceived symbols of past Labour weakness.  <p>  <p>As the shadow chancellor, Gordon Brown, was called in to dampen down the post-devolution row within Labour's ranks, ministers have their own problems, not least the rebellion over Defence Secretary Michael Portillo's plans to sell &#163;1.5bn of military homes to help raise money for Mr Clarke's budget.  <p>  <p>Yesterday the Foreign Secretary, Malcolm Rifkind, took the unusual step of letting it be known he supported the policy of his potential rival in a future leadership contest - at a time when a deliberate campaign of Portillo-bashing is being attributed to supporters of John Redwood. Labour, which was devastated by the cumulative impact of 'tax bombshell' attacks in 1992, has been warned off too much negative advertising. Voters want "a positive message and a change of government," Gordon Brown told Channel 4 News last night.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Michael White</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>When Tony Blair told party activists during yesterday's launch of Labour's Road to the Manifesto statement that if they "believe this is not the way forward, now is the time to say so", he sounded like an Anglican vicar asking the traditional question during the marriage service. Which is roughly where he finds himself as he embarks on a four-month campaign to woo and wed MPs, peers, the 350,000 members of the Labour Party, not forgetting those wary trade unions, and bind them in everlasting bliss to his distilled version of new Labour's priorities for government. What this is partly about is just that, locking in the activists to what Mr Blair hopes to do as prime minister, 'getting his betrayal in first' as cynics put it in tribute to the stormy Wilson-Callaghan years when charges of betrayal were leftwing coin of the realm.  <p>  <p>So the Road to the Manifesto is, in large measure, a huge education exercise, partly aimed at the watching electorate.  <p>  <p>But it also embodies a useful exercise in stripping down policy commitments, jettisoning those which might embarrass the leadership in the coming election battle, getting the 'ditching and dumping' over and done with. Hence last week's referendum row.  <p>  <p>The selling of the package started last night when Mr Blair engaged in a three-way tele-conference, fielding voters' questions in what is routinely billed as an inter-active session, itself reinforcing new Labour's aura of whitehot information technology. A party political broadcast took the message to TV viewers at home.  <p>  <p>The process will continue today when the Labour leader visits Heathrow to inspect the airport, meet the workers and then lunch in the British Airways boardroom. And by 4 o'clock he will be in Gloucester, accompanied by John Prescott, selling The Road to a mixed audience - tickets by application - and taking their questions.  <p>  <p>So it will be for Blair and his shadow allies throughout the summer months. There will be public meetings, union conferences, interviews and speeches, leading up to the party conference in Blackpool from 30 September, which is expected - emphatically - to endorse the statement.  <p>  <p>After that, in a repeat performance of the campaign to re-write Clause 4, every Labour Party member on the computerised list at party HQ in Walworth Road will be asked to vote yes or no on the document. The result will be known in late November or December.  <p>  <p>It all has the merit of keeping everyone busy and thus out of mischief. As one shadow minister said of the Clause 4 debate: "If it hadn't been for Clause 4 we'd have been facing demand for a minimum wage of &#163;12 an hour by now."  <p>  <p>Except that it is not quite like the 1994/95 Clause 4 battle. That may have been a top-down initiative too, but there were at least two sides to the argument: old Clause 4 versus its updated rival. Victory is all but assured in 1996, but this time there must be genuine fears that the turn-out will be low, either because Old Labourites quietly abstain or new supporters feel no need to endorse a foregone conclusion.  <p>  <p>Such an outcome would allow the Tories to revive claims that Blair leads an unreconstructed party. It might also vindicate complaints that the idea which Mr Blair sprung on his NEC on 27 March  - having decided how to proceed during his Christmas holidays in Australia - is all about marginalising the unions and local activists by appealing over their heads to the lay membership.  <p>  <p>In short, the smooth presentation of yesterday's statement should not obliterate entirely the fact that it remains yet another of Mr Blair's gambles on the Road to Downing Street.  <p>  <p>Blair opted for that gamble because he felt the Clause 4 exercise went well despite predictions of disaster. The tour he undertook at that time let him capitalise on his ability to be impressive on the stump.  <p>  <p>This is altogether a riskier project. In a recent after-dinner speech, Roy Jenkins likened Mr Blair's position to a man carrying a delicate Ming vase across a polished museum floor: one slip and it smashes.  <p>  <p>Yesterday, Mr Blair chose to highlight five policy priorities, all of them priorities in the public mind, according to the pollster Robert Worcester, speaking on Channel 4. If it succeeds he and his kitchen cabinet may highlight five more.  <p>  <p>But the Tory onslaught last night, though ham-fisted, signalled a determination to thwart the Labour leadership's efforts to turn its manifesto into the fiscal equivalent of an American Stealth bomber. John Major rattled off a list of implied tax increases, Kenneth Clarke took a dig at supposed errors in Labour's sums, and party chairman Brian Mawhinney came up with a sinister pair of eyes peeping from behind a 'New Labour, New Danger' poster. The ad will appear in Tory papers today. It will be much harder for the Tories to hit the target this time than in 1992 when Neil Kinnock's volatile personality and John Smith's shadow budget allowed Tory strategists to murmur 'tax and Kinnock' whenever they were asked how they were going to win against the odds.  <p>  <p>Far from having no policies, a repeated jibe, Labour has lots. Yesterday's statement is highly ambitious. If prime minister Blair fulfilled half of it a grateful electorate would be impressed.  <p>  <p>Yesterday, even allies did not get a chance to discuss the statement. There was no time for debate because the printers were waiting, potential rebels were told.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>WRITING ON THE WALL  <p>  <p>Number of times these words appear in the draft manifesto  <p>  <p>new 107  <p>  <p>change 36  <p>  <p>security/insecurity 20  <p>  <p>lead/leadership 18  <p>  <p>partner/partnership 14  <p>  <p>stake/stakeholder 8  <p>  <p>deal 8  <p>  <p>challenge 8  <p>  <p>tough 6  <p>  <p>socialism/socialist 1  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Tories launch negative electioneering campaigns against Labour </b><br><br><br><b><h2>  19 July 1996</h2></b><br><h2> Central Office "fears and smears" alarm Labour  </h2>
  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Michael White</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>A jittery Labour Party last night launched a ferocious attack on the Conservatives' election strategy in the wake of new evidence that Central Office will be spending a record &#163;10m on an American-style  negative campaign of "fears and smears".  <p>  <p>After the Conservative chairman, Dr Brian Mawhinney, launched a poster bearing the slogan "Labour's Union Jack" over a white flag with the message "New Labour.

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Terence Perkins to challenge armed forces for discharging him for being gay</b><br><br><br><b><h2>  19 July 1996</h2></b><br><h2> Court backs gay sacked by navy  </h2>
  <br><br>      <p>A former Royal Navy serviceman yesterday won permission to bring a legal challenge against a decision to discharge him from the armed forces because he is gay.  <p>  <p>Mr Justice Sedley ruled in the High Court that Terence Perkins, aged 27, of Bestwood, Nottingham, had "an arguable case" for judicial review that the Ministry of Defence blanket ban on homosexuals was contrary to the European Union's equal treatment directive.  <p>  <p>Peter Duffy, appearing for Mr Perkins, said the "inflexible policy" offended against the right of gays to "dignity and freedom" in employment. The case is likely to be referred to the European Court of Justice. The House of Lords recently upheld the ministry's right to enforce the ban. Outside court, Stephen Grosz, solicitor for Mr Perkins, said the case raised the issue of whether the directive applied to homosexuals.  <p>  <p>Mr Perkins, who joined the navy in 1991, revealed he was homosexual in August 1995. The navy's Special Investigations Branch told him homosexuality was 'inconsistent with service in the armed forces' and he was sacked. Earlier this year, the Lords refused to hear an appeal by four other sacked homosexual service personnel against a Court of Appeal ruling that the ban was not unlawful.  <p>  <p>Yesterday Mr Duffy told the High Court that his client was relying on a recent European Court of Justice ruling in the case of 'P' giving transsexuals protection from discrimination under the directive. 'P' was dismissed from an educational establishment by Cornwall county council after deciding to have a sex change operation. The European Court ruled this amounted to unlawful discrimination.  <p>  <p>Mr Duffy argued that the ruling extended to banning all discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation.  Richard MacManus, for the Government, argued that homosexuals did not come within the scope of the ruling.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Shearer becomes world's most expensive footballer as Newcastle pay 15m </b><br><br><br><b><h2>  19 July 1996</h2></b><br><h2>  What's loyalty got to do with it?</h2>
<h3>Alan Shearer's coming home - for a neat 25,000 a week</h3>  <br><b>Leading article</b><br><br>      <p>First reactions from the man in the brand new black-and-white No 9 shirt suggest that Alan Shearer  has left Blackburn Rovers in order to 'return home' to the city of his birth. 'Shearer's Coming Home'  certainly makes a folksy angle on the record transfer deal, as well as pandering to the deep well of  Tyneside sentimental self-regard. But you don't have to be a bereft Rovers supporter to suspect that  nothing weighed so heavily with our top goalscorer as the expected &#163;25,000 a week that Sir John  Hall was willing to pay him to come to Newcastle United.  <p>  <p>Top footballers may once have been local loyalists, but these days they are guns for hire, anywhere  in Europe. Shearer may claim undying Tyneside roots but a subversive rumour claims that he was in fact  a Sunderland fan as a boy. And if the &#163;15m man thinks that when he reports to St James's  Park he will find lots of canny lads in the dressing-room discussing whippets and shipbuilding, he is  likely to be very disappointed. At the last count, the Newcastle team contained more players from  continental Europe than from what Arthur Hopcraft dubbed England's cauldron of football.  <p>  <p>If Shearer really hankers after one of the few remaining English league teams with an almost  entirely homegrown squad, he should be heading for the nearby home of Hartlepool United. The Pool's  first team last season came from no further afield than Stockton, Gateshead, Sunderland,  Middlesbrough, Horden, Wallsend, South Shields, Newcastle - and of course Hartlepool itself. The  town's MP may be a moderniser, but at the Victoria Ground traditional values reign. If Shearer chose  the Pool he would not be coming home; he would never have left. And he'd still be only half an  hour from the Metro Centre.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Shearer becomes world's most expensive footballer as Newcastle pays &#163;15m </b><br><br><br><b><h2>  19 July 1996</h2></b><br><h2> Shearer opens door to Kluivert</h2><h3>Europe's hottest property takes goals to Newcastle  </h2>
  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Michael Walker</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>Manchester United and Blackburn Rovers are to seek consolation for Alan Shearer's &#163;15m transfer to the north-east by moving for the  brilliant Ajax striker Patrick Kluivert.  <p>  <p>With United unable to rely on Andy Cole for consistent goalscoring and Blackburn needing to convince a distraught public to invest in their season tickets, the abundantly gifted Kluivert would fit the bill for both. Milan are believed to have an option on the 20-year-old Dutch international, who will be out of contract next summer. But as he could then move for nothing it would make sound business sense for Ajax to reap what could be a &#163;12m windfall by selling Kluivert during the coming season.  <p>  <p>Immediately after Holland's dismissal from the European Championship, Kluivert said publicly that he would welcome the chance to join the wave of continental talent threatening to engulf the Premiership. Asked about which clubs he might consider joining, he mentioned only three: Manchester United, Newcastle and Liverpool.  <p>  <p>Yesterday morning's news that Shearer was leaving Ewood Park for Newcastle had more than a whiff of inevitability about it. Ever since the 22nd minute of England's first Euro 96 game against Switzerland when he broke his near two-year international scoring drought, Shearer has been the hottest property in European football.  <p>  <p>He went on to become the top scorer in the tournament and in many eyes its outstanding performer. It seemed anomalous to the public that he would descend from that platform and return to a side who had not even qualified for Europe. The surprise was that Shearer should choose Newcastle ahead of Manchester United for his world-record move.  <p>  <p>Since Euro 96 it was the Old Trafford club who had publicly and privately courted the England centre-forward, a chase that included a bid of about &#163;12m. However, the inquiries brought increasingly angry denials from Rovers and in the end they may have been happier selling Shearer to Newcastle rather than to their north-west rivals.  <p>  <p>Certainly that was the impression the Manchester United chairman Martin Edwards received. "There was no way that Blackburn would let him come here," Edwards said, "and they made that clear by rejecting our offer. The player also made it clear the club would not allow him to join us." Yesterday Shearer said that he was "particularly impressed" by Alex Ferguson as a manager but explained his preference for Newcastle as "the challenge of returning home and wearing the famous black and white". The deal had been done over the weekend after Shearer had talked with Jack Walker, Blackburn's financial backer, and Kevin Keegan, the Newcastle manager. Walker had been unable to persuade Shearer to remain at Ewood even though, in Shearer's words, "Jack battled harder than anyone could imagine."  <p>  <p>Robert Coar, Blackburn's chairman, found small consolation in the fact that the club had "fought tooth and nail" to keep Shearer, whose departure came 12 months after he signed a four-year contract. Crucially there was a verbal agreement that, should a tempting offer come along, then Shearer would be free to consider it.  <p>  <p>Speaking at his Bangkok hotel on Newcastle's tour of the Far East, Keegan appeared as ecstatic as any member of the Toon Army. "It just shows you the ambition of Newcastle United," he said. "We are the biggest-thinking team in Europe now. We're not the biggest, most successful team yet, but we have tremendous support from above which allows me to buy players. I like buying players.  <p>  <p>"Today he will have a medical, that's the first thing. The fee is agreed but obviously it's subject to a medical. Alan Shearer will not be joining us on this tour."  <p>  <p>Keegan had learned of the news before his departure from Heathrow airport on Friday night. As he prepared to board the plane for Thailand, a call on his mobile phone informed him that Walker had agreed to let Shearer 'return' to his home-town club.  <p>  <p>Just what number shirt the new acquisition will wear immediately became the most interesting item on the agenda for Newcastle fans. The present holder of the No 9 jersey, Les Ferdinand, must be worrying about his future, though Keegan is said to have always intended playing Ferdinand alongside Shearer. If Shearer does not join the club's tour, then his first appearance in black and white may come against Manchester United in the Charity Shield at Wembley on 11 August. Two days later Shearer will be 26.<p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Flight TWA 800 blown up </b><br><br><br><b><h2>19 July 1996</h2></b><br><h2>TWA criticised over delay in releasing victims' names </h2>
<h3>Sixteen high-school friends were  among those who died</h3>  <br><br>      <p>Details of the 230 passengers and crew who died in the TWA crash began to emerge last night, with  at least 16 of the victims coming from a Pennsylvania high school.  <p>  <p>Among the few victims named were a Briton, Christine Baily, aged 46, and an Irish emigrant, Vera  Feeney, from Kilmore, Co Roscommon, and her daughter Deirdre, aged 17.  <p>  <p>The wife of jazz saxophonist Wayne Shorter, Anna Maria Shorter, and the daughter of jazz singer Jon  Lucien, Dalila Lucien, were also on the flight. Neither a complete passenger list nor even a breakdown  of nationalities were issued by TWA yesterday, and the airline came under sharp criticism for its  handling of the disaster.  <p>  <p>Sixteen of the passengers belonged to the French club of Montoursville High School in north-eastern  Pennsylvania, on their way to Europe to improve their language skills. Forty French nationals are  known to have been on board.  <p>  <p>Late last night eight Italians victims of the crash were named, and another three people with  Italian names were expected to be named.  <p>  <p>The names of the flight's four cockpit crew and 14 flight attendants were also released. Captain  Steve Snyder of Connecticut, Captain Ralph Kevorkian of California, and flight engineer Richard  Campbell of Connecticut had all been with TWA for more than 30 years.  <p>  <p>New York's mayor, Rudolph Giuliani, criticised TWA's senior managers for leaving families in the  dark, saying it had fallen to him, working overnight Wednesday from an incomplete list, to confirm or  relieve people's fears. "It is the lack of upper management that is distressing," said Mr Giuliani,  who knew at least one person aboard TWA 800. "What happened is outrageous. All night upper-level  management was missing."  <p>  <p>A TWA spokesman, John McDonald, told the CBS news network by telephone from the company's  headquarters in St Louis the airline had begun notifying victims' families, but admitted to a delay.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Flight TWA 800 blown up </b><br><br><br><b><h2>19 July 1996</h2></b><br><h2>The loss of Flight 800 - Suspicions centre on Middle East groups</h3>  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Ian Black</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>If TWA 800 turns out to have been the target of a terrorist bomb like Pan Am 103 downed over  Lockerbie in 1988 - fundamentalist Middle Eastern groups are likely to be the main suspects.  <p>  <p>Palestinian, Lebanese and Iranian organisations have all been involved in anti-American attacks in  the past two decades; but those in the past five years have been carried out by radical Islamist  groups with a Saudi Arabian link, such as those behind the bombing of a US base in Dhahran earlier  this month.  <p>  <p>Security experts look for capability and motive in suspects, though US and British officials were  unwilling to speculate yesterday - not least because many wrongly linked Islamic groups with last  year's Oklahoma City bombing. But examining motive produces a wide range of suspects. Radical  fundamentalists oppose the US both because of its backing for conservative Arab regimes in the Gulf  and its traditional support for Israel. Progress in the Middle East peace process - halted by the  rightwing victory in the Israeli elections - makes no difference to die-hard groups such as the  Palestinian Islamic Jihad, Hamas and the Lebanese Hizbullah. Middle Eastern terrorists are not likely  to be directly supported by states. Ten years ago regimes like Iraq, Libya and Syria backed groups for  their own ends. Libya remains the main suspect behind the Lockerbie bombing - though the Popular Front  for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command is still in the frame - and like Iraq is isolated and  weak. Syria has cleaned up its act.  <p>  <p>The US blames Iran for supporting terrorism and there is evidence that Tehran - or at least  elements in the regime - has links to groups like the Organisation of Islamic Revolution of the  Arabian Peninsula. But no one has identified direct Iranian state attacks on US targets.  <p>  <p>Today's Middle Eastern men of violence tend to be radical Muslim veterans of the anti-Soviet war in  Afghanistan, financed - ironically - by the CIA, Saudi Arabia and Britain.  <p>  <p>In the US, attention was also focusing yesterday on the circle around the Muslim cleric, Sheikh  Omar Abdel-Rahman, now serving a life sentence for leading a conspiracy which culminated in the 1993  bombing of the World Trade Centre in New York.  <p>  <p>Another key figure is the mysterious Pakistani, Ramzi Ahmed Yousef, once described as the 'evil  genius' behind the World Trade Centre bombing, which killed six people and injured 1,000. Mr Yousef  and two associates are on trial in New York for plotting to blow up 11 American airliners over the  Pacific.  <p>  <p>Capability is a harder question. The expertise to bomb an aircraft is not believed to be widely  available and the few known practitioners, like Yousef, are already in custody. One Iraqi bombmaker  who worked for the small but deadly Palestinian Abu Ibrahim group defected to the US in the 1980s and  lives under a new identity there.  <p>  <p>Two other cases are also likely to be under examination. The US provoked threats of retaliation in  May when a federal judge ordered the extradition of the Palestinian Hamas leader, Mousa Abu Marzook,  to Israel to face murder charges for allegedly planning a series of bombings. Meanwhile in a  Washington court a Palestinian, Omar Mohammed Ali Rezaq, is on trial for his part in the 1985  hijacking of an Egypt Air flight.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Flight TWA 800 blown up </b><br><br><br><b><h2>19 July 1996</h2></b><br><h2>The loss of Flight 800 -  US crash investigators resist bomb speculation</h2><h3>The TWA tragedy raises many questions  about security on flights</h3>  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>David Fairhall</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>Experts working to discover what brought down TWA Flight 800 are resisting speculation that might  distort their investigation.  <p>  <p>James Hall, chairman of the United States National Transportation Safety Board, said yesterday it  was vital that they "follow the facts". But their search is based - like all the speculation - on a  process of seeking answers to a series of questions:  <p>  <p>Why should a Boeing 747 jumbo jet explode shortly after take-off - something that has never  happened?  <p>  <p>There are two main possibilities: a mechanical failure leading to fire and an explosion - or  sabotage in the form of a terrorist bomb.  <p>  <p>What sort of mechanical failure might be involved?  <p>  <p>Aircraft engines do sometimes catch fire and/or explode, particularly at the high-power settings  used for take-off and the initial climb. When mounted on the wings - as in the Boeing 747 - this could  rupture and ignite the main kerosene fuel tanks within, leading to the sort of 'fireball' reported by  witnesses to the latest crash.  <p>  <p>There have also been incidents involving 747s in which an engine fell off. The most serious  occurred four years ago involving an El Al cargo plane which subsequently crashed in Amsterdam.  <p>  <p>Why was the flight's take-off delayed for an hour on Wednesday evening? An early unconfirmed report  suggested ground crews replaced an engine pressure-ratio gauge which indicates the power setting - the  equivalent of a sports car's rev counter.  <p>  <p>In theory, this should have no effect on the plane's performance, but there could have been some  serious side-effect. TWA said the flight was delayed to identify an unclaimed item of baggage and  remove a broken-down motorised baggage loader.  <p>  <p>Is the fact that this was an old aircraft significant?  <p>  <p>In general, airliners become safer as they settle down into service. Crews become familiar with the  equipment and mechanical bugs are ironed out. The Boeing jumbo has an exceptional safety record.  However, this particular plane was one of the first 747s to enter service, an aircraft which first  flew 25 years ago. At such an age, problems do sometimes surface. Did the pilot send out any distress  call?  <p>  <p>Apparently not, despite early reports that the coastguard heard something. This is a strong reason  for suspecting there was a bomb on board. What other indications are there?  <p>  <p>The intense fireball reported by witnesses, again suggesting a bomb explosion. However, one witness  said the plane spiralled down before exploding, which ties in with the possibility of mechanical  failure. Will the answer be found?  <p>  <p>Almost certainly. US Navy divers were confident last night that they would be able to recover at  least one of the 'black boxes' - a cockpit voice recorder and a flight data recorder - which, if  undamaged, would give an account of any aircraft failure. Bodies, seats and baggage will be examined  for metal fragments and traces of explosive.  <p>  <p>If it was a bomb, how did it get on board?  <p>  <p>Most likely in baggage which was checked in - perhaps at another airport - so as to avoid human  scrutiny and evade explosives-sniffing sensors. The device could be triggered by a barometric device  (the plane had reached 13,000ft) or by a timer.  <p>  <p>If so, can anything be done to prevent such outrages?  <p>  <p>Yes, but at a cost in disruption and, ultimately, higher fares. 'Soft' airports have to be  hardened, as Athens - an earlier departure point for this aircraft - is supposed to have been.  <p>  <p>British defence scientists at Farnborough, meanwhile, have developed a system of protective blast  screens and reinforcement which they believe would contain a baggage-hold blast of the kind that  destroyed the Pan Am 747 over Lockerbie in 1988.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>
