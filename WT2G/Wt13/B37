<H2>3.  SOCIAL ISSUES</H2>
<P>Short-rotation plantations are sometimes said to promote social benefits in
regions where they are located (<A HREF="eucaly6.html#beattie75">Beattie 1975</A>).
 These direct and indirect social benefits include (1)  the creation of jobs,
(2) income growth, (3) flood control, (4) erosion control, (5)  watershed
protection and water quality, (6) creation of recreational and leisure
activities, and (7) soil improvement.  Under certain circumstances, forest
plantations are considered to be better investments than other agricultural
activities because of their low social costs  (<A HREF="eucaly6.html#capp76">Capp
Filho 1976</A>).  On the other hand, the costs that short-rotation forest
plantations are claimed to have are (1) loss of water through
evapotranspiration, (2) soil nutrient depletion; (3) sedimentation of rivers and
streams; (4) hazardous logging activities leading to high accident rates for
employees; and (5) damage to the road system  (<A HREF="eucaly6.html#worrel59">Worrel
1959</A>).  Obviously, this subject is very controversial.
</P>
<P>	The jobs and taxes generated and the salaries paid are some of the most
easily measured benefits of the eucalypt plantations.  These economic indicators
have been used in most of the economic and social evaluation studies of the
eucalypt plantations in Brazil (<A HREF="eucaly6.html#neves79">Neves 1979</A>).
 An excellent example of a forest company in Brazil from which to get an idea of
social and economic impact is Aracruz Celulose S.A., the largest eucalypt pulp
producer in the world (2 million tons per year).  In 1992 alone, Aracruz paid
US$18 million in taxes to the state of Esp&iacute;rito Santo (where its mill is
located); spent US$15 million in social investments; allocated US$14.7 million
to its forest farmer program; spent US$12.5 million in its forest extension
programs; invested US$600 thousand in research projects; paid US$30 million in
salaries; and bought US$50 million of goods from suppliers located in the state.
 In 1992 alone, the company injected US$120.8 million into the economy of the
state of Esp&iacute;rito Santo (<A HREF="eucaly6.html#soresini93">Soresini 1993</A>).</P>
<P>	These economic and social benefits make the forestry sector in Brazil one
of the best alternatives for development and for contributing to the economic
and social welfare of its increasing population  (<A
HREF="eucaly6.html#siqueira90">Siqueira 1990</A>).  Forestry activities offer
job opportunities even in remote areas of the country.  On average, each hectare
of eucalypt plantation generates four directly related jobs, an indication of
the economic and social importance of these plantations, which is expected to
increase in the coming years.  Today, it contributes US$18.8 billion or 3.9% to
Brazil's Gross Domestic Product (<A HREF="eucaly6.html#soresini93">Soresini
1993</A>).</P>
<P>	In recent years, another positive social contribution of the forest
plantations has been in disposal and recycling of residues such as urban waste
and organic material.  The risks of applying these residues to forest
plantations are lower than those presented by their application to agricultural
areas (<A HREF="eucaly6.html#rizzi93">Rizzi 1993</A>).  The capacity of forest
areas to renew and produce good quality water has been proven.  However, several
factors have to be considered with respect to disposal/recycling in these
systems, such as the capacity of the area to take a certain amount of
wastewater, the growth of the species, impacts on fauna and flora, and
contamination of streams and groundwater.</P>
<H3><A NAME="policy"> 4.  POLICY AND LEGISLATION</A> 	</H3>
<P>Forestry development requires the establishment of very clear and
well-defined regulatory legislation and enforcement.  Despite the existence of a
significant forest industry, it was not until the mid-20th century that
Brazilians began to establish a well-defined forest policy  (<A
HREF="eucaly6.html#swiolko90">Swiolko 1990</A>).  The following summarizes the
development of forest policies in Brazil.</P>
<P>	Forestry activities were established in Brazil soon after it was discovered
by the Portuguese in 1500.  These activities were focused on the harvesting of
Brazil-wood (<I>Cesalpinia echinata</I>), which was one of the main economic
activities at that time.   However, with the development of agriculture and the
cattle industry, forestry activities assumed a less important role in the
Brazilian economy.  This situation existed until the 1960s, when the forestry
sector started to receive more attention from government.</P>
<P>	Since the colonization period by Portugal, laws existed to protect the
native forests, which were considered the property of the crown.  Despite these
laws, the forest along the Atlantic coast was practically destroyed by logging
to provide timber and firewood or by clear-cutting to provide land for
agriculture.  In 1799, laws were passed to regulate the harvesting of trees, and
severe penalties were given to violators.  At that time, individuals guilty of
setting forest fires deliberately were sentenced to death.  Even with these
severe penalties, deforestation of the Atlantic forest continued, so Prince Dom
Jo&atilde;o IV enforced a new law requiring private land owners to preserve the
forests located within a certain distance from the Atlantic Coast and along the
margins of certain rivers.</P>
<P>	The first legislation for reforestation of the Atlantic Coast forest was
introduced in 1802, and in 1813 it became illegal to cut Brazil-wood.  In 1825,
the prohibition of cutting Brazil-wood was extended to other species but the
illegal cutting of Brazil-wood, a mainstay of the Brazilian economy, continued. 
In 1829, cutting and burning on government forest lands had to be approved by a
municipal government council.  However, in 1831 things changed completely; all
the laws concerning the harvesting and burning of the trees and the monopoly of
the crown on the Brazil-wood and other species were removed.  The rate of
deforestation grew considerably, and fire was used indiscriminately to clear
areas for agricultural use (<A HREF="eucaly6.html#swiolko90">Swiolko 1990</A>).
 The colonial system basically was out of touch with the local social and
economic situation.</P>
<P>	The first Brazilian Forestry Code was passed in 1934 by decree 23793. 
However, it was not enforced for about three decades at which time deforestation
was occurring at an incredible rate (<A HREF="eucaly6.html#sbs87">SBS 1987</A>).
 The 1960s was a time of key changes in forestry in Brazil because of (1) a new
Brazilian Forestry Code, (2) the fiscal incentives for reforestation, (3)
legislation for wildlife protection, and (4) the creation of the Brazilian
Institute for Forestry Development (IBDF).  The main objectives of the code were
(1) forest preservation, (2) proper management and harvesting of the native
forests, (3) replacement of forests used by industries, and the (4)
establishment of national forests devoted to multiple use (<A
HREF="eucaly6.html#ribas90">Ribas 1990</A>).</P>
<P>	The 1965 version of the Brazilian Forestry Code allowed for development of
fiscal incentives for the establishment of human-made forests.  This code was
the key to the growth of the Brazilian forest sector.  In 1966 the federal
government passed Law 5106/66 that allowed individuals and companies to use 50%
of their income tax payment for reforestation (<A HREF="eucaly6.html#suchek91">Suchek
1991</A>).  As a consequence of this law, the area of planted forest in Brazil
soared from 470 thousand hectares (before the fiscal incentives) to 6.2 million
hectares in 1992.  The greatest breakthrough at that time, and perhaps the most
influential factor in the establishment of a very intensive and advanced
eucalypt silviculture in Brazil, was that the use of eucalypt wood for pulp and
paper production proved feasible (<A HREF="eucaly6.html#soresini93">Soresini
1993</A>).  The country became the world's leader in eucalypt plantation
establishment.  However, along with all benefits accrued from these plantations,
criticism also arose, mainly from individuals and organizations concerned with
possible harmful effects the plantations might have on the environment and on
the social welfare of rural communities.</P>
<P>	Initially, the Brazilian Forestry Code provided three types of fiscal
incentives for preserving native forests and establishing planted forests: (1)
privately owned planted or natural forest would not be taxed, (2) income
originating from natural forests or plantations would not be taxed, and (3)
funds used for afforestation or reforestation would  be deductible from the
income tax of individuals and companies.  In 1966, Law 5106/66 established the
rules for tax incentives for reforestation, setting a 50% limit for deducting
these expenses from total income.  One problem with Law 5106/66 was that the
taxpayer had to incur expenses prior to asking for the deduction.</P>
<P>	Law 1134/70, which was passed in 1970, provided that companies could apply
up to 50% of their income tax to new forest investments in projects previously
approved by IBDF.  Thus, for a period of time both 5106/66 and 1134/70 provided
fiscal incentives for reforestation in Brazil.  Law 1134/74 resulted in a boom
in the forest sector of the country, and several companies specializing in
reforestation emerged.  However, some problems arose because of this law. 
Companies would receive a percentage of their taxes back but would not track the
reforestation projects.  This situation prevailed until 1974 when a new law,
1376/74, was passed in an attempt to correct this distortion.  Law 1376/74
created the Fiscal Incentives Fund to which companies submitted funds rather
than to a specific reforestation project of a particular forest company.  In
1983, Law 88207/83 was passed, which established new regulations for fiscal
incentives.  These new regulations required the companies to anticipate the
amount of money to be invested 6 months in advance when asking for rebate on
their taxes.  The reaction of forest companies was very negative.  The Brazilian
Association of Forest Companies claimed that the new legislation would bankrupt
the emerging forest sector and cause unemployment.</P>
<P>	In 1986 new legislation made additional changes in the fiscal incentives
rules for reforestation, leading once again to a strong negative reaction by the
forest companies.  In 1987, Law 1297/87 limited tax-deduction application in
reforestation to 10% and confined it to only certain areas in the states of
Minas Gerais and Esp&iacute;rito Santo.  Finally, in 1988 the fiscal incentives
for reforestation were discontinued by Law 7714/88, closing a very important
chapter of the development of the forestry sector in Brazil.  In 1989 IBDF was
dissolved by the government, and in its place the Brazilian Institute of
Environment and Natural Resources (IBAMA) was created.</P>
<P>	The recent Federal Constitution gives new treatment to forest legislation. 
Today, not only the federal but also the state and the municipal district can
pass legislation dealing with forestry.  Thus, preservation of forests, fauna,
and flora have become a common responsibility of the federal, state, and
municipal governments (<A HREF="eucaly6.html#swiolko90">Swiolko 1990</A>).</P>
<P>	For example, in the state of S&atilde;o Paulo companies are prohibited from
using fire in any phase of establishment of plantations.   In some counties of
the state of Esp&iacute;rito Santo, the companies are not allowed to plant <I>Eucalyptus</I>
in land not previously occupied by that genus.  In fact, in the state of Esp&iacute;rito
Santo, the forest companies are not allowed to buy land to establish eucalypt
plantations.  They can operate only on land that they already own and can only
improve the productivity of their plantations or engage in tree farmer programs
to increase the supply of wood for their mills.</P>
<P>	Despite the fact that the Brazilian forest policy was based on fiscal
incentives for establishing short-rotation monoculture plantations of exotic
species, native forests still contribute substantially to the forest production
of the country.  In northern Brazil, native forests contribute 99.8% of the
total harvest, whereas in the southeastern region, short-rotation plantations
contribute 82.6% of the total.  In other words, the northern states specialize
in producing lumber from native forests, and the southeastern region specializes
in producing other wood products from short-rotation plantations (<A
HREF="eucaly6.html#ribas90">Ribas 1990</A>).</P>
<P>	The current pressures exerted by the international community on countries
with large areas of forest such as Brazil are leading to new actions.  For
example, organizations such as the World Bank and the Inter-American Development
Bank are linking loans to an  obligation by countries to consider the
environmental aspects of projects for which they are seeking funds.  Some
European countries are refusing to import forest products from tropical
countries if the products originated from unmanaged forests or from forest
companies that do not comply with their specifications regarding environmental
conduct (<A HREF="eucaly6.html#siqueira90">Siqueira 1990</A>).</P>
<P>	When eucalypt plantations displace any existing ecosystem, the relative
importance (both ecological and social) of the existing ecosystems should be
carefully balanced against the advantages to be gained (<A
HREF="eucaly6.html#palmberg86">Palmberg 1986</A>).  Decisions about whether or
not such replacement is justified can only properly be decided by considering a
comprehensive national policy for the conservation of nature and genetic
material (<A HREF="eucaly6.html#poore85">Poore and Fries 1985</A>).  This is a
continuous process and is evolving as Brazil's social and economic structure
changes.</P>
<H3><A NAME="forest">5.  FOREST EDUCATION AND RESEARCH
</A></H3>
<P>As previously mentioned, forestry education in Brazil began in 1960, when
the National School of Forestry was founded in Vi&ccedil;osa, Minas Gerais, by
the federal government under the auspices of the FAO.  In 1964, the National
School of Forestry was transferred to Curitiba, Paran&aacute;, and a new school
was founded by the state government in Vi&ccedil;osa.  Fourteen years later a
graduate program was initiated at that school, which is now called the
Department of Forestry of the Federal University of Vi&ccedil;osa (<A
HREF="eucaly6.html#reis93">Reis and Reis 1993</A>).  Today, approximately 15
schools of forestry are spread across Brazil in cities such as Manaus and Bel&eacute;m
in the north; Patos and Recife in the northeast; Bras&iacute;lia and Cuiab&aacute;
in centralwest; Vi&ccedil;osa, Rio de Janeiro, Lavras, Piracicaba, and Botucatu
in the southeast; and Curitiba and Santa Maria in the south.</P>
<P>	Among these, the school located in Vi&ccedil;osa, Minas Gerais, has the
strongest program oriented toward eucalypt plantation and utilization.  This
emphasis derives from the fact that Minas Gerais has the largest area of
short-rotation eucalypt plantations in Brazil.  The school located in
Piracicaba, S&atilde;o Paulo, also has a very strong eucalypt-oriented forestry
program.  Because most of the forest industries that use eucalypt wood as raw
material are located in the southeastern region of the country, it is only
logical that strong eucalypt-oriented programs be located there.</P>
<P>	It is important to emphasize that the country's first forestry school at Vi&ccedil;osa
was established just 34 years ago, and the first graduate program in forestry
was offered there only 20 years ago.  Thus, during the large-scale plantation
development educational and scientific programs concerning the silvicultural and
ecological aspects of the eucalypt plantations were not in existence (<A
HREF="eucaly6.html#reis93">Reis and Reis 1993</A>).  The programs that were
available were devoted to enhancing timber production alone and paid little or
no attention to the impacts of the newly established plantations on the
environment.  This lack of a sound scientific information base coupled with (1)
the misuse by some individuals and forest companies of the resources derived
from fiscal incentives; (2) the failure of some eucalypt plantations, along with
(3) the &quot;exotic&quot; characteristic of <I>Eucalyptus</I> in Brazil, set
the framework for the current anti-eucalypts campaign in the country.  It is
interesting that the establishment of exotic agricultural crops such as
soybeans, coffee, sugar-cane, and others has not been subjected to the same
degree of criticism.</P>
<P>	In 1967, the University of S&atilde;o Paulo and some forest companies
signed an agreement creating the Institute for Forest Research (IPEF).  Because
most of the companies associated with this institute used eucalypt wood as raw
material, they exerted a strong influence on the research program as well as on
the graduate and undergraduate forestry programs at IBEF.  A similar situation
occurred in 1974 when the Federal University of Vi&ccedil;osa signed an
agreement with several forest companies in Minas Gerais and Esp&iacute;rito
Santo creating the Society for Forest Research (SIF).  All of these companies
used eucalypt either for charcoal or pulp production.  Their influence on the
research program and on the graduate and undergraduate forestry programs of the
Federal University of Vi&ccedil;osa was considerable.  Other universities and
state research institutions conduct studies concerning eucalypts on a smaller
scale but mostly focus on pine plantations and local native forests and species.</P>
<P>	During the 1970s and 1980s, most universities course and research programs
focused on silviculture, forest management, tree breeding and improvement,
fertilization, forest protection, and wood technology (charcoal, pulp and paper,
particle boards, and essential oils).  In the late 1980s and into the 1990s, the
focus changed to sustainable development.  Thus, subjects such as forest
planning, agroforestry, harvesting mechanization, nutrient cycling, genetic
improvement (e.g., clones and hybrids), biological control of pests and
diseases, forest legislation and policy, environmental and social impacts of
forest plantations, soil conservation, watershed management, biodiversity
conservation, and urban forestry have become very important.  Both the graduate
and undergraduate programs of the schools of forestry in most of the Brazilian
universities have been modified to fit the current needs of the private sector
and government institutions as well as society as a whole.  About 4600 foresters
have graduated since 1965 from the 15 universities in Brazil.  Of these
graduates, 60% are working in the private sector (<A
HREF="eucaly6.html#sequeira90">Sequeira 1990</A>).</P>
<P>	Despite the considerable number of institutions, universities, companies,
and organizations devoted to forest research in Brazil, a lack of coordination
among them is apparent, resulting in inefficiency and dispersion of funds,
labor, and equipment (<A HREF="eucaly6.html#sequeira90">Sequeira 1990</A>). 
Forest research in Brazil has always tried to solve immediate problems or attend
to the most urgent needs of forest companies and other forest organizations.  As
a result, from 1971 to 1977 research concentrated mostly on the production of
wood for industrial uses (charcoal, pulp and paper, particle board).  Since 1978
energy problems and greater environmental concerns have forced research and
education to concentrate more on forests as a renewable energy source, the
environmental impact of plantations, and new markets for the wood.

<H2>6.  LESSONS LEARNED</H2>
<H3>6.1  FISCAL INCENTIVES</H3>
<P>As already mentioned, fiscal incentives for reforestation in Brazil were
very important in the development of the pulp and paper and the charcoal-based
pig-iron and steel industries in the country.  However, the fiscal incentives
program was not perfect.  As soon as the law was approved by the government,
there was a race to develop private companies that would prepare technical
projects to be submitted to IBDF.  These companies convinced prospective
investors to invest money in reforestation projects.   Many of the investors
never received money back on their investments, and in some cases, companies
would return only a certain percentage of the total investment, normally
immediately after the contracts were signed.  Consequently, most of the
investors thought that they had received their share and did not track the
reforestation activities of the companies, which made significant profits at the
expense of the investors.</P>
<P>	Because of the low price of the marginal lands (mainly in the savanna-like
regions in centralwestern and southeastern Brazil), many of the companies bought
large tracts of land without really intending to carry out the reforestation
projects submitted to IBDF.  Unfortunately, IBDF never had the necessary
financial support to inspect the proposed reforestation projects, many of which
were established in remote areas, making the possibility of utilization equally
remote.</P>
<P>	The most successful projects were those linked to the pulp and paper,
cement, pig-iron and steel, and composite board industries.  These projects had
a direct link between timber production and its immediate use as a raw material.
 Thus, the first and perhaps most important lesson learned by the government was
to require that any project be linked to an existing (or planned) industry that
ultimately would use the resources.  Further, a fully funded government
organization must oversee the reforestation activities and the existing
educational and research institutional system.</P>
<P></P>
<H3>6.2  LAND ACQUISITION</H3>
<P>The failure of several reforestation projects in Brazil was a result of land
acquisition practices.  In the beginning, most of the companies wanted large
tracts of land at the lowest possible price.  Thus, they did not pay attention
to important details such as distance from consumer centers, availability of
water and energy, chemical and physical properties of the soil, or the existing
vegetation.  Consequently, several plantations were abandoned (such those in
Mato Grosso do Sul) because they were too far way from any prospective user. 
Others did not become well established because of unsuitable hydrology or
geology.  In some cases, endangered ecosystems, such as the Atlantic forest or
other native forest ecosystem (e.g, savanna, Araucaria forest, and Amazonian
forest), were simply cut and burned to establish a technically sound
reforestation project.</P>
<P>	The price of land in the more industrialized regions of the country has
risen considerably over the last 10 years, and it has been practically
impossible for the companies to buy land or to expand their plantations in areas
near their mills.  Most of the new plantations are being established in areas
recently cut and previously occupied by old plantations.  Emphasis is now on
increasing the productivity of the existing plantations through genetic
improvement and careful management of the soil.  The remaining native ecosystems
are preserved and play a very important role in the biological balance of the
area.  Companies prefer degraded land (such as abandoned crop and pasture lands)
to land having native vegetation cover.  Flat or gently rolling areas are also
preferred to steeper areas, which are more susceptible to soil erosion. 
Designating appropriate land for plantation establishment is a key component of
any plantation establishment program.</P>
<P></P>
<H3>6.3  TREE SPECIES AND PROVENANCES</H3>
<P>At the beginning of the incentive-based reforestation program, no ecological
zoning existed nor were any comprehensive scientific data available to help the
companies to choose the best species for each region and site.  Based on some
early research in S&atilde;o Paulo, most of the companies used <I>Eucalyptus
grandis</I> and <I>E. saligna</I> in their reforestation programs throughout
Brazil, including savanna-like regions, which have a very low level of
precipitation and a 5- to 7-month dry season.  These species have a very high
growth rate but are not adaptable to such regions.  As a result, major failures
occurred in the initial reforestation programs in these regions and some have
very low productivity even now.  </P>
<P>	In the early years, seeds from eucalypt species that were suitable for many
regions of Brazil were difficult to obtain.  Some companies used seeds collected
from plantations and experimental plots.  This practice led to the establishment
of very heterogeneous stands because of the very high degree of hybridization of
the existing eucalypt species.  Subsequently, companies learned that ecological
zoning (done by Golfari in the late 1970s) was essential to match not only
species but provenances to each region of the country.  Further, genetically
improved seeds had to be imported from other countries (Australia, New Zealand,
Timor Islands, South Africa, Zimbabwe, and Rhodesia) to be used not only for the
plantations but also to establish local tree orchards for future seed
production.  These procedures have paid off, and today, Brazil exports
genetically improved seeds of both eucalypt and tropical and subtropical pines.</P>
<P>	Cloning was the next logical step as the companies tried to achieve
homogeneous stands with a very high productivity, natural resistance to pests
and diseases, and uniform raw material for their production processes.  Today,
controlled hybridization, cloning, and micropropagation are leading the country
to a very advanced position in eucalypt plantation technology.</P>
<P></P>
<H3>6.4  PESTS AND DISEASES</H3>
<P>At the beginning of the large-scale eucalypt plantation establishment in
Brazil, the two most difficult problems were leaf-cutting ants and root-damaging
termites.  Control of ants was accomplished by using chemical products such as
methyl bromide, aldrin, and (later) baits containing dodecachlor.  Termites were
controlled mainly by aldrin placed in each planting hole during stand
establishment.  Although most countries currently ban chlor-based pesticides,
they were used indiscriminately in the most populated regions of Brazil.  If
this situation had continued, it would have caused serious environmental
problems affecting both fauna and the human population.</P>
<P>	The establishment of mismatched species in certain regions and sites led to
the appearance of diseases such as the canker caused by<I> Chryphonectria
cubensis</I>.  Because of the size of the plantations, it was not economically
feasible to control the fungus chemically.  The best means found to overcome the
problem were to use eucalypt species naturally resistant to the disease, to use
techniques of genetic improvement and controlled hybridization to develop
individuals and hybrids naturally resistant to canker, and to use vegetative
propagation to obtain clones of <I>Eucalyptus grandis </I>or hybrids that were
highly resistant to such disease.</P>
<P>	Because of the size of the plantations and perhaps because of the removal
of some native vegetation cover, local insects also became a problem for the
eucalypts.   Lepidoptera and coleoptera were the most problematic.  Initially,
companies tried to use chemical pesticide control; however, apart from the high
cost of chemical applications (sometimes by aerial spraying), the problems of
environmental contamination and growing resistance of the insects to these
pesticides were prohibitive.  However, the use of appropriate species for each
region and the use of silvicultural practices such as pruning helped alleviate
the insect problem.  A major breakthrough was realized with the use of
biological control to maintain insect populations at an acceptable level.  In
one of the control measures, a certain amount of native vegetation is intermixed
with the eucalypts.  This technique favors the maintenance of local bird
populations that play a very important role in controlling the insect
population.  A nationwide program to monitor insect populations in eucalypt
plantations was initiated in which universities, research institutions, and
forest companies participated.  Natural enemies (insects, bacteria, viruses, and
fungi) of the prospective problem insects were also studied.  Today, natural
controls are the most efficient and most used techniques to control insects in
eucalypt plantations.</P>
<P>	In 1992 the use of dodecachlor-based baits for ant control in Brazil was
banned by IBAMA.  This led some private companies to study and develop, along
with the scientific community, new kinds of baits that were not harmful to the
environment.  One of the most recent products is based on sulfuramid, which has
proven to be very efficient in controlling leaf-cutting ants and has none of the
environmental problems presented by dodecachlor.</P>
<P></P>
<H3>6.5  SITE PREPARATION</H3>
<P>Because no significant experience was available regarding silvicultural and
management techniques before the establishment of incentives-based forest
plantations in the 1970s and early 1980s, most of the forest companies used site
preparation techniques used to prepare land for agricultural crops.  Most of the
time, the area was burned initially to diminish vegetation cover and to allow a
better view of the terrain in which the bulldozers would work.  The remaining
vegetation was then removed by bulldozers and burned again.  This also resulted
in removal of the superficial and more-fertile layer of soil, which accumulated
in strip-like areas with the residual vegetation.  Subsequently, these strips
would cause serious problems during the mechanized planting, tending, and
logging operations and would make ideal locations for the hills of leaf-cutting
ants, compounding control problems.  The next operation involved harrowing the
soil followed by two plowing operations.  Soil erosion was of no concern;
consequently, these intensive activities did not take into account the slope of
the area or the direction of harrowing, plowing, and furrowing.  Because
planting was done during the rainy reason, these techniques led to an enormous
amount of soil erosion and silting of the streams.</P>
<P>	Today, plantations are not established in areas having native forest cover.
 Most of the new plantations are being established in areas previously occupied
by eucalypt stands that have been harvested or on abandoned and degraded
agricultural and pasture lands.  These areas are usually covered by small bushes
and shrubs, which are incorporated into the soil during site preparation. 
Sometimes, they are simply eliminated by using herbicides, after which the area
is furrowed to a 0.5-m depth to eliminate the compacted layer.  These furrows
are established according to the planned initial spacing (generally 3  m) along
the contour.  Because they are perpendicular to the slope, they play a very
important role in the absorption of water by the soil during the raining season.
 Some  states such as like S&atilde;o Paulo have banned the use of fire  for
site preparation for both agricultural and forest plantations.  The technique
used today for site preparation is based on minimum site disturbance.  Perhaps
the only disadvantage of this new approach has been the increased use of
herbicides.  Developing alternatives to intensive site preparation is key to
alleviating negative site-specific environmental impacts.</P>
<P>	Another mistake made by companies in the early 1970s was the use of
incorrect amounts of fertilizers.  Sometimes the same NPK formula was used
everywhere independent of soil fertility.  In the 1980s a high level of effort
and substantial funding was put into research programs to solve the problems
related to soil fertility and eucalypt nutrition.  A cooperative program was
created and is now being implemented by most of the forest companies,
universities, and research institutions in Brazil in which each company has a
specific fertilizer formulation for each specific site, species, hybrid, and
clone.  These practices have considerably improved the productivity of the
Brazilian eucalypt plantations and have lowered the cost of the wood delivered
to the mills.</P>
<P></P>
<H3>6.6  TENDING AND CULTIVATION</H3>
<P>The most common practice in the first year of establishment of the eucalypt
plantations (in flat and undulate areas) was to eliminate the competing
vegetation between the rows of the seedlings by mechanized discing.  The weeding
within the rows of eucalypts was done manually by hoeing.  These tending
operations exposed the soil and promoted erosion (in the undulated areas)
because planting was usually oriented down the slope.  The disking would also
cut the surface roots of the eucalypts, reducing growth and sometimes killing
the tree, especially when done at the end of the rainy season or during the dry
season.</P>
<P>	Today, most of the companies have banned such methods of tending and have
adopted the use of herbicides or some mechanical chopping of the weeds without
disturbing the soil.  Various research studies have shown that cattle and sheep
can also be used for the biological control of weeds, reducing the cost of
eucalypt plantation establishment.  Intercropping agricultural crops, such as
corn, beans, and rice, in the first year of plantation establishment can also
eliminate the need for tending operations and reduce the overall cost of
eucalypt plantation maintenance.  The most recent study in this regard deals
with the intercropping with leguminous herbaceous species to control weeds (<A
HREF="eucaly6.html#neto90">Neto et al. 1990</A>).   All of these options help
reduce negative site impacts.</P>
<P></P>
<H3>6.7  ROAD CONSTRUCTION</H3>
<P>Most of the forest companies failed to give road construction design proper
attention in their projects in the 1970s and early 1980s.  A typical road
network was constructed without having been planned in detail to allow access
for labor and machinery to reach the area to be planted.  The roads were
maintained during the first 2 to 4 years of the plantation establishment and
then abandoned, to be reentered only at harvesting time.  Consequently, most of
the roads eroded completely and presented serious problems to the environment.</P>
<P>	Today a cooperative program among forest companies, universities, and
research institutions is devoted to solving these problems.  The program's main
objectives are to  design road networks that will reduce the cost of hauling and
transporting wood from the stands to the mills and to improve the roads by using
gravel and other material that will enhance compaction so the roads can carry
the heavy traffic expected during harvesting operations.  Roads also play a very
important role in forest fire prevention and control.  Originally, roads were
designed on downhill slopes and would divert water from the eucalypt stands. 
Today, roads follow the contours of the terrain and divert water toward the
trees.</P>
<P>	Most of the problems with the roads arise during the harvesting of the
forest stands.  Logging and hauling operations are carried out year-round,
including the rainy season when erosion problems tend to be aggravated. 
Development of specialized equipment appropriate for felling, hauling, and
transporting eucalypt wood has considerably reduced the environmental impacts of
these operations.  Proper compaction and surfacing of roads and development of
lighter machinery and trucks that have special tires also have improved the
situation.</P>
<P></P>
<H3>6.8  COPPICING AND RENEWAL</H3>
<P>In the 1970s and early 1980s most of the forest companies in Brazil used the
natural ability of the eucalypts to sprout and adopted a coppicing system of
renewal.  The stands were harvested at 7 years, and stumps were left to sprout. 
One, two, or three sprouts would be left on each stump to grow, and subsequently
harvested 5 to 7 years later.  Sometimes this would be repeated, and the
original stand would have up to three rotations of 5 to 7 years before being
replanted.</P>
<P>	However, as opposed to other species that have an increase in yields with
coppicing, the yield of the eucalypt stands in Brazil had a decline of 20 to 50%
after the first rotation.  The major reasons for this decline were (1)
establishment of <I>Eucalyptus grandis</I> and <I>E. saligna</I> on inadequate
sites (low rainfall and very long dry season), (2) the large genetic variation
in the seeds used, (3) inappropriate provenance, (4) the incidence of canker
attack and leaf-cutting ant infestation, and (5) inadequate logging techniques
that damaged the stumps.  Most of these problems were solved, and today the
coppicing systems can be used with reasonable success in Brazil.  However,
because forest companies are constantly improving eucalypt genetically with new
clones and new hybrids that have higher productivity and better technological
properties, it pays to replant the stands instead of coppicing.  Today, renewal
of the eucalypt stands after the first harvest is an almost universally accepted
practice.
</P>
<P></P>
<P></P>
<H3>6.9  SPACING</H3>
<P>Originally, laws outlining fiscal incentives for reforestation encouraged
the use of dense plantations.  The greater the number of seedlings planted and
tended per hectare, the greater the amount of money that could be claimed for a
tax deduction.  Thus, there was a tendency to use a 2 by 2 m spacing, resulting
in 2500 trees per hectare.  Eventually, this spacing posed some problems with
mechanized cultivation and harvesting operations.  One way to overcome this
problem and still maintain the same number of trees per hectare was to change
the spacing to 2.5 by 1.6 m, 2.75 by 1.45 m, or 3 by 1.3 m.</P>
<P>	In the late 1970s and early 1980s, Brazil began a national program of
growing biomass-for-energy.  This program tended to use close spacing, resulting
in 5000 to 10,000 trees per hectare.  Rotation was also reduced to 4 to 5 years
so that the trees would be harvested as soon as competition began.  However,
these eucalypt plantations failed, mainly because mortality was high,
productivity of the stands was low, the final tree diameter was small, and the
percentage of bark vs wood was too high.  Further, because most of these
eucalypt plantations were established in savanna-like regions having
low-fertility soils, nutrient depletion became problematic.</P>
<P>	Today, companies are adjusting the initial spacing to the quality of the
site, the genetic material being planted, and the rotation length; thus, a
specified tree type is obtained at harvesting time.  The most common spacings
now used are 3 by 2.5 m, 3.0 by 3.0 m, 3.5 by 3.0 m, 3.5 by 3.5 m, and 4.0 by
3.0 m.</P>
<P></P>
<H3>6.10  INTERACTION WITH COMMUNITIES</H3>
<P>For a long time, public relations was not needed between forest companies
and existing communities.  Forest operations were carried out on a very large
scale and were considered by Brazilian society to be important as a source of
jobs, and new companies were welcomed throughout the country.  Essentially no
environmental or social concerns about the establishment of the large-scale
eucalypt plantations were expressed.  However, over the last 10 years growing
concerns about the impacts of such plantations in Brazil have forced the
companies to respond.  Because most of the companies were not interacting
adequately with local communities, serious problems arose.  </P>
<P>	Most companies are now facing pressure from nongovernmental organizations
and new forest legislation.  In addition to federal forest legislation,
restrictive state and municipal forest and environmental legislation is now
making operations more and more difficult for the companies.  For example, in
some counties in the state of Esp&iacute;rito Santo, municipal legislators
prohibited establishment of eucalypt plantations on new land; only lands
previously occupied by eucalypt plantations could be replanted.  Because this
prohibition applied only to companies, the corporations overcame the problem by
initiating tree farmer programs.  Beyond increasing the supply of timber, the
companies adopted the strategy of making local farmers partners in the timber
supply side of their operations.  As part of these tree farmer programs,
companies donate seedlings (exotic and native species, sometimes fruit trees) to
the local communities.</P>
<P>	Forest companies are also supporting educational programs at the
elementary- and high-school levels.  The objective is to educate the new
generation about the benefits of forest activities and their social and
environmental impacts.  Sometimes the companies will provide support for
nongovernmental organizations that then carry out the environment educational
program.  Companies are now actively using the media to explain the benefits of
the forest industry.</P>
<P>	Company contributions or donations to help restore and preserve endangered
ecosystems have also helped the companies improve their image at both the local
and international levels.  Development of alternative land uses such as
agroforestry systems, along with the tree farmer programs, have enhanced public
image of the companies. Financial support of research projects at universities
and research institutions also has helped to integrate the companies with the
scientific community.</P>

<H2>7.  NEW TRENDS </H2>
<H3>7.1  AGROFORESTRY</H3>
<P>As mentioned, the increasing price of the land surrounding company
facilities and some new restrictions on plantations in southeastern Brazil
stimulated forest companies, along with state governments, to begin local tree
farmer programs to reinforce wood supplies.  These programs, however, were not
readily accepted by local farmers, who were concerned that eucalypt plantations
would divert land from food to timber production (<A HREF="eucaly6.html#assis86">Assis
et al. 1986</A>).  Their belief that tree farmer programs would result in
decreased food crop production was widespread.</P>
<P>	Given this situation, agroforestry appeared to be an alternative that could
integrate timber and food production, thus meeting food demands while addressing
wood production needs.  However, for agroforestry to be acceptable, both
companies and farmers had to have accurate biological, technical, and economic
information about the intercropping of agricultural crops and tree plantation
species.  Agroforestry as a science is relatively new, despite being a
historical land use in Brazil as well as in other parts of the world. 
Agroforestry research in Brazil, particularly involving eucalypts, has only been
done recently.  In 1986, the relevant literature for agroforestry relative to
eucalypts in southeastern Brazil was limited to only three studies.  The first
work consisted of <I>Eucalyptus alba</I> intercropped with corn in the state of
S&atilde;o Paulo (<A HREF="eucaly6.html#gurgelfilho62">Gurgel Filho 1962</A>),
followed by <I>E. grandis</I> intercropped with soybeans in Minas Gerais (<A
HREF="eucaly6.html#couto82">Couto et al.  1982</A>), and <I>E. grandis</I>
intercropped with beans in S&atilde;o Paulo (<A HREF="eucaly6.html#schreiner86">Schreiner
and Balloni 1986</A>).</P>
<P>	The success of these studies stimulated researchers from the Federal
University of Vi&ccedil;osa to continue studying a series of eucalypt
agroforestry systems.  These studies were a joint effort between forest
companies in the state of Minas Gerais and the university and were funded
through the Society for Forest Research and certain forest companies.  The
research has included <I>Eucalyptus torelliana</I> intercropped with corn in
Belo Oriente (<A HREF="eucaly6.html#ferreianeto93">Ferreira Neto 1993</A>);
<I>E. grandis</I> intercropped with black beans in Pe&ccedil;anha (<A
HREF="eucaly6.html#ferreianeto93">Ferreira Neto 1993</A>); <I>E. citriodora</I>
with <I>Panicum maximum</I> in a silvopastoral system with cattle and sheep in
Dion&iacute;sio <A HREF="eucaly6.html#almeida90">(Almeida 1990</A>); <I>E.
cloziana</I> with herbaceous legumes and grasses for cattle grazing in Montes
Claros (<A HREF="eucaly6.html#santos90">Santos 1990</A>); and most recently,
<I>E. grandis</I> intercropped with herbaceous legumes for weed suppression and
soil protection in Dion&iacute;sio (<A HREF="eucaly6.html#ferrieraneto93">Ferriera
Neto 1993</A>).</P>
<P>	Today, most of the forest companies in Brazil are adopting agroforestry as
an alternative land use, mainly for their tree farmer programs.  Agroforestry is
likely to become a key point of the plantation programs oriented toward the
small farm operation.</P>
<P></P>
<H3>7.2  WOOD BIOMASS GASIFICATION</H3>
<P>Studies conducted by some Brazilian companies have shown that <I>Ceteris
paribus </I>energy production from biomass cannot compete in price with energy
generated from  oil, coal, and natural gas.  The only way it might be
competitive would be by generating a more valuable form of energy--electricity. 
This may be possible by means of a new technology--Biomass Integrated
Gasification/Gas Turbine or BIG/GT, developed in the United States at Princeton
University.  This technology consists of gasifying and using the  gas to move a
turbine, which produces electricity.  The exhaust gases from the turbine are
captured for additional energy production.  Compared with the 20% conversion
efficiency of traditional steam-based electricity production, the new technology
has a 40% conversion efficiency.</P>
<P>	In 1992, Brazil submitted a technical proposal to the Global Environmental
Facility (GEF) to build  an experimental BIG/GT plant and to study the economic
feasibility of commercial development.  The five-stage project was approved and
is now under way.  The first stage was to evaluate the technical proposal and
preinvestment studies.  The second stage, to be concluded by 1994, involves the
development of equipment and basic engineering and economic feasibility studies
and preparation of the basic structure for stage three.  Stage three consists of
the construction of the pilot plant with the US$23 million funded by GEF. 
Additional capital resources will be provided by associated companies: Centrais
Eletricas Basileiras, Companhia Hidro El&eacute;trica do S&atilde;o Francisco,
Fundacao de Ci&ecirc;ncia e Technologia, Companhia Vale do Rio Dole, Shell
Brazil S.A., and Shell International Petroleum Company.  This joint venture is
coordinated by the Brazilian Minister of Science and Technology.  The pilot
facility will probably be built in Bahia close to eucalypt plantations.  The
fourth stage, which will last for 24 months, will comprise operational
demonstration tests with sugar cane bagasse and wood biomass.  Finally, the
fifth stage will be the commercial development of the plant.</P>
<P>	This BIG/GT project is the first of its kind in the world and, if
successful, will bring many advantages, such as small plant size that allows
decentralization of electrical energy production; reduction of energy
transmission costs; small capital investment, allowing private companies to
enter the sector; use of marginal agricultural lands for short-rotation forest
plantations devoted to biomass for electricity energy production; generation of
jobs in rural areas; and utilization of the Brazilian dendroenergetic potential.
 The northeastern region of Brazil, alone, has a potential of transforming 197.1
million steres (stack meters of roundwood in 1 m &#215; 1m &#215; 1m piles) each
year into 19.673 thousand megawatts of energy per year.
</P>
<P></P>
<P></P>
<H3>7.3  FOREST PRODUCTS ENVIRONMENTAL CERTIFICATION</H3>
<P>In 1992, the Brazilian Society of Silviculture (SBS) along with the private
forest companies proposed the creation of a US$500,000 Integrated Management
System for Improving the Value of Forestry Affairs (SEIVAS).  This system is
designed to predict the world markets 10 to 20 years in the future.  This
information will help identify goals for the Brazilian forestry-based products
in the international market.  Based on world market trends and Brazil's
conditions, the system will ultimately define markets in which the country can
enjoy a competitive edge.  Furthermore, the system will indicate what components
of the industry would have to be developed to reach these goals.  Two parts of
the system are already being implemented: the program for preservation and
recovery of the Brazilian forest cover and the Certification for Forest Products
(CERFLOR) project related to the origin of the raw material utilized in
manufacturing of forestry products.  The CERFLOR project has a certificate
called a &quot;green stamp&quot; for any forest raw material or product
originating from native forests or plantations managed according to
environmentally sound techniques.  Coordination and elaboration of the rules for
receiving this certificate was assigned to EMBRAPA.</P>
<P></P>
<H3>7.4  A MEGA AFFORESTATION PROJECT</H3>
<P>Mega Afforestation (FLORAM) is a forestry project proposed in 1990 by the
Institute of Advanced Studies of the University of S&atilde;o Paulo to promote
social advancement.  The project's objective is to establish 20 million new
hectares of forest plantations in Brazil over the next 20 years.  This project,
according to the Industrial Institute for Economic and Social Research from
Stockholm, Sweden, would generate one million jobs and would produce US$10
billion per year in forest products.  This project received the support of the
private sector, universities, research institutions and nongovernmental
organizations in Brazil and is now under way.  FLORAM proposes three types of
forests: the first for industrial purposes using exotic species, the second for
dual purposes (conservation and commercial utilization) using exotic and native
species, and the third for conservation only (using native species only).</P>

The transportation network of tomorrow will utilize many resources, both
conventional and renewable. New fuel efficient vehicles and smart highways will
improve the efficiency of conventional use. Almost any type of current and
future vehicle can be fueled from biomass. The flexibility of this important;
domestic and renewable resource could provide liquid fuels for internal
combustion engines (e.g., flexible and dedicated alternative fuel vehicles),
electric and hybrid vehicles (e.g., electricity and liquid fuel), and fuel cell
vehicles (e.g., hydrogen from ethanol or methanol technologies).
</P>
<P>This strategic plan is the first of many steps toward realizing the
potential of biomass. Through this document we have outlined our vision of the
future and the general guidelines and principles we will incorporate to achieve
that future. As has been stressed throughout the plan, industry's participation
is
<I>critical</I> to making the future a reality. As the Program proceeds to
develop and deploy biofuels technologies, this plan will be updated to ensure it
is current, given any new market, regulatory, or economic realities unforeseen
at the time of publication. By making this plan a &quot;living document,&quot;
it will be used by BSP as guidance for its future activities. We encourage and
welcome your comments.

Laboratory, and DynCorp-Meridian.

<P>The Department of Energy (DOE) Biofuels Systems Program (BSP) is conducting
research, development, demonstration, and commercialization activities to
encourage the use of biofuels for transportation. The Program is managed by the
Biofuels Systems Division (BSD) within the DOE Office of Transportation
Technologies (OTT). The Division and Program organization are shown in Figures 1

<H3>What are Biofuels?</H3>
<P></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;Biofuels&quot; are alcohols, ethers, and other chemicals made from
cellulosic biomass - renewable resources such as fast growing trees, grasses,
aquatic plants (microalgae), and waste products, such as agricultural and
forestry residues, and municipal and industrial wastes. With further advances in
technology, these domestically produced, biomass resources could provide over
50% of future U.S. light duty vehicle (LDV) fuel requirements. Some of the
biofuels used to fuel cars and trucks include ethanol and biodiesel. Other
alcohol fuels such as methanol, which currently are produced from fossil fuels,
can also be produced from renewable biomass and be classified as biofuels.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR>
<P>Many exciting developments are currently underway here at the Biofuels
Systems Program. We recently undertook a strategic process to inventory our
current situation as well as examine potential future trends. <EM>What we found
was that the BSP is at a unique crossroads, positioned to advance biofuels
science and technologies into a ready marketplace to fuel an economically
competitive transportation sector with secure, clean, and renewable energy
resources.</EM> We are examining a number of ways that biofuel products and
technologies can capitalize on the massive markets at home and abroad for
sustainable energy technologies. Many of our goals involve a new way of doing
business, one that is more responsive to our stakeholders, as described in <I>Fueling
A Competitive Economy</I>, the DOE Strategic Plan. In support of our goals, we
are working with a number of industries to deploy bioconversion and
thermoconversion technologies to produce ethanol, methanol, biodiesel, and fuel
additives for transportation. In FY 1995, the program will focus on pilot-plant
operations in partnership with Amoco Oil Company and the New Energy Corporation
of South Bend, Indiana, leading to collaborative ethanol production
demonstrations based on low-cost feedstocks. A second element of the BSP is the
terrestrial feedstock development program where we are collaborating with
industry partners, such as Boise Cascade, on opportunities to develop
low-cost/high-yield feedstocks such as fast-growing trees (e.g., hybrid poplars)
and herbaceous species (e.g., switchgrass). We are also working with several
environmental organizations who are interested in sustainable agriculture for
energy while enhancing habitats for wildlife.
</P>
<P>The BSP s Vision, Mission, Goals, Objectives, and Strategies that have
emerged from this process are detailed in this strategic plan. As the plan
evolves, it is our intent to continue to reach out and involve you, our
stakeholders. We can achieve our vision only by your meaningful involvement.  We
are currently initiating a set of information, education, and outreach
activities to make it easier for our stakeholders to access BSP technology,
resources,  and  facilities. Furthermore, we invite you to contact us either
directly or through the National Alternative Fuels Hotline to express your
opinion on this plan which we view as an ongoing process and living document.

the best technologies.
</P>
<P></P>
<H2>Program Mission</H2>
<P>We will research, develop, demonstrate, and facilitate the commercialization
of biomass-based, environmentally-sound, cost-competitive, U.S. technologies to
develop clean fuels for transportation, leading to the establishment of a major
biofuels industry.
</P>
<P>We will use biomass sources, such as waste paper and wood residues, to serve
near-term niche markets as a bridging strategy to position the biofuels industry
for the long-term bulk fuel markets. To meet these ends, we are focusing on: the
research and development of integrated biofuels systems; the creation of
strategic partnerships with U.S. industry and other stakeholders; and improving
the operations of our program through well-defined metrics, communication, and
coordination with our stakeholders and customers.

<H2>Sustainable Transportation Systems</H2>
<P>Our country's transportation system is critical to the economic well-being
of our nation. Safe and efficient delivery of goods and services is of paramount
importance. Increasingly, it is being realized that a sound, well-planned
transportation system is a key element of sustainable development. Biofuels can
contribute to an energy mix of environmentally-sound, domestic fuels.
</P>
<P>New partnership programs such as Clean Cities are helping to bring together
federal government agencies, such as the Department of Commerce and the
Department of Energy, local government, and private sector suppliers to put more
alternative-fueled vehicles (AFVs) on the road and, by creating a stronger
demand, encourage the building of fueling stations, maintenance facilities, and
other convenient local infrastructure to support them. It is estimated that the
Clean Cities effort will result in 250,000 AFVs and 1,000 additional refueling
stations throughout the United States - all by 1996. 
</P>
<P>Moreover, requirements in the Energy Policy Act of 1992 and other
legislation, such as the Alternative Motor Fuels Act of 1988, should, by the end
of the 1990s, draw significant numbers of vehicles that are capable of using
nonpetroleum fuels (over 100,000 units annually) into Federal, state, and
private fleets. It is the Program's intent to supply as many of these AFVs as
possible with biomass-based transportation fuels.

<HR><IMG SRC="benebiof.gif" ALT="Benefits table">
<P>The aggressive development and deployment of transportation fuels derived
from biomass offer the following benefits highlighted below.
</P>
<P><B>Fueling Sustainable Transportation Systems: Creating Jobs and New
Markets</B>
</P>
<P>The development of a major biofuels industry will create many domestic jobs
in agribusiness, engineering, lending institutions, construction, fuel
production and distribution. Biofuels technologies also provide the potential of
exports to other countries, where new markets exist for alternative fuels,
either as a fuel extender or to address growing concerns about mobile source
emissions.
</P>
<P>Advances in genetic engineering and the growth and harvesting of feedstocks
will generate thousands of jobs and improve efficiencies in agriculture and in
the lumber, pulp, and paper products industries. The production of high-valued
chemicals including ethers, solvents, and pharmaceuticals will also create
high-paying jobs.
</P>
<P>Biofuels will also revitalize the nation's rural economies by providing more
farm jobs, increased equipment sales, fuel plant employment, and other indirect
employment and income benefits.
</P>
<P><B>Fueling Sustainable Transportation Systems: Protecting and Enhancing
Environmental Resources</B>
</P>
<P>An estimated 82% of the carbon monoxide, 43% of the reactive organic gases
(precursors to ozone), and 57% of the nitrogen oxides in domestic cities are
emitted from the use of petroleum-based transportation fuels. Because biofuels
burn cleanly, they are an excellent method for reducing emissions from the
transportation sector. In fact, ethanol and methanol are listed as  clean
alternative fuels  in both the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments and the 1992 Energy
Policy Act. Furthermore, the carbon dioxide (CO<SUB>2</SUB>) advantage of
biofuels is of particular importance. The threat of global climate change
resulting from buildup of CO<SUB>2</SUB> and other greenhouse gases may make it
necessary for the world to move away from fossil fuels and towards energy forms,
such as biomass, that result in little or no net additions of CO<SUB>2</SUB> to
the atmosphere. In addition, biofuels can alleviate waste disposal problems in
many parts of the country, due to landfill closings and more stringent
wastewater regulations, because they can be produced from a wide variety of
wastes.
</P>
<P><B>Fueling Sustainable Transportation Systems: Energy Security</B>
</P>
<P>The transportation sector depends on petroleum for 97% of its energy needs.
The largest contributor to the U.S. balance of trade/balance of payments problem
is imported oil. In 1995, the oil trade deficit is expected to be $66 billion.
Nearly half of our oil is being imported, and the expectation is that this
fraction will continue to increase in the future. Estimates by DOE indicate that
by 2020, up to 74% of the oil we use will be supplied by imports. In that same
time frame, our oil trade deficit is projected to be $173 billion.
</P>
<P>Numerous studies have concluded that our heavy reliance on imported oil is
becoming a serious energy security issue, and it is clear that our vulnerability
will get worse with time. Key among the reasons for rising oil imports is the
limited domestic resource base of crude oil. Additionally, global oil resources
are finite and not renewable, oil quality is deteriorating (becoming heavier and
with more sulfur), while costs are expected to increase. An important way to
stem the tide of imports is to substitute plentiful domestic energy resources,
such as biofuels, for petroleum fuels in the transportation sector.
</P>
<P>The cost to the nation's economy of importing oil is substantial. First,
there are the military expenses associated with energy security. Although
experts do not agree on what portion of our military costs should be allocated
to energy security, the average value from four recent estimates is $35 billion
per year. Maintaining the Strategic Petroleum Reserve is another cost element
associated with energy security. From 1976 to 1990, the nation spent $40 billion
on this reserve. Currently, we spend about $300 million per year. Aside from
energy security, oil imports cost us in other ways. A recent Oak Ridge National
Laboratory study estimates that the real cost to the U.S. economy of oil imports
from 1972 to 1991 averaged $60 to $95 billion per year.
</P>
<P>The production of alternatives to oil from domestic resources, such as
biomass, would create manufacturing jobs, help American farmers, and keep more
of our investment dollars at home supporting a sustainable energy future.

<H2>Where We Stand</H2>
<P>As depicted in Figure 3, the Biofuels Systems Program is conducting research
on numerous feedstocks and conversion processes to produce a wide menu of
biofuel options for the future, including -- ethanol, methanol,biodiesel,
additives for reformulated gasoline (RFG), electricity, and hydrogen. While all
of these options offer their own unique advantages and opportunities, BSP is
working to accelerate the application of certain biomass technologies based on
the near-term, mid-term, and long-term components of this strategic plan.
</P>
<CENTER>
<P><B>Figure 3:</B>
<IMG SRC="pathway.gif" ALT="Fuel pathway diagram">
</P></CENTER>
<P>In the near-term, BSP is primarily focusing on those biofuels that can be
deployed in niche markets using existing infrastructure, such as ethanol from
waste biomass, fuel additives for reformulated gasoline, and biodiesel from
plant oils.  In the mid- and long-term, commercially produced energy crops will
provide fuels for dedicated vehicles and a new infrastructure. Biofuels, such as
ethanol and methanol, show promise for their mid- and long-term potential as
bulk fuels. Renewable hydrogen and aquatic-based biodiesel also have long-term
potential.
</P>
<P>This is not to say that we are automatically ruling out the other fuel
options; if and when new alternatives appear to be as or more promising, based
on market/stakeholder demand and the type of vehicles or research coming out of
industry, there will be flexibility to shift our focus.
</P>
<P>The Biofuels Program has traditionally encompassed two major areas of
research and development. These areas are: (1) the production of biomass
feedstocks and (2) the conversion of the feedstocks to transportation fuels and
high-value chemicals. The Biofuels Systems Division has assigned feedstock
research and development (R&amp;D) responsibility to the Oak Ridge National
Laboratory (ORNL) while conversion R&amp;D is centered at the National Renewable
Energy Laboratory (NREL).
</P>
<P>As part of a fundamental reorientation of our program to accelerate the
application of biofuels, the research at these laboratories is being further
integrated to link numerous feedstocks to various conversion technologies. BSP
is also strengthening its ties to industry and other stakeholders. The BSP
research program and collaboration with industry participants are discussed
below.
</P>
<P></P>
<H3>Feedstock Production</H3>
<P>Most current ethanol production is based on corn and other starch crops. The
first facilities producing ethanol from cellulosic biomass will use low-cost
wastes as feedstocks. The large-scale use of biomass-based transportation fuels,
however, will require crops grown specifically for energy purposes. The emphasis
on BSP's feedstock R&amp;D program is on developing fast-growing trees and
grasses as energy crops. Screening trials have been conducted on over 100
species of trees and 20 species of grasses. Of the trees identified as promising
for energy crops, hybrid poplars are receiving the most research attention.
Research efforts also emphasize switchgrass, a grass found to bepromising over a
wide area of the United States.
</P>
<P>Sustainable energy crop yields achievable today appear to be in the range of
3 to 8 dry tons per acre per year. Indications are that yields up to 12 dry tons
per acre may be achievable through the development of better varieties and
improved cropping methods.
</P>
<P>With current knowledge and technologies, it is estimated that energy crops
could be produced, harvested, and delivered for about $3.00 per million BTUs. A
reasonable goal for the future is $2.00 per million BTUs.
</P>
<P></P>
<H3>Conversion to Transportation Fuels</H3>
<P>Three different R&amp;D approaches are being pursued to develop commercial
technologies for converting the raw materials in trees, grasses, and other
plants -- or plant wastes -- to transportation fuels. These approaches are:
</P>
<P></P>
<UL>
<LI>Biochemical conversion of lignocellulosic materials from trees, grasses,
and wastes to ethanol. In the near-term, the ethanol,  or products derived from
ethanol, would be used as an additive to gasoline.  In the long-term, the
ethanol would be used as the primary component in an ethanol-gasoline blend.
</LI>
<LI>Thermochemical conversion of biomass through gasification or
pyrolysis-to-methanol, RFG components, biocrude derivatives, or hydrogen.
</LI>
<LI>Physical/chemical conversion of biomass such as vegetables oils, animal
fats, and/or microalgal oils to produce biodiesel, an alternative fuel that can
be used in diesel engines.
</LI></UL>
<P>Each of these research areas is discussed briefly:
</P>
<P><I><B>Ethanol.</B></I> The basic processes for converting lignocellulosic
feedstock to ethanol are (1) conversion of the cellulose and hemicellulose to
sugars (hydrolysis) and (2) fermentation of the sugars to ethanol. R&amp;D work
is progressing on both of these basic steps. Emphases are on increasing the
yield of sugars from hydrolysis, decreasing the production of fermentation
inhibitors, and speeding up the fermentation process. A significant benefit of
the biochemical process being developed by BSP is the generation of surplus
electricity.
</P>
<P>Thus far, process testing has been limited to bench-scale with some
integration of process steps. A larger scale, process development unit (PDU) is
under construction and will be ready for testing in mid-1994. Two cooperative
research and development agreements (CRADAs) have been implemented with
industrial partners capable of commercializing the technology.
</P>
<P>As shown in Figure 4, using present BSP technologies, it is estimated that
ethanol could be produced for $1.22 per gallon. Projected costs of energy crops
will result in ethanol costs under $1.00 per gallon by 2005 and under $.70 per
gallon by 2010. Waste feedstocks look even more attractive. For wastes with zero
feedstock costs (e.g., municipal solid wastes [MSW]), near-term technology
results in costs around $1.00 per gallon. By 2005, ethanol cost is predicted to
drop as low as $.50 per gallon and to $.34 per gallon by 2010.
</P>
<CENTER>
<P><B>Figure 4</B>
<IMG SRC="costgoal.gif" ALT="Research Goals" ALIGN="BOTTOM">
</P></CENTER>
<P><B><I>Alcohols and Hydrocarbon Fuels.</I></B> Alcohols can also be
produced from thermochemical processes. This approach uses gasification, a
thermochemical process to convert biomass to synthesis gas (syngas) - a mixture
of carbon monoxide, hydrogen, and low molecular weight hydrocarbons. The
synthesis gas is then cleaned and conditioned to prepare it for the particular
liquid fuel synthesis step of interest. This is followed by fuel cracking and/or
purification, if necessary. The most promising fuel products are methanol; mixed
higher alcohols such as butanol; and gasoline, diesel, and jet fuels. The
biomass gasification, clean up and conditioning steps have been demonstrated at
the pilot scale for methanol production. The fuel synthesis, cracking, and
purifications steps are currently commercially available for converting fossil
fuels to all of the products listed. The sulfur-free nature of these fuels, when
produced from biomass, gives them added value over their fossil-derived
counterparts, especially if the projected cost goals are achieved. Using present
BSP technologies, it is estimated that methanol could be produced for about
$0.93 per gallon. A reasonable R&amp;D cost goal is $0.50 per gallon.
</P>
<P><B><I>Ethers and Biocrude through Pyrolysis.</I></B> Pyrolysis, another
thermochemical process for biomass, is an alternative approach to gasification.
Pyrolysis produces a mixture of oils, char, and non-condensible gases which can
be further processed to derive a variety of products. If a liquid refiner
feedstock is desired, the oils are condensed to form biocrude which can then be
deoxygenated and hydrogenated for compatibility with petroleum process streams.
If hydrogen is desired, then the biocrude is reformed. Alternatively,
iso-olefins are then reacted with alcohols to produce ethers. Biomass pyrolysis
technology is currently being scaled up to 35 tons per day which is considered
near-commercial. Reforming is a standard petroleum refining technology, and
ethers are commercially produced, using fossil fuel feedstocks. The other
processes are being developed at the bench scale. As with alcohol and
hydrocarbon fuels, the products obtained by pyrolysis are sulfur-free.
</P>
<P><I><B>Biodiesel.</B></I> The production of biodiesel fuel from existing
sources of plant oils -- e.g., vegetable oils and restaurant waste oils -- is
already commercial technology in Europe and Japan. Some commercial
demonstration-scale work is now underway in the United States for
soybean-derived biodiesel. The Biofuels Systems Program is looking into
near-term deployment of biodiesel from plant oils, while developing long-term
concepts for obtaining biodiesel from microalgae.
</P>
<P></P>
<H3>BSP Collaboration With Industry -- A Primary Focus</H3>
<P>The BSP is collaborating with industry, university, national laboratories,
and other researchers, to accelerate the application of biomass technologies and
their associated fuels, based on the near-term, mid-term and long-term
components of the strategic plan. All three components are being pursued <B><I>today</I></B>.
Some examples of collaboration are discussed below.
</P>
<P><B><I>Near-Term Commercialization</I></B>
</P>
<P>The near-term focus of the BSP is on processes that will lead to the
commercial production of ethanol from waste and cellulosic biomass, fuel
additives for RFG, and biodiesel from plant oils. To meet these objectives, BSP
has extended its efforts with a new emphasis on scale-up (transferring
technology from the laboratory to the marketplace) and partnering with industry.
This is best exemplified by the Program's CRADAs with Amoco Corporation and New
Energy Company of Indiana. The Amoco partnership involves converting wastes into
ethanol for immediate application. This partnership is exciting because oil
companies, such as Amoco, would have the ability to produce ethanol's ether
derivative ETBE, a high-value RFG component, which can be used to control base
gasoline's vapor pressure.
</P>
<P>BSP's partnership with the New Energy Company of Indiana is developing
technology for ethanol production from the residual starch and cellulosic
components in corn to enhance ethanol yields and decrease production costs for
corn dry-milling operations. New Energy provides an existing facility in which
to integrate biomass-ethanol production technology rapidly; their pilot plant is
now providing data at an industrial site to support large-scale implementation
in the immediate future. In 1993, the New Energy CRADA received an <I>R&amp;D
100</I> award as one of the most important inventions of the year.
</P>
<P>In addition, the Program has cost-shared arrangements for fuel production
with five different consortia of industrial companies located in various states
including California, New York, Florida, Hawaii, and West Virginia. It is
expected that these consortia will lead to the first commercial fuel production
plants in 1995 to 1996. These first plants will utilize low-value waste
materials such as waste paper, rice straw, sawdust, and paper sludge. The
utilization of these materials for the production of transportation fuels will
also help solve serious waste disposal problems.
</P>
<P>Additional partnerships are being arranged with the National SoyDiesel
Development Board for the near-term commercialization of biodiesel. Biodiesel
could contribute to reducing particulate emissions from urban buses as required
under the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (CAAA). Preliminary results of tests
conducted by engine manufacturers suggest that biodiesel may significantly lower
several key exhaust emissions, especially those of problematic particulate
matter. DOE's Office of Alternative Fuels plans to conduct several biodiesel
emissions and engine testing projects with the expectation that the fuel will
meet CAAA requirements.
</P>
<P>In addition, BSP is funding a new Alternative Fuels Users Facility (AFUF)
which is considered critical for determining the commercial potential of a major
new biofuels industry in the United States. During 1994, NREL will begin
operating the multimillion dollar facility at its Golden, Colorado site. NREL
engineers and their industry partners will use the AFUF for initial scale-up and
integration of ethanol production that shows great promise in the laboratory.
Researchers and engineers from industry and academia, as well as from NREL and
other national laboratories, will be able to test promising biomass conversion
technologies at the pilot-plant scale.
</P>
<P><B><I>Mid-Term Commercialization</I></B>
</P>
<P>The mid-term focus of the BSP is to continue improving the basic technology
for the production of biofuels from wastes, as well as  begin deploying
commercially-produced dedicated energy crops for the production of alcohols,
hydrocarbons, electricity and biodiesel.
</P>
<P>It is anticipated that commercial production of fuels from energy crops will
be initiated in the late 1990s or early 2000.  Currently, a CRADA is being
arranged with Boise Cascade and ORNL to analyze the potential of using
osmotically-active compounds as a molecular selection criteria for choosing
poplars. This technique will allow Boise Cascade to select for drought tolerant
species and save considerable irrigation costs while reducing related
environmental impacts.
</P>
<P>Thermoconversion R&amp;D program activities include interacting with
potential stakeholders to determine which fuels and chemicals are of most
interest to industry.
</P>
<P><B><I>Long-Term Commercialization</I></B>
</P>
<P>The major long-term foci of the program are: the widespread use of energy
crops for the production of biofuels for bulk transportation fuel markets; the
development of aquatic microalgae, capable of rapid growth and high lipid (oil)
content for processing as a diesel fuel; and the economic production of
biomass-derived fuels and chemicals, such as hydrogen.
</P>
<P>Currently, the BSP is setting up several feedstock R&amp;D centers for the
development of a greater variety of energy crops to be able to support the
widespread use of biofuels. DOE's Office of Alternative Fuels, building on
biofuels technologies, is currently supporting research into renewable sources
of hydrogen, including steam reformation and thermochemical gasification of
biomass. Finally, the BSP program is collaborating with pharmaceutical and
biotechnology companies to develop strains of microalgae capable of fast
reproduction and high levels of lipid production.

<H2>The Major Issues</H2>
<P>As the Biofuels Systems Program's technologies mature, the program is
shifting its focus from lab-oriented R&amp;D to market-oriented research,
analysis, and technology transfer activities. As part of our strategic planning
process, we have examined some of the priorities and challenges involved in
marketing biofuels to meet their potential.
</P>
<P>In the transportation sector, passenger cars and other light duty vehicles
provide the best markets for alternative liquid fuels from biomass. In the last
several years, as a niche market for blends, the demand for biofuels has been
roughly one billion gallons. This demand is expected to increase to 4.7 billion
gallons by 1995 due to the Clean Air Act oxygenated fuel and reformulated
gasoline programs. Biofuels, in the near-term, will be used primarily as an
oxygenate for gasoline, either directly or as an ether derivative. By 2000,
biofuels could supply 100% of the oxygenate market, while providing additional
neat fuel for a growing flexible and dedicated alternative fuel fleet. By 2030,
biofuels could provide over 50% of the light duty vehicle fleet requirement,
primarily by using biofuels in dedicated systems, as opposed to an oxygenate for
gasoline.

<P>Several issues described below will affect whether biomass fuels attain
their market potential, including: 1) the economics of biofuels; 2)
environmental and availability issues regarding the resource base; and 3)
sustaining the momentum of a growing, but fledgling, biofuels industry.
</P>
<P>The BSP is addressing these concerns through a series of targeted strategic
goals (elaborated upon in the second half of this document). These revolve
around improving the program's participation with industry as well as advancing
grass roots coordination and outreach, in order to transfer biofuels technology.
BSP is also focusing on improving its internal operating modes by emphasizing
total quality management practices and tailoring its analytical processes to
more closely integrate feedstock and conversion research with end-use
requirements. In a first step of achieving better integration, the Biofuels
Systems Program is collaborating closely with its parent organization, the
Office of Transportation Technologies, in the areas of heavy duty, advanced
hybrid vehicle, and fuel cell technologies which can be fueled by all
biomass-based fuels. BSP is also working to enhance internal communications
among DOE headquarters, the laboratories, and program contractors.
</P>
<P></P>
<H3>Economics of Biofuels</H3>
<P>Using present technologies and under current market conditions,
transportation fuels from biomass are competitive with petroleum-based fuels in
only very special circumstances (tax credits, facility ad-ons for conversion,
plant site, negative value waste feedstocks, etc.). One, or a combination, of
three things must happen to make biofuels reach its market potential:
</P>
<P></P>
<UL>
<LI>Improvements in the technologies for both growing biomass and converting it
to transportation fuels;
</LI>
<LI>Price increases in petroleum-based transportation fuels; and/or
</LI>
<LI>Internalization of the true benefits from biomass fuels. The benefits that
are not currently reflected in market prices are (1) the environmental benefits,
especially those related to CO2 and (2) the benefits from reduced oil imports.
</LI></UL>
<P>Regarding technology improvements, the prospects are excellent that the
research directions presently being pursued will result in transportation fuels
from biomass at a cost competitive with petroleum-based fuels from oil at
$20-25/barrel. Although the future of world oil prices is very uncertain, most
projections point to $20-25/barrel oil very early in the 21st century. The
question of internalizing costs is a public policy matter that the Biofuels
Program cannot address, but it does seem clear that neither the global climate
change issue nor the oil-import issue are going to be addressed effectively
without explicit recognition of externalities. Studies are currently underway in
the U.S. to examine the external costs of petroleum fuel use -- pollution, trade
imbalances,  subsidies,  and  the  greenhouse effect -- to determine how they
differ from the likely costs of other transportation fuels.
</P>
<P></P>
<H3>The Resource Base</H3>
<P>As indicated in the Vision and Mission statements, the Program's aspiration
is to foster the creation of a major biofuels industry, an industry that
provides a significant fraction of the nation's transportation fuels. Although
there is not a precise quantity of fuel associated with  significant fraction, 
the intent of the Biofuels Program is to develop the technologies that can be
major contributors to achieving or exceeding EPAct requirements (Section 502) of
producing sufficient domestic replacement fuels to substitute, on an energy
equivalent basis, 10% by 2000 and 30% by 2010, of the projected consumption of
motor fuel by light duty vehicles in the U.S. This suggests an eventual
capability of producing between 224 and 727 million barrels of oil equivalent
per annum of transportation fuels. This level of refined fuels will require a
feedstock supply of between 190 and 527 million tons per year of raw biomass,
taking into account the efficiency of converting the feedstock to transportation
fuels. It should be noted that in the long-term, we expect a biofuels industry
to be capable of producing as much as 1 billion tons of raw biomass per year
which, given improved conversion efficiencies, could satisfy over half of future
light duty vehicle fuel requirements. Thus, achieving the Program's vision will
ultimately require a substantial amount of biomass energy.
</P>
<P><B><I>Waste Feedstocks</I></B>
</P>
<P>The initial step to establishing a biofuels industry will emphasize the
production of additives for conventional fuels with the production being based
on waste materials. These wastes may come from a variety of sources including
agriculture, the wood products industry, and municipal refuse. It is estimated
that economically recoverable wastes are about 375 million tons per year, with
about 156 million tons already being used -- mostly for steam and electric power
production. The remaining 219 million tons of wastes would yield nearly 259
million barrels of oil equivalent transportation fuels, if it were all available
for conversion to biofuels. Realistically, a portion of the economically
recoverable wastes will be used for steam and power production. Thus, the
ultimate production of transportation fuels from wastes will probably be no more
than approximately 172 million barrels of oil equivalent per year, or less than
9% of our present consumption rate for light duty vehicle fuels. Wastes could,
therefore, provide the feedstock for a reasonable start, but this resource could
not support a large-scale industry. Consequently, energy crops will be needed to
achieve the Program Vision of a major biofuels industry.
</P>
<P><B><I>Biofuels from Waste</I></B>
</P>
<P>The paper and organic fractions of MSW comprise over 65 percent by volume of
the waste stream. These &quot;cellulosic&quot; fractions provide an excellent
feedstock for conversion to biomass fuels. Furthermore, significant amounts of
cellulose are presently being landfilled due to the lack of demand for recycled
paper. The utilization of cellulosic waste streams would reduce the demand for
land resources needed for landfilling and their associated environmental impacts
by reducing the amount of MSW, while at the same time producing much needed
cleaner transportation fuels. Many municipalities spend anywhere from $10 to
$100 per ton in tipping fees just to dispose of MSW or collect it for recycling.
Alternatively, these waste feedstocks could be supplied to a biofuels facility
at no or negative cost to the facility.
</P>
<P><B><I>Energy Crops</I></B>
</P>
<P>The most likely land resource base for biomass production is the nation's
excess cropland. The U.S. Department of Agriculture's intermediate estimate for
excess cropland by 2030 is 129 million acres. It appears that 40 million of
these acres could provide high yields without irrigation. The remaining 89
million acres would require either irrigation or the development of crops for
dry land farming. If the Program goal of 10 dry tons per acre per year is
achieved, the 40 million acres would yield about 400 million tons per year of
primary energy. If converted to biofuels, using mid- to long-term conversion
efficiencies, this feedstock would provide between 550 and 620 million barrels
per year of oil equivalent transportation fuels.
</P>
<P>It should be noted that the excess cropland is distributed over several
growing regions of the United States. Crops must be matched to growing regions,
and this means that the crop research and development effort must include
several plant species. It also means that the actual development work must take
place over a wide geographical area corresponding to the growing regions. The
above discussion indicates that the combination of wastes and energy crops from
the nation's best excess cropland would provide between 722 and 792 million
barrels per year of oil equivalent transportation fuels, or 25% to 30% of LDV
fleet requirements in the mid-term. Going beyond this to achieve the Program
Vision will require an expansion of the land resource base beyond the 40 million
acres of relatively good land projected to be in excess of that needed for food
and fiber. Therefore, in the long-term, energy crop techniques suitable for the
drier excess cropland and for marginal lands will need to be developed.
</P>
<P></P>
<H3>Growing A New Industry</H3>
<P>The current biofuels industry involves a broad spectrum of stakeholders
ranging from the corn/grain-to-ethanol, pulp/paper, agricultural and forestry
industries, as well as oil companies. In additin to the current participants,
other stakeholders such as fermentation equipment producers, who manufacture the
needed conversion equipment for biofuels, and wholesale fuel distributors, who
will develop its accompanying infrastructure, will all play an important role.
In general, the future industry will encompass those participants who have a
technical and financial interest in the development of transportation fuels on
an industrial scale.
</P>
<P>This situation presents BSP with both a challenge in meeting the potential
needs of a wide range of stakeholders, while providing the opportunity to work
with and positively impact several industrial sectors of the nation. Currently,
BSP collaboration with industry is undertaken through the following arrangements
which include:
</P>
<P></P>
<OL>
<LI>CRADAs;
</LI>
<LI>Cost-sharing arrangements; and
</LI>
<LI>Collaborative research.
</LI></OL>
<P>In addition to these mechanisms, BSP believes that additional cross
fertilization is required between industry stakeholders and the Program as the
successful development of a biofuels industry will require a high level of
coordination and collaboration among several industrial groups, government
agencies, and public interest groups. 
</P>
<P>As a result, the Program is facilitating the joint funding of roundtable
discussions, conferences, and symposia to further industry/program communication
and coordination. This is exemplified by BSP's collaboration with the National
Biofuels Roundtable, an organization comprised of over 25 participants from
industry, government agencies, environmental, and public interest groups.
</P>
<P></P>
<HR>
<H3><A NAME="roundtable">Guiding the Development of a Sustainable Biomass
Resource: The National Biofuels Roundtable</A></H3>
<P>If large-scale development of biomass for liquid fuels or electricity
production occurs, significant shifts in agricultural land could result.
Additional pressure could be placed on forests and other natural resources,
unless managed appropriately.  Developing a biofuels industry in an
environmentally conscious manner is critical to achieving the full environmental
benefits of biomass (e.g., use of perennial energy crops to reduce erosion and
runoff, selection of crop practices to reduce anthropogenic carbon emissions
that may contribute to global climate change, and application of energy crops in
ways that minimize the fragmentation of desirable habitats).
</P>
<P>To address these concerns, the Biofuels Systems Program is working with some
of our stakeholders under the National Biofuels Roundtable, a forum looking to
mitigate any potential real or perceived negative effects as well as enhance
ecological integrity and biological diversity.
</P>
<P>The Roundtable is committed to reaching a consensus on guiding the
development of a sustainable biomass energy resource. Seven principles have been
established for developing biomass energy including the protection and
enhancement of ecological and biological diversity. This organization promises
to be a catalyst for applying good biomass practices at the local and regional
levels.
</P>
<P>SOURCE: <I>Principles and Guidelines for the Development of Biomass Energy
Systems</I>, A Report from the National Biofuels Roundtable, Draft Final Report,
May 1994.

<P>Furthermore, the Biofuels Systems Program will increase its efforts to
disseminate information on new technologies and involve additional potential
industry participants through the establishment of an effective external
communications, education, and coordination effort.

<H2>Goals, Objectives, and Strategies</H2>
<P>The BSP is positioned at a crossroads to provide the transportation sector
with the scientific and technological base leading to the use of efficient
renewable energy resources; industrial competitiveness; improved environmental
quality; and enhanced national security. Achieving this potential will be a
continuing challenge that, at the same time, will create opportunities for our
stakeholders.
</P>
<P><IMG SRC="focus.gif" ALT="Strategic Focus" ALIGN="LEFT"> Our strategic
planning efforts have resulted in a technology- and market-based roadmap that
will most effectively use our unique scientific and technological assets and
expertise to meet the needs of our industrial partners for the benefit of the
nation. This technology- and market-based strategic plan benefits from the
strengths, weaknesses, and other key factors identified in our situation
analysis, such as our need to work cooperatively with industry and improve the
internal operations of our program.
</P>
<P>The four strategic goals developed as a part of this strategic plan are
outlined below.
</P>
<P></P>
<H3>Strategic Goal #1: <I>Close the gap between technology readiness and
market opportunities.</I></H3>
<P>The BSP has a critical role to play in assisting the transportation sector's
economic competitiveness as a result of its unique lines of business, laboratory
system, and research and development capabilities. The BSP, its laboratories,
and contractors have the expertise and facilities that are essential to major
high technology transportation (and other) energy producers in reconciling their
economic and environmental requirements.
</P>
<P>To reach our strategic goal of closing the gap between technology readiness
and market opportunities, <I>we are making fundamental changes in the way we
are conducting R&amp;D in feedstock and conversion processes and are working to
increase industry-government partnerships.</I>
</P>
<P>We are linking together our feedstock and conversion programs much more
closely in an interactive mode so that industry will have the confidence that
these technologies are available to support significant commercial enterprises,
at each stage of market opportunity (e.g., use of waste resources for niche
markets in the near-term vs. energy crops for bulk fuel markets in the future).

<OL>
<LI>Quantify the availability, type, cost, location, and alternate uses of
biomass waste to identify potential business opportunities.

to large-scale deployment of biofuels.
</LI>
<LI>By 1997, increase the number of feedstock R&amp;D centers from 3 to 8 to
cover the crop production regions of the U.S., and thus, reduce the risks
inherent in the energy crop deployment required to produce the oil equivalent of
518 million barrels of biofuels.

to expand the geographic range of biofuels production capability and to develop
information on nw energy crops, as well as the limits of biomass supply,
especially for more difficult site and climate conditions.
</LI>
<LI>By 2005, establish close collaboration with the agricultural, fuels, and
vehicle industries directly involved in deploying biofuels and with the
financial sector from which investment capital will be needed.
</LI>
<LI>By 2015, demonstrate the operational readiness and economic viability of
converting the new energy crops to fuels.
</LI>
<LI>By 2020, deploy new energy crops and systems throughout industry to support
expanded biomass resource base utilization and production levels.
</LI></OL>
<P></P>
<H3>Strategic Goal #2:<I>Enhance the Biofuels Program management structure and
procedures to produce a coordinated program with well-defined metrics.</I></H3>
<P>One of the major findings from the situation analysis conducted during our
strategic planning process is the realization that the BSP has an urgent need to
enhance its program management structure, processes and procedures, as well as
its ability to measure progress. In order to attain a well-coordinated and
integrated program, internally and externally, the BSP must embrace the best
management practices to improve stakeholder satisfaction, prevent defects, and
eliminate waste.
</P>
<P>As with the rest of the DOE, the BSP must be viewed as an organization with
which its stakeholders <I>want</I> to do business. To assist in attaining this
goal, the initial step of developing and introducing Total Quality Management
(TQM) practices for the Biofuels Program is being taken in FY 1994. As the TQM
principles are refined and adapted to our specific needs, this new phase of our
management will begin to be implemented in FY 1995. Once fully implemented, we
envision a management system that will lead to continuous, cost-effective
improvement.

<LI>Define a structured, strategic management process which entails
incorporation of a strategic management charter, appointing a strategic
management team, and establishing biannual meetings.
</LI>

input through formal and informal meetings.</LI>
<LI>Implement the following four guidelines for BSP and its program
participants:
<UL>
<LI>Document the Program requirements in a management plan;
</LI>
<LI>Perform management assessments to baseline the Biofuels management program
and identify areas for improvements;
</LI>
<LI>Develop an implementation plan; and
</LI>
<LI>Measure progress.
</LI></UL></LI></OL>
<P></P>
<H3>Strategic Goal #3: <I>Adopt an integrated, systematic, and comprehensive
analytical process to guide program management.</I></H3>
<P>Investments in energy-related R&amp;D have a strong influence on economic
productivity, jobs and income, environmental quality, and national security.
Careful management and balancing of our R&amp;D portfolio is particularly
important in these days of limited funding, so that the proper pathways are
followed, while avoiding duplicity, eliminating waste, and minimizing false
starts. This &quot;balancing act&quot; requires the use of an interactive
analytical process to provide the type of objective feedback that will assist
program management and decision-making.
</P>
<P>A coordinated analytical structure is of particular importance, since the
Biofuels Systems Program encompasses and interacts with an extremely wide array
of disciplines, topics, and issues relating to conventional and alternative
fuels and modes of transportation, the environment, agriculture, fiscal policy,
legislative and regulatory mandates, financial institutions, consumer behavior,
and national security. Analyses of these issues require understanding and
integration of extensive technical, economic, scientific, and institutional
data, as well as the use of diverse and disparate methodologies, models, and
other analytical tools. The challenge to the BSP is to be able to conduct
first-class basic and applied analyses that will help the program and its
stakeholders achieve near-term goals, objectives, and strategies while meeting
their long-term needs. Furthermore, these analyses must be conducted in the
context of providing the kind of program measurement, accountability, and
responsibility expected by the public.

</LI>
<LI>During the second quarter of each fiscal year, the BSP strategic management
team will identify the analyses to be conducted, as well as review the results
or progress of previously-approved analyses.
</LI></OL>
<H3>Strategic Goal #4: <I>Establish an effective external and internal
communications, education, and coordination effort.</I></H3>
<P>The BSP has a responsibility to establish and enhance relationships with its
stakeholders, to increase knowledge about its mission and activities, and to
increase the level of feedback for effective program management. In addition,
the DOE's agency-wide transformation mandates a change in culture, emphasizing
stakeholder orientation, openness, and public trust.
</P>
<P>It is the intent of the BSP to be responsive to its stakeholders -- internal
and external -- by initiating an effective communications, education, and
coordination effort, designed to reach industry and the research community,
regulatory and legislative bodies at all government levels, educational
institutions, interest groups, and the general public. Key to this
communications goal will be the establishment of a working group to coordinate
and guide these activities.

marked difference is due to the &quot;CO<SUB>2</SUB> recycling effect&quot;

<H3><I>Role of Biofuels Systems Division</I></H3>
<P>The Biofuels Systems Division (BSD) is located within the U.S. Department of
Energy's (DOE) Office of Transportation Technologies. The BSD manages DOE's
national Biofuels Systems Program and serves as the lead technical advisor on
the development of biomass-based transportation fuel technologies. Acting in
concert with industry and other stakeholders, the Biofuels Systems Program (BSP)
is seeking to establish a major biofuels industry that can provide a significant
fraction of the nation's transportation fuels. The overall goals of the BSP are
the development and deployment of technologies for the production of
sustainable, domestic, environmentally-beneficial, and economically-viable fuels
from biomass feedstocks. Numerous projects are currently underway to assess the
potential of biofuels technologies in mitigating carbon dioxide (CO<SUB>2</SUB>)
as well as accelerate their deployment to help reduce the rate of growth of
greenhouse gas emissions. Research is being conducted in partnership with U.S.
industries and other stakeholders at two national laboratories -- the Oak Ridge
National Laboratory and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory.

<H3><I>The Greenhouse Effect and the Theory of Climate Change</I></H3>
<P>Although the terms greenhouse effect and global climate change are often
used interchangeable, they refer to two different atmospheric concepts. The
green house effect is an actual process: it is the natural phenomenon by which
Earth's atmosphere traps and holds warmth from the sun. The Earth's surface
absorbs the solar radiation that reaches it and radiates heat back into the
atmosphere. Trace gases (CO<SUB>2</SUB>, ozone, methane, oxides of nitrogen,
and others) that exist in the Earth's atmosphere absorb and bounce back much of
the planet's radiated heat before it escapes into space. Because CO<SUB>2</SUB>
exists in the atmosphere in far larger quantities than other traces gases, it is
responsible for more than half the Earth's greenhouse effect. Without this
process, the Earth's surface temperature would be about 90F (33C) cooler and
unable to support life as we know it.
</P>
<P>Global climate change refers to a theory; if the amount of CO<SUB>2</SUB>
and other trace greenhouse gases in the atmosphere are increase, more heat will
be trapped potentially causing a variety of changes to current climate patterns,
temperature, and atmospheric processes.

<BODY
BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" TEXT="#238E23" LINK="#855e42" VLINK="#5c3317" ALINK="#000000">
<P>In recent years, there has been a growing volume of literature suggesting
that human activity causes increases in the concentrations of CO<SUB>2</SUB>,
and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere which could result in climate
changes over most regions of the world (for more information, refer to the
suggested reading list on greenhouse gases at the end of this document).  While
the mere existence of the phenomenon is open to scientific debate, there is no
doubt that concentrations of greenhouse gases are rising in the atmosphere due,
in part, to emissions from carbon-based fuels.  While all fuels currently used
in the transportation sector contain various amounts of carbon, consumption of
fossil fuels such as coal, natural gas, and all petroleum products have no
mechanism for recycling the carbon.  The greater the consumption of fossil 
fuels, the greater the emissions of greenhouse gases such as CO<SUB>2</SUB>,
methane (CH<SUB>4</SUB>), nitrous oxides (N<SUB>2</SUB>0), and other gases
such as ozone (O<SUB>3</SUB>).
</P>
<P>Viewed through a &quot;greenhouse lens,&quot; the fundamental constraint on
future energy consumption is no longer predicated only on the finite nature of
fossil fuel reserves. Rather, the limit now resides with the atmosphere, the
oceans, and the terrestrial biosphere, where &quot;sinks&quot; for storing
atmospheric carbon may be rapidly filling up or being destroyed (e.g.,
deforestation).  Global CO<SUB>2</SUB>, concentrations in the atmosphere have
grown by 25 percent since preindustrial times, with half of this increase
occurring over the past three decades. 
</P>
<HR>
<P></P>
<H3>The Climate Change Puzzle</H3>
<P>The global climate change theory is widely accepted in principle. However
the validity of this theory has yet to be proven - largely because of the many,
complex variables that affect the Earth's climate. These variables comprise
numerous pieces of a puzzle. Current climate systems involve many different
factors, such as the atmospheric-land-ocean interactions, changes of solar
energy output, changes of the Earth's orbit around the sun, as well as volcanic
eruptions. Some changes occur naturally, while others are accelerated by human
actions, thus making it very difficult to isolate a particular factor to
determine the resulting impact.
</P>
<P>In addition, unlike a typical puzzle, the climate change puzzle pieces are
continually varying in size and relations to one another. Small changes in one
puzzle piece, such as temperature levels, may drastically affect the size of the
other pieces. For example, some systems of the earth's climate such as the Gulf
Stream may have threshold temperatures above which small variations may induce
irreversible changes. As a result, there is little agreement about how much
warmer or cooler the Earth's atmosphere may become, the probably impacts that
climate change could have, or how soon we might feel the effects.
</P>
<HR>
<P>While numerous models and scenarios have been created that describe global
and regional impacts of increasing greenhouse gas concentrations, ranging from
beneficial to benign to nearly apocalyptic, it may take years until scientists
are able to interpret the data from the mass of scientific evidence that can
give us clear advance warning. Climatic history shows that even small changes in
global temperature patterns can have dramatic impacts on the Earth's complex
atmosphere, ocean, land, and life systems. Thus, it seems a rational strategy to
embark on actions to prevent and anticipate related climate changes as &quot;insurance&quot;
against the possibility that CO<SUB>2 </SUB>released today will not be
completely reabsorbed for decades or even hundreds of years. As a result, many
countries, including the United States, are implementing policies and
regulations to reduce CO<SUB>2</SUB> emissions. While CO<SUB>2</SUB> is among
the least reactive of the greenhouse gases, it is the most prevalent,
responsible for almost half of the atmospheric concentration of gases. This
alone has made CO<SUB>2</SUB> the major focus of domestic and international
strategies for controlling greenhouse gases.
</P>
<HR>
<H3>Hedging Climate Change Uncertainty by Pursuing a Minimum Risk Strategy</H3>
<P><IMG ALIGN="LEFT" SRC="future.gif">Many businesses minimize risk by
planning for a number of possible alternative futures as a way to hedge risk and
allow for contingencies. For example, Future A may be considered so probable
that all decisions which are made assume that the forecast is correct. However,
if these assumptions are wrong, there may be no flexibility to meet other
outcomes. Thus, rather than solely developing a course of action for one
particular future scenario, business strategic planners prefer to tailor a
strategy that will allow adaptation to a number of possible outcomes. As shown
above, a minimum risk strategy that permits an advance to point <I>T</I>, buys
time while still keeping remaining options open.
</P>
<P>Similarly, with regard to the climate change phenomenon, approaches such as
improving fuel economy and reducing the use of fossil fuels through the
deployment of biofuels can provides us relatively quick results in terms of
emission reductions. By pursuing a strategy that reduces the rate of emissions
and buys time, climate change risk can be minimized for the U.S. and the world
until better information on the phenomenon can be established. This becomes
especially important because many scientists believe that slowing the <I>rate</I>
at which greenhouse gases are building up in the atmosphere is considered to be
more important than the total <I>magnitude</I>of the change (0ver centuries).
Humankind's and the environment's ability to adapt to climatic changes is much
greater if the changes takes place slowly, thus allowing for more time to device
methods to abort or reverse the process.

<H2>Improving Fuel Economy and Switching to Low-Carbon Emission Fuel Sources</H2>
<P>Currently over 30 percent of U.S. CO<SUB>2</SUB> emissions emanate from the
transportation sector with the growth rate of emissions being projected to be
higher than for any other sector.
<IMG SRC="co2emi.gif" ALT="CO2 emissions" ALIGN="RIGHT">
</P>
<P>While impressive fuel economy gains have been achieved over the last twenty
years, due to the establishment of corporate average fuel economy (CAFE)
standards, much of the early benefits from lower fuel consumption and related
emissions are being overtaken by increases in the number of cars and trucks and
the overall escalation in vehicle miles travelled.
</P>
<P>As a result of these trends, the central thrust of DOE's transportation
program to reduce greenhouse gas emissions revolves around enhancing the market
for more energy efficient vehicle technologies and cleaner fuels as well as
demand-side management programs. Transportation demand management efforts such
as improved public transportation help to reduce oil consumption and reduce the
environmental impacts of the transportation sector. Additional research efforts
are focused on increasing vehicle fuel efficiency and alternatives to the
intemal combustion engine. All of the above strategies will achieve reductions
in emissions of CO<SUB>2</SUB> in the transportation sector.
</P>
<P>Research is also underway to expand the supply of alternative fuels to
reduce oil consumption. Biofuels such as ethanol, methanol, and biodiesel offer
the transportation sector one of the few near zero CO<SUB>2</SUB> emissions
options available, as the biomass feedstocks themselves serve as a carbon sink.
</P>
<P>The coupling of these demand- and supply-side measures has the potential to
yield even greater reductions in greenhouse gases. For example, the use of CO<SUB>2</SUB>-mitigating
biofuels, when combined with vehicle energy efficiency improvements will afford
the needed exponential gains in lowering transportationrelated greenhouse gas
emissions. Similarly, coupling the use of biofuels (such as biodiesel and
alcohols) with public transportation measures will achieve lower emissions as
well as a reduction in vehicle miles travelled a two-fold benefit.
</P>
<HR>
<P></P>
<H3><I>DOE is integrating fuel economy and alternative fuels</I></H3>
<P>DOE's Office of Transportation Technologies (OTT) is pursuing a long-term R&amp;D
strategy that emphasizes the following elements:
</P>
<OL>
<LI>development of an advanced, lightweight, hybrid electric vehicle capable of
achieving 80 miles per gallon as the technology matures;
</LI>
<LI>accelerated commercialization of alternative vehicles and fuels such as
ethanol, methanol, biodiesel, and natural gas;
</LI>
<LI>electric car technologies, battery powered in the near term and
fuel-cell-powered in the long term.
</LI></OL>
<P>One of OTT's most promising initiatives is participating in the development
of a &quot;Super Car&quot; of the future that can attain 80 miles per gallon;
approximately three-times the fuel economy of today's models. This project is
part of an alliance between automakers, the Department of Energy, and several
other Federal agencies known as the <I> Partnership for a New Generation
Vehicle Initiative </I>. The Biofuels Systems Division is integrating its
research efforts so that biofuels can be used to energize the &quot;Super Car,&quot;
as well as other vehicle technology options.
</P>
<P>This example is just one of many ventures in which DOE is trying to marry
the benefits of clean fuels and improved vehicle technology for applications in
both the light and heavy duty sectors.

<BODY
BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" TEXT="#238E23" LINK="#855e42" VLINK="#5c3317" ALINK="#000000">
<P>Biofuels are alcohols, esters, ethers, and other chemicals made from
cellulosic biomass renewable resources such as fast growing trees, grasses,
aquatic plants (microalgae) and waste products, such as agricultural and
forestry residues. Biofuels can play an important role in helping to stabilize
greenhouse gas emissions. Through photosynthesis, the <B>biomass from which
these fuels are made captures and recycles the carbon released </B> (as CO<SUB>2</SUB>)
during combustion/ conversion. In contrast, use of fossil fuels represents a
transfer of stored carbon from geologic reserves into the atmosphere and
biosphere without a process for recycling the carbon.
</P>
<HR>
<P></P>
<H3><I>CO<SUB>2</SUB> Recycling Effect</I></H3>
<P>The ability of plants to absorb CO<SUB>2</SUB> using a process called
photosynthesis is just one of a complex set of natural processes that form the
Earth's's <I> carbon cycle </I>. This cycle circulates carbon through the
Earth's atmosphere, plants, animals, oceans, soil and rocks -- primarily in the
form of CO<SUB>2</SUB>. Carbon is the key element in the chemical structure of
plants, animals, and microorganisms.
</P>
<P>Fossil fuels were formed from prehistoric plants and animals and have
impounded carbon contained in these sources for more than 160 million years. The
consumption of fossil fuels, therefore, circumvents the cycle by releasing
carbon that had been locked away by nature without providing a mechanism to
reabsorb it. Conversely, biofuels work with the Earth's carbon cycle. Much of
the CO<SUB>2</SUB> released when biomass is converted into a biofuel and burned
in automobile engines is recaptured when new biomass is grown to produce more
biofuels.
</P>
<HR>
<P>If used in place of fossil fuels, it is clear that biofuels could reduce net
transportation CO<SUB>2</SUB> emissions. For example, researchers at the
Department of Energy's National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) recently
evaluated a hypothetical industry in the year 2010 that produced ethanol from
energy crops. CO<SUB>2</SUB> emissions were traced from the growing,
harvesting, and transport of biomass to its conversion into ethanol, its
distribution and use, to evaluate and compare its environmental impact to that
of reformulated gasoline. The results of the analysis led researchers to
conclude that ethanol manufactured from energy crops and containing 5% gasoline
denaturant <B>would generate 90% less net CO<SUB>2</SUB> emissions </B> than
reformulated gasoline. This study was a major step in trying to develop a better
understanding of the true benefits of biofuels. Although the data are not yet
compiled, the use of other biofuels such as diesel and methanol are expected to

<H3><I>Cumulative CO<SUB>2</SUB> Benefits of Ethanol Compared to RFG in 2010
(mg/mi)</I></H3>
<P>A recent NREL study concluded that use of ethanol manufactured from energy
crops and containing 5% gasoline denaturant would generate 90% less net CO<SUB>2</SUB>
emissions than reformulated gasoline (RFG). Furthermore, when secondary
emissions from the generation of electricity used in the biomass-to-ethanol
conversion process are considered, net CO<SUB>2</SUB> emissions are even less. 
<IMG ALIGN="LEFT" SRC="cumco2.gif">
</P>
<P>The value of biofuels as a transportation climate change strategy is
becoming increasingly apparent to both government and industry for a number of
reasons. Biofuels such as ethanol, methanol, and biodiesel offer great
flexibility in their usage because they can fuel almost any type of current and
future vehicle technology. A whole range of lower greenhouse gas emitting
biomass-derived products could be used to meet current and future transportation
energy needs that traditionally have been provided from petroleum resources.
Many of the biofuels options under investigation such as biomass-based ether
blending components for oxygenated and reformulated gasoline can be incorporated
into the current infrastructure with little modification.  In the near-term,
biofuels and their ether derivatives can be used as blending agents to dilute
CO2 emissions from fossil-based fuels. In the mid- and long-terms, vehicle
technology advances are expected to allow greater utilization of biofuels in
more &quot;dedicated&quot; applications (requiring some infrastructure
modifications) thereby achieving the full spectrum of greenhouse gas benefits.
</P>
<P>The technical potential for biomass energy resources to displace the demand
for petroleum and other fossil fuels demand is quite large for both the U.S. and
the rest of the world.

<P>The U.S. Department of Energy's Biofuels Systems Program (BSP) is conducting
research on numerous feedstocks, conversion processes, and fuels that could help
to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in both the near- and long-term.
</P>
<P>It has been estimated that utilization of a fraction of the U.S.'s biomass
resource base alone could supply the equivalent of 1.6 billion barrels of oil in
2030, or over 50 percent of the projected light duty vehicle energy demand.
Advances in genetic engineering hold the promise of further increasing energy
crop yields and biofuels productivity. These developments would accelerate the
displacement of oil and the reduction of transportation sector greenhouse gas
emissions in the not-too-distant future.

<H3><I>Thinking Globally, Working Nationally and Internationally</I></H3>
<P>Ten percent of the earth's cropland, pasture, and forests could provide 44
billion barrels of oil equivalent of biomass-based energy annually, over 50
percent of which is in developing countries. To fully utilize the potential of
biofuels to mitigate the release of greenhouse gases, international research and
technology deployment cooperation is important. As such, the BSP is the lead
U.S. representative of the International Energy Agency's Bioenergy Agreement,
which activity promotes the economically and environmentally sustainable
deployment of biofuels through cooperative research to reduce future worldwide
greenhouse gas emissions in developed and developing countries.

<H2><I>Biofuels Reduce CO<SUB>2</SUB> While Promoting Sustainable Economic
Growth</I></H2>
<P>Increasingly, biofuels are being valued for their unique capability to &quot;recycle
CO<SUB>2</SUB>&quot; and thus contribute to reducing greenhouse gas (GHG)
build-up. At the same time, these fuels can provide a number of other equally
important benefits to this nation through their production as a renewable,
sustainable, domestic, environmentally-beneficial fuel. The addition of biofuels
to the mix of transportation fuels will diversify the sector's dependence on
petroleum (estimated at 97 percent), while extending the nation's finite fossil
resources. Currently, half of our oil is being imported, and the expectation is
that this fraction will continue to increase in the future. In 1995 alone, the
oil trade deficit is expected to be $66 billion.
</P>
<P>Moreover, the economic benefits from biofuels are wide-ranging. Adding
biomass-based energy supplies to the resource base for transportation fuels will
stimulate domestic investment and create domestic jobs to supply the feedstock,
to convert the feedstock to fuel, and to distribute the fuel to the consumer. In
this way, sustainable economic growth is achieved for the country and investment
dollars are not sent overseas in support of a non-sustainable energy future. The
biofuels industry and its economic benefits will be distributed throughout the
country. Feedstock conversion plants would be located near the feedstock source.
The emergence of energy crops and fuel conversion facilities will provide
investment and jobs to rural America, helping to turn around the current
economic picture for many regions.
</P>
<P>In addition, advances in biofuels technologies made by U.S. companies will
enhance our international competitiveness as these technologies are exported to
an energy-hungry world and, thereby, avoid associated potential climate change
problems with other fossil-based energy options. Furthermore, a biofuels
industry will require a broad spectrum of technical support from national
priority critical technology areas such as biotechnology and environmental
technology.
</P>
<P>The development and deployment of biofuels technologies will also alleviate
many of the environmental concerns of conventional fuels. For example,
production, transportation, storage and use (usually combustion) of
petroleum-derived fuels have numerous adverse effects on the environment. The
public pays a substantial price for these impacts: e.g., increased cost for
treatment of diseases caused by air pollution, clean-up of oil spills and
leakage from underground storage tanks. Fuels such as biodiesel emit less
sulphur dioxide and particulate matter than conventional diesel fuel produced
from petroleum. In fact, the environmental benefits of producing energy crops
appear to far outweigh any potential environmental negatives. The use of energy
crops like grasses and trees can provide numerous environmental and other
aesthetic benefits such as watershed protection, increased landscape diversity,
creation of edge habitats, shelter, and food sources for wildlife, as well as
providing a possible alternative to urban sprawl through the use of energy crop
corridors.
</P>
<P>As described above, biofuels offer numerous opportunities to provide energy
security, industrial growth and jobs, new export markets, and environmental
benefits. Thus, as a greenhouse gas strategy, large-scale implementation of
biofuels is expected to increase the nation's capability to provide for economic
growth in a sustainable manner while reducing overall greenhouse gas emissions -
a win-win situation for the nation.

<TITLE>Increasing Biofuels Utilization Through Government and Industry
Cooperation</TITLE></HEAD>
<BODY
BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" TEXT="#238E23" LINK="#855e42" VLINK="#5c3317" ALINK="#000000">
<P>A number of key institutional and technological developments are already
helping to propel biofuels down the road to stabilizing greenhouse gas
emissions. Often, the progress a new technology makes in the market depends on
opportunities provided through regulatory, financial, and legislative
institutions. Governments, at the local, state and federal level, have enacted
legislation which has nurtured the fledgling biofuels industry by providing
incentives for the production and use of al ternative fuels. Recent federal
legislation and implementing regulations, such as those stemming from the Clean
Air Act Amendments and the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (EPACT) provide significant
stimuli for biofuels. Out of the 30 Titles within EPACT, 9 Titles either
directly affect biofuels or provide significant potential for increasing
biofuels related activities. Further, DOE programs, such as Clean Cities, are
working to provide the necessary infrastructure for alternative-fueled vehicles.
</P>
<P>In addition to market incentives, techno-engineering advances that improve
the performance of a new technology can open the door to energy markets. While
the U.S. government has been at the forefront of promoting the technological
advances necessary to make biofuels a viable option for the transportation
sector, American industry is becoming increasingly cognizant of the value of
biofuels. Several industrial partnerships have been formed with the Biofuels
Systems Program to develop both feedstocks and conversion technologies for
biomass-based fuels.
</P>
<P>Through the Oak Ridge National Laboratory, the BSP is setting up several
feedstock R&amp;D centers to support a greater variety of energy crops for the
widespread use of biofuels. Companies, such as Boise Cascade, are working with
the program to develop techniques to select drought tolerant feedstock poplar
species. In addition, the BSP has established an Alternative Fuel Users Facility
at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), which is considered a
critical step toward the commercialization of biofuels technologies. NREL
engineers and their industry partners will use this first-of-its-kind facility
for initial scale-up and integration of production technologies that have been
proven viable at the bench scale.
</P>
<P>Perhaps, just as importantly, the BSP is working to improve government/
industry cooperation by embarking on a series of efforts to facilitate access by
interested participants to the program's tech nologies, resources, and
facilities. In addition, a variety of mechanisms are being utilized for industry
and other stakeholders to collaborate with the Biofuels Systems Program through
cooperative research and development agreements (CRADAS) and collaborative
research. (Additional information is contained in BSP's Strategic Plan which is
cited in the publications list.)
</P>
<P></P>
<H3><I><A NAME="conclus">Conclusion</A></I></H3>
<P>Despite the potentially serious prognosis on climate change, the fact that
the U.S. and over 150 nations have agreed to stabilize greenhouse gas emissions
before there has been any demonstrated hann to people or other living things is
remarkable. Biofuels technologies offer many opportunities for reducing
greenhouse gases as well as providing numerous economic and energy security
benefits. Because vehicular emissions are a major contributor to the release of
greenhouse gases, improving fuel economy and developing inexpensive, acceptable,
low-carbon-emitting energy sources such as biofuels can enhance our global
environmental security as well as our economic standard of living and
well-being. Taking these cost-effective <I> precautionary </I> actions to slow
the rate of greenhouse gas release will allow us time to better understand the
effects of CO<SUB>2</SUB> and other greenhouse gases, while at the same time,
move us towards a more sustainable energy future.

Walker Branch Watershed is located on the U. S. Department of Energy's Oak Ridge Reservation near Oak Ridge, in Anderson County, Tennessee.  The watershed consists of two subcatchments with a total area of approximately 100 ha.  The climate is typical of the humid southern Appalachian region.  The forest soils are acidic, very cherty, infertile, and permeable.  They are formed over dolomitic bedrock, but retain little evidence of their carbonate parent material.  The forest vegetation is primarily oak-hickory with scattered pine on the ridges and mesophytic hardwoods in the valleys.<p>

The Walker Branch Watershed Project began in 1967 under sponsorship of the U. S. Atomic Energy Commission (now the U. S. Department of Energy).  Initially, the project centered primarily on the geologic and hydrologic processes that control the amounts and chemistry of water moving through the watershed.  Past projects have included:<p>

<li>U. S. Department of Energy funded studies of watershed hydrology and forest nutrient dynamics,
<li>National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration funded studies of forest micrometeorology,
<li>studies of atmospheric deposition under the National Atmospheric Deposition Program,
<li>the International Biological Program Eastern Deciduous Forest Biome Project,
<li>National Science Foundation sponsored studies of trace element cycling and stream nutrient spiraling, and
<li>Electric Power Research Institute funded studies of the effects of acidic deposition on canopy processes and soil chemistry.  
<p>
These projects have all contributed to a more complete understanding of how forest watersheds function and have provided insights into the solution of energy-related problems associated with air pollution, contaminant transport, and forest nutrient dynamics.  This is one of a few sites in the world characterized by long-term, intensive environmental studies.

<td><h4><a href="TDEAAAAA.HTM">Throughfall Displacement Experiment</a> </h4><p>
The goal of the Throughfall Displacement Experiment is to develop a mechanistic understanding of how a mid-latitude, deciduous forest responds to changes in precipitation that might result global warming.  This large-scale field experiment in an upland oak forest evaluates the impacts of below- and above-normal levels of precipitation with respect to plant, pest/pathogen, and microbial processes that drive carbon, water, and nutrient cycling budgets in forest ecosystems.</td>

<tr>
<td><h4><a href="MONITORI.HTM">Longterm Monitoring</a></h4><p>Measurements of forest meteorology, hydrologic inputs and outputs, forest biomass and species composition, and soil chemistry have been made on Walker Branch Watershed over the past 25 years.  These long-term measurements have been made to document changes in climate and atmospheric deposition and to quantify the response of the forest ecosystem to these changes.</td>

<td><h4><a href="http://www.atdd.noaa.gov/carbon.html">Continuous Monitoring of Stand-level Carbon and Water Flux </a></h4><p>Fluxes of carbon dioxide, water vapor, and energy are being made continuously above the temperate deciduous forest of Walker Branch Watershed. The eddy correlation method is being used to measure these fluxes. This technique employs a sonic anemometer, and an open-path infrared gas analyzer designed and fabricated by ATDD/NOAA personnel. These flux data are being used to validate and refine parameters of existing models of forest carbon dynamics. </td>

The EPRI Mercury Air/Surface Exchange (MASE) Project is developing and applying micrometeorological and chamber techniques plus modeling approaches for measuring Hg fluxes over soils, water, and vegetation.  </td>

<td><h3>Deposition Monitoring Network</h3>
Walker Branch Watershed is part of the National Atmospheric Deposition Program/National Trends Network deposition monitoring program.  The purpose of the network is to collect data on the chemistry of precipitation for monitoring of geographical and temporal long-term trends (see Other Relevant Links).  Wet deposition collectors have been used at Walker Branch Watershed to collect precipitation for analysis of trace metal and major ion chemistry since 1976.</td>

<td><h3>Meteorological Tower</h3>
The NOAA ATDD deciduous forest meteorological research site is located on the western border of Walker Branch Watershed an an elevation of 365 m above MSL.  Research facilities at this site include a 44-m tall stairway tower and two 33-m triangular towers that serve as head and tail spars for an instrument support system.  The instrument support system consists of eight parallel pairs of cables mounted at seven levels within and one level above the forest canopy.  This system allows measurements in planes parallel to the forest floor using a moving sensor mounted on the cable system.</td>

<td><h3>Subsurface Weirs</h3>
Facilities for the study of hydrogeochemical tranport through soils include an isolated soil pedon (2 x 2 x 3 m deep) and a subsurface weir.  The soil pedon is instrumented with soil solution samplers at nine depths.  The subsurface weir system consists of a trench (approximately 13 m long and 2.5 m deep) that intercepts flow from a 0.45 ha subcatchment.  Stainless-steel pans on the upslope face of the trench intercept subsurface hydrologic flow from the A, E, and Bt1 horizons and the Bt2 and Bt3 soil horizons.  The subsurface and surface flow is routed through a tipping-bucket rain gauge linked to a computer data acquistion system.<br>

<td><h3>Weirs</h3>
Stream gaging stations located above the confluence of the two forks (East Branch and West Branch) of Walker Branch consist of 120 degree V-notch weirs.  The 2.5 foot deep V-notch in each weir is capable of measuring maximum flows of 41.6 CFS (1.18 m/s).  A sharp-crested rectangular section above the V-notch extends the upper flow limit to 65.7 CFS (1.86 m/s) with slightly les accuracy.  Flow seldom exceeds 24 CFS (0.68 m/s) so the accuracy of normal stream flow measurements is quite high.  Automatic water samplers at each weir collect a sample proportional to stream flow.</td>

Models of global climate change predict that increasing levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere will (1) cause an increase in average global temperatures and (2) alter regional levels of precipitation.  It is also predicted that the incidence of drought will increase with a warming global climate.  Forests throughout the southeastern United States, where evapotranspiration demand is high and is predicted to increase as temperatures rise, would be particularly vulnerable to declines in annual precipitation.
<p>   
Experimental manipulation of hydrologic inputs at the TDE is accomplished by intercepting throughfall in approximately 2000 subcanopy troughs (0.3 x 5 m) suspended above the forest floor on a &quot;dry&quot; treatment plot and transferring the throughfall across a control plot for distribution onto a &quot;wet&quot; treatment plot.  Each plot is 80 x 80 m in size.  The treatments result in a 33% decrease in precipitation reaching the forest floor on the dry plot and a corresponding increase in precipitation on the wet plot.  Reductions in soil moisture on the dry plot are expected to be equivalent to the driest growing seasons of the 1980's drought which resulted in reduced tree growth of some species. 
<p>
The site was chosen because of its uniform slope, consistent soils, and a reasonably uniform distribution of vegetation.  The forest community is dominated by white oak, chestnut oak and red maple, but it contains just under 20 tree species.  The past 25 years of research on the Walker Branch Watershed provide an important reference data base against which to judge the outcomes of this large-scale field experiment.

<h3> MERCURY AIR/SURFACE EXCHANGE (MASE) OVER TERRESTRIAL AND AQUATIC
SYSTEMS</h3><br>
DEVELOPMENT OF MICROMETEOROLOGICAL AND CHAMBER METHODS
TO REASSESS CONTINENTAL BIOGENIC MERCURY EMISSIONS AND THE ROLE OF
DRY DEPOSITION<p>
<hr size=10>
<br>
<img src ="EPRIMAS2.GIF" align = right>
The industrial use of mercury in the elemental form (Hg) and the behavior of most Hg species during combustion of fuels and wastes assures that Hg is emitted to the atmosphere primarily in gaseous forms.  These gases deposit locally and also undergo long range transport and deposition to remote areas, where they readily bioaccumulate in the toxic, methylated form [<a href="HGBUDG.GIF">See figure]</a>.  <p>

The widespread occurrence of atmospheric Hg suggests that there are numerous processes leading to the airborne dispersion of Hg from the earth's surface.  The atmospheric burden of Hg is known to consist of both natural and anthropogenic sources, and previous estimates of the global Hg budget indicate that these sources are almost equally important contributors to the atmospheric Hg burden.  However, the individual sources and processes by which Hg is emitted from natural surfaces are not well understood.  Oceanic sources of Hg are thought to comprise the dominant portion of the natural Hg budget, but quantitative information concerning the role of terrestrial ecosystems is less available.  Several aspects of the Hg issue are discussed in the proceedings of a recent workshop in Canada. [<a href="http://www.cciw.ca/eman-temp/reports/publications/mercury95/main.html">Canadian Mercury Network</a>]<p>

The EPRI (Electric Power Research Institute) MASE (Mercury Air/Surface Exchange) project was initiated at Oak Ridge
National Laboratory to quantify the deposition and emission of Hg in both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems.  We and our colleagues at the NOAA ATDD [<a href="http://www.atdd.noaa.gov/">NOAA ATDD</a>] have developed and extensively tested the micrometeorological modified Bowen ratio (MBR) method which uses vertical gradients of vapor-phase Hg and reference trace gas concentrations with simultaneously measured turbulent-mixing parameters to quantify area-averaged Hg fluxes.  To facilitate these observations we developed a multiple replicate sampling system consisting of a six-port-manifold connected to six separate mass flow controllers (MFCs) to obtain highly precise quantifications of gas phase elemental mercury vapor [<a href="http://www.ic.ornl.gov/tss/esd/six-port-mfc.html">Replicate Sampling System</a>].  We have also developed and tested refluxing mist chambers to quantify the speciation of gaseous Hg, particularly reactive, water soluble compounds of divalent Hg.  This species is important because it exhibits a water solubility far greater than that of the dominant form of atmospheric Hg (i.e., metallic vapor). <p> 

We have completed successful applications of our flux methods over soils contaminated with Hg wastes and municipal sludge, background forest and agricultural soils, forest vegetation, lake waters in temperate and boreal forests, and subtropical wetlands.  In addition, we have recently completed studies using alternative flux methods:  a portable teflon dynamic flux chamber over soils and a controlled-environment laboratory chamber for plant seedlings.  Most of these studies have been published (see link below).  The work over sludge-amended soils identified the first known terrestrial emissions of methyl mercury [<a href="http://birch.cit.cornell.edu/ebp/profiles/ACprof.3.html">See also Anthony Carpi's Home Page</a>]. <p>

Our current and future work involves joint flux and speciation studies with NOAA in the Florida Everglades (funded by the South Florida Water Management District), with the University of Michigan on and near Lakes Michigan and Superior (funded by state agencies and the USEPA), with the University of Reno over western mercuriferous soils and mine tailings (funded by EPRI), with the Swedish Environmental Research Institute (IVL) over waters and soils in the Lake Gardsjon watershed in western Sweden (funded by EPRI and the Swedish EPA), with the Institute of Hydrophysics at the GKSS Laboratory in Geestacht, Germany over the Elbe River floodplain (funded by EPRI and the German BMFT), with NOAA over municipal landfill areas (pending), and with Earlham College in areas near major point sources (pending).  We are interested in forming collaborative efforts with outside researchers who are interested in developing further Hg flux and speciation studies.  <p>

2.2  Title Of Investigation:<br>
<a href="TDEAAAAA.HTM">Walker Branch Throughfall Displacement Experiment (TDE)</a><p>

3.0  DATA SUMMARY<br>
Monthly integrated or averaged values for incident photosynthetically active radiation, incident total radiation, air temperature, relative humidity, rainfall, and soil temperature at 15 cm.<p> 

4.0  PROCEDURES<br>
Measurements of incoming rainfall, irradiance (Pyranometer sensor, LiCor Inc.) and photosynthetic photon flux density (Quantum sensor, LiCor Inc.) are obtained in a nearby clearing.  These data are used to represent "above-canopy" conditions for the experimental site.  Two tipping bucket rain gauges with 3 m extension troughs attached are installed on each plot to evaluate the amount of throughfall reaching the forest floor. Sub-canopy air temperatures (2 stations per treatment plot) are made at approximately 1 m of height in a location shielded from direct solar radiation.  Soil temperatures are measured at two depths (15 and 35 cm) and 4 locations per plot.   All temperatures are measured with thermistors.  Climate data are collected as hourly means and logged on data loggers (Li-1000, LiCor Inc.) housed in instrument enclosures located at one upslope and one downslope  location per treatment plot, and one enclosure in the nearby clearing.<p>

2.2  Title Of Investigation:<br>
<a href="TDEAAAAA.HTM">Walker Branch Long-term Monitoring(TDE)</a><p>

3.0  DATA SUMMARY<br>
Annual integrated values for precipitation and runoff by catchment and for the entire watershed.<p> 

4.0  PROCEDURES<br>
At the onset of monitoring of precipitation in 1969, precipitation was measured at five locations around and within Walker Branch Watershed using Fischer and Porter model 1548 punch-tape weighing recorders.  The punch tape system operated from 1969 through 1980.  Subsequent monitoring has been conducted at only two stations with an 8 day weighing bucket strip chart recorder.  The strip charts are read on a digitizing board to a sensitivity of 0.25 mm.  Two subcatchments of the Walker Branch Watershed are monitored for streamflow with 120 degree V-notch weirs:  West Fork Catchment = 38.4 ha; East Fork Catchment = 59.1 ha.  The stream stage heights were originally monitored with Fischer and Porter model 1542 punched-tape water-level recorders.<p>

     We are conducting a large-scale manipulative field experiments in an upland oak forest on the Walker Branch Watershed in eastern Tennessee USA to identify important ecosystem responses that might result from future precipitation changes.   The manipulation of soil moisture is being implemented by a gravity-driven transfer of throughfall precipitation from one treatment plot to another.   Throughfall is intercepted in  &#137;2000 subcanopy troughs (0.3 x 5 m) suspended above the forest floor of the "dry" plots (&#137;33% of the ground area is covered) and transferred by gravity flow across an ambient plot for subsequent distribution onto the "wet" treatment plot.  Percent soil water is being monitored with time domain reflectometers at 310 sampling locations across the site.  The experimental system is able to produce statistically significant differences in soil water content in years having both extremely dry and extremely wet conditions.  Furthermore, comparisons of pre- and post-installation soil temperature measurements have documented the ability of the experimental design to produce these changes without changing the microclimate of the forest understory. <P>

<h2>Foliar Photosynthesis and Biochemistry</h2><P>
At the depth of the 1995 drought, light-saturated photosynthesis of overstory tree foliage was 55% greater and 28% lower for the wet and dry treatment plots when compared to foliage on the control plot ([<a href="OVERCER5.GIF">See figure]</a>).  A similar pattern was also apparent for the understory plants throughout the 1995 growing season (Hanson, Harter, Stringfellow, Todd).  <P>
A considerable degree of variation in drought tolerance among species has been demonstrated, with American beech, dogwood, black gum, and sugar maple least tolerant, red maple intermediate, and white oak and chestnut oak most tolerant, as determined by osmotic potential at full turgor (OFT ; a component of drought tolerance).  During the wet 1994 growing season, dogwood and chestnut oak were the only two species that displayed osmotic adjustment (lowering of OFT) to drought, having lower OFT in the dry treatment.  The capacity for osmotic adjustment was species-specific and not restricted to only species having low OFT (Tschaplinski et al.).<P>
There was no effect of canopy position on OFT  in red maple, but OFT of understory chestnut oak seedlings were higher (less drought tolerant) than that of the overstory trees, because understory trees did not display osmotic adjustment in response to drought, whereas overstory trees did.  A large fraction of the osmotic adjustment to drought in dogwood and chestnut oak trees could be accounted for by the major classes of solutes, including soluble carbohydrates, organic acids, and cations, but the relative contribution of any given class of solutes varied with time of season and species (Tschaplinski et al.).<P>

<h2>Stem and Forest Floor Respiration</h2><P>
In the dry 1995 season bole respiration of overstory oaks remained unaffected, but red maple bole respiration was significantly lower in the dry plot when compared to the ambient and wet treatments areas.  Sapling stem respiration has yet to show a response to the TDE treatments (Edwards, Hanson).<P>

The fixed percentage change in precipitation inputs implemented by the TDE (i.e., &#177;33%) has not impacted soil carbon efflux rates as much as changes in the seasonality of rainfall like those leading to the historically dry 1995 growing season (Hanson, Chambers).  <P>

<h2>Sapling Water Use</h2><P>
Red maple saplings growing in the understory showed strong seasonal patterns of whole-plant water use with differences due to treatment (wet vs. dry) being evident during a mid-summer (1995) drought.  These effects were observed across a range of sapling stem diameters suggesting that position within the understory was not a factor in regulating whole-plant water use (Wullschleger).   Comments or questions regarding sapling water use should be addressed to Stan Wullschleger<a href="mailto:w5d@ornl.gov">(w5d@ornl.gov)</a> <P>

<h2>Below Ground Responses</h2><P>
Pretreatment distribution of roots shows that the majority of root biomass in all size classes in found in the upper 30cm of the soil ([<a href="PREROOT.GIF">See figure]</a>).<P>

Minirhizotron measurements for 1994 indicated that root growth in the upper 30 cm was significantly reduced in the dry plot during most of the growing season.  Along the upper slope of the TDE site, minirhizotron data shows that most early season growth occurs by late June. White unsuberized roots make up the majority  of the observed length . From late August through the end of the growing season brown suberized roots begin to occupy more of the observed root length. In the Dry treatment brown roots occupy no less than 60% of root length from mid-August to  early-October, but no more than 45% of wet and ambient root length ([<a href="MINITRT.GIF">See figure]</a>).  Minirhizotron data of net cumulative root length in the 0-30cm soil depth was greater in the Wet treatment at all dates during the growing season than in the Ambient or Dry treatments. Following a dry period that occuried from mid-June to late-June root length production in the Ambient and Dry declined ([<a href="ROOTLGTH.GIF">See figure]</a>).  Fine root survival as observed through minirhizotrons was significantly greater in the Wet treatment compared to the rates of survival in the Ambient and Dry treatment ([<a href="ROOTSURV.GIF">See figure]</a>).<P>

After three growing seasons  the root distribution from harvested ingrowth cores shows a similar pattern to the pretreatment distribution in that the majority of root biomass is in the 0-30cm layer ([<a href="POSTROOT.GIF">See figure]</a>).  Large changes have occurred in the Ratio of <1mm/1-2mm root weights between 1993 (pretreatment) and 1995 (ingrowth). However, little within year difference exists among treatments in the 0-30 and 30-60cm depths. In the 60-90cm depth little change in the <1mm/1-2mm ratio is observed in the Wet and Ambient treatments. On the other hand the Dry treatment shows a 2-fold change in ratio, indicating a greater relative investment in <1mm roots ([<a href="ROOTRATI.GIF">See figure]</a>).<P>

<P>

<h2>Plant Growth and Survival</h2><P>
Mortality of seedlings  planted on the TDE (Acer, Liriodendron, Quercus) showed significant effects of species, treatments and topography, plus significant interactions between the main factors.  Treatment effects were particularly dramatic, with no mortality in the wet treatment and the highest mortality in the dry treatment (Huston, Holmgren).  Contact Mike Huston for additional information <a href="mailto:mhu@ornl.gov">(mhu@ornl.gov)</a> <P>

Overstory, or canopy, trees showed virtually no growth response to experimentally altered precipitation levels in either 1994 or 1995 whereas understory saplings showed reduced and increased growth on the dry and wet plots, respectively.  In 1994, <I>Cornus florida</I>  sapling growth showed the greatest response with a 27% reduction in basal area growth for dry vs. ambient plot saplings.  During 1995,  <I>Acer rubrum</I>  and <I>C. florida</I>  sapling growth showed a mean increase ( 80%) in basal area growth on the wet plot when compared with the ambient and dry plots ([<a href="SAPLGROW.GIF">See figure]</a>).  No mortality was observed during 1994, but the exceptionally dry conditions in 1995 resulted in <I>C. florida</I>  mortality of 4, 9, and 21% for the wet, ambient, and dry treatments, respectively (Hanson, Harter, Stringfellow, Todd [<a href="MORTALAA.GIF">See figure]</a>). <P>

Combined growth responses in 1994 and 1995, and the suite of physiological observations to date, support our hypotheses that the small stature vegetation of an upland oak stand will be more sensitive to changing precipitation patterns than established canopy dominant trees.  If future climate change  were to lead to reduced growing season soil water contents (resulting from either lower precipitation or elevated evapotranspiration) early forest ecosystem responses are likely to be exhibited by regenerating vegetation instead of the existing dominant overstory trees (Hanson et al.).  <br>

<h2>Stand Net Ecosystem Production</h2><P>
Observed growth data and model simulations suggest that seasonal differences in rainfall inputs will have a greater impact on plant productivity and net ecosystem production than an identical increase or decrease in each precipitation event occurring throughout the annual cycle (Hanson, Edwards, Wullschleger).  Reductions in annual NEP from reduced regional rainfall can approach 50 percent in extreme drought years ([<a href="NEP.GIF">See figure]</a>). <P>

<h2>Spatial Patterns of Armillaria Fungi Populations</h2><P>
Species in the white-rot fungal genus Armillaria vary in parasitic aggressiveness as root pathogens of trees.  Armillaria genets were mapped in the TDE plots using basidiomata and rhizomorphs collected in 1994 and 1995.  Isolates from 36 rhizomorph and 48 basidioma collections identified as A. gallica, and from 21 basidioma collections identified as A. Mellea, were further classified as 5 A. gallica genets and 18 A. Mellea genets.  Only 4 of the 105 collections were obtained from the "dry" plot.  Contact Johann Bruhn for additional information <a href="mailto:Bruhn@PSU.Missouri.edu">(Bruhn@PSU.Missouri.edu)</a> <P>

<h2>Plant-Herbivore Processes</h2><P>
Donald Shure of Emory University is conducting a NIGEC funded project to determine the possible changes in plant resource allocation to foliar N and phenolic defenses (i.e., tannins) following rainfall manipulations and quantifying the type and extent of insect herbivory from tree species experience wet, ambient or drought conditions. <P>

Early treatment results in 1993 and 1994 showed no change in plant-heribivore processes between dry, ambient and wet-treatment plots.  The absence of treatment differences in 1994 reflects the impact of an especially wet summer which prevented soil moisture reductions on the dry plot from affecting plant foliar chemistry.  Nevertheless, rainfall effects were evident when comparing our results over a three-year period (1992-1994).  Leaf N and phenolic concentrations were lower in all tree species during the much drier summer in 1993 and 1992.  Foliar N levels in oaks returned to pre-drought levels during the wet 1994 summer, although N concentrations in maple leaves remained low.  Total phenolic and hydrolyzable tannin levels were also low in 1994, whereas condensed tannin production was much higher for all species during the wet summer.  These results show consistent reductions in plant allocation to foliar nutrients and phenolic defenses during drought.  In contrast, the degree of recovery following drought varied between species and for different categories of phenolics.  Insect herbivore damage was directly correlated with rainfall totals over the three year period.  Herbivore damage on oaks was significantly reduced during the 1993 drought whereas insect feeding on oaks and maples in 1994 was elevated during the wet summer.  These findings suggest that herbivore damage at Walker Branch appears largely dependent on the response of specific insect feeding guilds to moisture-related changes in foliar N and plant phenolics. <P>

<IMG SRC="question.gif"><p>

Is exposure to toxic chemicals responsible for the observed decline in San Joaquin kit fox
abundance on the Elk Hills Navel Petroleum Reserve?<p>

<IMG SRC="findings.gif"><p>

The fur of kit foxes, native soil, and contaminated materials were analyzed. Metals in the fox
fur were, in general, not elevated relative to reference sites. Some metals that were associated
with oil development wastes (arsenic, barium, and vanadium) were elevated in the kit fox fur
on the oil field but not reference sites.<p>

Concentrations of these and other elements were not correlated with native soil
concentrations. Only arsenic achieved levels that were associated with toxicity in studies of
laboratory test species. However, these elevated concentrations occurred in only 1/200 foxes,
too few to account for the precipitous decline.<p>

Demographic analysis indicated that the decline was associated with the poor survival of
foxes in their first year. The hypothesis that the population decline was because of a
drought-related decline in habitat quality rather than toxicity has been supported by a recent
rebound in the population following wet years.<p>

<h2>Waste-to-Energy in the United States: A Social and Economic Assessment</h2>

<HR><P>

<IMG SRC="iab8-6.gif"><p>

<FONT SIZE=-1><i>WTE initiatives are shown by county size. (Source: ORNL Regional
Studies Program.)</i><p></FONT>

<IMG SRC="question.gif"><p>

Why have numerous projects to build municipal waste incinerators in the United States been
cancelled in recent years? To what extent have social and economic conditions played a role
in these cancellations? What, if anything, do these cancellations have to do with the future
viability of waste-to-energy (WTE) in the United States?<p>

<IMG SRC="findings.gif"><p>

The study included (1) a detailed socioeconomic analysis of all WTE projects during the 1982
to 1990 time frame and (2) four comprehensive case studies--two at sites where a
project was cancelled and two at sites where facilities were completed.<p>

On the basis of the aggregate socioeconomic analysis, there are marked differences between
communities that initiated a WTE project and those communities that have not yet considered
WTE. Socioeconomic differences, however, do not correlate with decisions either to proceed
with or cancel a WTE project. In addition, the study concluded that financial barriers were
not the predominant reason for WTE project cancellations, and those barriers are not likely to
be highly problematic in the coming decade.<p>

The case study portion of the study identified numerous complexities that community leaders
and decision makers must address when considering WTE. After a WTE project has been
initiated, the decision to proceed with or abandon the project appears to depend largely on the
dynamics of the decision-making process and the interactions among concerned parties.<p>

<h2>Environmental Effects of Whole-Tree Timber Harvesting</h2>

<HR><P>

<FONT SIZE=-1><i>Net hydrologic losses for nitrogen, potassium, and calcium are shown
for five years after whole-tree harvesting (WTH) and saw-log-only harvesting

<IMG SRC="question.gif"><p>

What are the effects of different intensities of forest harvest on nutrients and regrowing
forests?<p>

<IMG SRC="findings.gif"><p>

Timber harvest removes nutrients from forests in wood harvested and in soil erosion or
rainwater leaching through the soil. Most of these nutrients can be replaced by weathering
from soil minerals and from rainwater. In 11 forest stands throughout the United States,
regardless of the intensity of forest harvest, the quantity of nutrients lost from the site by soil
erosion or rainwater leaching was small compared to amounts removed in harvested wood. 
Nutrients removed in harvested wood were potentially large enough to reduce subsequent
forest growth at some sites.<p>

Landscape pattern indicators calculated on remotely sensed data of land cover have been
proposed for monitoring biotic diversity, watershed integrity, and resilency of ecosystems. 
Issues related to data type, uncertainty, and sampling are being addressed. Researchers are
seeking to identify a set of metrics that effectively characterize landscape heterogeniety at
regional scales for the nation. Effective ways to visualize pattern and change are also being
studied.<p>

Do the low-level radioactive waste disposal practices at Oak Ridge National Laboratory

<IMG SRC="findings.gif"><p>

Protection of the public from the disposal of low-level radioactive waste at ORNL was
demonstrated with reasonable assurance during active disposal operations and for the
indefinite future.<p>

Closure concepts for current waste disposal operations and the waste acceptance criteria used
in current operations do not provide sufficient protection to an inadvertent intruder for times
greater than 300 years after the closure of the facility.<p>

Groundwater protection regulations have not yet been promulgated. Protection criteria that are
likely to be promulgated would not be met with the current disposal practices.<p>

Revisions to existing waste operations and site closure plans are warranted to satisfy existing
performance objectives.<p>

<h2>Critical Loads Assessment Framework</h2>

<IMG SRC="question.gif"><p>

What is the feasibility of an effects-based (critical loads) approach to atmospheric pollutant
regulation and abatement?<p>

<IMG SRC="findings.gif"><p>

A critical load is the amount of pollutant that sensitive ecosystems can be exposed to on a
sustained basis without experiencing measurable degradation.<p>
     
Researchers proposed a six-step approach for setting critical loads: (1) selection of ecosystem
components, indicators, and characterization of the resource; (2) definition of functional
subregions; (3) characterization of deposition within each of the subregions; (4) definition of
an assessment endpoint; (5) selection and application of models; and (6) mapping of projected
ecosystem responses. This approach has much in common with ecological risk assessment.
Variability in ecosystem characteristics and data and model uncertainty were recognized as
integral parts of the assessment process. The need for intercomparison activities among data
and model options was stressed.<p>

<IMG SRC="question.gif"><p>

How will environmental resources such as forests, water, and agriculture be affected by
climate change, and what effects will these changes have on the human environment?<p>

<IMG SRC="findings.gif"><p>

State-of-the-art climate impact assessment has several serious shortcomings. Most assessments
have studied the response of individual resources to changing climate. For the most part, they
have not assessed the role of important interactions between resources. These linkages may
cause the effect of climate change on a resource to be greater or lesser than what might be
expected from an analysis of the resource considered in isolation.<p>

A comprehensive database of the environmental resources in a region is essential to an
integrated regional study, both to characterize the area's resources as they exist today and to
serve as input for modeling the response of resources to climate change.<p>

<h2>Climatic Feedback in the Global Carbon Cycle</h2>

<HR><P>

<IMG SRC="iab2-3.gif"><p>

<FONT SIZE=-1><i>Changes in global climate due to increased atmospheric
CO<sub>2</sub> will alter carbon cycle processes in land, continent margins, and oceans,
which will in turn affect the atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentration. Processes that may
have effects large enough to alter future projections of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> are
listed under their geographic region.</i><p></FONT>

<IMG SRC="question.gif"><p>

Will future CO<sub>2</sub>-induced changes in temperature and precipitation equal or
exceed the changes that have occurred over the glacial cycles of the past 160,000 years and
affect the global carbon cycle?<p>

<IMG SRC="findings.gif"><p>

Colder or wetter climate will favor the uptake of more CO<sub>2</sub> from the atmosphere
by the oceans, whereas warmer or dryer climate will decrease the uptake of CO<sub>2</sub>
by the oceans. The greatest uncertainty is how the gas exchange rate will vary with changes
in surface winds under altered climate.<p>

Periodic climate events such as the El Ni&ntilde;o / Southern Oscillation produce detectable
changes in vegetation dynamics and atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentration. The
understanding of seasonal and interannual variation in global terrestrial vegetation dynamics is
currently sketchy because of a lack of data to relate ecosystem processes to climate variation
for most major biomes.<p>

Field and laboratory experiments on tundra ecosystems that mimic the changes expected to
occur as a result of climate changes reverse the direction of CO<sub>2</sub> flux from a net
storage of 150 g CO<sub>2</sub> m<sup>-2</sup> season<sup>-1</sup> to a net release of
300-400 g CO<sub>2</sub> m<sup>-1</sup> season<sup>-1</sup>.
Annual liberation of as little as 1% per year of either the 300 Pg C stored in the top meter of
soils above the 60<sup>o</sup> latitude band or the estimated 500 Pg C in peat would
double the current rate of increase in atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>.<p>

<IMG SRC="question.gif"><p>

How could new synfuel technologies such as H-coal liquefaction affect environmental
resources?<p>

<IMG SRC="findings.gif"><p>

Researchers at Oak Ridge National Laboratory identified, evaluated, and ranked the potential
ecological hazards posed by several synfuel technologies, including H-coal liquefaction.
Research was based on (1) estimated quantities and compositions of aqueous, solid, and
gaseous waste streams; (2) contaminant concentrations calculated for air, water, and soil; and
(3) comparison of predicted exposure concentrations with toxicological and environmental
benchmarks.<p>

Aromatic amines, phenols, and cadmium were determined to be probable environmental
concerns should full-scale development of H-coal technology take place. Polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbons (PAHs), mercury, arsenic, lead, nickel, copper, zinc, iron, beryllium,
manganese, chromium, chlorine, NO<sub>x</sub>, SO<sub>2</sub>, and suspended
particulates were categorized as
possible concerns.<p>

considered to (1) comply with regulations; (2) ensure the protection of human health and the
environment; and (3) evaluate potential configurations for waste management capabilities. 
For example, at DOE's plutonium-processing Rocky Flats Plant in Colorado, environmental
assessments of alternative waste management strategies are under way. The strategies include
removing plutonium-containing residues to an off-site storage facility or retaining them
on-site. In another study, ORNL determined the impacts of transporting plutonium containing
transuranic (TRU) waste from Erwin, Tennessee, to a temporary storage location at
ORNL.<p>

In general, the environmental impacts of various alternative transport and storage strategies do
not appear to be significant. Decisions will likely be driven more by other factors such as
regulations (state and federal) and cost.<p>

How sensitive are eastern U.S. lakes and streams and brook trout populations to alternative
rates of continuing acidic deposition?<p>

<IMG SRC="findings.gif"><p>

A weight-of-evidence approach was used by Oak Ridge National Laboratory researchers in
collaboration with other scientists in the National Acid Precipitation Assessment Program to
assess the sensitivity of the chemistry and biology of  lakes and streams to hypothesized
changes in sulfate deposition over the next 50 years. The analyses focused on the projected
effects of the magnitude and timing of changes in sulfate deposition in the northeastern
United States, the Mid-Appalachian Highlands, and the Southern Blue Ridge Province.<p>

The sensitivity of  water chemistry and brook trout resources to the hypothesized changes in
deposition was found to be greatest in the Adirondacks of New York and the
Mid-Appalachian Highlands. Several chemical and biological models, field observations, and
paleolimnological findings were used to evaluate uncertainty in the projections.<p>

The findings of these studies were used as input by the administration and by Congress in the
formulation of the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments.<p>

Extensive site testing, computer modeling, and effective use of innovative technologies at
DOE's Kansas City Plant has shown that alternate concentration limits can be justified. The
conclusion is based on two factors: the effect of building drains and utility leaks on
groundwater flow and dilution by the nearby surface waters.<p>

How can an integrated assessment approach facilitate addressing questions related to global
climate change?<p>

<IMG SRC="findings.gif"><p>

Global climate change is unprecedented in scope, scale, complexity, and potential severity of
impacts. Integrated assessment has emerged as an approach to guide scientific research on
global climate change and to help formulate new and more effective policies in response to
global climate change.<p>

Integrated assessment requires the linking of information from different disciplines and
assumes the integrated impact may not equal the sum of the parts.<p>

Integrated assessment provides a basis for comparing alternative policy choices, allows policy
issues to frame the direction of scientific research and development, involves existing
scientific knowledge, accommodates new knowledge as it becomes available, and provides a
bridge between science and policy.<p>

<IMG SRC="question.gif"><p>

Can a conceptual framework for a  nonmonetary valuation  module be developed?<p>

<IMG SRC="findings.gif"><p>

The goal of this project is to develop a conceptual framework for a nonmonetary valuation for
the computerized Tracking and Analysis Framework (TAF). This framework was developed
specifically for the National Acid Precipitation Assessment Program (NAPAP), but is
applicable to other integrated assessment venues.<p>

Currently, no framework exists for organizing and analyzing data on noneconomic social and
institutional perspectives relevant to NAPAP. However, the framework is necessary because
social and institutional perspectives are critical elements in determining both categories of
policy-relevant consequences and net societal benefits resulting from implementation of the
1990 Clean Air Act Amendments.<p>

The project is under way. Its outcomes are expected to include the following: (1)
identification of potential future data sources; (2) characterization of data needs, in part to
influence the direction of future research; and (3) a frame-work that can accommodate diverse
sets of information (currently based on extant data) and that will help satisfy the NAPAP
mandate.<p>

<IMG SRC="question.gif"><p>

How can the National Science Foundation implement environmental protection measures for
U.S. Antarctic Program (USAP) facilities and operations?<p>

<IMG SRC="findings.gif"><p>

A programmatic environmental impact statement was prepared that evaluated four alternatives
for implementing environmental protection measures for the USAP. These measures ranged
from continuing USAP activities at the 1989-90 level of environmental protection to making
environmental protection and the health and safety of personnel the overriding considerations
for all USAP activities.<p>

The assessment found that the alternative of completing ongoing safety, environment, and
health initiatives and streamlining the USAP by reducing the number of support personnel
would accomplish the objectives of reducing the amounts of materials brought to Antarctica
and the wastes generated at USAP facilities. This alternative would result in less impact on
land and water resources. Long-term reductions in station personnel would also reduce the
impacts of air emissions and wastewater discharges in comparison to other alternatives
considered.<p>

<h2>Plastics Recycling: Economic, Social, and Institutional Issues</h2>

<HR><P>

<IMG SRC="iab8-7.gif"><p>

<FONT SIZE=-1><i>A projection of post-consumer plastic waste is shown for different
sectors in the year 2000.</i><p></FONT>

<IMG SRC="question.gif"><p>

The United States currently recycles about 2% of its post-consumer plastic waste. To what
extent can this percentage be increased by overcoming selected technical, economic, social,
and institutional obstacles? What is the economic viability of plastics recycling as compared
to other forms of waste management?<p>

<IMG SRC="findings.gif"><p>

Oak Ridge National Laboratory has completed numerous studies in the area of plastics
recycling during the past decade. Study results suggest that as much as 14% of all
post-consumer plastics could be recycled if efforts are targeted at overcoming obstacles to
recycling clean, single-resin waste streams. As much as 55% could be recycled if
economically viable methods can be developed to collect and process waste streams that
contain at least 50% thermoplastic materials.<p>

Given current technology, social, and institutional constraints, the economic viability of
recycling plastic waste is questionable. In many areas of the country, recycling can cost as
much as $200 per ton as compared to about $40 per ton for landfill or incineration. Some
have argued for additional recycling on the basis of reducing environmental externalities. It is
not clear, however, that the externalities associated with recycling are significantly less than
with other approaches to waste management.<p>

<IMG SRC="question.gif"><p>

Is it feasible to make broad, continental scale assessments of climate change?<p>

<IMG SRC="findings.gif"><p>

In assessing the impact of a supersonic transport fleet, predicted climate changes were
imposed on five models representing the major ecosystem types across the continent.<p>

The simulation models predicted that primary production will increase linearly with
temperature increase over the range tested, except in extreme deserts where the effect is
reversed. As temperature increases, water stress also increases and accounts for the decreased
desert productivity.<p>

<h2>Recent Trends in Automobile Recycling: Economic, Social, and Energy Issues</h2>

<HR><P>

<IMG SRC="iab8-8.gif"><p>

<FONT SIZE=-1><i>Life cycle energy impacts of various recycling scenarios for the model
year 2000 vehicle.</i><p></FONT>

<IMG SRC="question.gif"><p>

To what extent will (1) current trends toward the greater use of nonmetallic materials in
automobiles and (2) the development of new recycle technologies impact the economic
viability of automobile recycling in the United States?<p>

<IMG SRC="findings.gif"><p>

The study (1) examined automobile recycling in Europe and Japan to document social and
economic "lessons learned," (2) estimated the energy systems impacts of the recycling status
quo and probable energy impacts of alternative technical and institutional approaches to
recycling, and (3) identified major policy issues that will be key to the future economic
viability of automobile shredder facilities in the United States.

The study estimated that during the coming decade the quantity of energy used in the
manufacture of automobiles will increase (because of the increased use of plastics and
aluminum); the energy consumed during the life of the automobile will decrease (in response
to new technologies and lightweight materials); and, somewhat surprisingly, the energy
savings from the recycling of automobiles will increase (primarily because of the increased
recycling of aluminum). 

The adoption of new recycling technologies and approaches (e.g., thermoplastic recycling and
incineration of automobile shredder residue) will have little impact on energy savings at the
recycle step. <p>

<h2>Reducing Greenhouse Gas Emissions in China</h2>

<HR><P>

<FONT SIZE=-1><i>Primary energy output and carbon emissions for
China.</i><p></FONT>

<IMG SRC="question.gif"><p>

What are the institutional, legal, and cultural constraints and opportunities to reduce
green-house gas emissions in China?<p>

<IMG SRC="findings.gif"><p>

China accounts for about 7% of all world greenhouse gas emissions and is the fourth largest
country source behind the United States, the former Soviet Union, and Brazil. About
three-fourths of China's carbon emissions are from the production and conversion of coal.
China is willing to cooperate in reducing coal use because it is the major source of air
pollution and acid rain. Any agreements on limiting the use of coal directly benefit China in
terms of reduced acid rain and improved public health.<p>

However, the reality is that China will continue to develop and consume coal as its primary
source of energy well into the next century.  There are simply no other choices given its
desire to expand its economy, its need to get power projects online, and its comparative
advantage in coal production.  China's participation in an international global warming treaty
will only come if the industrialized countries take responsibility for the problem and
demonstrate a desire to share the economic burdens of industrial and energy sector reductions
equitably through resource transfers.<p>

<h2>Supply of Short Rotation Woody Crop Biomass to the Watts Bar Power Facility</h2>

<HR><P>

<IMG SRC="iab5-7.gif"><p>

<FONT SIZE=-1><i>Watts Bar cost supply curves show the effect of commodity
programs.</i><p></FONT>

<IMG SRC="question.gif"><p>

What might be a good case study model to evaluate the potential of short rotation woody
crops as a fuel source in the Watts Bar facility location in eastern Tennessee? What are
restrictions on resources surrounding the plant as defined in terms of supply, price,
transportation costs, and land availability? Are there important environmental impacts because
of land conversion in this area?<p>

<IMG SRC="findings.gif"><p>

A regional linear programming model was developed for this study that includes the variables
in the questions above. The model incorporates current agricultural possibilities in the region
along with the proposed short rotation woody crop production. Environmental issues including
erosion, chemical usage, and potential leaching are also incorporated within the modeling
framework.<p>

Output from the model provides information on where and what types of land should move
from current agricultural land use to biomass production.<p>

Further analysis was conducted by comparing scenarios with a 300,000-ton per year biomass
constraint production requirement. The analysis demonstrates a methodology that has the
potential of addressing regional or local concerns with respect to biomass supply. It
demonstrates the potential in supplying power conversion facilities of alternative sizes. The
methodology can provide environmental impacts of the changes likely to occur to the
landscape surrounding the facility.<p>

<h2>Renewable Biomass Energy: Understanding Regional Scale Environmental Impacts</h2>

<HR><P>

<IMG SRC="iab5-6.gif"><p>

<FONT SIZE=-1><i>Relative shifts in evapotranspiration, erosion, nitrate in runoff, and
phosphorous fertilizer applications are shown with increasing acreage in switchgrass
production. Each line represents a single subregion.</i><p></FONT>

<IMG SRC="question.gif"><p>

What are the environmental implications of converting millions of acres of farmland to
production of biomass energy? What kinds of models will be most useful in predicting
environmental changes induced by energy crop production?<p>

<IMG SRC="findings.gif"><p>

Probable environmental effects of growing energy crops are examined at a regional scale. The
approach takes into account both economic and environmental factors. The approach is to
analyze, at a county level, the probable impact of  switchgrass production on erosion,
evapotranspiration, nitrate in runoff, and phosphorous fertilizer in two multi-county subregions
within the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) service region.<p>

Results show that the adoption of switchgrass production will have different impacts in each
subregion as a result of difference in the initial land use and soil conditions in the subregions.
Erosion, evapotranspiration, and nitrate in runoff are projected to decrease in both subregions
as switchgrass displaces the current crops. Phosphorous fertilizer applications are likely to
increase in one subregion and decrease in the other because of initial differences in the types
of conventional crops grown in each subregion. Overall, these changes portend an
improvement in water quality in the subregions with the increasing adoption of
switchgrass.<p>

<FONT SIZE=-1><i>Environmental laws and regulations provide interpretations of the term
"adverse ecological effects."</i><p></FONT>

<IMG SRC="question.gif"><p>

What precedents exist in environmental laws and regulations for determining that an adverse
ecological effect has occurred?<p>

<IMG SRC="findings.gif"><p>

To meet assessment mandates of the Clean Air Act Amendments, the National Acid
Precipitation Assessment Program (NAPAP) draws upon more than a decade of research on
the potential terrestrial and aquatic effects of acid deposition. One mandate is to assess and
report to Congress on the relationship between reductions in acid deposition and the
prevention of adverse ecological effects.<p>

Effective reporting of NAPAP's findings will depend on a clear explanation and definition of
"adverse ecological effects." Several interpretations of the term were found in existing
environmental case law, legislation, and regulatory programs. Each interpretation provides a
context and factors for assessment. Consideration of these contexts and factors is a starting
point for NAPAP's interagency communications and reporting on the adverse ecological
effects question.<p>

What impacts are expected from the transport and storage of radioactive and hazardous waste
generated and stored at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL)?<p>

<IMG SRC="findings.gif"><p>

Integrated assessments for various waste storage activities at ORNL evaluated the impacts of
transport and storage on the following: environment (air, water, ecology), health, safety,
archaeology/cultural resources, and socioeconomics.<p>

Depending on the site location and waste form, each resource may be affected to a different
degree. In general, the integrated assessments found the greatest impacts to be related to
occupational exposures to radiation. However, impacts on human health from exposures
occurring during normal operations (e.g., transport of waste) or accident situations were not
deemed significant.<p>

<h2>Individual-Based Fish Population Model Applied to Management Issues</h2>

<FONT SIZE=-1><i>This schematic diagram shows the inputs influencing the processes and
life stages represented in the individual-based model for young smallmouth bass and the
source of losses from each of these life stages due to natural causes and
fishing.</i><p></FONT>

<IMG SRC="question.gif"><p>

How can models be developed to enhance decision making in fish population
management?<p>

<IMG SRC="findings.gif"><p>

The individual-based population model for smallmouth bass is part of Oak Ridge National
Laboratory's Program on Compensatory Mechanisms in Fish Populations.<p>

The model, tested on 10 lakes in Ontario, Canada, showed that by varying the opening date of
the fishing season, it is possible to explore the results of increasing and decreasing the degree
of overlap between the spawning and nest-guarding period and the exploitation of guarding
male smallmouth bass by fishing.<p>

The degree of overlap will influence the survival and subsequent growth of guarding males
and the young-of-year, possibly in a density-dependent or compensatory manner.<p>

<h2>Biomass Energy Crop Displacement of Fossil Fuels</h2>

<FONT SIZE=-1><i>Wood chips stacked outside the Burlington Electrical Department in
Burlington, Vermont, illustrate the use of biomass energy crops in generating
electricity.</i><p></FONT>

<IMG SRC="question.gif"><p>

Is the potential for biomass energy crop displacement of fossil fuels large enough to
significantly contribute to the mitigation of CO<sub>2</sub> buildup in the United
States?<p>

<IMG SRC="findings.gif"><p>

Estimates of the land base available for biomass energy crops range greatly depending on
assumptions about crop types, genetic improvements, agricultural policy, and food production
needs.<p>

Even a low land availability such as 35 million acres could result in mitigating about 6% of
the fossil carbon emitted in the United States.<p>

Generation of electricity from energy crops will mitigate more carbon than will production of
liquid fuels.<p>

<FONT SIZE=-1><i>A representative sketch of the main menu is shown here of an early
prototype of EMIS.</i><p></FONT>

<IMG SRC="question.gif"><p>

How is the vast amount of data potentially relevant in an emergency maintained and relevant
portions quickly retrieved when needed?<p>

<IMG SRC="findings.gif"><p>

EMIS, or the Emergency Management Information System, is a prototype of a user-friendly
client-server information system designed to support emergency decision making and response
to a chemical weapons accident.<p>

At the core of the system is an Oracle database running on a Sun SPARCserver. Client
workstations such as Apple Macintosh Quadras are connected to the server via Ethernet. The
system supports many planning and response functions, including data acquisition from
instruments such as met towers, team assignment, monitoring of workers in protective
clothing, as well as generation of notifications and media releases from pre-stored editable
boilerplate components. EMIS features integrated electronic mail and an interface to high
speed fax modems.<p>

Geographical information needs are supported by a customized version of MicroGIS running
under Microstation. A version of the Army's D2 atmospheric dispersion model also is
integrated. Much of the user friendly front end of EMIS was developed in Oracle Card.<p>

Although EMIS is currently a prototype for chemical weapons accidents, it was designed for
portability and adaptability to other types of hazards management and response. Major design
goals were: ease of use, high responsiveness, low potential for operator error, forgivingness,
minimal training requirements, and low life-cycle maintenance costs.<p>

<IMG SRC="question.gif"><p>

Can clean coal technologies make a difference by providing energy using coal, the United
States' most abundant fuel, in an environmentally superior manner?<p>

<IMG SRC="findings.gif"><p>

Congress has appropriated nearly $2.5 billion and combined it with about $4.5 billion
provided by the private sector for 46 demonstration projects in the Clean Coal Technology
(CCT) Program. The goal of the CCT Program is to demonstrate advanced coal utilization
technologies that are more energy-efficient and reliable and achieve substantial reductions in
emissions compared with existing coal technologies. The program takes the most promising
technologies and moves them into the commercial marketplace through demonstration
projects.<p>

Analyses prepared for a Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement for the CCT Program
found that widespread implementation of clean coal technologies by the year 2010 could lead
to significant reductions in emissions of sulfur dioxide and oxides of nitrogen when compared
to a no-action alternative, which assumed that conventional coal-fired technologies with
conventional pollution controls would continue to be used.<p>

<FONT SIZE=-1><i>An integrated biomass energy system shows the complex evaluation and

<IMG SRC="question.gif"><p>

What are the evaluation and implementation issues associated with integrated biomass
production and conversion systems as a greenhouse gas mitigation option?<p>

<IMG SRC="findings.gif"><p>

Biomass power systems are a potentially important option not only for satisfying power needs
in both industrialized and developing countries, but also for their global and local
environmental benefits. Biomass power systems can reduce the rate of CO<sub>2</sub>
buildup in the
atmosphere by sequestering carbon and by substituting for fossil fuels. When feedstocks are
grown renewably, biomass contributes no net buildup of atmospheric carbon. Locally, biomass
plantations can reduce demands on existing forests, lessen soil erosion, provide a means to
restore degraded lands, and when combusted offset emissions and local impacts from
fossil-fired power generation (e.g., SO<sub>2</sub> and NO<sub>x</sub>).<p>

The evaluation and implementation of integrated biomass systems are exceedingly complex.
Many of the outputs require the use of specialized valuation procedures. However, the
procedures for quantifying and valuing plantation benefits are at best difficult, and data are
usually lacking. Oak Ridge National Laboratory is currently involved in a project in
Southwest China to value nonpower benefits and to aid in the imple-mentation of actual
projects.<p>

<IMG SRC="question.gif"><p>

How can one measure the economic losses associated with sources of environmental
degradation, when the degradation is caused by multiple sources?  What are the policy
implications of multiple sources of degradation?<p>

<IMG SRC="findings.gif"><p>

This study examines two sources of environmental degradation in the New York striped bass
fishery. The first is the decline in environmental quality in Chesapeake Bay. The second is
the PCB contamination of striped bass from the Hudson River. Both places are primary
spawning grounds for striped bass in New York waters.<p>

The results of the study show that the two fisheries (Hudson and Chesapeake) cannot be
managed independently. For example, the study shows that the loss in value associated with
the general deterioration of the Chesapeake-based striped bass population was $2.3M to
$7.7M. However, a management policy that augmented Chesapeake populations without
addressing the Hudson contamination problem would not recover the full amount. A
continued consumption ban would prevent the realization of these benefits.<p>

The study also shows that the losses associated with the Hudson contamination and associated
ban would total $0.745M to $3.7M. However, cleaning up the Hudson River would not
guarantee the realization of these benefits, as depressed Chesapeake populations may
necessitate management actions that restrict catch through quantity and size limits.<p>

<h2>Potential Vulnerability of Renewable Energy Systems to Climate Change</h2>

<HR><P>

<IMG SRC="iab5-2.gif"><p>

<FONT SIZE=-1><i>Climate change could potentially affect the magnitude of the resource
available (increased cloudiness could affect the use of solar collectors such as this one in
Amman, Jordan) as well as the feasibility of using the resource (changes in predominant wind
directions could affect these wind energy systems in Southpoint, Hawaii, because of their
fixed orientation).</i><p></FONT>

<IMG SRC="question.gif"><p>

In what ways might climate change affect renewable energy systems? Do any of these types
of changes look important enough to warrant additional analysis?<p>

<IMG SRC="findings.gif"><p>

Climate change can affect the renewable energy resource itself, the equipment used to capture
it, or the value that society places on energy yields relative to other uses of renewable
resources. A review of technology descriptions and operating experience revealed that climate
change could reduce or in some cases increase energy yields from equipment installed before
the change. Estimating the magnitude and type of change for each renewable energy system
would require examining specific climate change scenarios.<p>

An integrated assessment of atmospheric, ecological health, economic, and socioeconomic
impacts addressed four alternatives and focused on impacts from ozone depletion and global
warming.<p>

The assessment found that minimizing leaks of CFC-114 was environmentally preferred over
adding PFCs into the cooling systems. Considering economics to a limited extent, the
preferred alternative was to take no action regarding coolant replacement in the interim period
while continuing to investigate more environmentally friendly substitutes. Only one alternative
for introducing PFCs into the system was determined to cause significant global impacts.<p>

<h2>Theory of Ecological Risk Assessment</h2>

<HR><P>

<IMG SRC="iab6-2.gif"><p>

<FONT SIZE=-1><i>Paradigm for ecological risk assessment.</i><p></FONT>

<IMG SRC="question.gif"><p>

What is an appropriate theory of ecological risk assessment and how should ecological risk
assessments be performed in practice?<p>

<IMG SRC="findings.gif"><p>

Ecological risk assessment is a new field that arose in the 1980s. Regulators needed
something equivalent to human health risk assessments for use in making environmental
decisions. The staff of the Environmental Sciences Division of Oak Ridge National
Laboratory worked through the 1980s to develop an appropriate theory of ecological risk.<p>

The ecological risk paradigm developed is based on the paradigm for human health risk
assessment but incorporates the greater complexity of ecological systems. In particular it
recognizes that ecological risk assessments must identify endpoints from among the array of
properties of various populations, communities, and ecosystems. It recognizes that the scale
and structure of the receiving environment are critical to assessment of ecological risks. It
also recognizes the ecological risks are likely to involve indirect effects and changes in
habitats as well as the direct toxic effects.<p>

An anthropological study of Aleut Indian culture was integrated with an ecosystem model to
assess impacts on the marine versus upland ecosystems.<p>

The study analyzed the relative sensitivity of the Aleut culture to the marine and terrestrial
environments and found four orders of magnitude greater sensitivity to changes in the marine
system. This dependence on the marine system is justified by the relative stability of the
ocean ecosystem and its insensitivity to environmental changes.<p>

How much progress has been made in understanding the global carbon cycle over the past 15

The most important recent developments are (1) information on the contribution of land
clearing to atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> levels, (2) long-term records of atmospheric
CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations
obtained from ice cores, and (3) much-improved estimates of how much carbon is stored in
and exchanged among oceanic, atmospheric, and terrestrial reservoirs.<p>

Research has uncovered more complexity than was previously appreciated. Researchers are
unable to balance all the fluxes of the global carbon cycle over the period 1800 to the
present, and different mathematical models give results that are difficult to reconcile.<p>

A new global systems approach shows promise in solving current difficulties.<p>

<IMG SRC="question.gif"><p>

What is environmental assessment?<p>

<IMG SRC="findings.gif"><p>

Environmental impact assessment (EIA) is a process for evaluating the environmental and
social consequences of proposed activities. The goals of EIA are the prediction of impacts,
better decision making, and the minimization of adverse impacts to the environment.<p>

Staff at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory prepared a source-book on the EIA process for
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. The major activities that are required for
successful EIA include: initiation, scoping, assessment, decision making, and post-decision
analysis.  Each of these activities is described in terms of needs, tools, issues, linkages, and
references.<p>

The source book is designed for reviewers and preparers of environmental documents and as
a training guide for government agencies and nongovernmental organizations in both
developed and developing countries.<p>

<IMG SRC="question.gif"><p>

What are the potential ecological consequences of global climate change on the structure of
aquatic predator populations?<p>

<IMG SRC="findings.gif"><p>

Annual variations in climatic conditions can regulate the abundance and size structure of top
predator populations by directly affecting the primary forage of the predator.<p>

If winters should become less severe as a result of global warming, the growing season for
many aquatic species will be extended; some species could extend their northern range, which
would result in interferences within established food webs.<p>

Predicted extremes in temperature fluctuations could result in range expansions of
cold-sensitive species in warmer years followed by their drastic decline in colder years.<p>

<h2>Integrated Databases for Integrated Assessment</h2>

<HR><P>

<FONT SIZE=-1><i>Abrupt environmental discontinuities along political boundaries often
indicate differences in data reporting; these must be reconciled to construct regional databases
used in integrated assessment. The figure above illustrates the collection of data about wheat
production in a four-state area.</i><p></FONT>

<IMG SRC="question.gif"><p>

How available are the multisectoral, regional-scale databases that are needed to conduct
integrated assessments?<p>

<IMG SRC="findings.gif"><p>

Integrated assessment often requires analysis across large spatial and temporal scales.
Anomalies or discrepancies often appear when integrated databases are being constructed to
support these analyses. These discrepancies may result from differences (often undocumented)
in measurement or reporting techniques, units, or data management practices.<p>

For example, obvious discrepancies are often seen as discontinuities in environmental
variables along political boundaries. More troublesome, because they are less obvious, are
changes in reporting techniques, units, or data management practices over time that may
mask, or give false indications of, change. Even the simple confusion between data indicating
"zero" versus "no data" can be difficult, time-consuming, and expensive to correct. In many
cases, agencies providing the individual data sets are unable to answer questions concerning
relevant data gathering and management practices.<p>

It is important that compilation, quality assurance, and documentation of integrated databases
be given a high priority in integrated assessment activities.<p>

<IMG SRC="question.gif"><p>

How should the Department of Energy (DOE) make decisions about the level to which
contaminated parcels of land should be cleaned up? More specifically, what social and
economic elements should be integrated into a quantitative decision-support tool that helps
DOE make those decisions?<p>

<IMG SRC="findings.gif"><p>

The goals of such a decision support tool must be made explicit (e.g., select the optimal land
use, the most cost-effective combination of land use and remediation, or narrow the range of
possible options to those that may be viable).<p>

Achieving public acceptance of the decision process and its outcomes should be an
over-arching goal. Public and stake-holder preferences for different decision processes,
components, and outcomes should be components of the decision support tool.<p>

<FONT SIZE=-1><i>This scheme is used for technology assessment.</i><p></FONT>

<IMG SRC="question.gif"><p>

What impacts are expected from large-scale conversion of coal to gas, liquid, or other solid
forms for cleaner and more efficient use?<p>

<IMG SRC="findings.gif"><p>

Historically, interest in converting coal to other fuel forms has been marked by cyclical
periods of activity and inactivity depending largely on oil and gas prices. Recent federally
funded programs to promote commercial deployment of advanced coal use technologies
include DOE's Coal Conversion Demonstration Program, the U.S. Synthetic Fuels
Corporation, and currently, DOE's Clean Coal Technology Program.<p>

Each program has conducted various types of environmental assessments. Because
environmental acceptability is a major consideration in developing these technologies, it is not
surprising that these assessments generally found no significant impacts. However, certain
issues unique to coal conversion, such as the presence of carcinogenic materials in
coal-derived liquids, are deserving of particular attention in designing processes and
mitigation measures.<p>

<FONT SIZE=-1><i>An environmental assessment shows the potentially meaningful exposure
pathways to individuals from a nuclear power plant accident.</i><p></FONT>

<IMG SRC="question.gif"><p>

What impacts are expected from the operation of large-scale nuclear power plants for
extended periods of up to 60 years? <p>

<IMG SRC="findings.gif"><p>

The United States now depends on nuclear power for about 20% of its electrical generating
capacity. Most of the 100-plus reactors currently operating were built in the 1960s and 1970s
and have now been operating for more than 20 years. A number of issues were raised during
the early environmental reviews required for construction permits and operating licenses for
these plants. The dominant concern was radiological impact. In general, with reasonable
mitigation, impacts were found to be acceptable.<p>

Because original operating licenses were limited to 40 years, utilities have expressed an
interest in extending the life of many of these plants for periods up to 20 years. New
environmental and safety issues related to relicensing have been raised and are being
addressed by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission in a generic environmental impact
statement (GEIS). These issues include aging of the reactors, radioactive waste management,
and institutional concerns. Some of these issues are being addressed in the GEIS itself but
others are site-specific and will be addressed at the time of relicensing applications.<p>

<IMG SRC="question.gif"><p>

How can the self-regulating capabilities of fish populations be more effectively incorporated
in assessments of the impacts of energy technologies on aquatic ecosystems?<p>

<IMG SRC="findings.gif"><p>

Individual-based simulation modeling is a powerful tool for mechanistically exploring the
potential for a fish population to compensate for environmental disturbances that increase
mortality risk, decrease growth, and/or decrease reproduction.<p>

As an example, life-history theory and results from individual-based models support the
hypothesis that Age 0 smallmouth bass are likely to demonstrate a greater compensatory
change in growth and mortality than Age 0 striped bass in response to environmental
disturbances.<p>

Some of the models from these studies have been used in regulatory proceedings to
demonstrate that additional fish-protection measures may not be needed at specific power
plants.<p>

<IMG SRC="findings.gif"><p>

The effects of legislative mandates for economic incentives and environmental constraints on
potential hydropower energy projects requiring new dams or diversions were evaluated.
Available regional information on fish, wildlife, and recreation was used to screen effects
under several alternative scenarios.<p>
     
Economic analysis showed that legislative benefits would indeed provide economic incentives
that would increase the amount of development.  Environmental analysis suggested that
providing full benefits without environmental constraints could permit potentially severe
impacts to important and limited resources to occur. Providing benefits while maintaining
legislated environmental constraints would allow moderate development and avoid the most
serious environmental effects.<p>

<h2>Potential Supply and Cost of Biomass from Energy Crops in the TVA Region</h2>

<HR><P>

<FONT SIZE=-1><i>TVA region-wide supply curves for SRWC wood feedstock in units of
energy (MBtu) and assuming current yield and 25% increased yield.</i><p></FONT>

<IMG SRC="question.gif"><p>

Is the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) land base capable of supplying sufficient biomass
from energy crops? Would the price of this biomass be sufficient to provide a viable
alternative to coal at existing TVA coal-fired power plants?<p>

<IMG SRC="findings.gif"><p>

The study included a 276-county region that included all the TVA service region. The model
of energy crop price and supply used in this analysis is based on the assumption that
farmer-producers would convert their agricultural land to biomass production when the profit
received from producing biomass would meet or exceed their current profit margins received
from producing conventional agricultural crops or using their land for pasture.<p>

From this break-even analysis, two biomass supply curves for switchgrass (an herbaceous
energy crop) and short rotation woody crops (SRWC) were produced. These curves showed
the price that farmers would need to receive for different levels of produced energy crops.
County-level maps showed the spatial distribution of quantities of potential energy crops and
their prices.<p>

Results showed that current land use patterns, soil quality differences, agricultural and energy
crop production costs, and soil-specific yields strongly influenced potential energy crop
production distribution, quantities, and prices in this area. Agricultural land in the TVA region
could potentially supply 18 gigawatts if wood was the sole fuel and 30 gigawatts if
switchgrass was the sole fuel. A farmgate price of $40 to $50 per ton of wood or $35 to $45
per ton for switchgrass would be needed to ensure landowners of profits commensurate with
current land use.<p>

Can bioindicators be used to successfully evaluate the effects of environmental stressors such
as contaminants on aquatic ecosystem health?<p>

<IMG SRC="findings.gif"><p>

Bioindicators have been applied in a variety of aquatic systems (streams, reservoirs, rivers,
estuaries) in the eastern United States to assess the nature and extent of environmental
degradation. Applications of bioindicators in some systems have proven to be not only
reliable indicators of ecosystem health but also potential sentinels of human health.<p>

Bioindicators have also been successfully used to evaluate the effectiveness of remedial
actions and to determine if industry is complying with environmental regulations.<p>

<h2>Policy Relevance in the Acid Deposition  Tracking and Analysis Framework</h2>

<IMG SRC="iab4-9.gif"><p>

<FONT SIZE=-1><i>The TAF can be used as a tool to aid decision makers'
analyses.</i><p></FONT>

<IMG SRC="question.gif"><p>

How can the Tracking and Analysis Framework (TAF) meet decision makers' needs?<p>

<IMG SRC="findings.gif"><p>

TAF is a tool to aid decision makers' analyses of the dynamics, effects, and social and
economic consequences of acid deposition. Integrated assessment using TAF is therefore
driven by environmental policy issues, concerns, and decisions that span a wide range of
organizational and individual stakeholders.<p>

To ensure that TAF supports priority policy concerns that are timely and appropriately
addressed by a reduced-form model, "integrating" mechanisms are proposed.<p>

These mechanisms include the identification of stakeholders and their priority issues;
consideration of TAF's capabilities as compared to the context, scope, and timing of the
stakeholder issue; and a framework for dialogue between decision makers and the modeling
community.<p>

<H3>Actions Completed During the Week</H3>
<P><B>WESMIN Receives Grant from McKnight Foundations</B></P>
<P> The McKnight Foundation of Minneapolis, Minnesota, has awarded a $250,000
grant to WesMin Resource Conservation District &amp; Development Council (RC&amp;D)
of Alexandria, Minnesota. The two-year project, &quot;Acceleration of Biomass
Energy Development and Assessment of Social, Economic, and Environmental
Effects,&quot; will complement and enhance the DOE's energy crops research in
the Lake States. ORNL staff members Mark Downing and Robert Perlack helped
develop the proposal and will be cooperators on the project.    </P>
<P>This project includes five new activities. One is a study of alternative
marketing and procurement systems that will culminate in the formation of one or
more growers' cooperatives and a growers' association. Another is a training and
technical assistance activity to expand the pool of personnel in Minnesota
technically skilled in the silviculture of hybrid poplar. A third activity is an
assessment of the impacts of tree crop production and use on local and regional
income and employment. The final activities are an assessment of local
environmental benefits of tree crops and an outreach activity that will work
through other RC&amp;Ds to initiate contacts and expand partnerships with local
government units and other organizations in the Minnesota River Basin area. ORNL
will participate in the economic and environmental activities.</P>
<P>   The McKnight Foundation is a private grant making foundation that
operates primarily in Minnesota. It seeks to strengthen community and community
institutions, to enrich people's lives through the arts, to encourage
preservation of the natural environment, and to advance scientific knowledge
that can improve people's lives.  </P>
<P><B>TAMU Receives Grant to Further Switchgrass Research</B></P>
<P>Matt Sanderson, principal investigator of the BFDP switchgrass project at
Texas A&amp;M University (TAMU) Texas Agricultural Experiment Station, has
successfully leveraged some of his DOE funding to obtain a significant new grant
from a competitive in-state research and education program. The Advanced
Research Program/Advanced Technology Program (ARP/ATP) of the Texas Board of
Higher Education awarded a two-year grant for a project on the ecophysiology of
Panicum virgatum ecotypes. Sanderson says he appreciated the ORNL FY1995 capital
funds that were used to purchase a time domain reflectometer and plant canopy
analyzer. The availability of these instruments &quot;helped tremendously in the
success of this proposal.&quot; The ARP grant will support a series of
experiments to test hypotheses about ecotypic differences in sensitivity to
nitrogen availability, sensitivity to soil water deficit, and differences in
carbon partitioning in response to stresses. Results from this work will help
explain the geographic distribution of upland and lowland types of switchgrass.
Switchgrass is a native perennial grass being developed as a model herbaceous
bioenergy crop and as an alternative agroecosytem for sustainable management of
tallgrass prairies. </P>
<P><B>GIS Information is Requested</B></P>
<P>Robin Graham supplied researchers and entrepreneurs at the University of
Missouri with requested information on the likely farmgate costs, supplies, and
landbase for switchgrass in 5 counties of interest. The data will be used in
proposals being developed for a biomass heating plant at the University of
Missouri and an electric power plant nearby. The information was derived from
data tables which were generated for BFDP's 11-state Midwest integrated
geographic information system (GIS). BFDP scientists and economists at ORNL and
University of Tennessee jointly undertook the GIS task in FY1994 with the
objective of evaluating the potential of biomass energy crops as a feedstock for
either transportation fuel or power generation. </P>

</H2></CENTER>
<H3>Actions Completed During the Week</H3>
<P><B> Computer Software for Calculating Feedstock Costs </B></P>
<P>BFDP has continued to supply reliable and timely information for various
biomass energy estimates and research proposals.  Marie Walsh recently provided
researchers at University of Missouri with a valuable information tool. It is a
user-friendly switchgrass budget generator software program that allows them to
use data specific to the Missouri counties they want to include in their
proposal. Walsh and support subcontractor Denny Becker developed the budget
generator program for estimating feedstock production costs. The switchgrass
budget generator is based on existing BFDP budget models but it is written as an
Excel spreadsheet.  It contains pop-up windows that allow the user to easily
change data assumptions such as yields, land rents, nutrient efficiency
parameters, or discount rates. Net present values of producing switchgrass are
calculated on a per acre and per ton basis as a function of yield, and the user
is provided information about labor requirements, fuel use, and fertilizer and
chemical use as a function of yield. Walsh and Becker have also developed a
budget generator for hybrid poplar feedstocks.  As part of the interface
activity, the software for both poplar and switchgrass is being supplied to
researchers at NREL to give them the capability of estimating crop production
costs under various scenarios and with respect to yield.  The software has the
ability to calculate biomass production costs in six regions of the U.S. under
different yields, land rents, nutrient efficiencies, and discount rate
assumptions. This will provide the information NREL needs to conduct energy
balance analysis for biomass crops. </P>

Activity Report --  January 5, 1996</H2></CENTER>
<H3>Actions Completed During the Week</H3>
<P><B>Contractors Workshop is scheduled: </B> 
</P>
<P>The 1996 annual BFDP subcontractors' workshop will be held in the North
Central region at Iowa State University (ISU) in Ames. Principal Investigator
Rick Hall, Department of Forestry, agreed to host the meeting and the tentative
date is September 9-13. The agenda and any field trips will naturally cover both
wood and grass crops. In addition to the ongoing ISU poplar breeding project,
researchers in the agronomy department conducted prior herbaceous crop screening
for the western corn belt region.
</P>
<P><B>Entomology conference includes short-rotation forestry</B></P>
<P>At the North American Forest Insect Work Conference to be held at San
Antonio in April, short-rotation intensive forestry will be included for the
first time. Recent shifts toward ecosystem management, sustainable forestry,
rare and endangered species, cultural resources, and biodiversity have changed
the way public and many private lands are managed.  Dramatic changes in
technology, education curricula, public policy, and research budgets are but a
few of the current challenges faced by entomologists and forest health
specialists. Several BFDP collaborators, respected for their knowledge and
experience with forest pests and pathogens, have been involved in planning the
conference.  Many forest products companies, forestry associations, and forestry
research institutions are conference sponsors and exhibitors. These include Ben
Meadows Incorporated, Champion International, Louisiana Pacific Corporation,
Mississippi State University, Natural Resources Canada, Temple-Inland Products,
Texas Forestry Association, USDA Forest Service, Union Camp Corporation, and
Weyerhaeuser.

<H3>Actions Completed During the Week</H3>
<P><B>Recognition given to Minnesota Wood Energy Project</B></P>
<P>At the January 10 annual meeting of the WesMin Resource Conservation &amp;
Development Council (RC&amp;D) in Alexandria, Minnesota, an award was given to
the &quot;Minnesota Wood Energy Scale-Up Project&quot; as the Outstanding
Project of 1995.  Sincere appreciation was expressed to BFDP which co-funds the
$750,000 project and to Mark Downing for his leadership and support. During 1994
and 1995, 1850 acres of hybrid poplar were planted on 18 privately owned farms
within a 50-mile radius of Alexandria. As the Midwest's first biomass energy
project utilizing hybrid poplar trees, this multiyear effort demonstrates that
large-scale plantations of hybrid poplar are feasible and can be managed to help
meet future needs for energy and fiber.  The WesMin RC&amp;D is sponsored by the
boards of 14 county commissions and soil &amp; water conservation districts in
west central Minnesota.</P>
<P><B>Mapping the process for ORNL Interagency Agreements</B></P>
<P>A workshop was held this week by Beverly Schultz, the contract administrator
at DOE-Oak Ridge Operations (DOE-OR) who is responsible for funds-out agreements
between ORNL and other federal agencies.  Janet Cushman and Wilma McNabb
attended the meeting and discovered that BFDP initiated between 30 and 50
percent of all interagency agreements (IAs) at ORNL. When the IA task was
recently added to her other responsibilities, Ms. Schultz saw the need to &quot;map
the process&quot; of paperwork and approvals in hopes of streamlining current IA
procedures. Discussions covered such things as purchase orders, invoicing,
signature chains, and logistics. Methods for electronic transmission of forms
and electronic signature capability will be explored as well.  However, one big
time delay in the process of getting funds out is waiting for the return of the
IA document with the corresponding agency's official signatures.</P>
<P><B>TVA integrates biomass strategic planning</B></P>
<P>Lynn Wright represented BFDP at a strategic planning meeting in Muscle
Shoals for Tennessee Valley Authority's (TVA) biomass research.  She presented
the current status of DOE's biomass work. TVA's planning effort is interesting
because organizations such as environmental, contracts and procurement,
technology development, and economics are all included. In addition to the 15-25
TVA participants and Ms. Wright, representatives were invited to the meeting
from Joint Institute for Energy &amp; Environment (JIEE) and Electric Power
Research Institute (EPRI).</P>
<HR>
<H3>Activities Anticipated During the Coming Week</H3>
<P>Dr. Charles Gay, Laboratory Director at the National Renewable Energy Lab
(NREL), will visit ORNL on Wednesday, January 17 and will present a

<P><B> NREL Director visits ORNL</B></P>
<P>Dr. Charles Gay, Director of the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL)
visited Oak Ridge National Laboratory on January 18th to promote renewable
energy research collaboration. With Marilyn Brown as host, Dr. Gay toured
several energy research facilities including the Buildings Technology Center,
Instrumentation &amp; Controls Labs, and High Temperature Materials Lab. He was
briefed on various technologies included in ORNL's Energy Efficiency &amp;
Renewable Energy Program. Lynn Wright gave a status report on the BFDP's
feedstock research for Dr. Gay, who expressed interest in the current ORNL/NREL
feedstock and conversion tasks. Dr. Gay's presented a seminar to ORNL staff, on
the &quot;NREL 2000&quot; re-engineering effort. He described the
difficult-but-essential downsizing that NREL is undergoing to transform itself
from a single-purpose laboratory to a multipurpose, multi-sponsored research
facility capable of exporting a variety of renewable technologies.
</P>
<P><B>Conference on DOE Basic Energy Science</B></P>
<P>Jerry Tuskan represented ORNL's Environmental Sciences Division in New
Orleans January 4-6 at a conference conducted by DOE's Basic Energy Sciences and
the National Science Foundation. The conference was designed to identify
specific areas for research to address longer term, socioeconomic and
industry-related environmental issues. It was organized into 6 topical workshops
(automotive, chemical, energy, electronics, metals, and macro) plus 6
cross-cutting workshops (sensors, monitors &amp; controls, manufacturing &amp;
processing, and health, ecological, and environmental impacts. Jerry
participated in the workshops on energy and resource management, transportation,
and recovery. He noted that for the first time biomass energy was discussed in
the context of basic research. The Resources workshop identified the need for
increased productivity of energy crops and improved efficiency of enzymatic
conversion processes. A conference report will summarize R&amp;D needs
identified in the workshops and the results will be used to formulate a call for
proposals, to be issued in early 1996 either as a joint DOE/NSF program or a DOE
program, called the Environmental Partnership Initiative (EPI).</P>
<P><B>AG Publication Features Willow Crops</B></P>
<P>The American Agriculturalist magazine published an article &quot;Cleaner
fuel from cash crop&quot; in its November issue featuring the &quot;Wood Biomass
for Bioenergy Program&quot; at State University of New York-College of
Environmental Science and Forestry (SUNY-ESF). Dan Robison, SUNY biomass program
manager, reported that the magazine article has generated more than 50 new
requests for information. The SUNY program, which receives co-funding from BFDP,
is developing a wood biomass production system using hybrid willow clones that
is based on an operational system in Sweden. The magazine described the
potential of willow crops as &quot;a source for green fuel for energy
production, as well as an alternative cash crop for landowners.&quot; These
biomass energy crops are closely spaced, intensively managed plantings intended
for marginal agricultural sites. The willow trees would be cut during the first
year and allowed to resprout, then harvested on three year cycles. Seven
harvests are possible from the initial planting. Already 26 farmers have
tentatively offered 2,600 acres for willow plantings in conjunction with a
bioenergy proposal submitted by SUNY to DOE and to USDA. If funded, the new
project would establish at least 1,000 acres of hybrid willow across the state
during a five-year period.</P>

<P><B>Tree Genetic Co-op Reviews its Progress and Plans</B></P>
<P>Jerry Tuskan and Connie Wang represented BFDP at the second annual meeting
of the Tree Genetic Engineering Research Cooperative (TGERC) at Oregon State
University. BFDP is one of more than 25 co-op members which include
universities, government, and industry. Significant accomplishments have been
made by the co-op. They include: (1) the development and testing of gene
constructs for introducing genetic resistance to cottonwood leaf beetle into
hybrid poplar and (2) modified tissue culture protocols used to successfully
regenerate numerous genotypes. These protocols have been used to produce several
herbicide resistant poplars clones that will be tested during the coming year on
sites provided by James River Corporation and Potlatch Corporation. The field
tests, which await federal regulatory approval, will represent the first
genetically engineered trees to be tested under operational conditions.  Other
co-op projects address issues such as early flowering, sterility, and risk
assessment of transgenes in plantations.</P>

<H3>Actions Completed During the Week</H3>
<P><B>Energy Crops Research at Bioenergy 96</B></P>
<P>The seventh National Bioenergy Conference to be held September 15-19 in
Nashville may include several energy crops exhibits and as many as seven
technical papers by BFDP staff researchers and subcontractors. Task Managers
have identified several projects with significant results and with manuscripts
nearly complete. Efforts are being made to edit, review and coordinate the
submission of abstracts before the March 1st deadline. Research topics include
switchgrass yields from harvest of scale-up plots in Alabama, GIS studies on
land-use changes, total acreage planted with short-rotation wood crops in the
U.S., analysis of Conservation Reserve Program acres and potential government
savings from establishing energy crops, synthesis of harvest costs for
herbaceous crops under several scenarios, effects of energy crops and various
land-use changes on wildlife habitat. The nature of Bioenergy '96 means oral and
poster presentations will reach a broader and more diverse audience than a
typical scientific conference. Information will hopefully be exchanged among
conference participants such as industry scientists, representatives of
bioenergy trade associations, farmers, landowners, equipment manufacturers,
engineers, plant managers &amp; operators, agricultural extension specialists,
generators of wood wastes and other biomass wastes, state energy officials, and
economic development specialists.</P>
<P><B>Minnesota Agro-Forestry Cooperative</B></P>
<P> The Minnesota Agro-Foresty Cooperative has formed to investigate the
profitability of growing hybrid poplar on privately owned land. This is
apparently a direct result of BFDP's scale-up project with WesMin RC&amp;D in
Alexandria. Initially the co-op's organizers are seeking $200 from 100 members
which will be used for a feasibility study and will give members the right to
purchase stock when the co-op begins growing trees. The goal is to eventually
produce 100,000 tons per year of hardwoods for energy uses as well as to supply
the pulp and paper market. With this co-op landowners may be able to take
advantage of a predicted shortage of native aspens in the region. </P>

<P><B>DOE INTERN COMPLETES BFDP ASSIGNMENT </B></P>
<P>For the last six months BFDP hosted one of the participants in DOE's
Technical Leadership Development Program (TLDP).   Carolyn Nobel came to ORNL
with a civil and environmental engineering degree, Naval ROTC training, a host
of academic awards, and the goal of  &quot;adding value to an organization that
is striving to improve the environment through measurable means.&quot;  Her
previous TLDP rotations included orientation and training at DOE Headquarters,
an assignment in the Budget Analysis Division of Environmental Programs Branch,
and technical training at the Colorado School of Mines. Carolyn specifically
requested the opportunity to work with the Biofuels Feedstock Development
Program, and  Lynn Wright was enthusiastic about serving as her supervisor. 
Carolyn spent  a significant portion of her time assisting Lynn with special
projects.  Additionally, Carolyn was given an opportunity to experience a full
range of program management activities, including participation in subcontract
site visits,  visits to DOE sponsors, and participation in weekly program
information sharing meetings.  Carolyn pursued  her personal goal of &quot;adding
value&quot; by developing a biomass energy overview talk suitable for high
school audiences and the general public. Carolyn interviewed the available
biomass experts at ORNL, searched the literature, incorporated staff review
comments, and grappled with computer software to produce a script and visuals.</P>

<P><B>SHORT-ROTATION FORESTRY PROJECT ANNOUNCED IN HAWAII </B></P>
<P>Sixteen years after DOE and USDA began research on short-rotation
silviculture in Hawaii, full-scale forestry has arrived on the Big Island. On
March 7, Bishop Estates announced it had leased 24,000 acres of former sugar
lands on the Hamakua Coast to Prudential Timber Investment, a subsidiary of
Prudential Insurance.  The project will provide 25-30 direct jobs in an
economically troubled area where residents once depended on the sugar industry
for jobs.    PruTimber will begin planting short-rotation eucalyptus in six
months, and expects to have the area fully planted within two years.  Timber
sales will begin in six to seven years.  Current plans are to export the timber,
though several processing companies are investigating opportunities in the area.
The research that enabled this new crop for Hawaii was supported by the
Bioenergy Development Corporation, a subsidiary of C. Brewer, Inc., the State of
Hawaii, the U.S.D.A. Forest Service, and DOE, which  invested more than
$2,600,000  in the development of short-rotation eucalyptus crops for the Big
Island between 1980 and 1989.

<P><B>IOWA SUPPLIES POPLAR CLONES FOR REGIONAL TESTING</B></P>
<P>In the BFPD's <I>Populus</I> breeding project for the North Central Region,
tree geneticists and physiologists at Iowa State University's Department of
Forestry (ISU) are breeding and selecting superior Populus clones. A summary of
recent accomplishments was presented in the annual progress report from the ISU
project entitled &quot;Selection and Development of Pest-resistant Populus
Clones for Biomass Energy Production in the North Central Region.&quot; </P>
<P> Significant 1995 accomplishments include:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Distribution of 60 clones/40 rooted cuttings of each for the establishment
of the first regional clone trial in the North Central region (Iowa, Michigan,
Minnesota, and Wisconsin). The breeding program is capable of producing about 50
clones every 2 years for regional testing on a limited pre-commercial scale.
Possibly 10% of the most productive ones could then be released for commercial
testing.</LI>
<LI>Development of a better technique for holding female flower branches
through to seed production which allows for the production of larger quantities
of seed.</LI>
<LI>Evaluation of 166 clones in the nursery clonal test. 51 of those were
recommended for regional field testing, 52 for additional nursery evaluation
plus scale-up, and 63 for discontinuation except for placing in a gene
conservation orchard.</LI>
<LI>Isolation and identification of two chemical components on leaf surfaces
that in combination induce feeding by cottonwood leaf beetle. The presence of
the two chemicals could be used to determine insect resistance or
susceptibility.</LI></UL>
<P>The tree breeders and physiologists at ISU have been working for 5 years on
this project. They are developing a new 5-year continuation proposal for work to
begin in FY 1997.  </P>

Activity Report -- March 22, 1996</H2></CENTER>
<H3>Actions Completed During the Week</H3>
<P><B>RESULTS FROM BLACK COTTONWOOD PROJECT</B></P>
<P>BFDP's black cottonwood project at University of Washington (UW)/Washington
State University (WSU) continues to produce massive amounts of data and
information. During 1995 the collaborators published no less than 2 book
chapters, 12 journal articles, two theses, 12 abstracts, and one
report/bulletin. Technical progress included the following accomplishments:</P>
<P><B>Molecular Genetics &amp; Breeding:</B>The ability to transfer genetic
markers and gene maps among hybrid  families will make marker-aided selection
possible. The use of marker genes to identify superior genotypes would reduce
the time required for large breeding programs. At UW transfer of genetic markers
and gene maps was demonstrated using F2 hybrid families 331 and 355. Those
families contain nearly 375 and 234 clones, respectively, and they are the
principal families used by investigators worldwide for mapping of quantitative
trait loci (QTLs). With TxD clone 49-177 as female parent, new outcrossed F2
(TDxTD; n~900) hybrids and backcross (TDxD; n~100) hybrids have been produced.
First-year seedling growth of these hybrids was excellent. Measurements continue
to be made for growth and a variety of other morphological, physiological, and
pathological traits on UW's QTL mapping plantations numbers 7.28, 7.29, and
7.30. These plantations contain the most intensively studied poplar trees in the
world.</P>
<P><B>Clone Testing:</B>  Recent tests of clones bred in 1987 and 1988
confirmed the superiority of F1 hybrids over advanced generation and three
species hybrids. In one test a single TDxN clone ranked with the top five TxD
clones in the trial. These results suggest that new superior clones will mainly
come from new F1 crosses.</P>
<P><B>Pathology Research:</B>A variant of the leaf rust Melampsora appeared
and attacked TxD F1 clones that were previously considered resistant. The
implications of rapidly changing diseases has received considerable attention.
Assessments were made of the morphometric variation in several strains of
Melampsora. Disease screening work is being meshed with a study of molecular
variation in the same group of rust isolates. It is hoped that the identity of
the variant rust will be determined and molecular techniques developed to
routinely identify field isolates of Melampsora. This could be an indirect way
to evaluate hybrid poplar clones for rust resistance.</P>
<P><B>Data Base Management:</B>  A World Wide Web site for information on
poplar and willow was created at
<A HREF="http://poplar1.cfr.washington.edu/">http://poplar1.cfr.washington.edu</A>.</P>
<P><B>Technology Transfer:</B>  The International Poplar Symposium (IPS) was
held in Seattle in August. More than 100 attended from 6 continents and more
than 20 countries. Field tours of the UW/WSU experimental plantations were
conducted prior to the IPS meeting. DOE's historical support for Populus
research was duly noted throughout the symposium.

<H2>Biofuels Feedstock Development Program<BR> Oak Ridge National Laboratory<BR>Weekly
Activity Report -- March 29, 1996</H2></CENTER>
<P><B>NORTH CENTRAL POPULUS CONSORTIUM</B></P>
<P>Jerry Tuskan facilitated the fifth meeting of the North Central Populus
Research Consortium held March 21st in St. Paul. This activity is part of what
has been described as one of the BFDP's virtual &quot;crop development centers.&quot;
There were approximately 14 persons in attendance representing federal
government, universities, state agencies, and forest products companies within
the region. A 15-minute summary was given of each organization's accomplishments
during the past 12 months. The following activities were included: </P>
<UL>
<LI>Iowa State University - 86 new clones were released to the regional trials
for planting in 1997. A breeding matrix of fours specific crosses over the next
5 years was developed. Single gene segregation for rust resistance has been
detected.</LI>
<LI>University of Minnesota - Results indicate geographic differences in
disease resistance, survival, volume growth, and strong east-to-west segregation
within native cottonwood collections.</LI>
<LI>U.S. Forest Service-St. Paul - Septoria collections displayed geographic
differences based on molecular markers and morphology. Disease surveys continued
in the Minnesota network of plantations that were established by Ed Hansen.</LI>
<LI>University of Minnesota-Duluth - ECOPHYS, a single stem Populus growth
model, is being modified to include a belowground component and will be
incorporated in EPIC, a soil erosion model to assess environmental effects of
short-rotation forestry.
</LI></UL>
<P>The North Central Consortium provides an opportunity to share information on
recent developments in Populus research among organizations that might not
otherwise do so. Members expressed the need for future meetings to give more
time to &quot;hammering out&quot; the details on technical issues of concern
such as advanced generation breeding approaches, and standardized disease
evaluation schemes. Coordinating these research efforts would maximize the
outcomes.</P>
<P><B>MANAGERS OF REGIONAL BIOMASS PROGRAMS VISIT ORNL</B></P>
<P>Managers of DOE's Southeast, Northeast, Great Lakes, Pacific Northwest, and
Western Regional Biomass Energy Programs along with John Ferrell, Director of
Office of Fuels Development visited on March 29. BFDP staff felt the interaction
was very positive because of commonalities of each program. As deployment of
dedicated energy crops becomes more important, sharing technical information,
and networks of constituents and stakeholders could benefit the Programs. The
meeting included discussions of current activities and trends in research.</P>
<HR>
<H3>Scheduled Events or Announcements</H3>
<P>Sarah Sprague, BFDP's primary contact in the DOE Office of Fuels
Development, will visit at ORNL in mid or late April. No dates have been set.</P>
<P> In late April Jerry Tuskan will host two members of Weyerhaeuser
Corporation's research staff who wish to visit with ORNL scientists to discuss
silviculture.</P>
<H3>Emerging Issues or Interactions</H3>
<P>None reported.</P>
<H3>EE/RE Congressional Hearings or Testimony</H3>
<P>None reported.
</P>
<H3>Subcontracts/CRADAs To Be Issued</H3>
<P>During the month of April, the legal departments of both ORNL and Union Camp
Corporation are expected to approve the Biofuels Feedstock Development Program's
CRADA. This is a joint research project that is designed to determine
productivity rates and carbon budgets for irrigated and fertilized tree crops
grown in the Southeast. It is comprised of four interrelated tasks addressing
osmotic potential, leaf gas exchange and water-use efficiency, whole-plant
carbon allocation, and ground-water quality. The project's expected outcome is
the characterization of physiological limits on maximum productivity of the
short-rotation hardwood species cottonwood, sycamore, and sweetgum.</P>
<H3>Outreach Activities/Media Interactions</H3>
<P>Applications were submitted for co-sponsorship of the Bioenergy 96
conference to be held in Nashville in September. Two booths at the trade show &amp;
exposition are being planned. ORNL's Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy
Program (EE/RE) will be featured at one and the other will focus on BFDP's
energy crops research.</P>

Activity Report -- April 5, 1996</H2></CENTER>
<H3>REPORT ON NEW YORK WILLOW CLONE-SITE TRIALS</H3>
<P>A project milestone report received from BFDP collaborators at State
University of New York indicates that exceptionally dry weather during the
growing season caused slow tree growth and exacerbated weed problems in the
clonal trials planted during the spring of 1995. Clone-site trials were
established at four sites (Himrod, King Ferry, Somerset, and Tully) to test 15
different willow clones and two hybrid poplars. During mid- to late-summer
survival was measured using a 100% census and tree growth and weed competition
were subjectively assessed. Average survival among the sites ranged from 79% to
98%. Inadequate fall site preparation and lack of proper weed control were major
factors affecting tree survival at each site and rabbit damage affected about
one-third of the trees at the Himrod site. Approximately 100,000 hybrid willow
cuttings were purchased from the University of Toronto during winter 1995-1996.
Twenty thousand hybrid poplar cuttings were purchased from the Ontario Ministry
of Natural Resources during February. These cuttings will be planted on a 5.5
hectare site owned by New York State Electric and Gas Corporation at King Ferry
or in clone-site trials during spring 1996. Any cuttings not planted during 1996
will be stored at -4 degrees C and planted during 1997.

<P><B>ENVIRONMENTAL TASK PRESENTED AT LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY MEETING
</B></P>
<P>Andrew Schiller represented BFDP at the U.S. meeting of the International
Association for Landscape Ecology, in Galveston, Texas the last week of March.
He gave a poster presentation entitled &quot;Hardwood Energy Crops &amp;
Wildlife Diversity: Investigating Potential Benefits for Breeding Birds and
Small Mammals&quot; which described BFDP's ongoing environmental research. A
large expression of interest was received from conference participants even
though they seemed to know very little about biomass or bioenergy. They
recognized the fact that applied technologies have potential to create both
economic and environmental &quot;win-win&quot; scenarios. The symposium theme, &quot;Integration
of Cultural and Natural Ecosystems Across Landscapes: Application of the Science&quot;,
was very appropriate for Biofuels research &amp; development . Nearly 400
attended the meeting, including researchers, wildlife biologists, computer
modelers, ecologists, landscape architects, and land use planners primarily from
academia, Forest Service research centers, EPA, local and regional planning
agencies, and several private firms. Workshops were held during the meeting on
1) measuring biodiversity, 2) spatial analysis tools, 3) geographic principles,
4) ecosystem management, 5) landscape ecology teaching techniques, and 6)
environmental planning. </P>
<P><B>DISCUSSION OF SAVANNAH RIVER SITE</B></P>
<P>   Lynn Wright, Virginia Tolbert, and Tim Tschaplinski participated in the
workshop hosted by the U.S. Forest Service Savannah River Forest Station at the
Savannah River (SR) site on April 16-17. Physiologists, wetlands experts,
entomologists, pathologists, fiber anatomists, economists, and integrated pest
management specialists from the Southern Research Station, representatives of 8
forest product industries, 4 universities, and representatives from the BFDP met
to discuss a potential collaborative research program being proposed at the
Savannah River site by the SR Forest Station. Primary questions (environmental
assessment, basics of production, and management systems) and associated
considerations identified and discussed including habitat, stand structure and
dynamics, use of waste materials as soil amendments, soil management, and
incremental establishment of hardwood crops on upland and lowland sites. Areas
of interest to the forest products industry and participating researchers were
enumerated as were areas that were considered to be either premature or of no
interest at this time. The potential to use the Savannah River site as a unique
research site was discussed. Representatives of the Forest Service in
consultation with the BFDP will develop a proposed research plan and funding
requirements for consideration by the forest products representatives. Their
comments are expected by the middle of May. The funding cycle and previous 1996
financial commitments of most industries represented would prohibit
participation and support for any research activities at the Savannah River site
until 1997.

Activity Report -- April 26, 1996</H2></CENTER>
<P><B> POSITIVE INTERACTIONS WITH WEYERHAEUSER AND FOREST SERVICE</B></P>
<P>Nick Wheeler, a research manager for Weyerhaeuser Corporation, visited the
BFDP April 24-25 for briefings on short-rotation woody crop technology. Jerry
Tuskan coordinated the visit, which included discussion with a most BFDP task
leaders. Wheeler indicated that Weyerhaeuser may soon send a larger delegation
to ORNL for in-depth discussions.</P>
<P>The current high demand for hardwood fiber is forcing forest products
companies nationwide to choose between on-shore sources versus off-shore
sources. Interactions with companies like Weyerhauser can support continued
domestic production of wood, and often lead to research collaborations that
expand and support BFDP's woody crops research.</P>
<P> Researchers from U.S. Forest Service-Forestry Sciences Laboratory in
Rhinelander, Wisconsin and Minnesota Natural Resources Research Institute
(MNRRI) also visited at ORNL April 22-24. The BFDP has atleast nine
well-established poplar projects in the Lake States, with the Forest Service,
the University of Minnesota/NRRI, and WesMin Resource Conservation &amp;
Development District. The discussions at ORNL focused on coordination among the
various BFDP-supported projects, coordination with related poplar research in
the region, and planning for new willow trials.</P>

<P>BFDP presented an information exhibit along with five other projects from
ORNL's Energy Efficiency &amp; Renewable Energy (EE/RE) Program at the Renewable
Energy Expo, held April 24 in Washington at the Cannon Office Building. The
Biomass Energy Alliance (BEA), American Biofuels Association (ABA), and National
Bioenergy Industries Association (NBIA) planned and promoted the event, which
was sponsored by Congressman Dan Schaefer. An estimated 500 attended during a
3-hour period including a diverse mix of congressional staffers, several
Congressmen, groups of students, small business entrepreneurs, and a few private
citizens.</P>
<H3>Honors, Awards, Publications</H3>
<P>Plant pathologist Mike Ostry, principal investigator on a BFDP/Forest
Service project, was honored as the North Central Forest Experiment Station's
1996 Distinguished Scientist. Jerry Tuskan was quoted in an article in the
Station's NC News saying &quot;He's the most widely recognized poplar
pathologist in the United States.&quot; Mike's work has had a huge impact on
disease management practices in forest across the U.S. After many years of
research on Septoria canker in poplar, Ostry developed the first workable
somaclonal system for producing disease-resistant trees. His research to reduce
the impact of diseases in short-rotation, intensive-culture plantations has had
a big effect on the industry's willingness to accept this alternative fiber
source. Jerry noted Mike's &quot;special ability to talk with all kinds of
people-scientists and farmers alike-with equal ease.&quot;</P>

<P><B>ENERGY PRODUCTION FROM FORAGES ONCE MEANT HORSES &amp; MULES</B></P>
<P>Dr. Ken Vogel, Research Geneticist and Research Leader, USDA Agricultural
Research Service, and Adjunct Professor of Agronomy, University of Nebraska,
published an article in the Journal of Soil and Water Conservation on the
conversion of transportation and agriculture industries from &quot;grass powered&quot;
to gasoline powered. Vogel discusses crop surpluses, soil erosion, water
pollution, and programs such as Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) and DOE's
Biofuels Program. He describes how haylands and pasturelands that were released
from biomass energy production by the conversion from horse power to machine
power can produce biomass-to-ethanol feedstocks and provide economic and
environmental benefits. Vogel's work on switchgrass for energy has been
supported by BFDP since 1990.</P>
<P><B>BIRD SURVEYS IN HARDWOOD PLANTINGS</B></P>
<P>Populations of breeding birds will be surveyed on lands held by Union Camp
Corporation near Franklin, Virginia for ten days during May and June 1996. Sites
include sycamore and sweetgum plantings, and naturally regenerated hardwoods. 
Comparisons will be made with previous data from sites in the Pacific Northwest
and Canada to address questions about effects of energy crops on wildlife
habitat. Participants will include ORNL's Virginia Tolbert and Andrew Schiller;
Union Camp Corporation research staff; and, Wayne Hoffman of the National
Audubon Society </P>

<H3>Major Events or Announcements</H3>
<P><B>BFDP AND AMERICA'S RIVERS BOTH BEGIN MINNESOTA PROJECTS
</B></P>
<P>Scott Faber, of the America's Rivers organization, visited ORNL on Friday,
May 17, and gave a seminar &quot;River Friendly Farming: Promoting Alternative
Floodplain Land Uses.&quot; America's Rivers is a Washington-based nonprofit
environmental group that began 24 years ago as a result of the Wild &amp; Scenic
Rivers Act. It has advocated the importance of the health of rivers like the
Minnesota and its floodplain, addressing issues such as impacts of dams and
flood control policy, nonpoint source pollution, and water trusts. The McKnight
Foundation recently awarded America's Rivers a grant to conduct a project on the
Minnesota River floodplain. Discussions at ORNL included ways in which this
project and the bioenergy project for which the WESMIN Resource Conservation and
Development District and its collaborators, including Mark Downing, received
McKnight funding. The WESMIN project addresses the social and economic effects
of biomass energy development, in while the complementary American Rivers'
project addresses flood control and protection of water resources.</P>
<P><B>REPORT FROM SOUTHEAST BIOENERGY ROUND TABLE</B></P>
<P>During its May 15th meeting in Atlanta, the Southeast Bioenergy Round Table
discussed the current draft of a concensus document and the steps necessary to
have the report finalized by September's Bioenergy '96 conference. The Round
Table reaffirmed its statement of purpose and reached consensus on the structure
of the &quot;draft final&quot; document to include background, an executive
summary, and a strategies section organized by target audiences (government,
industry, research, public interest, etc.) While there may be some overlap with
this structure, it will allow each target audiences to recognize what its own
role can be to promote biomass energy in the Southeast. The next meeting of the
Southeast Round Table is July 9-10 in Nashville, Tennessee.</P>
<P><B>MODELING BIOENERGY SYSTEMS UNDER IEA TASK XIII</B></P>
<P>Miles Watters of Aberdeen University, U.K., spent two days with BFDP staff
discussing bioenergy systems models and the International Energy Agency (IEA)
Bioenergy Model BEAM. The discussion focused on building consistent feedstock
production modules for BEAM and, in particular, how to incorporate the BFDP
production models for hybrid poplar and switchgrass into BEAM.  There was also
considerable discussion on work in the U.K. with willow production systems and
modeling the costs of willow production systems. As part of the IEA Systems
Studies Activity under Task XII, the current U.K. willow production module will
be modified to make it relevant to the U.S. production situation. Miles will be
doing this modification using the existing BFDP feedstock models as the
template. The goal is to have a set of consistent feedstock production models in
BEAM which will permit comparison of the different feedstocks in different
conversion systems. Miles was heavily involved in the development of the U.K.
willow production model and has been involved with U.K. willow trials for
several years. He has also visited the Swedish plantations and is knowledgeable
about their systems, yields, and problems. Thus he brings to the task both
modeling expertise and a practical grounding in the realities of willow
production. The willow module should be very useful to BFDP and is a good
example of how IEA networking can reduce duplicative efforts. 
</P>
<HR>
<H3>Scheduled Events</H3>
<P>On May 22 Jerry Tuskan will give an invited presentation in Magnolia,
Arkansas, on BFDP's cottonwood research at a tree improvement conference
sponsored by southern forest products companies.</P>
<P>A meeting of the Southern Regional Information Exchange Group (SRIEG) will
be held June 23-26 at the Texas A&amp;M conference facility in Houston. BFDP is
co-sponsoring this conference on the use of molecular markers in forest
genetics. Jerry Tuskan will present BFDP's current genetics research and will
also chair a session.

<P><B>NEW USER FACILITY USES OLD BFDP PLANTING</B></P>
<P> ORNL is constructing a free-air carbon dioxide exposure (FACE) facility in
a stand of short-rotation sweetgum trees near the ecological research area of
the Oak Ridge Reservation. Originally established in 1988 for BFDP's nutrient
cycling studies, this short-rotation planting was chosen because its trees are
now more than 35 feet tall. They have the closed canopy and well-developed root
system of a deciduous forest and also the uniformity needed to detect and
measure responses to increased carbon dioxide.</P>
<P>This will be the first FACE facility built to study the effects of elevated
carbon dioxide on deciduous forest trees. It will consist of four exposure
rings, each 82 feet (25 meters) in diameter. Carbon dioxide will be released
through vertical pipes around the rings' perimeters, exposing the trees within
to carbon dioxide concentrations 200 parts per million above normal levels.  
The Oak Ridge FACE will be a user facility, open to researchers from
universities and other research laboratories. Though the BFDP is not providing
financial support for the FACE project, research plans include detailed carbon
and nitrogen cycling studies relevant to the BFDP's short-rotation woody crops
research.</P>
<P><B>BIOPOWER COMMERCIALIZATION ISSUES DISCUSSED WITH IEA GUEST</B></P>
<P> Marie Walsh hosted a visit May 15-17 from Justin Ford-Robertson of the New
Zealand Forest Research Institute. Ford-Robertson is a New Zealand
representative to the International Energy Agency (IEA) Biomass Annex XIII
Integrated Bioenergy Systems. He spoke with Walsh, Robin Graham, and Gregg
Marland about IEA activities and discussed biomass research and
commercialization activities in New Zealand and the U.S. with other staff
members.   </P>

<P><B>ENERGY CROP DATABASE WILL SOON BE AVAILABLE ON THE INTERNET</B></P>
<P>The BFDP is developing a county-level database on energy crops that
encompasses the entire United States. The database will contain current
information on land base and land rents, energy crop yields, variable production
costs, and probable farmgate prices (the prices paid to farmers for the biomass
they produce). Farmgate prices do not include the cost of transporting biomass
to bioenergy conversion facilities. The database, which will initially include
data on switchgrass, hybrid poplar, and willow, will be searchable by either
county name or county Federal Information Processing Standards code and should
be useful for assessing geographic variation in energy crop potential. The
database will be available as Excel spreadsheet at the

<P><B>ATTENTION IS DRAWN TO RESEARCH ON DROUGHT TOLERANT CROPS
</B></P>
<P> This year's recordbreaking drought in the South brings prospects of
widespread failures of agricultural crops, higher consumer prices, loss of
topsoil, and talk of &quot;Dust Bowl days&quot;. Alternative management
strategies have been recommended to preserve range and grasslands, release of
federal grain reserves was requested to aid livestock producers, and economists
are calling the drought a test of the new Farm Bill called &quot;Freedom to
Farm.&quot; CNN, the cable television news network, interviewed David Bransby of
Auburn University as part of its story on the drought. Bransby, a strong
advocate of switchgrass as a biomass energy crop, discussed the promise of
energy crops with the CNN representatives. As a result, CNN is likely to produce
a segment on energy crops in the fall of 1996.

<P><B>PREDICTING THE EFFECTS OF ENERGY CROPS ON WATER QUALITY</B></P>
<P>Michael Sears, a Purdue University master's student collaborating with
ORNL's Carolyn Hunsaker and Robin Graham, has examined the watershed level
effects of energy crops on water quality. He used the Agricultural Non-Point
Source pollution model (AGNPS) to predict water quality changes associated with
switchgrass production for three Indiana watersheds.   The three variations on
land use assumed for this study included 1) current conditions; 2) economic
biomass, with switchgrass crops distributed as predicted by economic models;
and, 3) water quality biomass, with switchgrass crops are used as buffers around
bodies of water.  A thesis and at least 2 journal publications will be based on
this work. Proposals are also being developed for linking this model with

<P>Netafim's Roy Merritt presented information on Netafim's uniquely designed
drip irrigation systems to BFDP staff on June 18. The computer-controlled
systems are being used for commercial production of hardwood fiber. Several BFDP
poplar studies in the Southeast and Pacific Northwest are being conducted on
industrial sites which typically use Netafim systems.   Netafim pioneered drip
irrigation beginning in 1965 with agriculture in the deserts of Israel. Widely
used by California vegetable farms and wineries, the turn-key systems manage

<H3>Major Events or Accomplishments</H3>
<P><B>ENERGY CROPS ARE BEING COMPARED WITH CORN CROP IN ALABAMA</B></P>
<P>On June 26th, Virginia Tolbert and Andrew Schiller visited the BFDP project
at Alabama A&amp;M University near Huntsville. The project is designed to assess
environmental effects of converting land previously used for agricultural crops,
such as corn and soybeans, to dedicated energy crops. Water quality, erosion,
and changes in soil characteristics are being compared on a corn crop,
switchgrass planting, and sweetgum trees planted with and without a cover crop
between rows. </P>
<P>The corn crop is being grown using standard no-till methods, tree sites
without ground cover are being maintained in a weed-free state, and tree sites
with ground cover have an approximate 3 foot band of fescue in the middles
between the tree rows.  Second-year tree growth on certain sites has already
been 18 inches, greater than expected, with some trees already over 7 feet tall.
No fertilizer was used on the tree crops last year. This spring fertilizer was
applied at 100 lbs/acre to the tree sites and 80 lbs/acre to the switchgrass. 
</P>
<P>Principal Investigator (PI) Tom Green says erosion from the tree sites
without cover crops differs considerably from the other three treatments. The
amount of water leaving the sites in overland flow is very similar for all
treatments, but the volume of sediment leaving the tree sites with no herbaceous
cover is considerably greater.   The Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA),
co-sponsor of this work, has conducted the water quality analysis and is
analysing for the first year's results. A high school student who is collecting
hydrologic data and measuring soil moisture this summer will also be developing
a water budget for the different treatments.  ORNL staff have provided advice on
installation of equipment and data collection. Tolbert, Schiller, and the PIs
discussed the possibility of broadening the project's research base to address
other ecological questions using these plantings. There is interest in studies
of crown architecture and leaf positioning, of invertebrates such as surface
active ground beetles, and os bird species using the sites.    
</P>
<P><B>HERBACEOUS TASK MANAGER WEARS MANY HATS</B></P>
<P> Local television station WATE-TV Channel 6 asked Sandy McLaughlin to &quot;be
in the audience&quot; to respond to questions at its program on the theme &quot;Beyond
the Beauty.&quot; The purpose of the program was to help the public understand
the environmental, management, and economic problems faced by the Great Smokey
Mountains National Park (GSMNP). The event is part of the series begun last week
by Channel 6 and the Knoxville News Sentinel newspaper.  Well known for his
forest research, McLaughlin was also interviewed last week about results of ORNL
studies on the effects of air pollution on forests. Senator Frist, Park Director
Karen Wade, State Historian Wilma Dykeman, and Associate Laboratory Director Bob
Van Hook were also on the program.</P>
<P><B>BFDP AT TWO CONFERENCES</B></P>
<P> Janet Cushman described the BFDP's research in a paper presented at the
World Renewable Energy Congress IV in Denver, Colorado. The paper received some
interest, though many international participants may not have shared a strong
interest in the production of biomass crops for transportation fuels. Janet also
attended the Fuel Ethanol Workshop in St. Paul. This conference was sponsored by
USDA, DOE, the Renewable Fuels Association, Minnesota Department of Natural
Resources, Governors Ethanol Coalition, and National Corn Growers Association.</P>
<P><B>WORLDWIDE WEB EXPERTISE IS NEAR AT HAND</B></P>
<P> Sheryl Martin is an information specialist who works half-time with
Information Task Manager Anne Ehrenshaft. During ORNL's WEB Week 96 Sheryl
presented a &quot;success story&quot; seminar based her work for the Human
Genome Project and its use of the Worldwide Web. Experience on BIN as well as
the genome project has shown an information audience can be broadened and
diversified when links to search engines such as Yahoo are included to provide
the user more utility.

<P><B>SECOND SYMPOSIUM ON MARKER-AIDED SELECTION</B></P>
<P> Jerry Tuskan and his colleague Claire Williams of Texas A&amp;M University
organized a research symposium, co-sponsored by BEFD, to address the use of DNA
markers in forestry applications. The symposium continued a discussion on
marker-aided selection (MAS) begun by the USDA Cooperative State Research
Service through the Southern Regional Information Exchange Group (SRIEG) five
years ago. Since that time tremendous progress has been made in developing DNA
gene maps of poplar, douglas fir, eucalyptus, loblolly pine, and radiata pine.
Genetic variation in natural populations has been studied and many markers
associated with specific physiological traits have been identified. An example
of this is Tuskan's identification of a gender marker in willows. As a result of
the efforts to map the human genome, it is possible in principle to map genes in
tree species using marker-aided techniques. This will have high value in
commercial forestry and forest products operations. More than 120 researchers
from 14 countries participated in the MAS symposium. Abstracts of the papers are
available on the Internet at -

<P><B>DNA ANALYSIS AIDS SWITCHGRASS BREEDING PROGRAMS</B></P>
<P> Information on genetic diversity in switchgrass (<I>Panicum virgatum</I>
L.) will enhance the effectiveness of breeding programs and germplasm
conservation efforts. ORNL's Lee Gunter and Stan Wullschleger recently published
a BFDP study that characterized and assessed genetic diversity of 14 switchgrass
populations in the journal <I><A HREF="#Gunter">Crop Science</A>.</I> Using
RAPD markers, Gunter and Wullschleger determined that overall similarity was 65%
among populations compared to 81% within populations. The varieties 'Blackwell'
and 'Caddo' were the most similar populations (78%) based on RAPD markers,
whereas 'Alamo' and 'Forestburg' were the most divergent (53%). Cluster analysis
determined that populations segregated clearly into two main groups (putatively
based on ecotype) and united individuals within a population into discrete
groups. These results indicate that RAPD profiles can be used to identify
swtichgrass populations and may be useful in predicting relationships between
experimental germplasm sources and released populations. </P>

<P><B>GENDER MARKER PROPOSAL WINS DIRECTOR'S R&amp;D FUNDING
</B></P>
<P>The ORNL Executive Committee selected a proposal by Jerry Tuskan and
collaborators Lee Gunter, Tim Tschaplinski, and Frank Larimer for funding from
the 1996 Laboratory Director's R&amp;D (LDRD) Fund. The project, entitled &quot;Isolating
the DNA Sequences that Determine Gender in the Plant Family Salicaceae,&quot; is
one of seven winners from about 30 submissions in the category of &quot;Enhancing
R&amp;D Competencies.&quot; This LDRD funding will support a 2-year study on a
marker gene for willow which was identified by Tuskan's prior research. The
award also validates the importance of BFDP's co-sponsored bioenergy-from-willow
research at State University of New York's College of Environmental Science and
Forestry (SUNY-ESF) and enhances DOE's support of the large biomass energy
research consortium of utility companies in that state. </P>
<P><B>SMALL BIOMASS ENERGY SYSTEMS DISCUSSED</B></P>
<P> On August 20 Lynn Wright hosted a laboratory-wide seminar given by Jane
Turnbull of the consulting firm Peninsula Energy Partners. Results from a
worldwide survey of small biomass power generating systems were presented.
Turnbull, in cooperation with Bechtel Corporation, conducted a study of 27
technologies including gasifiers with spark ignited engines, gasifiers with gas
turbines, direct fired gas turbines, and direct combustion combined with steam
turbines. System sizes ranged from less than 250 kilowatts to 15 megawatts. Her
views on renewable energy were of interest to ORNL staff and she led discussion
of research needs for improving the viability of biomass systems. Well known in
the field of biomass energy, Turnbull, managed renewable energy projects at
Pacific Gas &amp; Electric and most recently at Electric Power Research
Institute. She has published papers on regulatory and policy issues of biomass
power, and served on national biomass energy advisory panels.

<P><B>CENTER OF EXCELLENCE IN FORESTRY AT ALABAMA A&amp;M</B></P>
<P>Alabama A&amp;M University has been designated a USDA Center of Excellence
in Forestry. The ceremony is September 12 and the guest of honor for the
occasion will be Jack Ward Thomas, Chief, Forest Service. Alabama A&amp;M;conducts
work on the environmental impacts of short-rotation woody crops for the BFDP.
The work is part of a 3-site study coordinated by the Tennessee Valley
Authority.</P>
<P><B>SUSTAINABLE FORESTRY RESEARCH TASK KICKOFF MEETING</B></P>
<P>On August 30 Lynn Wright, ORNL's coordinator for Agenda 2020 Sustainable
Forest Management Research, hosted the Task Kickoff Meeting. Reports and plans
were presented for each of the projects including: biochemical and molecular
regulation of crown architecture, wood property traits in loblolly pine and
hybrid poplar, water quality and site nutrients, molecular analysis of
carbohydrate regulation, and model-based diagnosis of soil limitations to forest
productivity. Valri Robinson, DOE Office of Industrial Technologies (OIT)
described in her remarks to the group the DOE management approach, outyear
budget expectations, the roles of the Project Manager at Idaho Operations Office
and ORNL's coordinator, as well as interactions with the American Forest and
Paper Association. Discussions addressed reporting requirements for milestones,
and evaluations and reviews, quality metrics, and participation in the Vision
Industries Expo in 1997.  
</P>
<P><B>DATA ANALYSIS BEGINS ON WILDLIFE HABITAT PROJECT</B></P>
<P> Andrew Schiller presented for BFDP staff an overview of the project on
effects of short-rotation woody crops on wildlife habitat. At the Union Camp
sites at Franklin, Virginia, a unique opportunity exists with dedicated
bioenergy crops to help &quot;stitch the landscape back together&quot; for
wildlife. Within the landscape is a matrix of various older aged trees including
willow-oak, ash, sycamore, sweetgum and pine trees, river drainages, and
adjacent farms of soybeans and cotton on sandy coastal plain soils.   Andrew
described the project hypotheses and objectives, the existing maps and forms of
data, as well as some interesting observation methods. For small mammals, larger
mammals such as deer, and especially for birds, this project will help validate
the relatively untested island biogeography theory of the 1960's.

<H3>Major Events or Accomplishments</H3>
<P><B>IOWA CONFERENCE ON GRASS CROPS</B></P>
<P>At the Native Warm Season Grass Conference and Expo, held September 12-13 in
Des Moines, Mark Downing served on a discussion panel addressing biomass related
issues. Others on the panel were Ken Vogel of USDA-ARS/University of Nebraska,
Jim Cooper of the Chariton Valley RC&amp;D Project, and Matt Sanderson of
USDA/Penn State. Each panelist gave an extemporaneous 10-15 minute talk. Mark
was involved with DOE's biomass feasibility studies and manages BFDP's scale-up
&amp; commercialization research. The audience consisted of farmers, ranchers,
grazers, and commercial feed/seed/supplies salesmen. Most were familiar with the
Chariton Valley Project and questions from the audience centered around markets,
ethanol, and &quot;what's happening in the rest of the country.&quot;</P>
<P><B>STRONG PRESENCE AT BIOENERGY '96</B></P>
<P> BFDP co-sponsored the 7th National Bioenergy Conference which was held
September 15-20 in Nashville. There was a strong BFDP technical presence at the
meeting as well. BFDP staff chaired more than three of the concurrent sessions.
Research sponsored by BFDP accounted for a total of 14 presented papers and 3
poster presentations. Two of these were presented in the Biomass Power Program
session, 1 in the session on technical barriers, 2 in the environmental issues
session, 5 in the modeling &amp; analysis session, and 2 projects were presented
in the session on biomass resources. DOE's energy crops research was featured at
the Bioenergy 96 exhibition and trade show with an array of information
products, computer demonstrations, and posters. Four newly published fact sheets
and numerous copies of the BIOCOST software were distributed.  
</P>
<P><B>DISCUSSIONS WITH BIOMASS ENERGY UTILITIES GROUP</B></P>
<P>   Representatives from the Utilities for Biomass Energy Commercialization
Association (UBECA) visited at ORNL on September 20 hosted by Lynn Wright. Bob
Mauro, Executive Director, and Paula Eidson, a new UBECA employee, sought this
opportunity to become more acquainted with the range of biomass technologies at
ORNL and to describe UBECA's current activities. There were discussions
concerning biomass feedstock issues, informal presentations of BFDP projects,
and a tour of a research laboratory.</P>
<P>   
<B>HERBICIDE RESEARCH YIELDS POSSIBLE COST SAVINGS</B></P>
<P> BFDP's project with USDA-Agricultural Research Service, Lincoln, Nebraska,
includes a study to determine the effectiveness of new herbicides in aiding
switchgrass establishment by reducing weed competition. The influence of
atrazine, imazethapyr (PURSUIT), imazapyr (ARSENAL), imazameth (PLATEAU), and
quinclorac (FACET) on switchgrass planted at a low seeding rate on marginal
(Class IV) cropland has been evaluated. The results indicate that PLATEAU is a
very promising herbicide for establishing switchgrass when used at reduced
rates. Switchgrass is more sensitive to PLATEAU than most other native
warm-season grasses. Based on this research, American Cyanamid sought and
received full federal registration of PLATEAU for use on non-cropland areas
(i.e., roadsides, rights-of-ways, grasslands that will not be grazed (prairie
preserves, wildlife refuges, conservation plantings), etc. in 1996. PLATEAU can
be used for weed control during switchgrass establishment as long as the area to
which the herbicide is applied is not grazed. CADRE, the same active ingredient
as PLATEAU, was registered for weed control in peanuts in 1996. The current cost
of PLATEAU is about $2.00 per 0.25 ounce of active ingredient or 1 ounce of
actual product. This brings the cost of the 0.5 a.i./acre rate for use in
switchgrass establishment to $4.00 per acres, which compares favorably to
application of atrazine at 2 pounds a.i./acre (ATTREX 4L) which costs $6.00 per
acre.
</P>
<HR>
<H3>Upcoming Activities &amp; Events</H3>
<P>September 27: Janet Cushman is giving an invited talk in Washington during a
review of a new DOE environmental management program. Dr. Stanley Auerbach,
former Director of ORNL's Environmental Sciences Division, recommended Janet's
perspective on management of a research program that is national in scope. She
also provided background information for a committee report of the National
Research Council. 
</P>
<P>October 2: Marie Walsh is organizing collaborative discussions with several
researchers from University of Tennessee about an agricultural modeling project.
There is growing interest in modifying the USDA agricultural model to include
energy crops. This is aimed at eventually combining data on land-use changes and
erosion predictions to evaluate environmental impacts with regard to sustainable
agriculture.

<P><B>HYBRID POPLARS DISPLAYED AT FARMFEST '96</B></P>
<P> The WesMin Resource Conservation &amp; Development District reported that
the hybrid poplar exhibit developed by WesMin, the Biofuels Feedstock
Development Program, and the U.S. Forest Service generated much interest among
the sixty thousand people attending Minnesota's Farmfest 96 in August. The
exhibit included a plot of hybrid poplar clones established in the spring of
1996. The BFDP paid for exhibit space and tent expenses. The U.S. Forest
Service, a BFDP cooperator, provided the poplar cuttings. WesMin, another BFDP
collaborator, planted and tended the trees. The tree plots will be expanded in
1997 to include new clonal selections. The original planting will be in its
second year of growth and should provide an excellent visual representation of
the growth potential of hybrid poplar.  
</P>
<P><B>INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RELATED TO PLANT BIOTECHNOLOGY</B></P>
<P> Jerry Tuskan has been invited by the National Research Council's Board on
Biology and the Board on Agriculture to participate in a forum on Intellectual
Property Rights and Plant Biotechnology: Challenges for Industry, Government,
and Academe. The November 6, 1996, forum will explore the impact of intellectual
property protection on the progress of plant biology research. Dr. Tuskan will
take part in a panel discussion examining how current practices in the
protection of intellectual property affect research strategies in biobased

How can energy research and development (R&D) for developing countries further such
policy objectives as economic and social development, environmental protection, and U.S.
export promotion?<p>

<IMG SRC="findings.gif"><p>

The highest priority is technology demonstration to reduce the gap between the technology
frontier and technology use in many developing countries. A second priority is technology
adaptation to fit available technologies more closely to developing country conditions: cost
reduction, more simplicity, and robustness, for example.<p>

U.S. energy technology exports depend on the nation's ability to target these activities on 
real development conditions and needs.<p>

<h2>The U.S. Chemical Weapons Disposal Program: Consideration of Impacts</h2>

<HR><P>

<IMG SRC="iab8-9.gif"><p>

<FONT SIZE=-1><i>The risk associated with destroying the U.S. chemical weapons stockpile
is relatively low in comparison to the risk of continuing to store the
weapons.</i><p></FONT>

<IMG SRC="question.gif"><p>

Given an aging U. S. stockpile of lethal chemical weapons located at storage depots in eight
separate states, what is the "best" disposal strategy from the perspective of the nation as a
whole?<p>

<IMG SRC="findings.gif"><p>

Oak Ridge National Laboratory provided technical support to the U.S. Army by preparing a
Final Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement (FPEIS) that assessed the potential
environmental impacts of alternate approaches to destroying the U.S. inventory of chemical
weapons.<p>

Consistent with a Congressional directive, the principal focus of the FPEIS was an integrated
interdisciplinary analysis and comparison of several alternatives: (a) on-site disposal at the
present storage locations, (b) transportation of the site-specific inventories by rail to two
regional disposal centers, (c) transportation of the inventories by rail to a single national
disposal center, and (d) a "no- action" alternative (i.e., continuing to store the stockpile).
Other alternatives that were subjected to analyses included other modes of transportation (e.g.,
air, truck, and barge) and alternate destruction technologies (e.g., incineration and
cryofracture).<p>

It was concluded that the U.S. chemical weapons stockpile could be destroyed in a safe,
environmentally acceptable manner and that the risk of catastrophic accidents would be
relatively low for all programmatic disposal alternatives. On-site disposal was found to pose
less risk to the public and to the environment than alternatives involving transportation of the
stockpile and was therefore selected as the best choice for the destruction of the U.S.
stockpile of chemical weapons.<p>

<h2>Comparison of the ILWAS, MAGIC, and ETD Watershed Acidification Models</h2>

<HR><P>

<IMG SRC="iab4-7.gif"><p>

<FONT SIZE=-1><i>(a) Small watershed with thin soil. (b) Large watershed with thick
soil.</i><p></FONT>

<IMG SRC="question.gif"><p>

How much confidence can be attributed to predictions from any single model in
environmental assessments?<p>

<IMG SRC="findings.gif"><p>

In this study, investigator bias was eliminated and Monte Carlo uncertainty analysis applied to
three commonly used watershed acidification models: the Integrated Lake-Watershed
Acidification Study (ILWAS), the Model of Acidification of Groundwater in Catchment
(MAGIC), and the Enhanced Trickle-Down (ETD). Model forecasts of the acid-neutralizing
capacity (ANC) of lakes under increased acidification scenarios were similar when predictions
were viewed on a relative scale (e.g., changes in ANC), but differed when viewed on an
absolute scale (e.g., number of lakes with ANC less than some value).<p>

Confidence levels in model forecasts can be improved by comparing predictions from
multiple models. If the models are based on sufficiently different hypotheses but predictions
agree, then there may be a  higher confidence than in predictions from any single model.<p>

How should the principles of integrated assessment be applied to governmental decisions on

<IMG SRC="findings.gif"><p>

In Europe, the principles of integrated environmental assessment are currently applied to
single projects and occasionally to programs. A United Nations Task Force for the European
Community, headed by the United States, considered whether and how assessment principles
could be applied to governmental policies, plans, and programs.<p>

The task force concluded that many assessment principles can and should be applied early in
the process of policy formulation. However, there were concerns about public participation
and review procedures, particularly in light of security or military questions. The task force
suggested measures that can be taken to address these concerns.<p>

The work of the task force supports European Community directives dealing with use of
environmental assessment in member nation decision making.<p>

Soil chemistry changes including leaching of nutrients, mobilization of toxic elements such as
aluminum, and fertilization have been postulated and in some places demonstrated to occur in
response to acidic deposition. The extent, magnitude, and implications of such changes have
been measured, mapped, modeled, and debated by Oak Ridge National Laboratory scientists.
Conclusions from these analyses were used for the National Acid Precipitation Assessment
Program and for an evaluation of critical loads of atmospheric sulfate and nitrate deposition.
An effort is under way to model soil and related terrestrial and aquatic effects as part of an
end-to-end assessment including emissions, transport and deposition, effects on natural and
human systems, and social and economic valuation.<p>

The findings will be used as input by the administration and by Congress in evaluation of the

<IMG SRC="findings.gif"><p>

Ecotoxicological benchmarks are estimates of exposure concentrations that, because they pose
minimal risks,  are not of regulatory concern and do not require further assessment. They are
used to refine the list of contaminants of concern, exposure pathways, and ecological
receptors that are evaluated in the assessment. They also allow prioritization of contaminated
sites.<p>

All of these benchmarks have been compiled into one comprehensive database. As new
information becomes available, these benchmark values are revised and publications are
updated.<p>

<h2>Actual vs Predicted Effects of Fuel Ethanol Projects</h2>

<IMG SRC="question.gif"><p>

How well do integrated environmental assessments identify and evaluate the effects of
proposed projects on the human environment?<p>

<IMG SRC="findings.gif"><p>

Few follow-up studies have been conducted on National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA)
assessments to determine if predictions of impacts and effectiveness of mitigation were
adequate. Oak Ridge National Laboratory researchers conducted a retrospective examination
of the predicted and actual environmental effects of three ethanol fuel projects for the U.S.
Department of Energy (DOE).<p>

Using reviews and analyses of existing data, interviews with project and government
personnel, and inspections of completed projects and their environs, the study largely found
that impact analyses adequately addressed the issues of importance.<p>
     
A few adverse effects, however, were either not identified at all (e.g., odor problems) or were
not accurately assessed (e.g., adverse effects of wastewaters on a municipal treatment plant).
Generally, these deficiencies can be attributed to (1) significant differences between project
design and the project as constructed; (2) inaccurate source terms; (3) failure to implement
planned mitigation; and (4) unexpected external environmental changes independent of the
project.<p>

<h2>Risk Assessment for Pre- and Post-Remediation of Uranium Mill Tailings</h2>

<FONT SIZE=-1><i>A comparison of dose rates per property is shown for pre- and
post-remedial action in Monticello, Utah.</i><p></FONT>

<IMG SRC="question.gif"><p>

Does remediation of uranium mill tailings contaminated-properties reduce the risk to residents
of those properties?<p>

<IMG SRC="findings.gif"><p>

Pre-and post-remedial action dose rates were calculated for 101 Monticello, Utah, properties
included in the Monticello Vicinity Remedial Action Project. Dose rates were calculated using
the RESRAD computer code. This calculation indicated that 98% of the effective dose
equivalent was contributed by external gamma and radon emanation. Radium concentrations
were averaged for pre- and post-remedial action measurements. The volume of the deposit
was also used in the dose calculations. In all cases the dose was reduced below 1 mSv
y<sup>-1</sup>
(100 mrem y<sup>-1</sup>). At 77% of the properties it was reduced below the Department
of Energy's
ALARA recommendation (<IMG SRC="http://www.ornl.gov/library/leq.xbm"> 0.30 mSv
y<sup>-1</sup>).<p>

Pre- and post-remedial dose rates were compared with a paired t-test, which showed a
significant difference (reduction) (p &lt; 0.05) in dose rates. The average cost of remedial
action, number of persons per household, number of properties remediated, and the reduction
of cancer mortality risk through remediation resulted in a cost of $5 million per life
saved.<p>

<IMG SRC="question.gif"><p>

What are the cumulative environmental impacts associated with developing hydropower
projects at 19 existing dams in the upper Ohio River basin?<p>

<IMG SRC="findings.gif"><p>

An environmental impact statement was prepared that analyzed both the site-specific
and cumulative impacts of hydropower projects that would occur to critical environmental
resources along a 500-mile reach of the upper Ohio River basin. Alternatives included a range
of power production and environmental protection measures.<p>

Dissolved oxygen concentrations were modeled along the entire reach of the river as a basis
for evaluating impacts to fisheries and related recreational resources. A trade-off analysis
found that, with mitigation, 78% of the proposed power could be generated with only minor
environmental impacts occurring.<p>

<IMG SRC="question.gif"><p>

What benefits can result from expanding Nordhaus's Dynamic Integrated Climate-Economy
(DICE) model to incorporate the energy sector?<p>

<IMG SRC="findings.gif"><p>

The DICE Model has been modified to incorporate the energy sector within a  constant
elasticity of substitution (CES) production function that includes energy inputs. In addition,
the model is also being modified to characterize the linkages between technological progress
and the economy, to simulate technology transfer in a two-region framework, and to
investigate the relationship between human capital and technological advances.<p>

Technological change was explicitly incorporated into a model of the economy and climate
change. The study focuses on the role of technological advances that would impact the level
of uncontrolled greenhouse-gas emissions from fossil fuels, the ability to mitigate emissions,
the development of nonfossil-fuel technologies, the ability to adapt to potential changes in
climate, and economic productivity.<p>

Nordhaus's DICE model has also been expanded into a two-region model, with one region
being the developed countries and the other region being the less-developed countries.<p>

The study provides an example of assessments specifically showing the value of investment in
different energy technology R&D options.<p>

An understanding of the influence of landscape structure is critical for effective land-use

Land use is a good indicator of risk to water quality from surface runoff--the proportion of
landscape in a land-use type, and the dominance and contiguity of that type. This research
improved the researchers' ability to analyze landscape patterns for large geographic areas and
contributed to a customized geographic information system available on the Internet.<p>

<IMG SRC="question.gif"><p>

Are geothermal energy resources exploitable without the attendant environmental impacts
common to extraction and use of other energy resources?<p>

<IMG SRC="findings.gif"><p>

Oak Ridge National Laboratory researchers reviewed environmental assessment documents for
more than 30 geothermal projects. The most likely adverse effects that were identified would
result from geothermal atmospheric emissions, planned and accidental discharges, surface and
groundwater consumption, disturbance or loss of wildlife habitat, ground subsidence,
and noise.<p>

The study included a detailed list of measures that can be implemented to prevent or mitigate
the adverse effects of geothermal developments. For example, in coastal areas of the
geopressured zone, spoil banks could be aligned parallel to natural drainage; roads could be
routed parallel to dune ridges; and canals could be permanently blocked when no longer
needed.<p>

How do you assess ecological risk for the variety of plants and animals that reside on the Oak
Ridge Reservation?<p>

<IMG SRC="findings.gif"><p>

A strategy for ecological risk assessment has been developed for the Oak Ridge Reservation. 
This strategy outlines the spatial areas that should be considered and specific data
requirements.<p>

In support of this strategy,  the Oak Ridge Reservation-wide Ecological Monitoring and
Assessment Program was developed to evaluate effects to wide-ranging species and to
integrate data from source areas to evaluate risk at larger spatial scales.<p>

<IMG SRC="question.gif"><p>

What are the basin-wide environmental impacts associated with multiple hydropower project
developments in an area where water resources are already highly developed and stressed?<p>

<IMG SRC="findings.gif"><p>

An environmental impact statement was prepared to evaluate the impacts of the proposed
development of seven hydropower projects in the Owens River Basin, California.<p>

The assessment of cumulative impacts focused on resident trout, riparian vegetation,
aesthetics, recreation, and the local economy. The impacts to these resources were quantified
to the extent possible, and each project was ranked in terms of severity of impacts.<p>

The study found that development of the seven projects would result in significant cumulative
environmental impacts and recommended that, with appropriate mitigation, only four of the
projects could be developed with acceptable levels of environmental impacts.<p>

<h2>Impacts of Increased Sea Levels on Coastlines</h2>

<HR><P>

<IMG SRC="iab2-18.gif"><p>

<FONT SIZE=-1><i>Impact of increased sea levels on coastlines and species habitats in the
U.S. Southeast.</i><p></FONT>

<IMG SRC="question.gif"><p>

How will high-risk coastlines respond to increases in sea level? How does the loss of land
impact coastal development and species habitats?<p>

<IMG SRC="findings.gif"><p>

Areas at risk to increased erosion rates and inundation from sea-level rise in the U.S.
Southeast were identified using a coastal hazards database. Approximately 66% of the
coastline in the U.S. Southeast is developed, with the remainder being located in or near state
and national parks, refuges, and seashores.<p>

Based on the climate change scenarios of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
(1990), nine case studies have been performed for high-risk sections of the coastline. In
general these studies found that developed portions of the coast are located on sandy barrier
islands or on sandy mainland coasts. These areas will primarily experience increased beach
erosion rates because of sea-level rise that will place billions of dollars worth of resort and
recreational facilities at risk.<p>

Undeveloped areas tend to consist of coastal wetlands, with most of the undeveloped sandy
coasts and barrier islands being protected by federal or state law. The primary threat to
coastal wetlands is from inundation. Reduction in the extent of these wetland habitats may
have a significant impact on the continued existence of several endangered and threatened
species. For example, in South Carolina a rate of sea-level rise of as little as 4.5 mm/year (the
current regional rate is 2 to 3 mm/year) would place more than 50% of the bald eagle,
Bachman's warbler, red-cockaded woodpecker, and brown pelican habitat at risk to
destruction.<p>

<h2>Identification of Coastlines at Risk to Sea-Level Rise</h2>

<HR><P>

<IMG SRC="iab2-17.gif"><p>

<FONT SIZE=-1><i>Different levels of risk for hazards associated with sea-level rise are
identified along the South Carolina coast.</i><p></FONT>

<IMG SRC="question.gif"><p>

How are areas at risk to inundation and increased erosion hazards associated with sea-level
rise identified?<p>

<IMG SRC="findings.gif"><p>

Four databases have been developed to help identify coastal areas at risk to inundation and
increased erosion hazards in the United States. One contains climatic data on the intensity and
frequencies of storms that may affect the coastal zone. The others contain data on more than
22 land and marine variables for the U.S. East, Gulf, and West coasts.<p>

These databases have been used to study and assess both the erosion and permanent or
episodic inundation potential of storm-induced or climate change increases in sea level. These
assessments were designed to be used by regional planners for the identification of high-risk
areas for more detailed study. Areas at risk were identified using a "coastal vulnerability
index," which weighted 7 to 13 variables according to the perceived importance of each in
determining the relative vulnerability of an area to sea-level rise.<p>

Completed analyses for the U.S. East and Gulf coasts identified the U.S. Southeast as one of
the most vulnerable regions. The Southeast, which extends from the Virginia and South
Carolina border to the Texas and Mexican border, contains 85% of the U.S. coastal wetlands
and 50% of the barrier islands. Of the region's 34,000 km of coastline, more than 40% has
been identified as being at high risk to episodic and permanent increases in sea level.<p>

<h2>Computerized Rapid Screening of Hazard</h2>

<FONT SIZE=-1><i>Hazardous chemicals: Finding the right neighborhood.</i><p></FONT>

<IMG SRC="question.gif"><p>

Is there a more rapid method for identifying the seriously hazardous chemicals out of the tens
of thousands of industrial chemicals than the current expert-committee process?<p>

<IMG SRC="findings.gif"><p>

In 1983, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, in support of the DOE synthetic fuels development
program, was charged to "justify the need to monitor specific unregulated substances and to
provide threshold values above which these substances must be monitored." In response, the
Rapid Screening of Hazard (RASH) method was developed as a chemical scoring system to
be used by either the expert or the nonexpert in the absence of compound-specific guidance
from regulatory agencies.<p>

The method was based on the hypothesis that toxicity-induced compensatory cell proliferation
can serve as a practical upper-limit index of carcinogenic promotion. This model has proven
to be more accurate than predictions based on structure-activity relationships, individual
screening bioassays, or combinations of bioassays and current artificial intelligence programs
and only slightly less accurate than the individual time intensive predictions by two of the
most respected experts in carcinogenic testing. The RASH method is currently being
computerized.<p>

<h2>Health Sciences Research Division</h2>

<HR><P>

The Health Sciences Research Division (HSRD) of Oak Ridge National Laboratory conducts a
broad range of basic and applied research in the general area of life sciences. Cause-effect
mechanisms of action are studied at several levels of biological structure that include
subatomic, atomic, molecular, cellular, tissue, organ, and organism toxicological
perspectives.<p>

HSRD has developed an almost unique capacity for analytical study that includes source
evaluation, environment transport, field characterization, biomonitoring, and dose-response
analysis. The integrated processes span from the conceptual interface--biological and chemical
processes merge into physical interactions--to various toxicological endpoints in cells,
laboratory animals, and humans.<p>

In addition, basic radiological, chemical, and biological processes are used to predict potential
risks to humans from exposures to hazardous agents for which (1) no directly relevant
databases are available, (2) available data are ambiguous as demonstrated by electric/magnetic
fields and low concentrations of established hazardous chemicals, or (3) exposures may illicit
an untoward response only when combined with joint exposures to other insults.<p>

Research areas include basic, applied, and project-specific studies for the Department of
Energy, other federal agencies, and industry in support of:<p>

<UL>
<LI>environmental decontamination and device decommissioning;<br>
<LI>energy, material, and process-development technologies;<br>
<LI>environmental, regulatory, and technological policy; and<br>
<LI>nuclear medicine.<p>
</UL>

More than 200 regular staff members are organized into areas of assessment technology,
biological and radiation physics, biological and information analysis, chemical physics,
environmental technology, and risk analysis. These sections are supported by about 250
subcontractors, guests, fellows, and students and enable HSRD to maintain strong
international leadership in many areas.<p>

Can the needs of the anadromous salmon population that uses the Mokelumne River for
spawning and rearing be met if the water demand of the many human users of this river is
sustained?<p>

<IMG SRC="findings.gif"><p>

A hydrologic assessment of the Mokelumne River, an economic assessment of human
demands, and a biological assessment of the fishery to determine minimum instream flow
requirements at a federally licensed hydropower dam were combined. The analysis identified
minimum flow requirements from the dam that would minimize water supply impacts and
maximize the habitat available for the salmon. The Oak Ridge National Laboratory alternative
compares well with alternatives developed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the
California Department of Fish and Game, and the East Bay Municipal Utility District.<p>

What are the environmental resources at risk in constructing and operating a scenic
parkway?<p>

<IMG SRC="findings.gif"><p>

Field studies of geology, soils, ecological resources, socio-economics, aesthetics, air and water
quality, and traffic were conducted along a 1000-ft corridor to determine the environmental
consequences of completing a 10-mile segment of the Foothills Parkway in the Great Smoky
Mountains National Park in Tennessee.<p>

The assessment found that potentially significant impacts result from slope instability and
habitat loss for a variety of aquatic and terrestrial species. Mitigation measures were
recommended to minimize such impacts. The National Park Service used this environmental
report as a basis for its environmental impact statement on the proposed project.<p>

<h2>Oak Ridge National Laboratory</h2>

<HR><P>

The mission of Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) is to advance the frontiers of science
and technology in three broad arenas: energy, the environment, and economic
competitiveness.<p>

ORNL staff are seeking better ways of producing, distributing, and conserving energy. They
work to reduce the environmental and health effects of energy technologies and to increase
understanding of environmental processes. Scientists, engineers, and policy experts at ORNL
are working to shape energy options and policies that are sensible, comprehensive, and
visionary.<p>

ORNL's environmental expertise has its roots in pioneering studies of the ecological effects of
radioactive fallout. In the 1960s, experiments used radioisotopes to "tag" forest nutrients,
shedding light on key chemical reactions in the nutrient cycle and revealing the role played
by bacteria and insects in breaking down organic matter. ORNL has gone on to examine the
effects of radioactive and chemical contamination of the food chain: the ecological effects of
releasing heated water from power plants into rivers: and the environmental impacts of new
power plants, hydroelectric dams, and other energy-related projects. In addition, ORNL's
expertise in instrumentation, detection, and ecosystem modeling--likewise rooted in nuclear
studies--is now being harnessed to develop sophisticated new methods for pollutant detection
and environmental monitoring.<p>

ORNL is committed to helping maintain the U.S. lead in science and technology. ORNL's
expert staff, specialized facilities, and innovative knowledge-sharing programs make it one of
the nations's leaders in restoring Americas's competitive edge. Collaborations linking ORNL
with U.S. industries and universities bridge long-standing gaps between pure research and
manufacturing technology. Flexible arrangements and an open environment make it possible
for thousands of outside experimenters to benefit from ORNL's capabilities each year. And
ongoing partnerships with The University of Tennessee and the Tennessee Valley Authority
leverage ORNL's resources in both research and the energy industry. ORNL also strongly
supports and promotes math and science education to inspire a new generation of scientists
and engineers.<p>

In pursuit of its mission, ORNL conducts basic and applied research in these key areas of
strength:<p>

<UL>
<LI>materials sciences and engineering;<br>
<LI>physical, chemical, and engineering sciences;<br>
<LI>biological and life sciences;<br>
<LI>computational sciences; and<br>
<LI>manufacturing sciences and technologies.<p>
</UL>

ORNL melds a unique blend of excellent researchers with a large array of world-class
facilities to conduct broad, interdisciplinary research. The interface between the life and social
sciences with energy technology development and the ability to integrate basic research,
applied research, technology development, information dissemination, and technology transfer
is unsurpassed among research institutions.<p>

<IMG SRC="question.gif"><p>

What costs and benefits will result from the use of alternative transportation fuels such as
ethanol, methanol, compressed natural gas, and electricity?<p>

<IMG SRC="findings.gif"><p>

The increased costs of all alternative fuels, their lesser energy densities, and the uncertainties
about the performance of vehicles are likely to make consumers resistant to using those fuels
in the near future. In the long run, however, fuels from natural gas and propane appear to be
able to compete with petroleum fuels. Costs of infrastructure for distribution and refueling are
relatively modest.<p>

Biofuels or increased electricity production by means of nuclear energy and photovoltaic
energy is necessary for significant reductions in greenhouse gases to occur.<p>

Research in progress addresses the costs of making a transition to alternative fuels, as well as
related policy issues.<p>

<IMG SRC="question.gif"><p>

What are the major environmental impacts and mitigation measures related to Air Force
flying operations?<p>

<IMG SRC="findings.gif"><p>

Both site-specific and generic studies of Air Force flying operations have revealed that the
public response to noise from the biological, psychological, physical and cultural perspectives
is a principal environmental consideration.<p>

Safety risk associated with potential aircraft crashes in flight paths around the air bases is also
an important consideration. Potential hazards must be mitigated by providing sufficient
buffers for both noise and flight safety purposes. These factors are integral to the
establishment of land use priorities in the vicinity of air bases, i.e., Air Installation
Compatible Use Zones and routinely-used flight paths called Military Operations Areas.<p>

Additionally, flight support operations require the storing of extensive amounts of aircraft
fuel, usually in underground storage tanks. They also typically involve the use of a variety of
other hazardous substances, which must be stored then disposed of eventually. These issues
become extremely important for the assessment of potential air and water contamination, the
Installation Restoration Program, and for future land use when the air base is deactivated.<p>

<h2>Reconnaissance Radiological Characterization</h2>

<IMG SRC="iab8-12.gif"><p>

<FONT SIZE=-1><i>This grid was used in radiation surveys at White Point Nike Missile
Site, San Pedro, California.</i><p></FONT>

<IMG SRC="question.gif"><p>

Are radioisotopes associated with past Department of Defense (DOD) operations at the White
Point Nike Missile Site in San Pedro, California, present within accepted background
levels?<p>

<IMG SRC="findings.gif"><p>

White Point is located in the city of Los Angeles and was used in the 1950s as a Nike missile
(uranium-tipped warheads) battery. The Nike Air Defense Program was discontinued in the
early 1970s, and the 71-hectare site was declared excess. The city of Los Angeles intended to
make the site a park, and it was therefore necessary to determine the levels of radioactivity on
the site. There was no evidence or any reason to believe that any man-made radioactivity was
present, however.<p>

A study was conducted to determine the radioactive contaminant levels. This was
accomplished by performing radiation surveys using the Ultrasonic Ranging and Data Systems
(USRADS) for field surveys, survey of the interior of abandoned facilities, and random soil
sampling. Alpha and beta-gamma radiation measurements and soil samples were taken at the
same coordinates. USRADS was used for field surveys, which included roadways and
building access areas. Indoor surveys and smears were conducted inside abandoned buildings.
Background samples were taken upwind of the site.<p>

The reconnaissance survey showed no indications of elevated anthropogenic radiation
concentrations to DOD operations at the site. This study provided valuable information on
collecting negative data with USRADS and other survey methodologies to show that
contamination is not present.<p>

Will there be any changes to the world petroleum trade patterns in the year 2000 as a result
of the democratization in the Former Soviet Union (FSU) and Eastern Europe (EE)?<p>

<IMG SRC="findings.gif"><p>

The Middle East will continue to be the dominant supplier in the world oil market. A
significant portion of FSU exports will come to North America, and EE will import 50% of
its crude oil from the Middle East.<p>

Much uncertainty remains about the level of future FSU crude oil production.  Any major
FSU crude oil production loss will be compensated by higher production in the Middle East,
Latin America, Africa, and the Far East. A big worldwide market exists for the FSU
petroleum; however, many non-geological factors will determine whether the FSU will play a
major role as an oil exporter in the future.<p>

<h2>Evolutionary Algorithms for Technology Adoption and Diffusion</h2>

<HR><P>

<IMG SRC="iab2-13.gif"><p>

<FONT SIZE=-1><i>The emergence of a spatial pattern of technology selection is shown,
with the increasing dominance of a single technology. The dominant technology is
demonstrated through the solid blocks on the left and the top line on the
right.</i><p></FONT>

<IMG SRC="question.gif"><p>

What can be learned from new individual-based evolutionary algorithms about the adoption
and diffusion of new complex technological systems and networks?<p>

<IMG SRC="findings.gif"><p>

Complex technologies (e.g., new computer systems or vehicle/motor-fuel systems) often
involve a network of related or compatible technologies and support infrastructure. The
patterns of new technology adoption are influenced by issues of technology compatibility and
infrastructural requirements. Evolutionary algorithms are well suited to modeling populations
of representative economic agents or individuals. The representative agents make independent
technology choices, but consider the compatibility of their choices with the choices of other
agents and with the installed base infrastructure.<p>

The above figure shows the emergence of a spatial pattern of technology selection (the
grouping of dark and patterned blocks), and the increasing dominance of a single technology
(the technology share history lines on the right).  Using alternative-fueled vehicles as an
example, the approach is used to examine path dependence, the possibility of technology
lock-in, and the opportunities for successful new technology introduction through niche
dominance.<p>

<FONT SIZE=-1><i>Hypothetical sampling transect through a spill site.</i><p></FONT>

<IMG SRC="question.gif"><p>

Can historical data, not collected specifically for determination of background concentrations,
be used to develop soil cleanup guidelines?<p>

<IMG SRC="findings.gif"><p>

Historical data from the Department of Energy's Kansas City Plant were evaluated with
log-probability plots to determine background concentrations of naturally-occurring metals
that were also site contaminants. The background values determined by this method were
consistent with those reported in the literature for the region. Moreover, it was also possible
to clearly separate the contaminant population from the background population.<p>

This approach was accepted by the State of Missouri and the Environmental Protection
Agency, Region VII. It has been used in numerous documents supporting site cleanup
efforts.<p>

<h2>Estimating the Externalities of Fuel Cycles</h2>

<HR><P>

<IMG SRC="iab1-12.gif"><p>

<FONT SIZE=-1><i>The U.S. Fuel Cycle Study team at Oak Ridge National Laboratory
developed a methodological framework to estimate environmental externalities associated with
energy produced by coal. This methodology will be applied to nuclear, biomass, natural gas,
oil, and hydro fuel cycles, as well.</i><p></FONT>

<IMG SRC="question.gif"><p>

How are the externalities associated with fuel cycles estimated? <p>

<IMG SRC="findings.gif"><p>

Externalities are effects of electric power on the welfare of others. A fuel cycle consists of
the stages in generating electric power such as mining, transportation, and waste disposal.
This study was conducted for the U.S. Department of Energy and the Commission of the
European Communities. It addressed the different fuel cycles of coal, biomass, nuclear
technologies, hydropower, and natural gas.<p>

Major products of the study are a methodological framework and a set of analytical tools that
can be used at each step of the methodology. The study emphasizes that externalities
generally depend on the design of the power plant, its location, and the extant regulations that
may have some of the damages already reflected in the price of electric power. Numerical
examples in the study suggest that some of the more important externalities for different fuel
cycles are:<p>
<UL>
<LI>coal: health effects from particulate matter unless baseline concentrations are very low,
morbidity from exposure to ozone in areas already high in ozone concentration, crop damage
from ozone, road damage if trucks are used to transport fuel to the power plant, and injuries
and fatalities from transportation accidents;<p>
<LI>biomass: health effects from particulate matter and ozone, and road damage and
accidents
from transporting biomass feedstock to the power plant;<p>
<LI>nuclear technologies: remediation costs from a severe accident (should one occur),
expected
effects to public health from releases of radioactive materials during transport, and
occupational and public fatalities from exposure to radon from uranium mines;<p>
<LI>hydropower: minor externalities, unless sensitive habitats or highly valued areas are
disturbed
or intruded upon; and <p>
<LI>natural gas: health effects from ozone and particulate matter.<p>

<h2>Health Risk from Tritium at Fusion Power Plants</h2>

<FONT SIZE=-1><i>Cleanup systems are required to protect the environment from accidental
and routine releases of tritium.</i><p></FONT>

<IMG SRC="question.gif"><p>

What are the underlying factors that change tritium gas, T<sub>2</sub>, to tritiated water,
HTO?<p>

<IMG SRC="findings.gif"><p>

Tritium will be a fuel at future fusion reactors, but health risks for tritium differ between its
form as T<sub>2</sub> gas and its form as HTO. Because tritium in the water form is about
25,000 times
more hazardous than in the gas form, evaluation of human health risks for a number of
situations around future fusion reactor plants depends on knowledge of how tritium converts
from T<sub>2</sub> to HTO. A series of experimental and theoretical studies were
undertaken to measure
needed parameters and to calculate others. This effort resulted in the development of validated
rate equations, which spanned more than seven orders of magnitude in tritium concentration.
Health risks from a wide variety of possible situations can now be calculated. These
calculations provide input for future design and siting requirements for tritium-fueled fusion
reactors.<p>

<FONT SIZE=-1><i>The estimated demand curve is shown for group visits to the University
of Tennessee Arboretum.</i><p></FONT>

<IMG SRC="question.gif"><p>

Many studies have estimated demand for visits to recreation sites. Can an estimate of visitor
use-value be obtained from interface surveys at arboreta? How might consumer use-value be
estimated? What might the consumer use-value be for this nonmarket resource service? Does
this value derived represent the entire value of the arboretum?<p>

<IMG SRC="findings.gif"><p>

The data was collected from interface surveys of visitors at the University of Tennessee
Research Arboretum. A recreation demand curve was estimated using truncated regression.
The estimated demand curve represented annual visits to the arboretum per group.<p>

It shows the predicted number of visits per group when total travel cost is allowed to vary,
holding income constant at its means. The price elasticity of demand for visits per group is
estimated to be -0.35, which is equal to the estimated coefficient parameter for total travel
costs when the functional form estimated is log-linear. Per group consumer surplus was
estimated to be $352.47. This amount was divided by the mean number of group visits per
year (6.9) to estimate average consumer surplus per group visit of $51.08.<p>

From the survey, average group size was 2.5 persons, yielding a consumer surplus estimate of
$20.43 per visit. An estimate of total visitor use-value for the arboretum of $355,433 per year
was obtained.<p>

<h2>Third-World Debt and Tropical Deforestation</h2>

<HR><P>

<IMG SRC="iab3-11.gif"><p>

<FONT SIZE=-1><i>Linkages are shown between debt, forests, macroeconomic and
microeconomic conditions, and the public sector.</i><p></FONT>

<IMG SRC="question.gif"><p>

What economic factors have contributed to the recent rapid deforestation in tropical countries?
Has the increase in external debt led to increased deforestation in these countries?<p>

<IMG SRC="findings.gif"><p>

The deforestation and degradation of tropical forests are taking place at an extremely rapid
pace. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the estimated annual rate
of tropical deforestation during the 1981-1985 period was 113,846 square kilometers or 0.6%
of the 1981 total forested area. The implications of the loss of these forests are
staggering.<p>

Tropical forests are extremely rich ecosystems that support a disproportionate large share of
the world's plant and animal species. Forests play a crucial role in both nutrient and
hydrological cycling and may provide sustainable economic benefits through managed
harvesting of timber and the collection of non-timber products such as fruits, nuts, and rubber.
Also, deforestation is a significant source of global warming through its effects on the global
carbon cycle.<p>

This study focuses on the relationship between debt and deforestation, examining conceptual
and empirical arguments that debt is a source of deforestation pressure. It was shown that
debt is significantly correlated with deforestation under a wide variety of assumptions and
specifications.<p>

<h2>Integrated Assessment Workshop</h2>

<HR><P>

<IMG SRC="iab2-11.gif"><p>

<FONT SIZE=-1><i>At a workshop in Washington, D.C., Mike Farrell, the director of the
Center for Global Environmental Studies at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, discusses the
importance of integrated assessment to key policy issues.</i><p></FONT>

<IMG SRC="question.gif"><p>

What aspects of integrated assessment make it able to address key policy issues?<p>

<IMG SRC="findings.gif"><p>

A workshop on Integrated Assessment: Characterizing Key Policy Issues was held June 28-
29, 1994, in Washington, D.C., with more than 90 participants. Introductory presentations
explained the importance of integrated assessment and presented a framework for
characterizing key policy issues for global change. This framework is explained below.<p>

<B>Process Counts</B>. The most important aspect of assessment is the process of
communication,
review, stakeholder involvement, broadening of perspectives, balancing of needs, bartering of
support, discovery of common goals, gradual understanding, and evolutionary resolution that
occurs. Assessment is not simply a report.<p>

<B>Multiple Approaches Are Needed</B>. An assessment must use a variety of approaches
with
fundamentally different assumptions, with a wide range in focus, and with differing levels of
analytical sophistication (from back-of-the-envelope calculations to different kinds of
end-to-end modeling).<p>

<B>Effects Dominate</B>. Perceived ecological, social, and economic consequences of
global climate
change will determine the most pressing needs for integrated assessment's support of policy
decisions.<p>

<B>Context Is Important</B>. The assessment process and its results should be viewed in the
context
of the policy issues at hand, the broader social and environmental policy issues facing the
United States, the availability of information, and the experience and background of the
stakeholders and decision makers.<p>


<B>Uncertainty Must Be Characterized</B>. Uncertainty must be considered in a meaningful
way and
communicated to lay audiences in an understandable manner.<p>

<h2>Integrated Dose Modeling for Chemical Weapons Accidents</h2>

<HR><P>

<IMG SRC="iab6-14.gif"><p>

<FONT SIZE=-1><i>PADRE simulation model logo.</i><p></FONT>

<IMG SRC="question.gif"><p>

How can accurate predictions of exposure to accidental releases of chemicals be made in view
of alternative protective action guides, emergency technologies, and human behavior?<p>

<IMG SRC="findings.gif"><p>

PADRE, or the Protective Action Dose Reduction Estimator, has been developed at Oak
Ridge National Laboratory by integrating physical, health, and social science knowledge
related to dose estimation.<p>

The model is designed to iteratively present the user with dialog screens to set accident
parameters, to specify the emergency response, and designate the protective actions employed.

The results are portrayed as the accumulation of the outside exposure to a chemical agent
over time for someone taking no protective action and for the accumulated exposure given the
chosen emergency system and protective action.<p>

Planners can see when the plume arrives, when it departs, the expected dose reduction from
the protective action scenario, and how much more dose savings can be achieved by reducing
response time. PADRE allows the user to change scenarios and analyze the change in
exposure to chemical agents.<p>

The interface allows the user to quickly change the accident scenario and meteorological
conditions, and it specifies an air exchange rate for a structure and evaluation time. In
addition, PADRE takes into account how long officials take to issue a warning; the type of
warning system in place to alert the public, including sirens, tone alert radios and others; and
the speed of public response. PADRE simulates the effectiveness of respiratory protection.
This simulation is useful for situations in which occupational safety or worker protection is of
interest. The model is being developed with support from the Federal Emergency
Management Agency as part of the Chemical Stockpile Emergency Preparedness Program.<p>

<IMG SRC="question.gif"><p>

What are the major factors promoting deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon?<p>

<IMG SRC="findings.gif"><p>

Road development, initial soil conditions, and the distance of farms from markets can explain
much of the deforestation and land degradation.<p>

A model simulates how feed-back from socioeconomic and ecological aspects of land-use
change can increase the rate of land degradation.<p>

Land-use changes can be used to estimate changes in biodiversity, land degradation, and
atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> and the effects of tropical deforestation.<p>

<h2>Land-Use Management for Carbon Sequestration</h2>

<HR><P>

<IMG SRC="iab2-16.gif"><p>

<FONT SIZE=-1><i>Mean annual carbon emissions from alternative land-use management
options (1991-2001). Notes: For reduction of deforestation rates, recovery is the restoration to
carbon levels of undegraded forest. Agroforestry options involve the conversion of 2 or 4% of
agricultural land each year sequestering 20% of the carbon of a mature plantation. Industrial
reforestation options involve the planting of 0.1% of all land capable of sequestering at least
4 tonnes of carbon each year or the offset of all current industrial wood
removals.</i><p></FONT>

<IMG SRC="question.gif"><p>

That is the magnitude of carbon emissions and the potential for sequestering carbon from
alternative land-use management options in SubSaharan Africa?<p>

<IMG SRC="findings.gif"><p>

Current land-based emissions of carbon are of the order of 152 million tonnes each year.<p>

Reducing deforestation by half could lower emissions to 21 million tonnes. Agroforestry, if
adopted at a rate of 2 to 4% annually, could reduce annual carbon emissions by about 38 to
66 million tonnes. Offsetting industrial roundwood removals or converting one-tenth of high
and medium productivity land back to forest each year could result in the sequestration of
about 11 to 18 million tonnes annually.<p>

The direct costs of carbon sequestration are low and are estimated at $3 to $22 per tonne
depending on the specific land-use policy.<p>

<h2>Amoebae-Associated Bacteria in Biodegradation and Bioremediation</h2>

<IMG SRC="iab8-11.gif"><p>

<FONT SIZE=-1><i>An electron micrograph of amoebae. Amoebae can protect bacteria from
environmental pollutants.</i><p></FONT>

<IMG SRC="question.gif"><p>

Are there novel sources of microbes useful in the bioremediation of explosives and other
toxic wastes?<p>

<IMG SRC="findings.gif"><p>

Arms reduction relative to the cessation of the Cold War refocuses priorities from arms
production to weapons destruction. The four major wars as well as the Cold War in this
century resulted in arms production in many disparate sites in this country and abroad.
Disposal or destruction of these contaminants requires innovative procedures as alternatives to
incineration, which is too costly or no longer permitted. The manufacture of special and
conventional weapons systems within the Department of Energy complexes produce a variety
of chemical products (TNT, RDX, HMX, etc., as well as their metabolites) that require
special treatment for disposal. Application of biodegradation and bioremediation techniques
may potentially provide the only viable solution.<p>

The exploration of this relatively unexamined microbial niche has resulted in bacterial
degradation patents. These bacteria have shown unusual desorbing and degradative capabilities
upon interaction with a variety of environmental contaminants, including the destruction of
TCE and desorption of mercury from soil. Recently studies have shown that these microbes
also can transform or degrade TNT from contaminated soil. Preliminary studies undertaken in
conjunction with Explosive Ordinance Disposal Technologies, Inc., (EODT), likewise
indicates the degradation of napalm by the microbes. These results indicate the
amoebic/bacterial consortium can degrade a variety of recalcitrant contaminants and may be
particularly useful in degrading explosives.<p>

<h2>Ecological Risks in the DOE Environmental Restoration Project</h2>

<FONT SIZE=-1><i>Assessments can evaluate the comparative ecological risks of remedial
action alternatives.</i><p></FONT>

<IMG SRC="question.gif"><p>

What are the comparative ecological risks of remedial action alternatives at Department of
Energy (DOE) facilities?<p>

<IMG SRC="findings.gif"><p>

DOE operates dozens of research and weapons production facilities. Some of these facilities
occupy several hundred square miles and have been largely protected from human disturbance
for the last 50 years. Many have vegetation types and species that have become rare in
surrounding areas.<p>

The ecological benefits of actions taken to remediate past contamination must be balanced
against the ecological costs of the land disturbance caused by the remediation. Relative
ecological risks and benefits of environmental restoration were assessed at six of these
facilities.<p>

The assessment showed that potentially significant levels of contamination were present at all
sites. However, only a small fraction of the total area of most facilities was affected. Facility
managers should perform site-specific assessments of the ecological value of areas proposed
for remedial action.<p>

<HR><P>

<IMG SRC="iab4-17.gif"><p>

<FONT SIZE=-1><i>The atmosphere/surface exchange of mercury (Hg).</i><p></FONT>

<IMG SRC="question.gif"><p>

How does dry deposition contribute to the atmosphere/surface exchange of mercury in a
forest, and could it be significant in the global metal cycle?<p>

<IMG SRC="findings.gif"><p>

Wet deposition alone cannot account for all the mercury apparently accumulating in lakes in
forested watersheds.<p>

The atmospheric concentration of mercury vapor is strongly related to air temperature,
suggesting the importance of surface soil emissions. A similar relationship exists between the
dry deposition of mercury and air temperature; modeled dry deposition velocities increase
with temperature because of the strong physiological control over the mesophyll pathway for
uptake of mercury.<p>

Dry deposition may be the dominant input process in a forest during the summer.<p>

A general increase in global temperature would have profound implications for the global
biogeochemical cycle of mercury, possibly resulting in increased rates of transfer of mercury
from the geosphere to the biosphere.<p>

<IMG SRC="findings.gif"><p>

Over 160 policy options were identified for consideration for inclusion in policy
packages.<p>

Detailed analysis of each option is required before it is adopted into a national policy
package.<p>

Six considerations are recommended as particularly relevant: complementarity of instruments,
balance of flexibility and effect, demonstrability of effectiveness, linkage to other goals,

Does the fate of research balloons in Antarctica constitute a significant impact on the
environment?<p>

<IMG SRC="findings.gif"><p>

Scientists at Oak Ridge National Laboratory evaluated potential effects of balloon operations
by the U.S. Antarctic Program. They found that in one important respect there may be a real
environmental concern regarding the use of balloons in Antarctica.<p>

The cumulative annual releases of balloons from all stations in the Antarctic probably number
in the thousands. Because many of the world's great whales, all of which are endangered,
frequent Antarctic waters, they are susceptible to the ingestion of plastic and other synthetic
materials that are present. A simple model was developed to predict the frequency of
encounters with balloons on individual and population bases.<p>

Although the inadequacy of currently available data dictated the use of several conservative
assumptions, the resulting whale/balloon encounter frequencies were so high (in the thousands
per year in some scenarios), that application of even very low fatality-to- encounter ratios
resulted in predictions of losses of these endangered animals.<p>

<h2>Assessing Impacts to Forests</h2>

<HR><P>

<FONT SIZE=-1><i>Models at different levels of biological organization can be used to
assess the impacts of climate change on forests.</i><p></FONT>

<IMG SRC="question.gif"><p>

What models can address the impacts of climate change on forests?<p>

<IMG SRC="findings.gif"><p>

Models for addressing the impacts of climate changes in forests exist at different levels of
biological organization: global, regional, landscape, community, and individual tree. No one
model can address all impacts, but landscape transition models and regional vegetation and
land-use models have been used to consider more impacts than the other models.<p>

The development of landscape vegetation dynamics models of functional groups is suggested
as a means to integrate the theory of both landscape ecology and individual tree responses to
climate change. Risk assessment methodologies can be adapted to deal with the impacts of
climate change at various spatial and temporal scales.<p>
  
Four areas of research needing additional effort are identified: (1) linking socioeconomic and
ecologic models, (2) interfacing forest models at different scales, (3) obtaining data on
susceptibility of trees and forest to changes in climate and disturbance regimes, and (4)
relating information from different scales.<p>

<IMG SRC="question.gif"><p>

What will be the consequences of a 10,000-year recurrence interval flood to the safety of
operations at the Gaseous Diffusion Plants?<p>

<IMG SRC="findings.gif"><p>

Regional flooding of the Ohio River in Kentucky and the Scioto River in Ohio having at least
a 10,000-year recurrence interval will not jeopardize occupant safety, continued operation, or
the containment of hazardous materials at the Paducah or Portsmouth Gaseous Diffusion
Plants. Flooding as a result of locally intense storms having a recurrence interval of 10,000
years will result in ponding over the Paducah and Portsmouth Gaseous Diffusion Plant sites.
Improved emergency preparedness procedures would be sufficient to ensure protection of
occupant safety, continued operation, and the containment of hazardous materials from
flooding of the site.<p>

Intense local storms with a recurrence interval of 10,000 years would result in excessive
ponding on the roofs of the main diffusion plant buildings.  The ponding would lead to roof
collapse unless the roof drainage system can be assured to be fully functional during the
storm. Building modifications will be required if such assurances cannot be demonstrated.<p>

<h2>Effects of Sea Level Rise on Threatened and Endangered Species</h2>

<HR><P>

<IMG SRC="iab2-19.gif"><p>

<FONT SIZE=-1><i>Percentage of Cape Romaine refuge lost to different sea level rise
scenarios.</i><p></FONT>

<IMG SRC="question.gif"><p>

How will the sea level rise impact the habitats of threatened and endangered species that live
in the coastal zones of the U.S. Southeast, specifically South Carolina and the Cape Romain
National Wildlife Refuge?<p>

<IMG SRC="findings.gif"><p>

Of the 70 endangered or threatened species that occur within the U.S. Southeast, 27.5% have
habitats that are within 3 m of mean sea level.<p>

In South Carolina the American alligator, Bachman's warbler, bald eagle, brown pelican,
loggerhead sea turtle, piping plover, red-cockaded woodpecker, shortnose sturgeon, and wood
stork have significant amounts of their habitats in the coastal zone. These species will be
adversely affected by an increase in sea level. The Bachman's warbler and red-cockaded
woodpecker, for instance, will have more than 50% of their habitat in danger from sea level
rise by the year 2100.<p>

Cape Romaine National Wildlife Refuge, South Carolina, serves as feeding and nesting
grounds for several endangered or threatened species. The most prominent of these are the
American alligator, loggerhead sea turtle, brown pelican, and wood stork. If the current rate
of relative sea level rise increases to 5 mm/year or greater by the year 2100 (the current rate
is 3.3 mm/year), then the refuge's marshlands and barrier islands could be reduced in size by
as much as 58%. Destruction of this amount of habitat may make the area unsuitable for
those species that are currently inhabiting the refuge.<p>

<h2>Testing the Feasibility of Recreation Benefit Function Transferability</h2>

<HR><P>

<IMG SRC="iab7-10.gif"><p>

<FONT SIZE=-1><i>This table shows the results of a study testing the reliability of the
benefit function transfer approach.</i><p></FONT>

<IMG SRC="question.gif"><p>

What are the conditions under which the transfer of recreational benefits may be tenable?
Considering the information that exists about nonmarket resource valuation, is the issue of
benefits transfer a viable topic? How can statistically sound methods be established by which
feasibility may be determined?<p>

<IMG SRC="findings.gif"><p>

This research presents an experiment designed to test the reliability of the benefit function
transfer approach using contingent valuation methods. Benefit transfer in this case refers to
the process by which a benefit estimated for a particular study site for which data exist is
transferred to a policy site for which no data exist. At issue in the functions transfer approach
is the presence of statistically similar contingent valuation functions that may yield similar
welfare measures.<p>

The procedure of utilizing the benefit function transfer approach to determine terms of
appropriated compensation to harmed individuals at a policy site is unreliable. This is so
because many of the benefit functions that were transferable did not yield statistically familiar
benefit estimates. Thus, benefits that are transferred from a study site to a policy site using
the benefit function transfer approach could be misleading or inaccurate.<p>

The overall conclusion, at least for the data at hand, is that the benefit function transfer
approach is not a reliable approach for the transfer of benefits. It is suspected that the
nonlinearity of the logic model used to estimate the benefit functions and the nonlinearity of
the benefits estimates themselves greatly contribute to this result. The nonlinearities introduce
possible asymmetries, which lead to the divergence between statistically similar benefit
functions and their respective benefit estimates.<p>

<A HREF="http://www.esd.ornl.gov/">Environmental Sciences Division</A> at<A HREF="http://www.ornl.gov/"> Oak Ridge National Laboratory</A> focuses on basic microbial ecology and bioremediation 
in the subsurface. The group is concerned with the basic science underlying bioremediation efforts
and other uses of biotechnology. The group's research couples molecular biology with traditional
microbiological methods to investigate microbial communities and the processes by which
microorganisms transform hazardous chemical contaminants.  The goal of these investigations is 
to increase the understanding of microbial ecology and microbial degradation of hazardous
contaminants; to demonstrate application of innovative microbial techniques and bioremediation
approaches in solving the <A HREF="http://apollo.osti.gov/home.html">U. S. Department of Energy's (DOE)  </A>and the nation's sediment,
soil, surface water, and groundwater contamination problems; and to transfer new monitoring and

Spatial and temporal variations of microbial abundance, activity, and community-level physiological profile (CLPP) were examined at a site near Oyster, Virginia. Significant spatial or temporal variations were observed
for aerobic culturable heterotrophs (ACH), microaerophiles, anaerobic glucose mineralization rates (GMR), and CLPP but not for aerobic GMR.  ACH and microaerophiles all decreased significantly with depth, but the slope
for each parameter changed significantly between sampling dates.  On the other hand, anaerobic GMR frequently increased with depth between the sampling dates. On the basis of CLPP analysis, the microbial community in a soybean field exhibited greater capability to utilize multiple sole carbon
sources than the community in a corn field. These results indicated that spatial and temporal variations of microbial abundance, activity, and CLPP at the site were significant, and were likely caused by water availability
and changes in physical or chemical conditions of the subsurface environments.

Maintaining high rates of co-metabolic degradation of trichloroethylene (TCE) by methanotrophs is difficult because of reductions in enzyme activity. Loss of enzyme activity may be the result of free radical effects caused by the epoxidation of the TCE by the soluble methane monooxygenase (sMMO) enzyme. Much of the enzyme activity can be recovered after degradation. The purpose of this study was to determine if compounds added during TCE degradation could reduce the loss of enzyme activity or increase enzyme recovery. Several types of compounds, including formate and formic acid (reducing power and a carbon source), ascorbic acid and citric acid (free radical scavengers), were added during TCE degradation at a concentration of 2 mM. A saturated solution of calcium carbonate was also tested. We measured the rate and extent of enzyme recovery in the presence of formate and methane. Of the compounds tested, only calcium carbonate and formic acid had a beneficial effect. The citric acid actually had a negative effect on sMMO activity; pH in this treatment fell to 4.9. In all other treatments, the pH remained at  7. The calcium carbonate and formic acid both reduced the loss of enzyme activity and resulted in the highest levels of enzyme activity after recovery.

The National Center for Manufacturing Science is investigating bioremediation of petroleum hydrocarbon at a site in Belleville, Michigan.  As part of this study we examined the microbial communities to help elucidate biodegradative processes currently active at the site.  We observed high densities of aerobic hydrocarbon degraders (10^3-4 cells/g) and denitrifiers (10^6 cells/g in the less-contaminated sediments (0.2 mg BTEX/kg sediment).  Low densities (10^2 cells/g) of iron and sulfate reducers were measured in the same sediments.  In contrast, the highly-contaminated sediments (10-16 mg BTEX/kg) showed low densities of aerobic hydrocarbon degraders and denitrifiers (10^1 and 10^5 cells/g, respectively) and high densities of iron and sulfate reducers (10^4 and 10^3 cells/g, respectively).  Methanogens were also found in these highly-contaminated sediments. These contaminated sediments also showed a higher biomass, by phospholipid fatty acids, and greater ratios of phospholipid fatty acids which indicate stress within the microbial community. Groundwater chemistry analyses indicated that the more-contaminated area was more reduced (Eh -69 mv) and had lower sulfate (37 mg/L) than the less-contaminated area (Eh -47 mv, sulfate 68 mg/L).  These conditions suggest that the subsurface environment at the highly-contaminated area had progressed into sulfate reduction and methanogenesis.  The less-contaminated area, although less reduced, also appeared to be progressing into primarily iron- and sulfate-reducing microbial communities.  The proposed treatment to stimulate bioremediation includes addition of oxygen, but the microbial characterization indicates that other electron acceptors might also be important in implementation and treatment to achieve effective and efficient bioremediation.

Linear or nonlinear regression analysis is often used to examine relationships between microbial populations and chemical or physical variables. Many ecological data, however, do not fit either model well. The variance of a response often increases as a function of the explanatory variable. This increase occurs in the field because, unlike in laboratory experiments where other variables are controlled, the populations are responding to simultaneous changes in many variables. Thus, other measured and unmeasured variables could affect the microbial response and obscure the relationship. So, no smooth relationship between the mean of a chemical variable and the mean microbial response is seen. Rather, there is a constraining relationship. Whereas a range in the microbial response exists at a given value of the explanatory variable (e.g., a chemical parameter), a tighter relationship to the other variable exists between the upper limit of the microbial response than for the mean value. We used simultaneous tolerance intervals for a regression model to define this upper boundary. After weighted regression is used to account for the proportional increases in variability with the hypothesized distribution, we defined a 95% upper tolerance limit. We used this approach to examine subsurface microbiology data and observed and defined a constraint by extractable phosphorous on species richness and microbial respiration. We are modifying this approach to address some nonlinear constraints that are apparent in our data (e.g., between CFU and species richness) and in other environmental data sets.

Geostatistical analysis of microbial data is a relatively uncommon but potentially powerful tool for describing the spatial structure and heterogeneity of subsurface microbial populations. Our previous research at a shallow coastal site in Virginia has shown the influence of location in relation to the water table in controlling microbial populations. However, our sampling design was inappropriate for geostatistical analysis. We subsequently used sonic drilling techniques to obtain >60 samples in each of 2 core holes at a similar sandy site near Mappsville, Virginia. Our preliminary geostatistical analysis of the CFU data suggests that  interesting patterns occur at several spatial scales. At a large vertical scale,  a spatial gradient in CFU declined exponentially (from  10^7 to <10 per g) with depth (to 5 m). We removed this depth trend, examined the autocorrelation in the residuals, and found evidence of increased CFU at  100 cm below the water table. The variation in CFU at a 10-cm scale was about one-quarter of the overall large-scale (>60-cm) variation in the cores.  These patterns suggest that a non-stationary (i.e., including a trend) spatial model that combines the depth trend with the geostatistical model of residual autocorrelation is ideal for this analysis. A similar approach will be used for other variables and relationships among variables.<P>

        Biotic formation of magnetic minerals has been documented for
mesophilic microorganisms but a microbial contribution to remnant magnetism
in thermal environments remains enigmatic.  We report the anaerobic
formation of extracellular magnetic iron oxides from a mixture of iron
hydroxide and iron oxyhydroxide by thermophilic (45-75 degrees C) microorganisms
obtained from deep subsurface thermal environments.   Enrichment cultures
of the deep (3000 m) sediments from Taylorsville Triassic Basin in Virginia
produced magnetic iron oxides when incubated with formate, acetate, or
lactate.  Enrichment cultures of the drilling fluids circulated through the
deep (>840 m) portions of Piceance Basin in Colorado formed magnetic iron
oxides when incubated with hydrogen, formate, acetate, lactate, or pyruvate.
Experiments on hydrogen-Fe(III)-enriched cultures exhibited: a) greater hydrogen
consumption in Fe(III)-amended than Fe(III)-unamended cultures and faster
Fe(II) formation and microbial growth in hydrogen-amended than hydrogen-unamended
incubations; b) parallel temperature and salinity profiles between the
microbial growth and the Fe(II) production; c) sensitivity of the iron
reduction to ferric reductase inhibitor pCMPS, electron transport
inhibitors HOQNO and quinacrine but insensitivity to nitrate reductase
inhibitors NaN(sub)3 and NaCN; d) a switch from formation of magnetic minerals
(magnetite plus trace maghemite) to non-magnetic siderite when the sulfate
reduction inhibitor molybdate was added.  These observations suggest a
thermophilic dissimilatory iron-reducing and magnetic iron oxide-forming
process that may have geological and biotechnological implications.<BR><BR><BR>

The Remediation Technologies Development Forum Chlorinated Solvents Working Group has selected sites in Delaware for bioremediation demonstrations. The demonstrations include bioremediation at an accelerated anaerobic (AA) site, an aerobic co-metabolic (CM) site, and a passive bioremediation [intrinsic(IN)] site. Microbial characterization is important in implementing and monitoring these approaches. Aerobic MPN showed methanotrophs at  10^2 cells/g, while anaerobic MPN showed iron reducers as high as 10^5 cells/g and fermentative bacteria at 10^2 cells/g. Phospholipid analyses indicated 10^6 to 10^8 cells/g in surface and CM sediments and  10^5 cells/g in AA and IN sediments. The AA and IN sites contained phospholipids indicative of Gram-positive bacteria, sulfate-reducers, and microeukaryotes, while the CM site contained a predominantly Gram-negative community with indications of methanotrophs. Five DNA probes were used, and sMMO was detected in 64% of the sediments. Although anaerobic bacteria were found at the AA site, the population densities were too low for rapid, effective anaerobic degradation without nutrient addition. The presence of methanotrophs at the CM site and the detection, with lux techniques, of inducers of TCE degradation by the aromatic pathway indicate that bioventing could enhance TCE degradation. The IN sites contained anaerobic bacteria which suggest the presence of natural anaerobic degradation. Specific microbial populations that are integral components of the bioremediation processes, such as methanotrophs and fermentative anaerobes, were quantified by MPN, phospholipid, and DNA analyses.

<STRONG>2.5</STRONG> DNA-coated Microspheres Are Effective Tracers For Transport Of Colloidal

Movement of colloidal particles in groundwater, where the particles must
pass through complex fractured porous material, is difficult to assess.
There are currently only a limited variety of tracers available for these
studies, which are dependent on both the small (micron) size of the particle
and the means to detect and quantitate the particles. To improve the
capability of detecting movement of colloidal particles, we have labeled
sub-micron diameter sized silica microspheres with DNA oligomers.  The
oligomers are 20 - 25 nucleotides in size and were attached to the
microspheres via a silane cross-bridge. The result is a series of particles
that are identical in their transport properties, but are labeled
distinctly. The efficacy of these labeled microspheres as tracers was
demonstrated in laboratory batch studies under a range of environmental
conditions and in a field experiment on the Oak Ridge Reservation. Results
from laboratory experiments demonstrate that the DNA label remains intact
and detectable for at least a period of weeks. For the field test, ten sets
of distinctly labeled particles were introduced into two multiport wells at
different depths, and 250 ml groundwater samples were obtained from a third
well. The transported microspheres were concentrated and the DNA labels
recovered. The various DNA labels were identified using DNA hybridization
under stringent conditions; complementary DNA probes bearing fluorescent or
chromogenic markers detected specific labels on slot blots. The slot blots
were examined by densitometry to obtain a quantitative result, with
comparison to the input signal. Results from the field experiment
demonstrate a complex pattern of movement. The described technique can
potentially utilize microspheres of different sizes, and is applicable to
other field sites.

        Several bacterial consortia capable of degrading carbon tetrachloride (CT) were enriched from 
a CT contaminated site in Hanford, Washington, and from in-house carbon tetrachloride contaminated 
water. These consortia are able to degrade CT in the presence of toluene without producing chloroform 
under initially aerobic conditions. Commercially available BIOLOG GN MicroPlates were unable to 
identify bacterial strains based on physiological capacities. To understand their community structure
and diversity, one consortium was subjected to molecular analysis. The 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) 
genes were amplified from the consortia community and cloned into plasmid vectors. Unique 16S rRNA 
gene clones, i.e. phylotypes, were detected by 4 tetrameric restriction enzymes. Altogether, 121 
16S rRNA gene clones were analyzed; 31 of them showed different RFLP patterns. About 60% of the 
clones belong to two dominant RFLP patterns. Further phylogenetic  analysis based on the partial 
16S rRNA gene sequences (about 300 bp) for the 10 major phylotypes showed that 7 phylotypes
 were closely related to <U>Nocardia calcarea</U>  and the other 3 phylotypes were related to <U>Curtobacterium luteum</U>.

The bioremediation of surface soils (0-30 cm) contaminated with weather
hydrocarbons is potentially a very cost effective treatment technology.
Laboratory experiments were carried out to measure the degradation of
weathered crude oil in soils collected from the south of Mexico.  Three
consortium of bacteria (an Oak Ridge National Laboratory, ORNL, in house
consortia, Instituto Mexicano del Petroleo, IMP, consortium from a waste
stream in Mexico City, and the native bacteria, NAT, isolated from soils
from the south of Mexico) were inoculated into soil slurries which
contained a hydrocarbon concentration of 5, 10 or 15%.  To test these
solutions a commercially available bioenhancing nutrient (nutrient plus
surfactant) and a synthetic surfactant were added at concentration of 0.05
or 0.1%.  Viable bacterial counts and hydrocarbon degradation (gas
chromatography analyses) were measured after aerobic incubation times of 1,
2 and 4 weeks at ca. 25 degrees C.  Laboratory results identified an increase in
bacterial numbers and a significant reduction in the total hydrocarbon
concentration after a 2 week incubation of surfactant assays over controls.
The most effective consortia was the IMP culture followed by NAT and ORNL.
Experiments are on-going both at ORNL and IMP to further
assess/characterize hydrocarbon degradation under simulated field
conditions.

A genetically engineered strain of Pseudomonas putida containing the lux gene cassette, which codes for light production in the presence of toluene, is being used to detect inducers of  trichloroethylene (TCE) degradation at contaminated sites. The biosensor was used to analyze samples at a western arid site and an eastern coastal site. TCE is found at the western site; TCE, tetrachloroethylene, and daughter products from reductive dechlorination have been detected at the anaerobic eastern site. Bioreporter testing of samples from the western site indicated that a cometabolic inducer was present. In those 1994 samples, addition of TCE degraders containing the toluene dioxygenase enzyme pathway resulted in degradation of the TCE. These results confirmed the presence of the inducer. However, no BTEX was seen at the site, implying the presence of a novel inducer. Samples currently being assayed will be used to examine temporal changes. At the eastern site, analysis of 8 groundwater samples indicated the presence of an inducer in 2 of the samples and BTEX has been present at some locations. However, for 17 soil samples the results were negative. The presence of the inducer in groundwater at these two sites shows the potential for aerobic degradation of the TCE by means of the toluene oxygenase pathways.<BR><BR><BR>

Silica microspheres labeled with single strands of DNA have been developed
at Oak Ridge National Laboratory for use in groundwater flow and transport
studies. The microspheres are coated with DNA by chemical modification of
the silica surface and attachment at the 5' end through an amine linkage.
This technique provides an almost unlimited number of uniquely tagged yet
physically and chemically identical colloidal-sized (0.5 mm) tracers.  The
DNA-labeled microspheres have been tested in packed columns of silica sand
and iron coated silica sand.  DNA hybridization techniques are utilized to
detect each unique DNA tag. Quantitation of signal is possible using a DNA
standard.  The microspheres have been used in field studies designed to
estimate the flow velocity of water through fractures and to delineate
fracture interconnectivity during pumping tests in fractured shales.

We have investigated the bioremediation of petroleum and chlorocarbon plumes in varied subsurface environments contaminated at levels spanning ug/kg to non-aqueous phase liquids.  Treatment strategies included natural attenuation,  anaerobic biostimulation, air sparging, methane injection, nutrient injection, and gaseous injection of methane in air plus triethylphosphate and nitrous oxide.  Microbial populations and trophic groups including methanotrophs, ammonia oxidizers, aerobic and anaerobic heterotrophs, fermentative anaerobes, and methanol-propane utilizers were quantified by MPN, phospholipid, and DNA analyses.  Microbial activities were evaluated by radioisotope time-course examination of activity and degradation by microbial populations in sediments and groundwaters.  Regardless of strategy or contaminant, bioremediation appeared to be orchestrated by microbial communities rather than individual populations.  Even during methane induced biostimulation, roles for toxicant degradation by anaerobes, ammonia oxidizers, and methanol-propane utilizing microbes were evidenced.   Microbial activity and bioremediation potential was primarily controlled by physical constrains such as sediment characteristics or water and nutrient flux while phosphorous was among the nutrients typically limiting microbial growth and metabolism.

<HR>
<P>The Microbial Interactions Group in the <A HREF="http://www.esd.ornl.gov/research-org/1995.html">Environmental Biotechnology Section</A> of the 
<A HREF="http://www.esd.ornl.gov/">Environmental Sciences Division</A> at<A HREF="http://www.ornl.gov/"> Oak Ridge National Laboratory</A> focuses on basic microbial ecology and bioremediation 
in the subsurface. The group is concerned with the basic science underlying bioremediation efforts
and other uses of biotechnology. The group's research couples molecular biology with traditional
microbiological methods to investigate microbial communities and the processes by which
microorganisms transform hazardous chemical contaminants.  The goal of these investigations is 
to increase the understanding of microbial ecology and microbial degradation of hazardous
contaminants; to demonstrate application of innovative microbial techniques and bioremediation
approaches in solving the <A HREF="http://apollo.osti.gov/home.html">U. S. Department of Energy's (DOE)  </A>and the nation's sediment,
soil, surface water, and groundwater contamination problems; and to transfer new monitoring and
remediation technology to industry.  Funding for the group is provided primarily from the 
Subsurface Science program (<A HREF="http://www.er.doe.gov/production/oher/EPR/subprog.html">SSP</A>)of the DOE Office of Health and Environmental Research, 
and by the DOE Office of Technology Development <A HREF="http://sc94.ameslab.gov/OTD/">(OTD)</A>.<P>

impact statements, research and emergency preparedness, transportation analysis, and analysis
of energy and environmental needs in developing countries.<p>

Energy use and delivery of technologies focus on electric power systems, building equipment,
building envelopes (walls, foundations, roofs, attics and materials), and methods to improve
energy efficiency in existing buildings. Transportation systems research is conducted both to
improve the quality of civilian transportation and for sponsors within the U.S. military to
improve the efficiency of deployment, scheduling, and transportation coordination.<p>

<h2>Center for Global Environmental Studies</h2>

<HR><P>

The Center for Global Environmental Studies provides a unique, interdisciplinary base for
exploring global environmental issues that are complex, interwoven, and global in scale. The
center has three main goals:<p>

<UL>
<LI>improving the understanding of the global-scale workings of the environments in air, on
land, and in water;<br>
<LI>developing capabilities to anticipate the long-term, large-scale effects that human actions
have on the biosphere; and<br>
<LI>identifying appropriate options for technological and societal responses.<p>
</UL>

The center's work is based on several assumptions that set it apart from the laboratory's
traditional approach to research and analyses:<p>

<UL>
<LI>The scope of the processes and problems explored is far greater--both in scale
and in time--than traditional research projects are equipped to deal with.<br>
<LI>Collaboration--both among traditionally competitive institutions and across
disciplinary boundary lines--is absolutely essential if any meaningful understandings
are to emerge.<br>
<LI>Policy--economically and politically practical policy--must be one of the
prime drives of global environmental research.<p>
</UL>

The central and unifying framework for the center's work is global systems analysis. This
analysis includes the development of increasingly sophisticated models that reflect the
dynamic interactions of numerous subsystems global vegetation; human cultures and
behaviors; and Earth systems such as atmospheric chemistry, ocean composition and
circulation, and the links between air, land, and sea. Long-term goals are the development of
models that will reflect the interplay of demographics, land-use patterns, economics,
ecological relationships, and other factors that influence the globe's environment.<p>

The Center for Global Environmental Studies brings together anthropologists, economists,
political scientists, sociologists, planners, geographers, climatologists, and ecologists to
examine the decision processes involved in the global management of risks and resources.
The center is developing the theoretical underpinnings of a practical approach to the problems
of decision making involving many players and complex technical issues.<p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<HR><P>

Integrated assessment is a process that can be used to evaluate and clarify resource
management policy options and outcomes for decision makers. The defining characteristics of
integrated assessment are (1) its focus on providing information and analysis that can be
understood and used by decision makers rather than for merely advancing understanding and
(2) its multidisciplinary approach, using methods, styles of study, and considerations from a
broader variety of technical areas than would typically characterize studies produced from a
single disciplinary standpoint.<p>

Integrated assessment may combine scientific, social, economic, health, and environmental
data and models. By its nature, integrated assessment requires bridging the gap between
science and policy considerations. Because not everything can be valued using a single
metric, such as a dollar value, the integrated assessment process also involves evaluating
trade-offs among dissimilar attributes.<p>

Although the term "integrated assessment" is a relatively new one, the approach embodied in
the term is not new. Scientists at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) recognized the
importance and value of multidisciplinary approaches to solving environmental problems early
on and have pioneered the development of tools and methods for integrated assessment over
the past three decades. Their extensive experience in environmental impact assessment and in
the development of ecological and regional-scale risk analysis, regional and global-scale
modeling, uncertainty analysis, and radiological hazard assessment have brought together
scientific, engineering, economic, and social science expertise, making ORNL unique among
research institutions.<p>

Major examples of ORNL's experience in the development of its capabilities for integrated
assessment include the following:<p>

<UL>
<LI>ORNL's extensive experience with evaluating the impacts of energy and defense
technologies and facilities under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) has produced
major advances in assessment science.<p>

<LI>ORNL helped integrate research results into assessment and policy for the National Acid
Precipitation Assessment Program (NAPAP) over the course of the program's 10-year history.
ORNL also led the development by a team of national laboratory scientists of methods for
integration of site-specific results into regional and national-scale assessments. Ongoing
efforts with NAPAP II will help ensure that its scientific results have policy relevance.<p>

<LI>ORNL recently completed a fuel cycle externalities study conducted jointly with the
Commission of the European Communities to quantify the social costs and benefits not
reflected in the price of energy products from different fuel sources.<p>

<LI>ORNL is currently supporting the Environmental Protection Agency's Environmental
Monitoring and Assessment Program. Their goal is to monitor and assess the condition of the
nation's ecological resources, for which ORNL is playing a role in scientific method
development.<p>
</UL>

These and other studies described in this volume of <i>Integrated Assessment Briefs</I>
exemplify many of the methods and approaches developed by ORNL researchers for
integrated assessment. To facilitate its use, the document is organized into sections
summarizing key projects typifying ORNL's diverse research interests. The eight cross-cutting
sections are: Energy Technologies, Global Change Studies, International Studies, Regional
Scale Studies, Renewable Resources, Risk Assessments, Theory and Methods, and Waste
Management Technologies.<p>

Each brief poses a research question and summarizes the findings of the research, giving
references and contact names for readers who wish to obtain further information. Should you
wish to acquire publications or other information mentioned in <i>Integrated Assessment
Briefs</i>,

<BODY bgcolor="#ffffff">
<font color="#228b22"><H1 align="center">National Environmental
Research Park</H1></font>

The National Environmental Research Park, located on the DOE
reservation at Oak Ridge, provides 5008 ha (12,400 acres) of protected
land for research and education in the environmental sciences. Lying in
the heart of an eastern deciduous forest area of streams and
reservoirs, hardwood forests, and extensive upland mixed forests, the
research park offers the unique advantages of a large information base,
a close proximity to educational institutions, and on-site
resources--the services of environmental scientists at ORNL and the
field and laboratory facilities.<P>

<H2>Research Opportunities</H2>

The research park is an outdoor laboratory and has field research
sites on which are located maintenance and support facilities
sufficient to permit sophisticated and well-instrumented
environmental experiments. Among these facilities are elaborate
monitoring systems that enable users to measure environmental
factors precisely and accurately for extended periods. Various
sites in the park offer opportunities for aquatic and terrestrial
ecosystem analyses such as biogeochemical cycling of pollutants
resulting from energy-producing facilities, landscape alterations,
and forest and wildlife management. Because the park is under the
jurisdiction of the federal government, the integrity of land and
water resources and the preservation of undisturbed lands are
ensured.<P>

The research park is responsible for three types of specially
designated areas: natural, reference, and <A
HREF="http://www.esd.ornl.gov/">Environmental Sciences Division</A>
research. Natural areas are protected areas on the Oak Ridge
Reservation that are habitats for regionally, nationally, or globally
unique, rare, or endangered plant and animal species.  These include
eight registered state natural areas. Reference areas are sites
(terrestrial and aquatic) that are representative of the vegetation
communities of the southern Appalachian region. Baseline data on the
plant and animal communities in these areas can be used to establish
comparative reference points of normal ecosystem structure and
function. The <A HREF="http://www.esd.ornl.gov/">Environmental
Sciences Division</A> research areas are sites of field research. Much
of the research is long term and highly instrumented with a
comprehensive data base of information available.  The Oak Ridge park
is one in a DOE network of seven national environmental research parks.
It is designated as a Tennessee wildlife management area and is a unit
of the Southern Appalachian Man and Biosphere Reserve.<P>

<STRONG><CENTER><H1>Background and History<BR>
North Memorial Health Care</H1></CENTER></STRONG>
<P>
In 1939, Dr. Samuel Samuelson built Victory Memorial Hospital in the suburb of Robbinsdale, Minnesota, just outside the northwest corner of Minneapolis. This 30-bed facility was reorganized in 1954 as a private, nonprofit hospital and renamed North Memorial. Vance C. DeMong, who was hired as the first administrator, served as chief executive officer of North Memorial until his retirement in 1981.
<P>
Beginning in 1956 and continuing through the 1990s, numerous building programs were undertaken, making the hospital a seven-story building with more than 500 beds, and expanding the campus to incorporate a medical office building, a medical transportation building, two satellite office buildings, an outpatient care facility and several parking ramps. North Memorial also owns several off-site primary care clinics and operates ambulances services in greater Minnesota and western Wisconsin. 
<P>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="http://www.nmmc.com/libweb/graphics/barbrass.gif"></CENTER>
<P>
In addition to the building programs, some of the highlights over the years included:
<UL>
<LI>1961, initiation of hospital-based North Ambulance Service.
<LI>1967, establishment of home care service.
<LI>1969, first open heart surgery performed.
<LI>1972, establishment of Family Practice Residency Program with University of Minnesota.
<LI>1973, name changed to North Memorial Medical Center.
<LI>1977,<EM> I Can Cope</EM> cancer education program founded at North Memorial, later to be marketed nationwide by American Cancer Society.
<LI>1981, Scott R. Anderson, became president and CEO and still serves in this capacity today.
<LI>1985, establishment of North Air Care (now NORTH/HCMC Air Care).
<LI>1988, initiation of North Mobile Mammography.
<LI>1994, opening of WestHealth in Plymouth, an ambulatory health care campus that is a joint venture of North Memorial and Abbott-Northwestern Hospital.
<li>1995, name changed to North Memorial Health Care to more accurately reflect the nature and range of services offered.
</UL>
<P>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="http://www.nmmc.com/libweb/graphics/barbrass.gif"></CENTER>
<P>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="graphics/newhosp1.gif" ALT="[photo of new building]"></CENTER>
<P>
In 1994, ground was broken for a new outpatient/ambulatory care center which would also serve as the main entrance to our Robbinsdale campus. This state-of-the-art facility opened in February of 1996,  with convenient access for patients and visitors via a new adjacent parking ramp. Housed in the new building are additional surgical suites; a 
complete patient care center for patients having same day surgery, endoscopy or other 
outpatient procedures; the Hubert H. Humphrey Cancer Center; North Heart Center; 
imaging services, including MRI, mammography, nuclear medicine, special procedures 
and x-ray; rehabilitation therapies, including speech pathology; and a learning center comprised of a medical library and classroom/consultation rooms. A circular driveway to the new main entrance, comfortable waiting areas, a coffee bar, electronic 
information kiosk and staffed information desk are among our customer amenities.

<STRONG><CENTER><H1>Advances in Chronic Hepatitis</H1></CENTER></STRONG>
<hr>
<STRONG><H3><i>by Coleman I. Smith, MD, Gastroenterologist<BR>
North Memorial Health Care</i></H3></STRONG>
<P>
Chronic hepatitis is not a single disease but rather a clinicopathologic syndrome with a number of causes. It is the end result of a variety of noxious stimuli to the liver, characterized by varying degrees of liver cell necrosis and inflammation. The disease in all cases does have the potential to progress to cirrhosis and even to hepatocellular cancer.  
<P>
Chronicity is defined as disease process which has continued for at least six months.  This is still a rather arbitrary definition, and in many cases, the diagnosis may be made before the six months has elapsed. Chronic hepatitis is usually manifest by persistently abnormal aminotransferase activity six months or more.  
<P>
There are three modes of presentation of chronic hepatitis:<BR>  
1)  It may present as an acute hepatitis which is followed by transition to chronic hepatitis. This is usually manifest as enzyme elevations persisting for at least six months.This is the least frequent presentation and accounts for no more than 5-10 percent cases of chronic hepatitis.  
<BR>
2)  Chronic hepatitis may present as overt chronic liver disease of unexplained origin with stigmata of hepatocellular failure and/or portal hypertension. This accounts for approximately 10-15 percent of cases.
<BR>
3) The most common presentation is the chance discovery of increased aminotransferase activity persisting for six months or more in an asymptomatic person. This mode of presentation accounts for 75-80 percent of cases of chronic hepatitis.
<P>
There are only a limited number of agents which are known to cause chronic hepatitis. Even though chronic hepatitis due to these agents may have a variable natural history, all have the potential to progress to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma.
<P>
The causes of chronic hepatitis include chronic viral hepatitis, and in this context hepatitis C represents the most common form that we see.  Hepatitis B and hepatitis D occur less frequently in our community. Autoimmune hepatitis, drug-induced hepatitis, and metabolic disorders (such as Wilsons disease and alpha-l antitrypsin deficiency) represent other causes for chronic hepatitis. A small percentage of cases are of unknown etiology and are labeled cryptogenic. Other disorders which can simulate chronic hepatitis but dont fit the definition of chronic hepatitis, having a different histologic appearance, include alcoholic liver disease, hemochromatosis, primary biliary cirrhosis, primary sclerosing cholangitis, and the more recently recognized but very common non-alcoholic 
steatohepatitis.
 <P>
Prior to our understanding of the multiple etiologies of chronic hepatitis, the first classification of chronic hepatitis was proposed 25 years ago. This classification was aimed at distinguishing groups according to the degree of disease activity. In the initial classification, the milder category of disease was termed chronic persistent hepatitis and the more severe disease was termed chronic aggressive hepatitis, and this has been used more recently interchangeably with the term chronic active hepatitis. This classification, however, has been misinterpreted as suggesting different specific disorders rather than degrees of severity of the same disorder. Because our knowledge of the possible etiologies of chronic hepatitis has grown quite remarkably over the past few years, it has now been suggested that the old terms chronic persistent hepatitis and chronic active hepatitis should no longer be used, and rather the term chronic hepatitis should be used to describe liver biopsies, taking into account the grade and severity and possible etiology of the lesion.
<P>
Thus, chronic hepatitis is now regarded as a clinicopathologic syndrome. The diagnosis however must be confirmed by histology. The pathologist will describe the biopsies in terms of the degree of inflammation, which is a measure of the activity of the disease. The stage of the disease will be assessed by the amount of fibrosis which is present, ranging from no fibrosis all the way to fibrosis bridging between portal tracts and cirrhosis. The pathologist will also, perhaps using clinical and other lab test information, attempt to describe the etiology if at all possible.
<P>
Even though all the forms of chronic hepatitis may have a number of similarities, at times one can distinguish certain features which make the possibility of an etiology suggested by the histologic appearance. This is not always possible, and clinical and other lab data are needed.
<P>
From a clinical point of view, the importance of establishing an accurate diagnosis includes the fact that one is able to establish a prognosis and to establish an accurate diagnosis of some of the causes of chronic hepatitis which are amenable to treatment.  In particular, autoimmune hepatitis is very amenable to treatment.  Even though chronic viral hepatitis does have treatment, the current antivirals which are available only produce a response in a minority of cases and at the cost of significant side effects.
<P>
Obviously, the establishment of a diagnosis of some of the other conditions that canmimic chronic hepatitis such as hemochromatosis is extremely important.  Establishment of a diagnosis of Wilsons disease is likewise very important because of the potentially easily administered treatment which is available.
<P>
In summary, chronic hepatitis is now realized to be a clinicopathologic syndrome caused by a variety of different agents. The importance of establishing a diagnosis and the severity of the disease lies in the fact that one can offer an accurate prognosis to patients and, even more importantly, in some of the disorders specific and effective treatment is available. The confusing terms of chronic active hepatitis and chronic persistent hepatitis should no longer be used, but rather the description of the pathology should reflect the stage and activity of the disease as well as the etiology.

<TITLE> Contraception Update - NMHC </TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY>
<IMG SRC="../graphics/pills.jpg" ALT="[pill bottle]"ALIGN="right">
<STRONG><CENTER><H1>Contraception Update</H1></CENTER></STRONG>
<hr>
<STRONG><H3><i>by Kris Eskuchen, MD, Family Practice Resident<BR>
North Memorial Health Care</i></H3></STRONG>
<P>

Contraception is a dynamic field of scientific research with underlying issues of ethics, morals and controversy. While developments continue to advance in multiple areas of contraception (i.e. barriers, hormonal methods, and male contraception), this article will introduce and review medical alternatives to surgical abortions and emergency contraception.
<P>
<STRONG>EMERGENCY CONTRACEPTION</STRONG> is by no means a newly discovered or theorized form of birth control. In fact, in 1500 BC, Egyptian women used douching as a form of contraception. This is not yet out of folklore today.  The morning after pill has been offered to victims of sexual abuse in the Emergency Department setting for nearly 30 years. What seems to be new in this area is the fact that it is just gaining some significant advertisement in the lay press. In the U.S., most teenagers are not aware of the existence of the morning after pill. In the U.K., it is a frequently used form of contraception, requiring only a physician's verbal order to the pharmacist.  Considering that the WHO estimates 200,000 women will die per year attempting to terminate unwanted pregnancies through unsafe abortion practices, this topic is worth considering.
<P>
A woman could consider emergency contraception if she has had unprotected intercourse 
within 72 hours and does not wish to become pregnant.  Unprotected intercourse includes the following:
<OL>
<LI>Sexual assault.
<LI>Intercourse without a contraceptive.
<LI>Multiple missed oral contraceptive pills in the two weeks preceding intercourse.
<LI>Missed one or more progesterone-only pill.
<LI>A barrier method inserted incorrectly, dislodged, removed too early, or found to be torn.
<LI>A condom that has slipped, broken or leaked.
<LI>An IUD that has been expelled partially or fully or removed at midcycle.
<LI>Ejaculation occurring on the external genitalia.
</OL>

<P>
The following is a list of the established (none are FDA approved) dosing regimens with their respective failure rated noted in parentheses: 
<P>
<STRONG><EM>Morning after pill (0.6%)</EM></STRONG><BR>
*Ovral tabs w/in 72 hrs and repeated 12 hrs later.<BR>
*Lo/Ovral, Nordette, Levlen 4 tabs w/in 72 hrs and repeated 12 hrs later.<BR>
*Triphasil, Tri-Levlen 4 tabs (yellow pill) w/in 72 hrs and repeated 12 hrs later.
<P>

<STRONG><EM>Progestin only:</EM></STRONG> <BR>
*Ovrette 20 tabs w/in 48 hrs and repeated 12 hrs later.

<P>
About 50 percent of women who take emergency contraceptive pills experience nausea and 20 percent vomit. If vomiting occurs within two hours after taking a dose, the dose should be repeated. Non-prescription anti-nausea medications such as Dramamine and Marezine can reduce the risk of nausea when taken 30 minutes before the pills and every four to six hours thereafter. Most providers recommend that the pills be taken with food to reduce the risk of nausea. One could also consider progestin-only minipills (Ovrette), which has far less reported nausea and vomiting. Recommendations for contraindications include an acute migraine headache with neurologic symptoms or history of a CVA or thrombosis (extremity or PE). 
<P>
The copper-T IUD is significantly more effective than the pills, but they are not ideal for all women. Poor candidates would be those women at high risk of STDs where insertion could lead to PID. Once placed, the IUD could be left for up to 10 years for continued contraception.
<P>
Advantages to emergency contraception include saving medical care dollars, social cost 
savings, less psychological turmoil of an unintended pregnancy, and prevention of attempted 
unsafe abortive practices. Disadvantages include the moral/ethical issues of the practice and the 
side effects outlined above.
<P
<STRONG><H3>Medical Abortion</H3></STRONG>
RU-486 (MIFEPRISTONE), as just described above for the use in 
emergency contraception, is better known as the French abortion pill. RU-486 is used in 
conjunction with a prostaglandin E1 analog and is currently being used in France, the U.K., Sweden and China. 
<P>
RU-486 is a progesterone antagonist and binds to the progesterone receptor in the nucleus of target cells. Progesterone is responsible for decidualization changes of the endometrium necessary for implantation of the blastocyst, decreasing responsiveness of uterine smooth muscle to contractile/excitatory agents, and firming the cervix and favoring the formation of the mucous plug. Along with RU-486's ability to interrupt the supply of progesterone to the uterus, it also has some innate prostaglandin activity (this mechanism not as well established).  
<P>
Essentially, the antiprogesterone effects cause irreversible damage to the decidualized 
endometrium leading to evacuation of the conceptus, which leads to decreased levels of hCG. Therefore, there is no support of the corpus luteum, luteolysis occurs and progesterone and estrogen levels fall, and a new menstrual cycle begins.  
<P>
Prostaglandin administration leads to myometrial contractions, dilatation and softening of the cervix perpetuating the expulsion of uterine contents. The prostaglandin activity of RU-486 is not significant enough to consistently produce the desired effects, so it is used in combination with misoprostol (a prostaglandin E1 analog).
<P>
The current British model of administration requires three to four visits by the patient to her provider.  The visits are outlined below:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>Consultation, counseling, and ultrasound to verify dates and rule out an ectopic 
pregnancy. The patient must be within 63 days of her last menstrual period. 
<LI>She then returns 24 hours later for provider administration of Mifepristone 600 mg (3 tabs 200 mg) and is observed in the clinic for one half-hour for possible allergic reactions.
<LI>The patient returns to the clinic in two days for the administration of the prostaglandin, misoprostol 200 micrograms po. The patient is then given the option to wait to abort (usually within two to five hours) within the clinic setting or to return home. She is given NSAIDs for pain. 
<LI>The follow-up visit is several days later to be sure expulsion is complete and that she's recovering appropriately. D&C/curettage or a repeated dose of prostaglandin is made available if the regimen fails.
</OL>

<P>
The proposed model of administration of RU-486 in the U.S. has not been finalized but will be a variation on the British model.  Steps 1-3 are to be accomplished within a single office visit. The provider will administer the medication after Step 1 proceedings and will then give the patient a prescription for the prostaglandin and NSAIDs to be taken at home. Ten percent of women request a stronger medication than the NSAIDs and receive narcotics in the U.K.  This too could be a maintained practice with the narcotics prescription given on an as-needed basis. The follow-up visit would be in two weeks.  
<P>
The process has an efficacy rate of >95% expulsion (60 percent within four hours of 
administration of the prostaglandin). Of the 5 percent remaining, 3-4 percent are incomplete and require either a second dose of prostaglandin or undergo surgical curettage. One percent of women have chose to continue the pregnancy after failure. To date, there have been no known teratogenic side effects.

The side effects of RU-486 include symptoms similar to morning sickness - nausea, headache, fatigue. Misoprostol produces abdominal cramping and pain in 80 percent of patients. Nausea, vomiting and mild diarrhea are less significant. Uterine bleeding is expected, most commonly lasting approximately one week, but it is not rare to have some lighter spotting lasting up to three weeks. One per thousand women requires a blood transfusion for excessive bleeding. A D&C is common in these cases of prolonged or excessive bleeding. The main contraindication is history of a bleeding disorder. The cost of the RU-486 in the U.K. is equivalent to a surgical abortion.  
<P>
The advantages of RU-486 over a traditional surgical abortion include not having to wait the six weeks required for surgical intervention; the process has the potential of being much more private; there's no risk for uterine perforation; and so far, no long-term complications have been observed since its release in 1989. The disadvantages include many of the same as those for a surgical abortion - moral and ethical dilemmas, cost and pain.
<P>
Dr. David Grimes headed the U.S. trials in San Francisco. His findings were consistent with those in France.  His research was presented in late 1995. On July 19, 1996, the New Drug Application began application processing with a strong recommendation for approval to the FDA. According to Sandra Waldman of The Population Council, RU-486 has the potential for release by early 1997.
<P>
The second medical alternative to a surgical abortion is that of <STRONG>METHOTREXATE</STRONG> AND 
<STRONG>MISOPROSTOL</STRONG>. Unlike RU-486, which is a new drug, these drugs are well-established. It is the indication that is new.  The patient must be less than eight weeks amenorrheic (by LMP and confirmed by vaginal ultrasound) to be considered. Methotrexate is approved by the FDA for use in RA, psoriasis and certain cancers (i.e., choriocarcinoma). While not yet approved by the FDA, it is being used in the termination of some ectopic pregnancies. Misoprostol is approved by the FDA for prevention of gastric ulcers induced by NSAIDs.
<P>
Methotrexate is a folic acid antagonist (inhibits dihydrofolic acid reductase) interfering with DNA synthesis, repair and cellular replication. This has a direct cytotoxic effect on developing trophoblastic tissue. Misoprostol is a prostaglandin E1 analog, which stimulates uterine contractions and expels the products of conception. 
<P>
Methotrexate 50 mg/m2 IM X1 could be administered by a provider with a prescription of 
misoprostol 800 micrograms po to be used five to seven days later. The limited research so far has produced efficacy rates in the 96-97 percent range. There have not yet been any identifiable side effects with the single dose of methotrexate. Misoprostol side effects were outlined with its use in conjunction with RU-486. Contraindications include porphyria or hypersensitivity to either medication. The cost of the process is four dollars for methotrexate, two dollars for misoprostol, and then two to three office visits. Advantages are essentially the same as for those outlined in RU-486.  Disadvantages are also similar, but involve a slightly less predictable rate of expulsion than with RU-486.    
<P>
The sometimes emotional aspects of conception control are not addressed by the above. 
Nevertheless, the pharmacology involved is well developed, and the physicians involved have a sufficiently effective armamentarium to handle the clinical problems.

<STRONG><CENTER><H1>Hypercoagulable States</H1></CENTER></STRONG>
<hr>
<STRONG><H3><i>by Virginia Dale, MD, Pathologist<BR>
North Memorial Health Care</i></H3></STRONG>
<P>

The three components of the coagulation system - platelets, coagulation proteins and the 
endothelium - exist in an active state of equilibrium, which maintains the fluidity of the blood in balance with the ability to enter into an almost explosive process of thrombosis to staunch hemorrhage. The power of the activated coagulation system requires powerful counterbalance so that thrombosis can be limited appropriately to the site of hemorrhage. A number of primary and secondary abnormalities can result in imbalance, leading to abnormal thrombosis.  
<P>
The thrombin-protein C-protein S-factor VIII system turns out to be central to inhibition of the coagulation cascade. Thrombin interacts with a binding site on the endothelium to activate protein C, which with its cofactor protein S, binds to and inactivates factor VIII.  Both protein C and protein S are vitamin K dependent serine proteases which are produced in the liver, and both - like proteins II, VII, IX and X - are decreased by warfarin.  Congenital protein C and protein S deficiencies may each cause two to five percent of thromboembolic phenomena. The onset of DVTs occurs soon after puberty. Since the half-life of these proteins is shorter than that of the procoagulant serine proteases, initiation of warfarin therapy can result in temporary acceleration of hypercoagulability, with resulting skin necrosis. Testing for these deficiencies is unreliable during an acute thrombotic event, but can be done once a patient has been stable on or off warfarin for two months.
<P>
In 1993, a group of patients with a history of thrombotic disease were discovered to be resistant to the effects of activated protein C (APC) in a PTT-based laboratory assay.  Initially, this was felt to be the result of an abnormal, undefined cofactor of APC, but the <EM>cofactor</EM> turned out to be factor VIII itself. Resistance to APC was found to be a very common abnormality among these patients - affecting from 20 to 60 percent of patients with a history of thrombosis - and to be due to a mutation in the binding site for APC on the factor VIII protein.  The mutation - named the Leiden mutation - has been found to be very common among the general population (five to six percent) and is now the most common identifiable cause of primary hypercoagulable states. Patients not on warfarin can be screened with the PTT-based assay. Those on warfarin can be tested by looking for the mutation itself.
<P>
Antithrombin III was one of the first important defined coagulation inhibitors. It is produced in the liver and inactivates thrombin, factors IX, X and XI in reactions that are powerfully 
catalyzed by heparin. Congenital AT-III deficiency is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait. It occurs with a frequency of 1:2000 to 1:5000, is associated with a 50 to 70 percent risk of a thromboembolic event, and may account for two to six percent of thromboembolic events. Treatment may require large doses of heparin, since AT-III is the main cofactor of heparin, and may be aided by administration of AT-III concentrates.  AT-III deficiency can be acquired from thrombosis, heparin therapy, liver disease, DIC, major surgery, nephrotic syndrome and protein-losing enteropathy. Testing is inaccurate in these settings, but can be done on patients who have been stable on or off warfarin for two months.  
<P>
Antiphospholipid antibodies (APA) are important causes of acquired hypercoagulable states. The lupus inhibitor can occur with lupus, but occurs more commonly in its absence. It results in an artifactual prolongation of PTT due to interaction with the phospholipid used in PTT tests, but in vivo, is associated with thrombosis rather than bleeding. Anticardiolipin antibodies are closely related but different APAs. The lupus inhibitor and anticardiolipin antibodies can occur transiently with infections (the latter frequently IgM and in low titer), but when present in conjunction with the APA syndrome, are associated with a high risk of recurrent thrombosis and fetal wastage, and some risk for premature atherosclerotic disease.
<P>
Heparin-associated platelet antibody is an important acquired cause of hypercoagulability among hospitalized patients. A recent study of 665 patients receiving prophylaxis against venous thrombosis after hip surgery, with either unfractionated or low molecular weight (LMW) heparin, reported an incidence of 2.7 percent among patients receiving unfractionated heparin, and none among those receiving LMW heparin. The antibody is associated with a high 
risk of thrombosis - seven of the nine affected patients had DVT and one had mesenteric 
artery thrombosis. Patients receiving heparin should have a platelet count monitored at least every other day. The antibody should be suspected if the platelet count falls to less than 100,000 or to less than one half within a 24- to 48-hour period, with no other identifiable cause. The high risk of thrombosis requires that all heparin be discontinued. Once present, there is a high incidence of cross reactivity with all types of heparin - bovine, porcine, and LMW - regardless of the initial inducing type of heparin, which limits therapeutic options. The heparinoid ORG 10172 has been reported to have a low incidence of cross reactivity with the antibody and may be useful in this setting.  
<P>
Testing for primary hypercoagulable states - protein C and S deficiency, factor V Leiden 
(resistance to APC), antithrombin III deficiency, lupus inhibitor and anticardiolipin antibodies - should be considered in the following circumstances:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Thrombosis at unusual sites (mesenteric, upper extremities).
<LI>Thrombosis at young age.
<LI>Recurrent thrombosis.
<LI>Thrombosis with no other predisposing causes. 
<LI>Family history of thrombosis.
<LI>Progressive thrombosis while anticoagulated, resistance to anticoagulation, or warfarin-induced skin necrosis. 
<LI>Acute post percutaneous transluminal angioplasty or post bypass thrombosis.
<LI>Premature or rapidly progressive arteriosclerosis.
<LI>Recurrent fetal wastage (APAs).
<LI>Prior to oral contraceptive use with a positive family history of thrombosis.
</UL>

<P>
Treatment of inherited hypercoagulable states is complicated by the fact that thrombotic events are not always expressed and are frequently precipitated by a second factor. High-risk patients require indefinite anticoagulation. Asymptomatic or low-risk patients may benefit from vigorous prophylaxis during high-risk situations such as pregnancy and surgery.

<TITLE> New Anti-Obesity Drug Regimen-NMHC </TITLE>

<STRONG><CENTER><H1>The <EM>New</EM> Anti-Obesity <BR>Drug Regimen</H1></CENTER></STRONG>
<hr>
<P>
<STRONG><H3><i>by Alison Coulter, MD, Family Practice<BR>
North Memorial Health Care</i></H3></STRONG>

The Federal "Healthy People 2000" objectives include reducing the prevalence of obese U.S. adults to no more than 20 percent by the year 2000. That's a very challenging goal; obesity affects one third of our adult population and one fourth of our children. Further, there has been a 30 percent increase in the number of obese Americans over the past 15 years. Americans are not alone; the prevalence of obesity has increased in many other countries.  
<P>
Obesity is defined as weighing 120 percent or more of the ideal body weight. This represents the midpoint range of weights for medium frame individuals from the 1983 Metropolitan Life height and weight tables. These values correlate with a body mass index (BMI) of 27.8 for men and 27.3 for women, where BMI is defined as weight in kg divided by height in meters squared.
<P>
Despite the vast, negative medical and psychological ramifications of obesity, there remains relatively little study devoted to the problem.  Medicine has not had an effective, low-risk treatment plan to offer the obese patient. The recent recognition of obesity as a disease that may be amenable to drug therapy has created a greater interest in trying to find a protocol that will be effective and low-risk.
<P>
Phentermine, (Ionamin, Fastin) is not a new drug. It has been used alone in the treatment of obesity; however, the side effects at dosages high enough to produce an effect have not been well tolerated. It has a structure similar to amphetamine and works by elevating catecholamine levels as does amphetamine. It can cause some CNS stimulation (much less than amphetamine), insomnia, increased heart rate and elevated blood pressure. It may cause a hypertensive crisis when used in combination with MAO inhibitors, and it may decrease diabetics' insulin requirement.
<P>
Fenfluramine is available as the racemic mixture, Pondimin, and as the dex isomer which is thought to be more specific, Redux. It again has a structure similar to amphetamine, but is actually a CNS depressant. It acts by increasing the release and decreasing the re-uptake of serotonin, which in turn cause a decrease in appetite. It may potentiate anti-hypertensives, decrease insulin requirements, and cause hypertensive crisis when used together with MAO inhibitors.  
<P>
It may have an additive effect when used with other CNS depressants such as anxiolytics and other SSRI anti-depressants.  It may also cause short-term memory loss thought to be 
reversible. Fenfluramine may also rarely cause pulmonary hypertension which may or may not reverse upon cessation of the drug.
<P>
The new drug regimen involves using fenfluramine and phentermine in combination. Neither of these drugs is new; however, using them together is. Combining fenfluramine, a CNS depressant and phentermine, a CNS stimulant, both at lower dosages than would be required for either of them alone, has resulted in a dramatic reduction in side effects. Weintraub is credited with having done the best study to date on the use of these two drugs combined with diet, exercise and behavior modification. Half of the study patients lost 10 percent or more of their initial weight and maintained it throughout the three-and-a-half years of study. There was no evidence of drug habituation or drug seeking throughout the period of the study. The side effects were mild and tended to be short-lived. They included dry mouth, constipation, nausea, 
abdominal pain, diarrhea, metallic taste, vivid dreams, drowsiness, sadness, nervousness and rapid pulse.
<P>
Dr. Guilford Hartley at HCMC is conducting clinical trials with the use of Fen-Phen and diet, behavior modification and exercise. At the end of the first year, 21 percent of the 64 study patients failed to lose 10 percent of their initial weight; 31 percent have gotten down to less than 120 percent of ideal body weight; and 48 percent have lost at least 10 percent of their initial weight, but are still more than 120 percent of ideal body weight. Hartley reports side effects as being in the "irritating but not dangerous" category.  He also reports good success with normalization of hemoglobin A1C values.
<P>								     
Dr. Richard Atkinson at the University of Wisconsin is also conducting clinical trials very 
similar to Dr. Hartley. His study group involves 1300 patients. At the end of the first year, he reports a 35-pound (15 percent) weight loss on average, a 30 mm decrease in BP and a 27 mg decrease in cholesterol.
<P>
According to the FDA, 1.1. million prescriptions were written for fenfluramine in 1995. 
Worldwide, more than 40 million patients have used fenfluramine. There is no documentation of devastating results. The FDA still has concerns that the drugs have a potential for abuse.Phentermine partially replaces the need for cocaine in addicted monkeys. All anorexiant drugs including phentermine and fenfluramine have been confiscated in schools and abused by anorectics. There is also concern that high doses of fenfluramine could cause neurotoxicity secondary to high levels of serotonin in the brain. This has been seen in animal studies. The effects and levels normalize with cessation of the drug.
<P>
The lay press has taken upon itself to educate the American public about this new drug 
combination. Articles have appeared in Mademoiselle, Woman's Day, Allure, Reader's Digest, Forbes and Good Housekeeping, to name a few.  Patients and doctors alike are asking questions about the usefulness of this regimen.
<P>
In contrast to the enthusiasm of the lay press and media, there has been caution on the part of many physicians to prescribe these drugs because of the world's past experience with amphetamines. To date, those concerns have not been substantiated. The Minnesota Board of Medical Practice's stand on this combination of drugs is the same as it is for any other intervention. Their official statement is, "The board continues to hold that use of any drug, or other intervention, be preceded by a history and physical, based on a diagnosis that supports the intervention, and be accompanied by proper follow-up, monitoring, use of consults, and documentation."
<P>
Primary care physicians continue to be asked by their patients to try these drugs. A suggested regimen to use is phentermine 15 mg/day, plus fenfluramine (in the racemic mixture form) 20 mg TID PLUS diet, exercise and behavior modification. There is no documentation that these drugs are effective when used in isolation. The cost of the drugs in this form is about $40 per month. An appropriate H & P, as well as lab studies should be obtained prior to initiation of the medications.  The drugs should be reserved for individuals weighing more than 120 percent of ideal body weight.  The physician should contract with the patient and be prepared to withdraw therapy if the patient does not meet the designated goals. 
<P>
This drug regimen is not effective for everyone. Reasonable target goals would be that the patient lose 5 to 10 percent of initial weight by the end of three to four months. If that does not occur, one could increase the dose of one of the drugs based on the types of side effects the patient is having, if any. For example, increase the fenfluramine to 40 mg TID or increase the phentermine by 15 mg daily. If in another three to four months the patient does not lose 10 percent of initial weight, discontinue therapy. If the patient initially loses weight and then gains it back while on the therapy, the same protocol should be used. Patients should also be counseled that if the drugs work for them, it may mean lifelong therapy. Most patients will gain their weight back once stopping the drugs. It's always reasonable to attempt to decrease the dosages once the patient has either reached the target weight or plateaued at a lower weight.
<P>
Obesity is now thought to be a disease with multi-factorial etiologies, including genetics. There is increasing interest in its treatment because of the increasing prevalence, the high rate of co-morbidities and increased mortality, and due to recent breakthroughs with regard to its etiology and management. The treatment of obesity with drugs remains controversial. The fen/phen combination appears to be a relatively safe and effective regimen for some patients. If you choose to prescribe these drugs, strict adherence to a well-understood protocol, in combination with supportive education and counseling as indicated above, is recommended.

<STRONG><CENTER><H1>Osteoporosis: <BR>The Epidemic for the Next Century</H1></CENTER></STRONG>
<hr>
<STRONG><H3><i>by John R. Gray, MD, Nephrologist<BR>
North Memorial Health Care</i></H3></STRONG>

Osteoporosis has been defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a "systemic 
skeletal disease characterized by low bone mass and microarchitectural deterioration of bone tissue, with a subsequent increase in bone fragility and susceptibility to fracture."
<P>
Osteoporosis can be considered an epidemic in the U.S.; 25 million people are affected; four out of five affected people are women. At age 50, a woman has nearly a 40 percent chance of developing an osteoporotic fracture during her lifetime! A bimodal frequency of fractures exists, with the incidence of vertebral fracture increasing after menopause, and hip fracture after age 70. Approximately 1.3 million fractures occur annually at a cost to the health care system of greater than 10 billion dollars per year.
<P>
Significant morbidity occurs related to the osteoporotic fractures. Vertebral fractures cause loss of height, chronic back pain, and a kyphotic deformity leading to the <EM>dowager's hump. </EM>Hip fractures, although less frequent than vertebral fractures, are associated with more death, disability and medical expense than all other osteoporotic fractures combined. There is a 20 percent excess mortality within one year of a hip fracture; 50 percent never fully recover, with a number of patients ending up in a nursing home.
<P>
Healthy bone contains: <STRONG>osteoclasts,</STRONG> which are multi-nucleated cells, of which the progenitor cell is a monocyte, that produce hydrogen ions to resorb bone; and<STRONG> osteoblasts,</STRONG> which fill the cavity formed by the osteoclasts with new bone. Activity between the two types of cells is tightly coupled in a <EM>bone remodeling unit.</EM> Bone mass reaches a peak at around age 35. Accelerated bone loss occurs within the first five to ten years after menopause, with a new set point at approximately 85 percent of the peak bone mass. Continued slow bone loss occurs later in life.
<P>
Risk factors for osteoporosis include: 1) thin, small build; 2) family history of osteoporosis; c) excessive tobacco, alcohol or caffeine use; 4) menopause before age 45; and e) certain medications such as corticosteroids, anticonvulsants, excessive thyroid hormone, loop diuretics and heparin. Reaching a low peak bone mass also is a significant factor in future risk of osteoporosis. Of major concern are the poor diets of  present-day teenagers - low in dairy products and high in fast foods and carbonated beverages.
<P>
<H3><STRONG>Diagnosis</STRONG></H3>
Low bone mass is the single most accurate predictor of increased fracture risk. Bone mass is responsible for approximately 75 percent of bone strength. As a general rule, one standard deviation decrease in bone density doubles the fracture risk. In the past, osteoporosis has only been identified after an osteoporotic fracture has occurred. We now have the ability to identify osteoporosis at an earlier stage through the use of bone mass testing. Indications for bone mass testing include: 1) the presence of a risk factor for osteoporosis, such as chronic corticosteroid use; 2) evidence of a vertebral deformity; 3) use in monitoring therapy; or 4) postmenopausal women who can't or won't take estrogen replacement therapy. <STRONG>DEXA (dual energy x-ray absorptionometry)</STRONG> is the preferred method to measure bone mass and has a precision of one percent. Its advantages over CT bone densitometry measurements include much less radiation exposure (1/20th of a chest x-ray) and the ability to scan the hip region in addition to the spine.
<P>
<H3><STRONG>Management of Osteoporosis</STRONG></H3>
Prevention of osteoporosis revolves around the following four factors:

<STRONG>1. Weight-bearing exercise</STRONG> will maintain bone mass. One hour of weight-bearing exercise per day over a period of two years has been shown to increase bone mass approximately eight percent. Conversely, absolute bed rest will decrease bone mass up to one percent per week.
<BR><BR>
<STRONG>2. Adequate calcium intake.</STRONG> The average U.S. diet contains less than 50 percent of the recommended calcium intake. High protein and high salt diets will cause an excess renal calcium loss. An adult should be consuming at least 1000 mg of elemental calcium per day. Adolescents, postmenopausal women and adults over 65 should be taking at least 1500 mg of elemental calcium daily. Calcium carbonate, which is 40 percent calcium, is the most common calcium supplement. However, it is poorly absorbed without stomach acid. Therefore, the elderly who have decreased gastric acid levels and patients on H2 blockers should use an alternative calcium supplement. Calcium citrate is absorbed despite the absence of stomach acid.
<BR><BR>
<STRONG>3. Vitamin D.</STRONG> 1,25 vitamin D is the principal active metabolite, increasing intestinal calcium absorption and with a metabolic effect on bone. Elderly patients tend to have decreased levels of 1,25 vitamin D due to (a) decreased dietary intake; (b) decreased sunlight; (c) decreased skin conversion of vitamin D; and (d) decreased renal conversion to the active form 1,25 vitamin D. The minimum requirement is 400 to 800 units per day. Some may need up to 50,000 units per week.
<BR><BR>
<STRONG>4. Estrogen replacement therapy.</STRONG>  Decreased bone mass occurs within months of estrogen withdrawal or oophorectomy. Estrogen replacement therapy remains the best current option for prevention and treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal females. It decreases the vertebral fracture rate by 50 percent, the incidence of coronary artery disease by 50 percent, and the risk of colon cancer. Women with an intact uterus should combine it with progestin to eliminate the increased risk of endometrial cancer. There may be a 30 percent increased risk of breast cancer in women who take hormonal replacement therapy for more than 10 years. It is recommended that estrogen replacement therapy be taken for a lifetime after menopause. Unfortunately, one study has shown that over 50 percent of patients discontinue estrogens within 12 months of starting therapy.
<P>
New pharmacological options are available for patients who have developed evidence of 
osteoporosis. All agents to date increase bone mass by decreasing osteoclast activity and bone resorption.<STRONG> Fluoride</STRONG>, which increases osteoblast activity, remains experimental.<STRONG> Calcitonin</STRONG> has been available for several years and has been shown to increase vertebral bone mass in the first two years of therapy. Efficacy is lost in greater than 30 percent after 15 months, due to antibody formation against the calcitonin. Side effects include nausea and flushing. It is available in either a subcutaneous or nasal inhalation form.
<P>
<STRONG>Bisphosphonates</STRONG> are synthetic analogs to inorganic pyrophosphates. They bind to 
hydroxyapatite in bone to inhibit osteoclast function. Didronel has been available for years as a treatment for Paget's disease, but has never been FDA-approved for the treatment of osteoporosis because of its inhibitory effect on osteoblast-induced bone formation. A newer third generation of bisphosphonate is alendronate (Fosamax), which was just FDA-approved for postmenopausal osteoporosis. It is much more potent in inhibiting bone resorption and does not inhibit bone formation at the doses recommended. It is very poorly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Therefore, it has to be taken 30 minutes before any food or beverage except for water. The major side effect is gastric or esophageal irritation. After three years, there is an approximately nine percent increased density of the spine and eight percent increased density of the proximal femur, with a 50 percent reduction of vertebral fractures. Continuous daily treatment appears to be required to maintain the effect of the drug.
<P>
<STRONG>In summary</STRONG>, we now have the means to detect and treat osteoporosis before fractures occur. With proper screening and management, hopefully the aging population will not have to experience the deformity and pain associated with osteoporosis.

<STRONG><CENTER><H1>An Overview of the Pap Smear</H1></CENTER></STRONG>
<CENTER><STRONG><H3><i>by Sue Schlafmann, MD, Pathologist<BR>
North Memorial Health Care</i></H3></STRONG></CENTER>
<P>

The Pap smear is a complex test with the purpose of screening for precancerous and cancerous lesions of the cervix. It is a unique screening test because it is not automated and depends entirely on human judgment. Since the discovery of the Pap smear in the 1940s by Dr. George Papanicolaou and its widespread implementation thereafter, several studies have shown a decrease in mortality (overall 70 percent) from cervical cancer.
<P>
<STRONG><H4>Obtaining a Sample</H4></STRONG>
Obtaining a sample for cervical cytology involves a number of factors, and experience often plays a key role in the adequacy of the specimen. Ideally, one should obtain a sample at midcycle, and obtain cells from both the squamocolumnar junction and the endocervix. In addition, there is essential clinical data, particularly ob/gyn history, that needs to be provided for accurate evaluation of the smear.
<P>
<STRONG><H4>Reporting Results and the Bethesda System</H4></STRONG>
Results are reported differently in different labs, although most, including ours, use some form of the Bethesda system.  This system was developed in 1988, in an attempt to standardize reports and provide more clinically relevant information.  It includes a statement regarding the adequacy of the specimen for diagnostic evaluation and a descriptive diagnosis.  Categories for descriptive diagnoses include benign cellular changes (from infection, inflammation, atrophy, etc.) and epithelial cell abnormalities.
<P>
Epithelial abnormalities are further divided into squamous and glandular lesions.  Squamous abnormalities include atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS), low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LGSIL), encompassing HPV and mild dysplasia; high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HGSIL), encompassing moderate and severe dysplasia; and squamous cell carcinoma. Glandular abnormalities include benign endometrial cells in a postmenopausal woman, atypical glandular cells of undetermined significance (AGCUS), endocervical and endometrial adenocarcinoma and extrauterine adenocarcinoma.
<P>
<STRONG><H4>Inadequate Smears</H4></STRONG>
Smears called inadequate for evaluation include those that have a low number of cells and those that have an obscuring artifact such as air drying, lubricant, inflammation, blood or cytolysis. Smears without endocervical cells may also be inadequate depending on the particular patient and clinical situation; adequacy is determined by the clinician in these cases.
<P>
<STRONG><H4>Potential Pitfalls: ASCUS and AGCUS</H4></STRONG>
The categories of ASCUS and AGCUS are for atypical cells that do not meet the criteria for dysplasia or malignancy, but cannot be explained by a reactive process either. Some labs try to further qualify this category as either favoring a reactive change or dysplasia.
<P>
Several investigators have retrospectively looked at Pap smears called ASCUS that had biopsy follow-up; they found that 18-30 percent have dysplasia on biopsy, and 3-10 percent have high grade dysplasia. Other studies have shown that it is very difficult to predict on Pap smears whether the atypical cells will be reactive or show dysplasia, except for those cases that turn out to be high grade dysplasia. Similar studies with similar results have been done with smears called AGCUS. One important point to take from these studies is that atypical glandular cells often are actually high-grade squamous lesions on biopsy, because the cytologic features may overlap.
<P>
<STRONG><H4>Management of the Abnormal Smear</H4></STRONG>
Management of the abnormal Pap smear is controversial and depends somewhat on the natural history of cervical dysplasia. It is known that some dysplasias spontaneously regress over time, others remain unchanged, and others progress to higher grade lesions, including cancer.
<P>
Management of high-grade lesions generally involves colposcopy and biopsy.  Management of ASCUS/AGCUS and low-grade lesions is more variable and may either involve colposcopy and biopsy to rule out a higher grade lesion or regular Pap smears at closer intervals to follow the abnormality. Some have recommended HPV typing to triage patients to either biopsy or repeat smears, but this is currently not a widely accepted alternative due to limitations in our understanding of HPV and its association with cervical dysplasia.
<P>
<STRONG><H4>Pap Smear Failure and False Negatives</H4></STRONG>
Due to the nature of the test, the Pap smear is prone to failure at all levels, including the 
clinical exam, obtaining the specimen, errors in screening and interpretation, the physician's failure to understand the report or take appropriate action, and patient's failure to follow recommendations. Several regulatory guidelines have been suggested to improve quality control in cervical cytology. These include rescreening 10 percent of all negatives, comparing cytologic findings with histologic findings in patients who have biopsy follow-up and reviewing previous material from patients with several consecutive smears.
<P>
Although the Pap smear has reduced cervical mortality since its implementation, it is still only a screening test and has a certain number of false negatives (reported in the literature as high as 50 percent). Studies have shown that most of these are due to sampling error, with a smaller percentage due to screening and interpretative errors. Sampling error is a difficult area to improve upon; since all lesions do not shed cells similarly, some lesions may not be obtainable by either a Pap smear or a biopsy, and some lesions may regress before definitive sampling.
<P>
<STRONG><H4>Automated Screening Devices</H4></STRONG>
The small percentage of false negative cases due to screening errors may be improved in the future with the development of automated screening devices. Two systems have already received FDA approval for rescreening negative smears, PAPNET and AutoPap. While each system works a little differently, they are both designed to screen smears and look for the most abnormal cells. Smears must then be rescreened manually in the lab, either with images on a high resolution video monitor or with the actual slide. Although these devices are designed to lower the false negative rate of Pap smears, they will only have an effect on the small percentage of cases due to screening error, not sampling error, the most common cause for a false negative test.
<P>
Other disadvantages of automated rescreening systems are interpretation of the cells identified as abnormal and cost. Many of the cells identified as abnormal by the system are difficult to interpret and may be classified as atypical cells of undetermined significance. The additional expense that these devices will add to the cost of a Pap smear (conservatively estimated at $35-50) is currently the responsibility of the patient. Until it becomes standard of care in cervical cytology, third-party payers won't be interested in covering the additional expense. This could 
lead to a two-tiered system of screening for cervical cancer, which may pose an ethical dilemma.
<P>
<STRONG><H4>Conclusion</H4></STRONG>
In conclusion, it is important to remember that the Pap smear is only a screening test, and 
while it has proven to be useful in decreasing the mortality of cervical cancer, it also has its limitations.  It is not a diagnostic test and any abnormalities need to be further investigated with a more definitive procedure such as colposcopy and biopsy.  Patients and physicians should be aware of this to avoid burdening this complex test with unreasonable diagnostic standards.

<STRONG><CENTER><H1>Atypical Squamous Cells of Undetermined Significance (ASCUS)</H1></CENTER></STRONG>
<CENTER><STRONG><H3><i>by Thomas Arlander, MD, Pathologist<BR>
North Memorial Health Care</i></H3></STRONG></CENTER>
<P>

Cervical cytology has been a part of medical practice for over 50 years, but only in recent 
years, since the 1988 and 1991 Bethesda Conferences on the nomenclature of cervical cytology abnormalities at NCI, has serious effort gone into standardizing cytology reporting. The so-called Bethesda System is now standard.
<P>
Unfortunately, although the cytologic changes associated with the degrees of squamous 
intraepithelial lesions (SIL) have been well described, changes of uncertain meaning are still subject to a wide range of interpretation. The designation ASCUS (atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance) was invented to cover these uncertainties. Proper use of this category requires a qualifying statement as to whether or not the examiner favors a dysplastic, inflammatory or reparative process. Recommendations for follow-up are often included.
<P>
The cytology literature is replete with articles on what constitutes ASCUS.  They are frequently in considerable disagreement. While the notion that ASCUS cells are those with a nucleus twice the diameter of a normal intermediate cell is the most consistent criterion, from this point each pathology practice goes its own way.  
<P>
Recently, Davey described a mean occurrence of ASCUS at 4 percent of all smears, with 
ranges from 0.2 to 9 percent. At the North Memorial Laboratory, the incidence of the use of 
ASCUS has remained stable over the years at about 1 percent. This would place our laboratory at the 25th percentile on the bell-shaped SD curve when compared to laboratories in the nation as a whole. Laboratories reporting 9 percent  ASCUS were at the 90th percentile level on the curve. Laboratories reporting these large numbers of ASCUS generate a lot of activity and anxiety over findings that are mostly not significant.
<P>
Determining where the proper ASCUS value should lie is difficult. Different populations are served by different laboratories, and we know that the rates of cervical neoplasia vary according to established epidemiological criteria. Different observers, however, treat this classification in vastly different ways. In 1995, our laboratory examined 33,059 cervicovaginal smears and reported 1192 as abnormal. Of the abnormal smears, 267 were reported as ASCUS (22 percent of total abnormal reports).  
<P>
The meaning of ASCUS to the patient and her physician is unclear. Ideally, long-term follow-up with later smears and biopsies might provide the answers. Reality has told us that, rather than high correlation with distinct lesions such as we see with the various SIL categories, ASCUS follow-up can range widely in possibilities. Fortunately for everyone, the most frequent association is with non-disease, inflammation and repair and individual variation. Some individuals with ASCUS smears have important lesions, including all degrees of SIL. Some individuals with normal cytology also have important lesions not uncovered by a particular smear. We assume that those with ASCUS are more likely to have some abnormality than those with normal smears.  
<P>
Of the 199 cases in our practice in 1994, where ASCUS was reported, follow-up statistics 
showed that only  27 or 14 percent showed squamous intraepithelial lesions on follow-up 
biopsy.  Of those followed by smear only, 10 out of 87 were abnormal on the repeat smear. It might be expected that the 22 percent who did not return for follow-up might include several cases of SIL.
<P>
The practice of cervical cytology has been fodder for the media for a number of years, at least since the <EM>Wall Street Journal</EM> expose of substandard cytology practices nine years ago.  The result of that article was the writing into the Federal Register of regulations related to cytology practice and the subsequent regulations of CLIA 88 (Clinical Laboratories Improvement Act). Cytology practice is highly regulated today, and the standards have become very high.
<P>
In spite of these regulations, certain laboratories have fallen through the regulatory cracks.  The recent experience of a hospital laboratory in Milwaukee, in which two young women subsequently died related to non-diagnosis of disease on cervical smears, illustrates this problem. While the laboratory was clearly shown to be seriously in error, the subsequent court trials led to examples of how junk science can dominate reason. In examining these proceedings for CAP Today, a publication of the College of American Pathologists, Dr. R. Marshall Austin quoted one expert who "claimed personally no false negative smears in 30 years of practice." The cytology literature accepts up to 30 percent false negatives as within reason.  Another pathologist claimed he could identify an abnormal smear  "in less than 5 seconds." Testimony such as this add little to the stature of cervical cytology as a science.  Slides from these cases examined by experts illustrated the possibility of disagreement. One slide received three different opinions from three different experts.  Among the areas of disagreement were in the ASCUS/AGCUS  category.
<P>
ASCUS and its cousin AGCUS (atypical glandular cells of undetermined significance) remain useful categories in cervical cytology. They should be considered a warning to the patient and her physician of a possible future problem. ASCUS/AGCUS, in our hands, will be reported in about one percent of cases. There is no need to panic.  Follow-up should occur within a reasonable period of time. Our recommended follow-up is repeat smear, not biopsy, and it should occur at about six months. After a repeat normal smear, a routine schedule of repeat smears should then be resumed. If the follow-up is still ASCUS or if SIL is noted, then colposcopy and biopsy are indicated.  
<P>
ASCUS smears remain a problem for patients and their physicians.  It is important to know the experience of the laboratory to which you send cytologic material in order to make informed decisions on future care of your patients.

<STRONG><CENTER><H1>Pap Smears for Patients with Prior Hysterectomy</H1></CENTER></STRONG>
<CENTER><STRONG><H3><i>by Seymour Handler, MD<BR>
North Memorial Health Care</i></H3></STRONG></CENTER>
<P>

A recent  <STRONG>JAMA</STRONG> study (275[12]:940, March 27, 1996) and related coverage in the May 1996 <STRONG>OB/GYN Clinical Alert</STRONG> examined the value of performing Papanicolaou smears of the vaginal cuff of women with prior hysterectomy for benign disease. The stimulus for this literature review was concern for cost containment and efficacy.  Since over one-third of women in the U.S. will undergo hysterectomy by age 60, and since 85 percent of the surgery was performed for benign disease, the magnitude of Pap smears on this patient population is substantial, perhaps a half million smears annually, for a total charge of over one hundred million dollars. Three objectives of current screening practice were described: 1)  existing screening recommendations by national authorities; 2)  the risk of vaginal malignancy after total hysterectomy for benign disease; and 3) whether the test meets the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) criteria of an effective test.
<P>
National organizations remain ambiguous on the question, presumably because it has become almost a cardinal sin to suggest that Pap smears be limited. The American Cancer Society (ACS) continues to recommend Pap smears after hysterectomy, albeit at greater time intervals. This recommendation should be considered in the context that the ACS recommends fecal occult blood testing and serum prostate-specific antigen tests despite other opinions that these tests remain unproven in value as screening tests for cancer. The National Cancer Institute and the American Academy of Family Practice remain ambiguous. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) is also ambiguous, possibly to avoid offending members who continue to screen.
<P>
Most case-control studies have failed to show a relationship between vaginal cancer and prior hysterectomy for benign disease. Further, because of the very low incidence of this disease, vaginal Pap smears could not be recommended as a screening test. Further, there are no studies to suggest that the outcome of the rare vaginal malignancy was improved by detection with a Pap smear.  Finally, the USPSTF has unequivocally stated that the practice of Pap smears of the vagina after hysterectomy for benign disease does not meet screening criteria.
<P>
If there is no apparent yield in early detection of cancer from performing a vaginal Pap smear, why is it such a widespread practice? The answer to this question is not addressed in the positions of the organizations recommending or discouraging the practice. The reason lies in the value of periodic health evaluations by clinicians, hoping to detect breast tumors, hypertension and other disorders. The Pap smear may be the stimulus for women to return to their physician for a periodic health exam; without the Pap smear, they may consider a return visit unnecessary. Although women may be addicted to a regular Pap smear, thinking that all cancers are detected by the test, the question to be addressed by clinicians promoting the exam is twofold: <STRONG> 1)</STRONG>  Is a periodic health exam of value in disease detection or  other valid medical reasons?<STRONG> 2)</STRONG>  Is the vaginal Pap smear in patients with prior hysterectomy for benign disease necessary to induce patients to return for a periodic health evaluation?  Both questions would require an affirmative answer to justify the procedure.
<P>
If indeed the indication for a screening test for cancer is lacking in performing a vaginal Pap smear, and if the reason for performing the test is to entice patients to return for an annual periodic health evaluation, isn't this practice a bit deceitful? If the purpose of a return visit is preventive medicine in its broadest context, then that should be the reason for a visit, not a Pap smear without justified yield. This argument has already been accepted by one of our ob-gyn groups who will no longer perform vaginal Pap smears in women with prior hysterectomyfor benign disease. Keep in mind that patients with prior dysplasia or other pelvic malignancies are not included in this discussion.

<H3><STRONG><EM>by Diane Wallner, MD<BR>
North Memorial/U of Minnesota Family Practice Resident, 1993-96</EM></STRONG></H3>
<P>	
In today's society, some families want to have the opportunity to inquire about the health of the fetus they have conceived. The parental desire to have a normal child and the lack of recognizable external signs of abnormality create the need for a system to screen women who may be at a higher risk of having an abnormal child. Prenatal screening has become the standard of care in obstetrics.
<P>	
Until biochemical screening became available, the most frequent method for selecting women at increased risk for fetal Down Syndrome (DS) was advanced maternal age. Currently, amniocentesis is offered to women who are 35 years or older or with known risk factors for DS. However, 75 to 80 percent of women with DS fetuses are younger than 35 and have no risk factors.  With the onset of biochemically based prenatal screening, we can now detect those women at higher risk and offer them further testing.
<P>	
Additional serum markers currently used with maternal serum alpha fetoprotein (MSAFP) to increase sensitivity are beta human chorionic gonadotropin (B-hCG) and unconjugated estriol (UE3).  MSAFP is a glycoprotein synthesized by the liver. Open neural tube defects (NTD), ventral wall defects and renal anomalies cause an elevation in MSAFP, whereas DS, Trisomy 18, missed abortion, molar pregnancy and IUGR cause a decrease in MSAFP. There has also been shown an association between elevated MSAFP and poor fetal outcomes with an increased risk of placental abnormalities, preterm deliveries, 
IUGR, congenital heart and vascular defects and neonatal deaths.  MSAFP was initially used alone as a screening test for DS, but is only about 20 percent sensitive.
<P>	
B-hCG is a glycoprotein produced by the placenta. It is the single best screening test for DS, with a sensitivity of about 40 percent. When used in combination with MSAFP, the sensitivity of the test increases to 55 to 57 percent.
<P>	
Estriol is a steroid hormone made by the placenta and requires fetal liver for synthesis. Its addition to the triple screen only increases the sensitivity of the test slightly to approximately 60 percent, but it is used to screen for Trisomy 18.
<P>	
Ideally, the triple screen should select those women at higher risk of delivering an abnormal fetus and allow us to offer them further diagnostic testing and counseling if wanted.  Therefore, there needs to be an acceptable balance between detection rate and false positive rate. Currently, a five percent false positive rate is acceptable. At this level of specificity, for every 50 women offered further diagnostic testing, one case of DS will be detected. This is certainly not ideal but the best we have to offer at this time.
<P>	
Mayo Medical Laboratories is currently using four serum markers for detection of DS: AFP, total hCG, UE3 and free alpha hCG.  The addition of the free alpha subunit of hCG to the triple test increases the detection rate for DS to approximately 65 percent ,with less than a five percent false positive rate.
<P>	
Serum markers are reported back to the physicians as multiples of the median (MoM).  MoM = patient's value/median value (of that lab). By reporting the results as MoM, this is thought to standardize the values between labs. There are variables that require adjustment in order to get accurate MoM, so every lab needs to know patient's age, race, gestational age, weight and diabetic status. The physician will then receive MoM for each component of the triple screen and the patient's overall risk of having a fetus with DS, NTD or Trisomy 18. A positive test is any woman whose risk is greater than 1:200, which is the risk of a 35-year-old female having a fetus with DS.
<P>	
What should be done with an abnormal screening test? Repeat testing is only recommended for elevated MSAFP between 2.5 to 4 MoM. A repeat test will regress toward its median for the true situation. Thus, in normal pregnancy, a repeat value is likely to be nearer the normal median, while if true levels are quite high, the repeat value is likely to be clearly abnormal. Repeat testing is not recommended for low MSAFP because both medians (normal and abnormal) lie on the same side of the 
graph.
<P>	
An ultrasound anatomical examination of the fetus is recommended. It will help confirm dates, and may also pick up NTD, ventral wall defects and other anomalies. Genetic counseling should always be offered to women with an abnormal screening test. This will give patients a better understanding of just what their test results mean and then allows them to make informed decisions. The gold standard of diagnostic testing is amniocentesis. However, the risk of amniocentesis is 0.5 percent for a singleton 
pregnancy and is user dependent. Therefore, the risk of having an abnormal fetus must be greater than the risk of an amniocentesis before this test should be offered.
<P>	
In conclusion, it is very important to inform the patient that the triple screen is only a screening test. It is not diagnostic. A positive test does not mean abnormality nor does a normal test completely rule it out. Many times further tests need to be performed before a diagnosis can be made.

Solitary thyroid nodules are commonly seen in clinical practice. Thyroid nodules increase with 
age and are present in four to seven percent of the adult population. Autopsy studies reveal the 
presence of thyroid nodules in 50 percent of autopsy specimens. Ninety-five percent of solitary 
thyroid nodules are benign, and five percent of thyroid nodules are malignant.  Common 
etiologies of the benign thyroid nodules are benign adenomas, thyroid cysts and Hashimoto's 
thyroiditis. Uncommon etiologies of benign thyroid nodules are subacute thyroiditis, painless 
thyroiditis, unilateral lobe agenesis, or Riedel's struma. The most common types of thyroid 
cancers are differentiated, with papillary carcinoma accounting for 60 percent, follicular 
carcinoma accounting for 12 percent, and follicular variant of papillary carcinoma accounting 
for six percent of all thyroid cancers. As thyroid cancers usually present as a solitary thyroid 
nodule, the clinician must differentiate benign from cancerous solitary thyroid nodules.  While 
history, examination, laboratory, thyroid hormone suppression, ultrasound and thyroid scans 
can all provide information regarding a solitary thyroid nodule, the only modality which can 
differentiate benign from cancerous thyroid nodules is the fine needle aspiration biopsy. 
<P>
The evaluation of a solitary thyroid nodule should always include history and examination. The 
following favor a benign thyroid nodule: family history of Hashimoto's thyroiditis; family 
history of benign thyroid nodule or goiter; symptoms of hyperthryroidism or hypothyroidism; 
pain or tenderness associated with a nodule; a soft, smooth, mobile nodule; or a multinodular 
goiter without a predominant nodule. The following features of history/examination increase 
the suspicion of a malignant nodule: age less than 20 or greater than 70, male gender, or a 
nodule plus dysphagia or hoarseness. Additionally, a history of external neck irradiation during 
childhood; a firm, irregular and fixed nodule; presence of cervical lymphadenopathy; or 
previous history of thyroid cancer, increase the likelihood that a nodule is malignant.  
<P>
Thyroid hormone levels are usually normal, and normal thyroid hormone levels do not 
differentiate benign from cancerous nodules; however, the presence of hyperthyroidism or 
hypothyroidism favors the benign nodule.  Thyroglobulin levels are useful tumor markers once 
the diagnosis of malignancy has been made, but are nonspecific in regard to differentiating a 
benign from a cancerous thyroid nodule.
<P>
Ultrasound accurately determines thyroid gland volume, number and size of nodules; separates 
thyroid from nonthyroidal masses; helps guide fine needle biopsy when necessary; and can 
identify solid nodules as small as 3 mm and cystic nodules as small as 2 mm. Although several 
ultrasound features favor the presence of a benign nodule, and other ultrasound features favor 
the presence of a cancerous nodule, ultrasound cannot be used to differentiate benign from 
malignant nodules. And since 15 percent of cystic thyroid nodules are malignant, ultrasound 
determination that a nodule is cystic does not rule out thyroid cancer.
<P>
Nodules detected by thyroid scans are classified as cold, hot or warm; 85 percent of thyroid 
nodules are cold, 10 percent are warm, and five percent are hot. Eighty-five percent of cold 
nodules are benign, 90 percent of warm nodules are benign, and 95 percent of hot nodules are 
benign.  Although thyroid scanning can give a probability that a nodule is benign or malignant, 
it cannot truly differentiate benign or malignant nodules and cannot be used as the basis for 
recommending treatment of the nodule, including thyroid surgery.
<P>
Thyroid fine needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy is the only method which can differentiate 
malignant and benign nodules in most, but not all, cases.  Several aspirates are obtained for 
cytologic review. The nodule is then classified as nondiagnostic, benign, suspicious or 
malignant. Nondiagnostic indicates that there are an insufficient number of thyroid cells in the 
aspirate and no diagnosis is possible. A nondiagnostic aspirate should be repeated, as a 
diagnostic aspirate will be obtained approximately 50 percent of the time when the aspirate is 
repeated. Overall, five to 10 percent of biopsies are nondiagnostic, and the patient should then 
undergo either an ultrasound or a thyroid scan for further evaluation. The majority of thyroid 
aspirations are benign and consist of benign follicular epithelium with a variable amount of 
colloid. 
<P>
The following thyroid malignancies can be diagnosed by FNA: papillary, follicular variant of 
papillary, medullary, anaplastic, thyroid lymphoma, and metastases to the thyroid. Follicular 
carcinoma and Hurthle cell carcinoma cannot be diagnosed by FNA biopsy.
<P>
Approximately 10 percent of FNAs reveal suspicious cytology. The thyroid cells on these 
aspirates are neither clearly benign nor malignant, but 25 percent of suspicious lesions are 
found to be malignant when patients undergo thyroid surgery. These are usually follicular or 
Hurthle cell cancers. Therefore, surgery is recommended for the treatment of thyroid nodules 
from which a suspicious aspiration has been obtained.
<P>
FNA is the first, and in the vast majority of cases, the only test required for the evaluation of a 
solitary thyroid nodule. (A TSH value should also be obtained to evaluate thyroid function.) 
Thyroid ultrasound and thyroid scans are rarely required for evaluation of a solitary thyroid 
nodule. FNA has reduced the cost for evaluation and treatment of thyroid nodules, and has 
improved yield of cancer found at thyroid surgery.
<P>
Although a solitary thyroid nodule can enlarge or shrink over time, the natural history of 
solitary nodules reveals that most nodules change little with time. Several studies reveal that 
suppression with thyroid hormone does not decrease the size of thyroid nodules. Therefore, 
unless a nodule is growing or becoming symptomatic, it is not necessary to suppress the 
nodule. In addition, suppression of a thyroid nodule would require long-term TSH suppression, 
potentially increasing the risk of osteoporosis in these patients.
<P>
While there has always been a traditional differentiation between thyroid glands with a solitary 
nodule and multinodular goiters, it has been shown that approximately 50 percent of patients 
with a solitary nodule on exam will have additional nodules on thyroid ultrasound. Therefore, 
the differentiation between solitary nodules and multinodular goiters is becoming less clear-cut, 
although it has traditionally been believed that the presence of a multinodular goiter reduces the 
likelihood that a thyroid cancer is present. However, recent studies indicate that there is an 
equal likelihood for developing thyroid cancer in a multinodular goiter just as in a solitary 
thyroid nodule. If a multinodular goiter has a predominant nodule, the predominant nodule 
should be biopsied.
<P>
In conclusion, FNA of the thyroid is a safe, inexpensive and effective way to distinguish a 
benign from a malignant nodule and usually should be the first diagnostic test performed.

<TITLE>Type II Diabetes Mellitus - NMHC </TITLE>

<STRONG><CENTER><H1>Treatment of Type II <BR>Diabetes Mellitus</H1></CENTER></STRONG>
<hr>
<STRONG><H3><i>by Rob Kemp, MD, Family Practice Resident<BR>
North Memorial Health Care</i></H3></STRONG>
<P>

Type II diabetes mellitus - noninsulin-dependent diabetes (NIDDM) - has a prevalence of 
approximately eight to 10 million Americans, affecting 10 percent of individuals over the age of 70. Within the past two years, the FDA has approved two new medications for the control of blood glucose. In addition to the sulfonylureas and insulin, we have metformin (Glucophage - Bristol-Myers Squibb) and acarbose (Precose - Bayer). Both of these new medications have different mechanisms of action than the sulfonylureas, and therefore, can be used alone or in combination with the former.
<P>
The etiology of Type II diabetes is essentially unknown; however, there is likely a genetic 
component, with more than 20 percent of first-degree relatives also affected by the illness, and a 90-100 percent occurrence in identical twins. The pathogenesis of this disease involves abnormalities in insulin release from the pancreatic islet cells, diminished insulin action at peripheral tissues, as well as accelerated hepatic glucose production. To make the diagnosis of Type II diabetes, two fasting blood glucose levels >140 mg/dl are needed, or a random nonfasting blood glucose value >200 mg/dl, along with classic symptoms of polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia and weight loss. Oral glucose tolerance testing can be utilized to make the diagnosis.
<P>
With the data published by the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial Research Group 
(DCCT) in 1993, it is believed that tighter control of blood glucose (i.e., near 
"normoglycemia") is the goal to strive for in the management of diabetes mellitus. This study showed a 50-70 percent reduction in the risk for developing the microvascular complications of diabetes mellitus in the intensively treated group (hemoglobin A1C = 7.2) versus a 
conventionally treated group (hemoglobin A1C values of approximately 9.2). However, this study involved only patients with Type I (or insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus. Additional studies are now in progress to evaluate the effect of tight blood glucose control in Type II 
diabetes. Overall, it is believed that near normoglycemia will also be beneficial in Type II 
diabetes, with the American Diabetes Association stating "the results of the DCCT suggest that 
many otherwise healthy patients with NIDDM should strive to achieve tight control."
<P>
Treatment of Type II diabetes should focus on setting patient goals for achievable blood glucose 
values and include intensive education on their disease. Diet and exercise (with weight loss), 
occasionally sufficient to control the illness, should be stressed in most patients with Type II 
diabetes. However, escalation of treatment is often needed by  adding a pharmacologic agent.
<P>
The class of medications known as sulfonylureas were discovered serendipitously in 1942, 
during the search for new sulfa antibiotics, and were first used to treat Type II diabetics in 
1952. The mechanism of action of the sulfonylureas is still somewhat controversial. These 
drugs are known to stimulate beta-cells to release insulin from the pancreas; they may also act 
to lower peripheral and hepatic insulin resistance, but more likely through an indirect 
mechanism rather than a direct effect of the agent on those tissues.
<P>
Glyburide, a commonly used sulfonylurea, is usually started at a low dose (2.5 mg) once daily. 
The dose may be increased every one to two weeks to 5.0 mg QD, then 5.0 mg BID, then 10 
mg QAM and 5.0 mg QPM, and finally, if needed, to the maximum dose of 10 mg BID.  
Generally, this class of medications can result in a one to two point drop in hemoglobin A1C  
values, or a 60 mg/dl decrease in fasting plasma glucose levels. Since these agents stimulate 
insulin production, they can cause clinically significant hypoglycemia as an adverse side effect. 
They can also cause nausea, vomiting, abdominal discomfort, rashes and weight gain. These 
medications are contraindicated in Type I diabetes, diabetes secondary to removal or 
destruction of the pancreas, pregnancy, major surgery or trauma, severe infections, or a history 
of sensitivity/allergy to sulfa drugs or other sulfonylureas.
<P>
Metformin was introduced in Europe in 1957. Its sister drug - phenformin - was used in the 
U.S., but removed from the market in 1977, following deaths resulting from lactic acidosis. 
This class of medications is known as the biguanides, and is believed to function by decreasing 
hepatic gluconeogenesis and increasing peripheral glucose uptake. Metformin has been shown 
to decrease hemoglobin A1C values approximately 1.8 percentage points, similar to the 
sulfonylureas. This drug is started at a dosage of 500 mg BID with morning and evening meals. 
It can be increased at one-week intervals to 1000 mg QAM and 500 mg QPM, then 1000 mg 
BID, and if needed, to the maximum dose of 850 mg TID.  
<P>
Side effects are common (30 percent) and include nausea, bloating, diarrhea and abdominal 
cramping. Initial side effects may disappear with time in many patients. As noted, metformin 
does not cause hypoglycemia, and therefore, could be used as first-line therapy in patients 
where this side effect would be very undesirable, such as in frail elderly patients or those 
involved in the transportation industry. Likewise, this medication can be used in combination 
with a sulfonylurea if maximum monotherapy is unsuccessful. Given its ability to cause 
significant acidosis if used improperly, this agent does have rigid contraindications, including 
renal dysfunction (creatinine >1.5 in men and >1.4 in women), liver dysfunction, history of 
alcohol abuse or binge drinking, acute or chronic metabolic acidosis, or conditions 
predisposing to renal insufficiency or hypoxia (i.e., acute MI or acute CHF, severe infection, 
use of iodinated contrast media, etc.).
<P>
The most recently approved drug for the treatment of Type II diabetes is acarbose. This 
medication is in a class of drugs known as alpha-glucosidase inhibitors, and was developed in 
Germany and used there for many years. Acarbose has no severe side effects such as lactic 
acidosis or hypoglycemia. It delays the breakdown and absorption of carbohydrates in the gut, 
which results in decreased post-prandial glucose levels and overall glucose load. More modest 
reductions in hemoglobin A1C values (0.5 - 1.0 percentage points) generally occur when 
compared to the sulfonylureas or metformin. The medication is started at 25 mg TID before 
meals and may be increased at four to eight-week intervals up to 50 mg TID for patients 
weighing less than 60 kg, or 100 mg TID for heavier patients. Cramping, flatulence, abdominal 
distension and diarrhea are common (40 percent), but are dose dependent and may resolve after 
initial exposure to the drug. The only contraindications are pregnancy, lactation, or a 
significant GI disorder.
<P>
Combination therapy with any two of the above three medications should be considered, if 
hemoglobin A1C values are between 7.5 and 10 percent, despite maximal monotherapy. 
Unfortunately, a significant number of patients will not achieve adequate glycemic control 
despite maximum oral therapy (hemoglobin A1C  values >10 percent) and will need to be 
started on insulin to obtain better control of their blood glucose levels. Insulin can be used in 
combination with the sulfonylureas, metformin or acarbose. A fairly common approach is 
known as bedtime insulin and daytime sulfonylurea (BIDS). Usually 0.1 to 0.2 U/kg of 
intermediate acting insulin (NPH) is used at bedtime. The insulin dose is increased until fasting 
blood glucose levels are less than 150 mg/dl. Improvement is usually seen within four to six 
weeks. Sole exogenous insulin is indicated if random glucose values are greater than 350 mg/dl 
or fasting glucose levels greater than 300 mg/dl at the time of diagnosis. Sole exogenous insulin 
is also indicated when other methods have failed. When insulin is used independent of other 
agents, the dose is usually 0.3 U/Kg (current weight), distributed as two-thirds in the morning 
and one-third in the evening, with the insulin ratio of regular:NPH being 1:2 in the morning 
and 1:1 in the evening. The major side effect from insulin usage is hypoglycemia; weight gain, 
insulin edema, lipoatrophy and lipohypertrophy also occur.
<P>
With the introduction of two new classes of medication in the treatment of Type II diabetes, we 
have further avenues at our disposal to help our patients achieve tighter blood glucose control 
and hopefully delay the onset of serious complications related to this disease.

<hr>
<P>
<STRONG><H3><i>by Gregory Pflaster, MD, Pediatrician<BR>
North Memorial Health Care</i></H3></STRONG>

In 1969, the U.S. Surgeon General testifying before Congress stated, "It is time to close the 
book on infectious diseases." Most primary care givers would find it interesting that the 
number of office visits for otitis media have increased from 9.91 million visits in 1975, to 24.5 
million visits in 1990. What accounts for this increase in visits? Increased day care? Better 
diagnosis?  Better insurance and access to care? More important, what should we do for the 
working parent with an ill child, who is demanding antibiotics for a return to day care? In the 
following discussion, several areas will be covered: the basics of sinusitis and otitis, common 
questions that parents bring up in the office, and why care givers should be wary of antibiotic 
overuse.
<P>
From December to April, it seems that every parent feels that their child has a sinus infection 
that needs<EM> the pink stuff.</EM> As practitioners know, all of these kids can't possibly have sinusitis. 
The complication rate of sinusitis arising from a URI  is only 0.5 to 5 percent. What 
differentiates a sinusitis from a simple upper respiratory infection? A knowledge of the basic 
anatomy of the sinuses is a starting point.  
<P>
Remember, there are only two sinuses present at birth, the ethmoid and the maxillary.  These 
are the clinically relevant sinuses when dealing with a toddler. Full development occurs in both 
by age 3. The osteomeatal complex is the area beneath the middle turbinate where the frontal, 
maxillary and anterior ethmoid sinuses drain. Infection can arise from a blockage in this area. 
Any process that impairs the patency of the sinus ostia, the ciliary motion, or increases the 
thickness of secretions, can lead to sinusitis.  
<P>
What differentiates a URI from sinusitis? Most experts agree that 10 days of non-improving 
nasal discharge, day and night cough, should lead to a consideration of sinusitis. The normal 
cold will last for up to two weeks; however, by day 10, there should be significant 
improvement. Nocturnal cough alone is not indicative, as this may be secondary to normal post 
nasal drainage. Color or thickness of secretions is also not diagnostic, as the normal upper 
respiratory infection will progress from clear to thick, mucoid, purulent secretions, and then 
back. 
<P>
Other signs and symptoms may include fever, fetid breath, painless morning periorbital 
swelling. Headache and face pain may occur in older children. The physical exam is non-
specific.  The most common diagnostic tests used are radiographs.  A sinus film is diagnostic if 
total opacification, air fluid level, or greater than 4 mm of mucosal thickening can be seen. The 
use of radiological diagnosis in children has been controversial due to the variation of 
development and the difficulty of getting good radiographs in young kids. If there is a strong 
clinical suspicion of sinusitis, forgo the radiograph and treat. The most common organisms 
causing sinusitis include: Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella 
catarrhalis. The first line treatment is still amoxicillin or Septra. If clinical improvement is not 
seen within 72 hours, the patient needs to be re-evaluated, and the use of an antibiotic effective 
against beta lactamase producers should be considerated.
<P>
Otitis media is one of the most frequent diagnoses that the average primary practitioner makes. 
Otitis accounts for 25 percent of all visits in the first year of life; 62 percent of children will 
have had otitis by one year of age; 80 percent  of children will have had otitis by age 3. As in 
sinusitis, the signs and symptoms of otitis may be non-specific; 40 percent of children will have 
had a preceding URI; 50 percent will present with fever. Vomiting, sleeplessness, 
conjunctivitis, ear tugging, drainage and pain may also be seen.
<P>
Otitis is diagnosed by the following: The tympanic membrane is opaque, has poorly visualized 
landmarks, is bulging, or lateral and medial mobility is impaired. The red ear which is 
otherwise normal is not otitis! Chances are if the child's face is red from a fever, or (more 
likely) screaming, the tympanic membrane will also be red. The microorganisms responsible 
for otitis media are essentially the same ones that cause sinusitis. There is a strong correlation 
of otitis with certain viruses such as RSV, influenza A and parainfluenza. The first line 
treatment is still amoxicillin or Septra. If clinical improvement is not seen within 48 to 72 
hours, the patient should be re-examined and a change to an antibiotic effective against beta 
lactamase producers should be considered. Though tympanocentesis may come back into vogue 
with the increasing incidence of antimicrobial resistance, the recommendation still calls for it if: 
the diagnosis is uncertain, the child is toxic in appearance, or there have been multiple 
antibiotic courses with a continued otitis.
<P>
Although practitioners know what to treat, and what not to treat, what are we to do about the 
parent who is demanding antibiotics? The answer is education. The following are several of the 
more common questions and statements that the practitioner hears several times a day, every 
day of the winter.<P>
<P>

<UL>
<LI><STRONG><EM>MY CHILD HAS  A COLD ALL OF THE TIME.</EM></STRONG>  The average child in the first two years of 
life has six to nine URIs a year. Fit this into a six-month winter (optimistic in Minnesota), 
and that is a new infection every four weeks. The average cold lingers for two weeks, so 
this leaves about 10 days before another infection hits. The answer is, "You're right, your 
child is sick often!"
<P>
<LI><STRONG><EM>MY CHILD HAS NOT BEEN SLEEPING WELL; I KNOW HE HAS AN EAR INFECTION! </EM></STRONG> 
This is usually the child who has perfect tympanic membranes on exam. It is normal for 
any child (or adult) to sleep poorly in the first few days of a URI secondary to mouth 
breathing, nasal congestion and post nasal drip. The follow-up question is usually, "What 
can I give my child?" The answer: humidity, head elevation, and cleaning out of nasal 
passages. Most studies indicate that anti-tussives, decongestants, and antihistamines do little 
to help with symptomatic relief. Agents such as decongestants may actually worsen the problem by impeding clearance of secretions by impairing ciliary motion.
<P>
<LI><STRONG><EM>DOES BREASTFEEDING PREVENT EAR INFECTIONS?</EM></STRONG> Yes! In one of the larger studies was completed in Tucson in 1993, of the 1,013 children examined, those breastfed exclusively for four months had one-half the risk of otitis that non-breastfed children had. There also appeared to be protective effect against recurrent otitis, and some protection past the time of breastfeeding.
<P>
<LI><STRONG><EM>I ONLY SMOKE IN THE OTHER ROOM, IS THAT A PROBLEM?</EM></STRONG> The simple answer is yes. In a study from Tucson of 1246 children, those whose mothers smoked greater than 20 cigarettes a day had an increased risk of recurrent otitis. If the child had a low (less than 3.5 kg) birth weight and the mother smoked, there was 3.5-fold increase in risk for otitis. Interestingly, there was no correlation with paternal smoking.
<P>
<LI><STRONG><EM>MY CHILD IS IN DAY CARE 40 HOURS A WEEK; IS THAT A PROBLEM?</EM> </STRONG> The bad news is yes. Studies in the last four years show an increase in the carriage of penicillin-resistant pneumococci and otitis in those children who attend large day care centers. Several studies have shown an increase in polyethylene tube (PET) placement in those children in large day cares when compared with children not in day care. One pediatric ENT physician has presented the option that for recurrent fluid or otitis, parents of children that attend day cares should be given the option of PET placement sooner than is currently standard.
</UL>

<P>
We know what to treat and when to treat, then why worry about a few antibiotics? The answer: 
"The microbe always wins." In 1970, all pneumococci, Haemophilus and Moraxella were 
sensitive to ampicillin. In 1996, 10 to 15 percent of pneumococci, 20 to 35 percent of 
Haemophilus, and 75 percent of Moraxella are resistant to ampicillin. Primary care 
practitioners are hearing  more concerning reports of resistance. For example, at a day care in 
Bardstown, Kentucky in 1992, 28 percent of cultured pneumococci from middle ear aspirates 
were resistant to penicillin. Several reports from large cities show increasing pneumococcal 
resistance to penicillin and some cephalosporins.
<P>
 What are the risk factors for development of resistant bugs?
<OL>
<LI>Age less than 3 years.<BR>
<LI>Use of B-lactam antibiotics within 3 months.<BR>
<LI>Multiple antibiotic courses.<BR>
</OL>

<P>
If this evidence says we should be careful, why treat at all? Studies in large populations have 
shown that approximately 85 percent of otitis will improve on its own, and that 40 percent of 
sinusitis resolves on its own. Most of us continue to treat for fear of the complications, which 
can include:
<UL>
<LI>periorbital/orbital cellulitis
<LI>mastoiditis
<LI>facial nerve palsies
<LI>intracranial problems
</UL>


<P>
In one region of Germany, where nontreatment and watchful waiting has been the norm, there 
has been a subsequent increase in the above complications.
<P>
What can be done to prevent this increasing resistance? One answer is the careful use of 
antibiotics, meaning the avoidance of big guns whenever possible. 
<P>
Short courses of antibiotics are gaining some popularity (although 10-day courses are still the 
standard). Five-day courses for otitis are common in Europe, and several studies have 
originated in the U.S. that support equivalent treatment successes in shorter durations of 
treatment. In addition, there are several easy things that all practitioners can do to limit the 
spread of resistant bacteria:
<UL>
<LI>Wash your hands!
<LI>Immunize!
<LI>Know your local resistance patterns!
<LI>Dont treat viral infections with antibiotics!
<LI>Dont use broad spectrum antibiotics!
<LI>Limit prophylaxis!
<LI>Shorten duration of antibiotic use!
</UL>

<P>
In closing, my plea is to step back and consider what you are treating before you prescribe an 
antibiotic. E.B. White summarizes it much more eloquently: "I would feel more optimistic 
about a bright future for man if he spent less time proving he can outwit nature and more time 
tasting her sweetness and respecting her seniority."

<P>For many nurses, home health aides, nursing assistants, and others in
the health care profession, working the night or evening shift isn't a
choice but a necessity. For others, you work nights because you love it.
</P>

<P>Like it or not, shift work is a reality in which sleep, nutrition and
relationships are life style adjustments you have to make to do your job.
Join us as our speaker helps you explore the barriers that working nights
and evenings present. You will look at ways to strengthen relationships,
improve your nutritional status, enhance your professional experience and
bring your life back into holistic balance. </P>

<P>Chi-Gong is an ancient Chinese therapy that was developed thousands
of years ago. The basis of Chi-Gong is the belief that energy flows in
a systematic pattern in our bodies. When this energy is blocked, disease
or pain occurs. Chi-Gong uses special methods of breathing, posture and
concentration to put this energy back in harmony. It is an invaluable tool
for self-improvement, self healing and spiritual development..

<P> <BR>
<P>
<STRONG>
<IMG HEIGHT=43 WIDTH=31 SRC="graphics/i.jpg" ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT SIZE= +2>f you are not 
familiar with the World Wide Web,</FONT> 
<FONT SIZE= +1>the one essential is to have a 
basic understanding of what hypertext is: <EM>hypertext is simply a method of linking related 
information so one may easily move from one entry to another related entry</EM>. 
<BR>
<P>
Those links are a visual key which allows the user easy access to other information. To the 
user, it does not matter where those additional resources are. All the user needs to know is 
to click on that visual key to continue on to more information.

<P>
On the World Wide Web, each hypertext link, the visual key, is <em>usually</em> indicated by 
a word or words underlined and in the color blue (or any other color than the main text). If 
you click on a highlighted word or phrase <strong>or a graphic</strong> bordered by the same 
color as the highlighting, your browser will load another page of information. 

<P>
That new page may be in the same directory, in a different directory of the same computer, or on 
a completely different machine across the hall or halfway around the world. It doesn't matter 
where that new file is to the program --nor, usually, to the user. It is not difficult to learn 
to recognize many of the computer addressing conventions used within the hypertext links.  
For most people, it is simply unnecessary.

<P>
<STRONG>TO MOVE ON</STRONG>, simply place your cursor over any underlined, highlighted text 
and click. Many of the links here will take you to other states and other countries, and almost 
all of those sites will include links to take you further on your link. Can you get lost in an 
endless string of links? Well, not really since you can always find yourself. 

<P>
<EM>TO RETURN</EM> one link, click on the back button at the top of the page of your browser 
or the GO on the status bar which will drop down a list of the pages you have visited and allow 
you to return to any of them by simply clicking on the earlier site. To return clear back to the 
opening screen of your browser, click on the Home button <em>in the toolbar at the top of the 
screen</em> or the home choice under the GO on the status bar. (If the open page has a "Home" 
botton, it will be the beginning page of which it is a section, not "your" home, so may take 
you someplace you've never yet been.)

<P>
That's all you have to know to get around the World Wide Web. Is there more? Of course. There 
are boxes inside boxes, but you can decide how much more you want to know. When you're ready 
for more, there are many places on the Web waiting to help you. A few of the more basic ones 
are available from North Memorial Medical Library's page <A HREF="employee/guides.htm"> 
Internet Basic Aids</A></FONT>.

<LI>Internet Services - The Library has access to the Internet and the World-Wide Web available 
from public computers in the library. We also maintain selective lists of links to WWW pages
we have explored and judged useful to one or more of our various user groups. We verify these 
links periodically to be sure they are still functional. You can, of course, access any of these 
lists, but we expect you will find the <A HREF="clinks.htm">General Health Information</A>
list of most immediate interest.

<IMG SRC="../graphics/house.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM">The Health Information Collection, front right in the Library
as you enter, is open to patients, their families, and the general
community. The collection contains books, pamphlets and magazines
on health topics. These items are written for people who do not
have medical training. Topics covered include: diseases, medical
tests, drugs and medications, surgery and other treatments, mental
health, women's health and healthy lifestyles. Books from this
collection can be checked out for two weeks, pamphlets and magazines
for 1 week. You may also have short sections photocopied.<BR>
<P>

<LI>
<IMG SRC="../graphics/cds1.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM">CD-ROM Databases
- The Library has CD-ROM databases available for use covering
both highly technical and general reference areas. These are available
if you visit the Library. The Health Information
Collection includes a computer especially for use with patient
education and general health information materials. Among the CDs
available is InfoTrac's Health Reference Center with information
designed for the general public on a wide variety of conditions 
and diseases.
<P>

<LI>
<IMG SRC="../graphics/funfone.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM">If you need
information to help you understand a diagnosis or have a general
question about a disease or medication, you can call the Library
and ask for information to be found for you. Short sections will
be photocopied and mailed to your home. The Library's general
number is 612-520-5673. For immediate medical advice and/or
physician referral, The Professionals, a nurse-staffed service
of North Memorial, can be reached at 612-520-5555.

YOUR
RESPONSIBILITIES:</H4>

<OL>
<LI>Please remember our collection is relatively small and we
seldom have more than one copy of a book or journal. Return materials
promptly so they are available for others to use. The Library
does not have daily overdue fines, but you will be charged for
the replacement cost of material according to our overdue guidelines
if the material is not returned. Please note &quot;replacement
cost&quot; includes processing; it is much cheaper to buy a copy
off the retail shelf than to forget to return an item to ours.
<LI>Suggestions of needed services and materials for the collection
are always welcome.

This list is selective and limited to those sites the library
staff has actually reached.<EM> Inclusion of a source does not
imply the Library or North Memorial endorses the content of any
site, nor does exclusion imply we have examined the site and found
it misleading or useless.</EM> 
<P> 

<STRONG>Never use any information from an internet site for self-diagnosis
or to make any changes in treatment prescribed by your doctor
without consulting your own physician.</STRONG> Nothing here or
anywhere on the Internet is a substitute for consultation with
your primary care physician or other qualified healthcare professional.
If you have a medical condition, please see your doctor. If you
don't have a primary care physician, please get one! (Even if
you don't live in the North Memorial service area.) This is for
your benefit.
<P>

<STRONG>The information available on the 'Net may be useful to
give you some background and to help you determine what questions
you want to discuss with your own physician. Remember the fact
something appears on the Internet does not necessarily mean the
material is reliable.</STRONG> 
<P> 

While the lack of an explanatory note about a site means little
(except perhaps the name is self-explanatory), notes have been
added when special features have been noticed. These links are
checked periodically to verify they are still active. A failure
to connect does not necessarily mean the site is inactive. It
could be:
<UL>
<LI>the site is busy and not accepting new users at that time,
<LI>the site is temporarily down when you tried to reach it,
<LI>the site is only available to external users outside of its
normal local business hours,
<LI>a computer in the routing sequence is overloaded and refuses
to accept and pass on your request.

If you continue to have problems reaching a site, please let us
know.  . .

and <BLINK><IMG SRC="../graphics/tip.gif" ALT="[Tip Icon]" ALIGN="CENTER">
<STRONG>REMEMBER</STRONG></BLINK> if you're looking for a specific site you believe is listed 
on a page, most browsers will let you use the command EDIT/FIND or something very similar to 
search for a particular word or phrase on a hypertext page. For instance, if you're looking 
for the Virtual Hospital, rather than paging down through multiple screens, you can use 
Edit/Find to go directly to the first and each subsequent use of "virtual" on a page.

<LI><STRONG><FONT SIZE= +1>Literature Searches -</FONT></STRONG> The Staff can do research
for you on topics related to your work. We have access to over
400 databases through seven online vendors to supplement out databases
on CD-ROM. We try out best to complete a search when you need
it - whether that is one hour or one month, and to tailor the
years covered or the approximate number of items retrieved to
your specifications. Abstracts, if available, are always printed
unless you request they be deleted. Charges for online searching
are absorbed by the Library's budget; there is no charge to you
or your department.<BR>

<LI><STRONG><FONT SIZE= +1>LATCH (Literature Attached to Charts) -</FONT></STRONG> The
Staff can prepare a packet of information specific to a particular
patient case which can be attached to the patient's chart to assist
the entire patient care team with the treatment and care of the
patient. The materials may be selected by you or by the library
staff and, if you wish, the full search from which the materials
for the chart were selected can be processed for you.<BR>
<P>
<LI><STRONG><FONT SIZE= +1>Computer Update -</FONT></STRONG> Automatically every month,
we can keep you up-to-date on medical topics of continuing interest
to you. We'll run the same seach each month against one or more
databases and send the new references to you by mail or e-mail.
<P>

<LI><IMG SRC="../graphics/cds1.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"><STRONG> <FONT SIZE= +1>CD-ROM
Databases -</FONT></STRONG> The Library has CD-ROM databases available
for use by North Memorial affiliates. Subscriptions to four indexes
in regularly updated CD-ROM format enable you to search for journal
articles in medical, nursing, allied health and health care management
sources. Results of your searches can be printed or downloaded
to diskette. The Library also has begun to purchase some reference
works on CD-ROM.<BR>
<P>
<LI><STRONG><FONT SIZE= +1>Photocopying -</FONT></STRONG> You can request photocopies
of journal articles or book sections from the Library collection.
The copying is done by the Library Staff and the U.S. copyright
law requires w have a request card completed by you for each item.
Most of our copying is done between 11 a.m. and 3 p.m., and we
try to fill all requests daily. Copies can be picked up at the
wall rack just inside the entrance to the Library; we can also
send them via interdepartmental mail if you request it, or fax
them to you when the need is urgent and the volume allows. There
is no charge to you for photocopying, though library users are
expected to use moderation in the amount of copying requestedl.
Unless required for immediate patient care, we can usually not
copy more than a maximum of ten items for any user on any one
day. The Library generally will not copy anything except library
materials.<BR>

<STRONG><FONT SIZE= +1>Interlibrary Loans -</FONT></STRONG> The Library has arrangements
with other libraries locally, regionally and nationally, to obtain
items not in our collection. Because the time needed to receive
materials varies from 2 days to a week or more (depending on where
we can find it), please let us know if you have a deadline. If
items are needed for immediate patient care, we can also use fax
service to get articles usually within a couple of hours. All
costs for interlibrary loans for medical and work-related requests

costs of an interlibrary loan, including staff processing time,

RESPONSIBILITIES:</H4>
<P>
<OL>
<LI>Please remember our collection is relatively small and we
seldom have more than one copy of a book or journal. Return materials
promptly so they are available for others to use. The Library
does not have daily overdue fines, but you will be charged for
the replacement cost of material according to our overdue guidelines
if the material is not returned. Please note &quot;replacement
cost&quot; includes processing; it is much cheaper to buy a copy
off the retail shelf than to forget to return an item to ours.
<LI>Help us to help you by filling out our request forms, pulling
materials from the shelf when you are in the Library, and allowing
enough time for us to get your project done whenever possible.
We'll try to be flexible to your individual needs, but we also
have the needs of all our other users to meet.
<LI>Suggestions of new materials for the collection are always
welcome.

This list is selective and limited to those sites the library
staff has actually reached. <EM>Inclusion of a source does not
imply the Library or North Memorial endorses the content of any
site, nor does exclusion imply we have examined the site and found
it misleading or useless.</EM> While the lack of an explanatory
note about a site means little (except perhaps the name is self-explanatory),
notes have been added when special features have been noticed.
These links are checked periodically to verify they are still
active. A failure to connect does not necessarily mean the site
is inactive. It could be:
<UL>
<LI>the site is busy and not accepting new users at that time,
<LI>the site is temporarily down when you tried to reach it,
<LI>the site is only available to external users outside of its
normal local business hours,
<LI>a computer in the routing sequence is overloaded and refuses
to accept and pass on your request.

For instance, if you're looking for the Virtual Hospital, rather than paging down through multiple screens, you can use Edit/Find to go directly to the first and each subsequent use of "virtual" on a page.

ChronicIllnet</A>
<BR>
<DD>For those interested in breaking news on chronic illness research
[and perhaps when patients come up with some of those odd questions], 
ChronicIllnet has dedicated a full-time reporter and a series of guest 
reporters to cover new therapeutics, diagnostics and research studies in 
addition to writing profiles and interesting pieces on specific lines of 
scientific inquiry. ChronicIllnet's "Online News" mission is to cover promising 
scientific developments not always reported by mainstream media and 
in many cases, to challenge conventional scientific thinking.  For 
example, one recent article examines a new finding overlooked by much 
of the media -- the link between AZT and birth defects.  TJ Moriarty, 
a reporter who has filed stories for CNN and San Francisco's KGO-TV, 
is the first reporter for ChronicIllnet, which was designated a cool 
site by Yahoo and one of the top medical sites by Discover.

<DD>SCP Communications, Inc.
<BR>
<DD>A Web site for health professionals and interested consumers.
Access is free, but you must first register as
a user. Practice-oriented information is peer-reviewed and edited
by thought-leaders in AIDS, infectious diseases, urology, and
surgery. Within each specialty is a short list of Highly-structured
articles and full-color graphics, updated frequently. Feature
articles include links to encapsulated results of a topic search
from the National Library of Medicine, and hot-links to related
articles on Medscape and elsewhere on the World Wide Web. Following
the list of feature articles is a longer list of current articles
and departments with the date of posting on Medscape. Other specialties
are being added. 
<BR>
Medscape members can now obtain continuing medical education credit online by reading 
and completing a post test/evaluation form on Medscape articles marked with the red CME 
badge. The program is sponsored by the Thomas R. Beam, Jr., Memorial Institute for 
Continuing Medical Education. Registered users may also receive a weekly list of the 
surprisingly substantive additions to this site. This has become one of the premier

PhD (Massachusetts General Hospital) and is published by OutlineMed Inc. in Boston, Massachusetts,

created in an attempt to incorporate large amounts of rapidly changing medical information into 
succinct, comprehensive, topic summaries. The search format and references are provided with the 
awareness most students and clinicians no longer have time to read the excellent review articles 
and primary studies in medicine. Each topic card is directed to allowing a clinician to care with 
a patient with a specific disease or symptom. In addition, over 250 Internal Medicine Board's-type 
review questions (linked to appropriate text) have been added to aide in reviewing topics and in 
preparation for licensing examinations. The host, Avicenna, requires registration, but registration 
is free (and recommended - a usesful and well-designed site).

This list is selective and limited to those sites the library
staff has actually reached. <EM>Inclusion of a source does not
imply the Library or North Memorial endorses the content of any
site, nor does exclusion imply we have examined the site and found
it misleading or useless.</EM> While the lack of an explanatory
note about a site means little (except perhaps the name is self-explanatory),
notes have been added when special features have been noticed.
These links are checked periodically to verify they are still
active. A failure to connect does not necessarily mean the site
is inactive. It could be:
<UL>
<LI>the site is busy and not accepting new users at that time,
<LI>the site is temporarily down when you tried to reach it,
<LI>the site is only available to external users outside of its
normal local business hours,
<LI>a computer in the routing sequence is overloaded and refuses
to accept and pass on your request.

1996 and thereafter they will be regularly updated. The external review mechanism will be

intera ctive, true European "state of the art" reference source on oncology treatment by the

considered preliminary.&QUOT; However, through the beginning of December 1996, only this one

<UL>
<LI><STRONG>Internet Services -</STRONG> The Library provides
access to the Internet and the World-Wide Web from public computers
in the library. We also maintain selective lists of links to WWW
pages we have explored and judged useful to one or more of our
various user groups. We try to verify these links at least once
a month to be sure they are still functional. You can, of course,
access any of these lists, but we expect you will find the <A HREF="nlinks.htm">Nursing &amp; Allied Health WWW Sites</A>
list of most immediate interest. Other lists are:<BR>
<BR>
<A HREF="../medstaff/mlinks.htm"><IMG SRC="../graphics/starmed2.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM" ALT="[Icon]">Medical Sites</A>
<A HREF="../employee/elinks.htm"><IMG SRC="../graphics/staremp2.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM">Non-Medical Employee Sites</A>
<A HREF="../consumer/clinks.htm"><IMG SRC="../graphics/starcon2.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM" ALT="[Icon]">General Health Information</A>
<BR>
<BR>

<LI><STRONG>Literature Searches -</STRONG> The Staff can do research
for you on topics related to your work. We have access to over
400 databases through seven online vendors to supplement out databases
on CD-ROM. We try out best to complete a search when you need
it - whether that is one hour or one month, and to tailor the
years covered or the approximate number of items retrieved to
your specifications. Abstracts, if available, are always printed
unless you request they be deleted. Charges for online searching
are absorbed by the Library's budget; there is no charge to you
or your department.<BR>
<P> 

<LI><STRONG>LATCH (Literature Attached to Charts) -</STRONG> The
Staff can prepare a packet of information specific to a particular
patient case which can be attached to the patient's chart to assist
the entire patient care team with the treatment and care of the
patient. The materials may be selected by you or by the library
staff and, if you wish, the full search from which the materials
for the chart were selected can be processed for you.<BR>
<P> 

<LI><STRONG>Computer Update -</STRONG> Automatically every month,
we can keep you up-to-date on medical topics of continuing interest
to you. We'll run the same seach each month against one or more
databases and send the new references to you by mail or e-mail. <BR>
<P> 

<LI><IMG SRC="../graphics/cds1.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"> <STRONG>CD-ROM
Databases -</STRONG> The Library has CD-ROM databases available
for use by North Memorial affiliates. Subscriptions to four indexes
in regularly updated CD-ROM format enable you to search for journal
articles in medical, nursing, allied health and health care management
sources. Results of your searches can be printed or downloaded
to diskette. The Library also has begun to purchase some reference
works on CD-ROM.<BR>
<P> 

<LI><STRONG>Photocopying -</STRONG> You can request photocopies
of journal articles or book sections from the Library collection.
The copying is done by the Library Staff and the U.S. copyright
law requires we have a request card completed by you for each
item. Most of our copying is done between 11 a.m. and 3 p.m.,
and we try to fill all requests daily. Copies can be picked up
at the wall rack just inside the entrance to the Library; we can
also send them via interdepartmental mail if you request it, or
fax them to you when the need is urgent and the volume allows.
There is no charge to you for photocopying, though library users
are expected to use moderation in the amount of copying requestedl.
Unless required for immediate patient care, we can usually not
copy more than a maximum of ten items for any user on any one
day. The Library generally will not copy anything except library
materials.<BR>
<P> 

<LI><STRONG>Interlibrary Loans -</STRONG> The Library has arrangements
with other libraries locally, regionally and nationally, to obtain
items not in our collection. Because the time needed to receive
materials varies from 2 days to a week or more (depending on where
we can find it), please let us know if you have a deadline. If
items are needed for immediate patient care, we can also use fax
service to get articles usually within a couple of hours. All
costs for interlibrary loans for medical and work-related requests
are covered by the Library; we do ask you to remember the minimal
costs of an interlibrary loan, including staff processing time,
are about $8.00 per item and moderation is requested.<BR>
<P> 

<LI><IMG SRC="../graphics/assistrn.gif" ALT="[Decorative graphic]" ALIGN="BOTTOM"><STRONG>Reference
Assistance -</STRONG> The Staff can assist you in the use of CD-ROMs,
catalogs, indexes, reference books and other materials in our
collection including the media of the Learning Resource Center.
You can also call or use e-mail to request any of our services
by mail, e-mail or fax as the situation requires. Please do not
hesitate to ask for assistance.<BR>
<P> 

<LI><STRONG>Health Information for Patients -</STRONG> You can
refer patients and their families to the Library to use the Health
Information Collection or North Women's Center resources. If you
or they call ahead, we can gather materials for them. We can also
deliver information to patients rooms or mail photocopies to them
at home.<BR>

RESPONSIBILITIES:<BR>
</H4>

<OL>
<LI>Please remember our collection is relatively small and we
seldom have more than one copy of a book or journal. Return materials
promptly so they are available for others to use. The Library
does not have daily overdue fines, but you will be charged for
the replacement cost of material according to our overdue guidelines
if the material is not returned. Please note &quot;replacement
cost&quot; includes processing; it is much cheaper to buy a copy
off the retail shelf than to forget to return an item to ours.
<LI>Help us to help you by filling out our request forms, pulling
materials from the shelf when you are in the Library, and allowing
enough time for us to get your project done whenever possible.
We'll try to be flexible to your individual needs, but we also
have the needs of all our other users to meet.
<LI>Suggestions of new materials for the collection are always
welcome.<BR>

This list is selective and limited to those sites the library
staff has actually reached. <EM>Inclusion of a source does not
imply the Library or North Memorial endorses the content of any
site, nor does exclusion imply we have examined the site and found
it misleading or useless.</EM> While the lack of an explanatory
note about a site means little (except perhaps the name is self-explanatory),
notes have been added when special features have been noticed.
These links are checked periodically to verify they are still
active. A failure to connect does not necessarily mean the site
is inactive. It could be:
<UL>
<LI>the site is busy and not accepting new users at that time,
<LI>the site is temporarily down when you tried to reach it,
<LI>the site is only available to external users outside of its
normal local business hours,
<LI>a computer in the routing sequence is overloaded and refuses
to accept and pass on your request.
</UL>

<P>
If you continue to have problems reaching a site, please let us
know. . .
<BR>
<P>
and <BLINK><STRONG>REMEMBER</STRONG></BLINK> if you're looking for a specific site you 
believe is listed on a page, most browsers will let you use the command EDIT/FIND or something 
very similar to search for a particular word or phrase on a hypertext page. For instance, 
if you're looking for the Virtual Hospital, rather than paging down through multiple screens, 
you can use Edit/Find to go directly to the first and each subsequent use of "virtual" on a 
page.

This list is selective and limited to those sites the library
staff has actually reached. <EM>Inclusion of a source does not
imply the Library or North Memorial endorses the content of any
site, nor does exclusion imply we have examined the site and found
it misleading or useless.</EM> While the lack of an explanatory
note about a site means little (except perhaps the name is self-explanatory),
notes have been added when special features have been noticed.
These links are checked periodically to verify they are still
active. A failure to connect does not necessarily mean the site
is inactive. It could be:
<UL>
<LI>the site is busy and not accepting new users at that time,
<LI>the site is temporarily down when you tried to reach it,
<LI>the site is only available to external users outside of its
normal local business hours,
<LI>a computer in the routing sequence is overloaded and refuses
to accept and pass on your request.
</UL>

<P>
If you continue to have problems reaching a site, please let us
know. . .
<BR>
<P>
and <BLINK><STRONG>REMEMBER</STRONG></BLINK> if you're looking for a specific site you believe is listed on a page, most browsers will let you use the command EDIT/FIND or something very similar to search for a particular word or phrase on a hypertext page. For instance, if you're looking for the Virtual Hospital, rather than paging down through multiple screens, you can use Edit/Find to go directly to the first and each subsequent use of "virtual" on a page.

This list is selective and limited to those sites the library
staff has actually reached. <EM>Inclusion of a source does not
imply the Library or North Memorial endorses the content of any
site, nor does exclusion imply we have examined the site and found
it misleading or useless.</EM> While the lack of an explanatory
note about a site means little (except perhaps the name is self-explanatory),
notes have been added when special features have been noticed.
These links are checked periodically to verify they are still
active. A failure to connect does not necessarily mean the site
is inactive. It could be:
<UL>
<LI>the site is busy and not accepting new users at that time,
<LI>the site is temporarily down when you tried to reach it,
<LI>the site is only available to external users outside of its
normal local business hours,
<LI>a computer in the routing sequence is overloaded and refuses
to accept and pass on your request.
</UL>

<P>
If you continue to have problems reaching a site, please let us
know. . .
<BR>
<P>
and <BLINK><STRONG>REMEMBER</STRONG></BLINK> if you're looking for a specific site you 
believe is listed on a page, most browsers will let you use the command EDIT/FIND or something 
very similar to search for a particular word or phrase on a hypertext page. For instance, 
if you're looking for the Virtual Hospital, rather than paging down through multiple screens, 
you can use Edit/Find to go directly to the first and each subsequent use of "virtual" on a 
page.

<LI><STRONG>Internet Services -</STRONG> The Library provides
access to the Internet and the World-Wide Web from public computers
in the library. We also maintain selective lists of links to WWW
pages we have explored and judged useful to one or more of our
various user groups. We verify these links periodically
to be sure they are still functional. You can, of course,
access any of these lists, but we expect you will find the <A HREF="elinks.htm">Non-Medical Employee Sites</A>
list of most immediate interest. Other lists are:<BR>

<UL>
<LI><STRONG>Literature Searches -</STRONG> The Staff can do research
for you on topics related to your work. We have access to over
400 databases through seven online vendors to supplement out databases
on CD-ROM and the Internet. We try out best to complete a search when you 
need it - whether that is one hour or one month, and to tailor the
years covered or the approximate number of items retrieved to
your specifications. Abstracts, if available, are always printed
unless you request they be deleted. Charges for online searching
are absorbed by the Library's budget; there is no charge to you
or your department.<BR>
<P> 

<LI><STRONG>Computer Update -</STRONG> Automatically every month,
we can keep you up-to-date on work-related topics of continuing
interest to you. We'll run the same seach each month against one
or more databases and send the new references to you by mail or
e-mail.<BR>
<P> 

<LI><IMG SRC="../graphics/cds1.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"> <STRONG>CD-ROM
Databases -</STRONG> The Library has CD-ROM databases available
for use by North Memorial affiliates. Subscriptions to indexes
in regularly updated CD-ROM format enable you to search for journal
articles in medical, nursing, allied health and health care management
sources. The library also now has the three basic indexes available on
four public computers in the library using WinSpirs, which utilizes an
Internet connection. Results of your searches can be printed or downloaded
to diskette. The Library also has begun to purchase some reference
works on CD-ROM.<BR>
<P> 

<LI><STRONG>Photocopying -</STRONG> You can request photocopies
of journal articles or book sections from the Library collection.
The copying is done by the Library Staff and the U.S. copyright
law requires we have a request card completed by you for each
item. Most of our copying is done between 11 a.m. and 3 p.m.,
and we try to fill all requests daily. Copies can be picked up
at the wall rack just inside the entrance to the Library; we can
also send them via interdepartmental mail if you request it, or
fax them to you when the need is urgent and the volume allows.
There is no charge to you for photocopying, though library users
are expected to use moderation in the amount of copying requestedl.
Unless required for immediate patient care, we can usually not
copy more than a maximum of ten items for any user on any one
day. The Library generally will not copy anything except library
materials.<BR>
<P> 

<LI><STRONG>Interlibrary Loans - </STRONG>The Library has arrangements
with other libraries locally, regionally and nationally, to obtain
items not in our collection you need for work. Because the time
needed to receive materials varies from 2 days to a week or more
(depending on where we can find it), please let us know if you
have a deadline. If items are needed for immediate patient care,
we can also use fax service to get articles usually within a couple
of hours. All costs for interlibrary loans for medical and work-related
requests are covered by the Library; we do ask you to remember
the minimal costs of an interlibrary loan, including staff processing
time, are about $8.00 per item and moderation is requested.<BR>
<P> 

<LI><IMG SRC="../graphics/assistem.gif" ALT="[Decorative Graphic]" ALIGN="BOTTOM"><STRONG>Reference
Assistance -</STRONG> The Staff can assist you in the use of CD-ROMs,
catalogs, indexes, reference books and other materials in our
collection including the media of the Learning Resource Center
and the Internet which is available from five public computers in
the library. You can also call or use e-mail to request any of our services
by mail, e-mail or fax as the situation requires. Please do not
hesitate to ask for assistance.<BR>

RESPONSIBILITIES:</H4>

<OL>
<LI>Please remember our collection is relatively small and we
seldom have more than one copy of a book or journal. Return materials
promptly so they are available for others to use. The Library
does not have daily overdue fines, but you will be charged for
the replacement cost of material according to our overdue guidelines
if the material is not returned. Please note &quot;replacement
cost&quot; includes processing; it is much cheaper to buy a copy
off the retail shelf than to forget to return an item to ours.
<LI>Help us to help you by filling out our request forms, pulling
materials from the shelf when you are in the Library, and allowing
enough time for us to get your project done whenever possible.
We'll try to be flexible to your individual needs, but we also
have the needs of all our other users to meet.
<LI>Suggestions of new materials for the collection are always
welcome.<BR>

<P>
This list is selective and limited to those sites the library
staff has actually reached. <EM>Inclusion of a source does not
imply the Library or North Memorial endorses the content of any
site, nor does exclusion imply we have examined the site and found
it misleading or useless.</EM> While the lack of an explanatory
note about a site means little (except perhaps the name is self-explanatory),
notes have been added when special features have been noticed.
These links are checked periodically to verify they are still
active. A failure to connect does not necessarily mean the site
is inactive. It could be:
<UL>
<LI>the site is busy and not accepting new users at that time,
<LI>the site is temporarily down when you tried to reach it,
<LI>the site is only available to external users outside of its
normal local business hours,
<LI>a computer in the routing sequence is overloaded and refuses
to accept and pass on your request.
</UL>
<BR>
<P>
If you continue to have problems reaching a site, please let us
know. . . 
<BR>
<P>
and <BLINK><STRONG>REMEMBER</STRONG></BLINK> if you're looking for a specific site you believe is listed on a page, most browsers will let you use the command EDIT/FIND or something very similar to search for a particular word or phrase on a hypertext page. For instance, if you're looking for the Virtual Hospital, rather than paging down through multiple screens, you can use Edit/Find to go directly to the first and each subsequent use of "virtual" on a page.

The Online Journal of Ethics </A>
<BR>
Explores both theoretical and applied ethical issues involved in the 
practice of business and the professions. We welcome submissions on 
theoretical topics such as the character and extent of social 
responsibility of business and the professions, the nature of the 
professions, and the relation between business/professional ethics and 
other ethics (Kantian, virtue, utilitarian, etc.).  The journal will 
also publish papers that address pressing ethical issues in a more 
topical fashion.  Such topics would include, e.g., the ethics of 
diversity training programs, downsizing initiatives, various 
pre-employment screening methods, empowerment, total quality 
management, different technologies used by corporations, and 
leadership, among other ideas. 
<BR>
The journal is an interactive mechanism which allows readers to submit 
comments relating to the issues presented in a particular article to 
the editorial staff using a submission form at the beginning of the 
article. Editorial staff will post comments back to the web site so 
that they may be read by other visitors to the site.  The journal will 
publish two issues per year, with periodic updates to the site.
