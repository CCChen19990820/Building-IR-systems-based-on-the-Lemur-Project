SHOWS PLYMOUTH'S NEW WAY OF DOING BUSINESS</B></PRTitle><BR>

  <B> </B><P align ="left"><B><BR>
       Highland Park, Mich. -- </B> In an effort to make car shopping easier, <BR>
Plymouth Division of Chrysler Corporation introduced today an interactive shopping experience known as &quot;Plymouth Place.&quot;  The in-mall shopping store will feature the full line of Plymouth vehicles, as well as interactive shopping computers and a staff of customer assistance advisors to answer product questions.  Plymouth Place began operation today at Clackamas Mall and will be featured in several Portland area malls in 1995.<BR>
	Plymouth Place was developed to raise awareness of the Plymouth brand with under-40 target buyers seeking an alternative to conventional automotive shopping.  Plymouth Place will be an ideal first step in the car buying experience - the &quot;just looking&quot; phase - when consumers are just beginning to shop.  There will be no salespeople on site, but rather product advisors who will be able to answer questions and, if the customer is interested, refer them to a Chrysler-Plymouth dealer in the area. <BR>
	&quot;Plymouth Place is targeted directly at the prospective Plymouth buyer, &quot; said Plymouth National Marketing Plans Manager Steve Bruyn. &quot;Our customers are value-minded individuals who are looking to gather as much information as possible before buying a car or minivan.&quot;<BR>
(03295)	-more-<BR>

<P>-2-<BR>

<P>	A main feature of Plymouth Place is the interactive kiosk known as the Tech Cart.  The futuristic looking computer cart is designed to give consumers the opportunity to shop for a Plymouth vehicle using interactive technology. The cart features two touch-activated computer terminals that allow the user to select vehicle options, check pricing and see running footage of the Plymouth Neon and Voyager.  In addition, the user can get a printout of their chosen car or minivan to take to a dealership when ordering the vehicle.  <BR>
	The Plymouth brand has been undergoing a complete revitalization over the past year, with the idea of building a brand that delivers expressively designed value-priced cars and minivans to the entry level market.  Plymouth already has two product hits in its stable, with the Voyager minivan and the Neon sub-compact car.  Over the next several months, Plymouth will introduce a completely re-designed Voyager, as well as Breeze, a four-door compact sedan, built off the same product platform as the Chrysler Cirrus and Dodge Stratus.<BR>
	&quot;What you see here at Plymouth Place is the future of car shopping, as well as a glimpse at the future of Plymouth,&quot; Bruyn said.  &quot;Many of our buyers have grown up with computers, shopped at home for products and relied on various forms of technology for information.  This provides them an environment free of distractions to get the information they need.&quot;<BR>

<P><center><PRTitle><B>EAGLE PERSONALITY SHINES THROUGH IN <BR>
SPORTY, INNOVATIVE, UPSCALE VEHICLES</B></PRTitle><BR>
<B> </B> </center><BR>
  <B> </B><P align ="left"><B><BR>
       Highland Park, Mich. -- </B>In a relatively short span of time, the Eagle Division of Chrysler Corporation has developed an image for vehicles that are upscale, creatively designed, and teeming with confidence-inspiring performance features -- an image that personifies the typical Eagle owner.  That trend continues for 1995, with the all-new Eagle Talon and the refined versions of the Eagle Vision, the Eagle Summit Wagon, Summit Coupe and Sedan.<BR>
	Each vehicle offers a sense of uniqueness to the independent-minded buyers it is targeting.  All new for 1995 is the Eagle Talon, which provides increased enjoyment to driving enthusiasts.  Few cars can match the overall combination of performance, handling, style and value that characterizes the new Talon -- in short, it's pure driving fun!<BR>
	The Talon is available in three performance levels -- ESi, TSi and the top-of-the-line TSi AWD (all-wheel drive).<BR>

<P>
<P>(36994)	(more)<BR>

<P>- 2 -<BR>
	The exhilarating power of the TSi and TSi AWD continues as the Talon signature.  A new 210 horsepower -- up from 195 horsepower previously -- 2.0-liter, 16-valve, DOHC turbocharged four cylinder engine powers both TSi models.  A Chrysler designed, developed and produced 140 horsepower 2.0-liter DOHC engine powers the ESi model.  Both are mated to a five-speed manual transaxle or an available four-speed automatic.  <BR>
	Standard front driver and passenger air bags are included in a totally redesigned interior anchored by a new instrument panel that flows uninterrupted into the doors.  Attention was given to design a more ergonomic and comfortable driving position.<BR>
	TSi standard features include adjustable headrests, cassette radio with six speakers, leather steering wheel and manual transmission shift knob, driver's seat power/memory height and recline adjuster, plus a passenger seat power/memory system for fore and aft adjustments.<BR>
	The Eagle Vision has something competing midsize sedans can't offer -- Chrysler's innovative cab-forward architecture.  This design not only affords increased interior room, it helps provide stable handling and a more agile ride.  And it gives the Vision a striking appearance, aggressive yet graceful, with aerodynamic curves.<BR>
	Vision is powered by two impressive powerplants, including a sophisticated 3.5-liter, 214 horsepower V6 that is standard on the sportier TSi model.  The 3.3-liter 161 horsepower is standard on ESi.  Both engines are mated to an advanced four-speed automatic transmission, which delivers precise shifting and maneuverability.<BR>

<P>- 3 -<BR>
	Safety also plays an important part in the Eagle Vision package.  Features include standard height-adjustable front shoulder belts, available anti-lock brakes, a remote keyless entry system (standard on TSi) and the rear integrated child safety seat.<BR>
	A dual front air bag passive restraint system, door beams and structural reinforcements give added protection in side impact collisions.  These structural reinforcements already meet federal government standards for 1997.<BR>
	Car buyers seeking a subcompact that combines good looks, dependability and safety features in an economical package need look no further than the 1995 Eagle Summit Coupe and Summit Sedan.<BR>
	The two door coupe appeals to buyers seeking driving fun and fuel efficiency in a more upscale package -- without the upscale price tag.  The four door Summit Sedan, whose design is exclusive to the Eagle brand in North America, is intended for those who seek sophistication, room and comfort without leaving the subcompact market.<BR>
	A 1.5-liter, 12-valve sequential multi-port fuel-injected engine is standard on all Summit Coupe packages, producing a healthy 92 horsepower.  A 1.8-liter, 16-valve engine is standard on all sedans and optional on the ESi coupe, delivering 113 horsepower.<BR>
	Safety comes to the forefront in the Eagle Summit Coupe and Sedan with standard  front driver and passenger air bags and optional anti-lock brakes on ESi sedans.  On the Summit Sedan, child-protection locks are standard equipment.   And both vehicles feature side door beams and &quot;crush zones&quot; in front and back, which absorb energy in an impact.<BR>

<P>- 4 -<BR>
	Adding an additional touch of flair to the Eagle brand's personality is the 1995 Eagle Summit Wagon, which offers the roominess of a five-passenger sedan, the flexibility of a minivan and the car-like ride and handling of a coupe to adapt to a wide variety of lifestyles.<BR>
	The Summit Wagon is available in three models -- DL, LX and AWD (all-wheel-drive).  The DL is powered by a 1.8-liter, 16-valve, multi-port fuel-injected engine that produces 113 horsepower.   Standard on LX and AWD models (and optional on the DL) is a 2.4-liter SOHC engine that delivers 136 horsepower.  A five-speed manual transmission is standard on all models, and a four-speed automatic transmission is optional.<BR>
	Safety plays an important role on the Eagle Summit Wagon.  The vehicle features dual air bags, child-protection door locks, an optional remote keyless entry system and available anti-lock brakes.  A commanding view of the road, plus an independent rear suspension and standard power steering work together to create a secure driving environment.<BR>

       Highland Park, Mich. -- </B>Sales of Chrysler Corporation vehicles outside of North America rose for the 17th consecutive month on a year-over-year basis in January.

CHRYSLER-PLYMOUTH TO SUPPORT MUSIC HALL <BR>

  <B> </B><P align ="left"><B><BR>
       Highland Park, Mich. -- </B>In an effort to help introduce a new generation of young Detroiters to the city's historic Music Hall, Chrysler-Plymouth will present the inaugural &quot;Plymouth Neon Jammin' Ball '95,&quot; on April 8, 1995 at 8 p.m.  The event will feature live music from Ortheia Barnes, Chrysler's own CTC Drive, the Trinidad Tripoli Steel Band, David Myles and the Mylestones, the Alma Smith Quintet, as well as dancing, food and other entertainment.  <BR>
	&quot;Music Hall has played a major part in Detroit's performing arts history, but many young people have never been exposed to the beauty and tradition of the theater,&quot; said Chrysler-Plymouth General Manager Steve Torok.  &quot;We believe that by supporting Jammin' Ball at Music Hall, we're opening its doors to the next generation of theater goers.&quot;<BR>
	The Jammin' Ball is the first event developed by Associate Producers <BR>
(co-chaired by Dennis Archer, Jr., Mike Carlo Catenacci and Ross H. Partrich), a newly-formed group of metropolitan Detroiters, ages 18-40, who, for an annual donation of $150, support the preservation, general operations and programming of the 68-year old Music Hall, the only not-for-profit theater in Detroit's theater district. <BR>
(11295)	- more -<BR>
	- 2 -<BR>
	Tickets for the event are $35 and are available through the Music Hall box office at (313) 963-2366, all Ticketmaster outlets or by phone at (810) 645-6666<BR>

  <B> </B><P align ="left"><B><BR>
       Highland Park, Mich. -- </B> February was unseasonably warm for Chrysler. &quot;Sales of Jeep Grand Cherokees and Dodge Rams are so hot you could fry eggs on them, but with Minivans you get bacon!&quot; Theodor R. Cunningham, Executive Vice President - Sales and Marketing and General Manager - Minivan Operations, exclaims. &quot;Our National Minivan Sale has clearly been a big hit, but sales in general continue to climb, with no less than 25 best-February-ever records shared by all three of our divisions.  Even more encouraging, dealer support for the new Plymouth and Dodge Neon is overwhelming, with more than 100,000 orders received,&quot; he said.<BR>
	Chrysler minivans set both total and individual February sales performance records.  Combined sales of 46,314 were 38 percent ahead of last year.  Dodge Caravan finished 33 percent ahead of last year with a new February mark of 23,982; Plymouth Voyager jumped 38 percent on record February sales of 19,411; and Chrysler Town &amp; Country rose 101 percent with a new February record of 2,921 units.<BR>
	Overall, Chrysler posted its best February car and truck sales performance -- both total and retail -- in six years.  Total vehicle sales of 176,550 were the highest since June 1993 and represented a 23 percent increase over last February.<BR>
<B>(10394)</B>	<B>-more-</B><BR>

<P>- 2 - <BR>

<P>	Chrysler car sales were the best in four years for February, totaling 64,644 for a seven percent increase over last year.  Dodge Intrepid had its best month ever with 10,034 units sold, while Dodge Shadow and Plymouth Sundance combined for their sixth consecutive monthly record with sales of 18,553.<BR>
	Total truck sales rose 35 percent in February to 111,906 -- a record for the month in both total and retail sales.  Dodge Ram topped February 1993 by 112 percent with sales of 15,971, and in the process broke a Ram sales record set in 1977.  Jeep Grand Cherokee and Jeep Wrangler both set new February records with sales of 19,079 and 5,503, respectively.<BR>

1993 ANNUAL REPORT</B></PRTitle><BR>
<B> </B> </center><BR>
  <B> </B><P align ="left"><B><BR>
       Highland Park, Mich. -- </B>Chrysler recently recycled 40,000 pounds of its own paper waste, converting the recycled material for use in printing the text pages of its recently completed 1993 Report to Shareholders.<BR>
	How much paper does 40,000 pounds represent?  Try 20 tons.  Or if all the paper that Chrysler recycled for its annual report were 8-1/2 x 11 inch sheets laid end to end, they would stretch from Washington D.C. to Boston -- or 450 miles.  <BR>
	The office paper recycling program is part of Chrysler's Waste Minimization Program launched in 1985 and an extension of the Corporation's commitment to the environment.  <BR>
	The 56-page text portion of the annual report is composed of 50% recycled paper -- 10% post-consumer waste from Chrysler and 40% pre-consumer waste from the mill.  The cover also used recycled paper, although the paper was not obtained from Chrysler's paper recycling program.  <BR>
	The annual report is being distributed to more than 350,000 shareholders, financial institutions, dealers and government officials.  <BR>
	[NOTE:  Media may pickup copies of the 1993 Report to Shareholders from the lobby of the K.T. Keller Building at Chrysler Center in Highland Park, Mich., on March 22 or 23 between 8:30 a.m. and 4:30 p.m.]<BR>

       Highland Park, Mich. -- </B><B>- </B>Chrysler Corporation set a new record for the model year at the end of September with total vehicle sales of 2,186,126 -- breaking the 1988 model year mark of 2,184,152.  Individually, all-time model year records were set by Chrysler trucks (1,362,546), by minivans (524,419), and by all Jeep&reg; models (430,562 combined). <BR>
	&quot;Great product acceptance and inspired dealers add up to record-breaking numbers,&quot; Theodor R. Cunningham, Executive Vice President - Sales and Marketing and General Manager - Minivan Operations, said.  &quot;And behind the big numbers is an even better story for Chrysler -- an all-time model year record for retail sales and best-ever retail records in two divisions and in six separate product lines.&quot;<BR>
	Sales performance for the month of September -- both total and retail -- was the best in eight years at Chrysler.  Total vehicle sales of 168,074 were up two percent from last year, thanks to record sales of trucks and of Chrysler's LH family of sedans.<BR>

<P><B>(42394)	-more-</B><BR>
	- 2 -<BR>
	Despite record September performances by Chrysler New Yorker and LHS, Dodge Intrepid, and Eagle Vision, total car sales slipped 17 percent from September 1993 to 61,883 -- due in part to product availability and discontinued models.  Chrysler sold 18,045 Neons in September.<BR>
	Chrysler truck sales totaled 106,191 -- 17 percent above last year -- posting the best September ever in both total and retail categories.  It was the eighth consecutive monthly record for truck sales and the 38th consecutive monthly increase.  Spurred by Dodge Ram, total Dodge Truck sales also set a new September record of 54,118 units -- a 45 percent increase.  By itself, Dodge Ram set its 10th consecutive monthly record on sales of 20,287, besting 1977's 16,051.  Chrysler Town &amp; Country and Jeep&reg; Wrangler also scored new September sales records.<BR>

<P><center><PRTitle><B>CHRYSLER BOARD OF DIRECTORS OUTLINES<BR>
ACTIONS BENEFITTING SHAREHOLDERS</B></PRTitle><BR>
<B> </B> </center><BR>
  <B> </B><P align ="left"><B><BR>
       Highland Park, Mich. -- </B>Chrysler Corporation announced today that it expects to achieve its primary financial targets by the end of this year of $7.5 billion in cash and a fully-funded pension plan, and is on track to achieving an improved credit rating.<BR>
	After a review of the Company's performance against these objectives and the financial resources required to support the Company's Business Plans, the following actions were approved by the Chrysler Board of Directors:<BR>
	 An increase in its projected five-year program spending from the current level of $20.8 billion to $22.9 billion<BR>
	 An increase in the common stock dividend from the current annual level of $1.00 per share to $1.60 per share (or $0.40 per quarter), a 60 percent increase<BR>
	 A $1 billion share repurchase program commencing in the first quarter of 1995 subject to market conditions<BR>
	&quot;The Board's view is that the Company should continue on its current path with the objectives of maintaining cash reserves adequate to fund its business going forward, regardless of business cycles, maintain fully-funded pension plans and continue to reduce overall financial leverage,&quot; Chrysler Chairman and CEO Robert J. Eaton said.<BR>
(51094)	(more)<BR>
	-2-<BR>
	<BR>
	The increased quarterly dividend of $0.25 to $0.40 per share on the Company's common stock is payable January 13, 1995, to shareholders of record on December 15, 1994.<BR>
	&quot;We fully expect that this dividend level is sustainable over the course of the business cycle,&quot; Eaton said.<BR>
	The Board also declared a dividend of $1.15625 per depositary share, each representing 1/10 of a share of the Company's Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, payable January 13, 1995, to shareholders of record on December 15, 1994.<BR>
	Prior to today's announcement, a quarterly dividend increase from $0.15 to $0.20 was announced on December 2, 1993.  A second increase -- from $0.20 to $0.25 -- was announced on May 19.  In total, the dividend has been increased 167 percent since December 1993.  The Board is not likely to review the dividend level again until late 1995.<BR>
	The $1 billion share repurchase program is expected to begin in the first quarter of 1995 depending on market conditions.  In addition, the Board will consider further actions to enhance shareholder value in the future, depending on the Company's financial situation and the market outlook at that time.<BR>
	&quot;This share repurchase program is a reflection of our confidence in the long term growth of our business,&quot; Eaton said.  &quot;We remain committed to enhancing shareholder value and this is a very effective method for doing so.&quot;<BR>
	<BR>
(more)<BR>

<P>-3-<BR>
	Eaton concluded:  &quot;The capital spending increase, the dividend increase and share repurchase have been under consideration by the Board for some time.  The Company's success in 1994 and the Board's view of its future prospects now indicate the time is right to take such actions.<BR>
	&quot;The outlook for continued market strength remains robust for 1995 and beyond.  The increase in our program spending to nearly $23 billion will give us additional growth opportunities through the development of more new and<BR>
innovative products as well as anticipated international actions.  We are confident that our plan is the correct one and that our financial position will continue to strengthen.&quot;<BR>
	The Board also amended the Company's shareholder rights plan by increasing from 10 percent to 15 percent the threshold of stock ownership that triggers other holders' rights to acquire Chrysler common stock at a reduced price.  The Company's action was responsive to its largest shareholder's stated interest in significantly increasing his holdings from his current level of approximately 9.2 percent.  The Company continues to believe that the<BR>
shareholder rights plan provides important protection for all shareholders.<BR>
	Other amendments to the shareholder rights plan provide that the rights may not be redeemed once the threshold is exceeded, but someone who inadvertently crosses the threshold and promptly sells down below the threshold would not trigger the rights.  The amendments clarify that rights can be redeemed by directors who are elected before the 15 percent threshold is reached.<BR>

<P><center><PRTitle><B>CHRYSLER HOLDS 1996 PRICING<BR>
TO 1.4 PERCENT OVERALL</B></PRTitle><BR>
<B> </B> </center><BR>
  <B> </B><P align ="left"><B><BR>
       Highland Park, Mich. -- </B>Chrysler Corporation announced today that retail prices of its 1996 model passenger cars and trucks will increase an average 1.4 percent, or $307 over comparably equipped 1995 models.<BR>
	&quot;This action is the result of a year-long team effort -- both within Chrysler and between the company and its suppliers and dealers -- to hold as close to the line as possible on price while increasing content and value to the customer,&quot; said Theodor R. Cunningham, Executive Vice President -- Sales and Marketing and General Manager -- Minivan Operations.  &quot;In order to accomplish this, we made significant reductions in the base prices of some of our most popular models.  This is in addition to the price reductions announced earlier for our all-new Chrysler, Dodge and Plymouth minivans.<BR>
	&quot;Our average increase is well below the 3.0 percent Consumer Price Index for the ninth year in a row, and strengthens the already competitive price advantage many of our models have over both domestic and import automakers.  In fact, if you add all of Chrysler's pricing actions up for the past ten years, you'll find we're significantly below the increases of our domestic competitors, and a whopping 41 percentage points below the imports,&quot; Cunningham added.  <BR>
<B>(30195)</B>	<B>-more-</B><BR>
	<B>- 2 -	</B><BR>
	Included in the 1996 model line-up are new Dodge and Plymouth Neon coupes for under $10,000, including destination.  The new entry level model includes power steering, 14-inch wheels and tires, full wheel covers, intermittent wipers and added sound insulation.<BR>
	The base price of the Chrysler Concorde begins at $19,995 including destination, a $1,090 drop in price for 1996, versus last year's popularly equipped model.  The 1996 Concorde also includes 16-inch tires and wheels as standard equipment.   <BR>
	Dodge Intrepid will begin at $18,995, including destination -- a $237 reduction from the typically equipped 1995 model.  Additions to the entry level model include a new front fascia with fog lamps, new wheelhouse flares and sill moldings, 16-inch touring tires and wheel covers, speed control, and power deck lid release.<BR>
	The price of the Eagle Vision drops $437 for 1996, compared to the typically equipped 1995 model, including destination.  In addition, the entry level Eagle Vision now includes 16-inch polycast wheels and touring tires.<BR>
	One product that did go up in price is the 1996 Jeep&reg; Grand Cherokee -- new from the inside out, with an all-new interior, a new exterior look, and dual airbags.  Jeep Grand Cherokee Limited moves further upscale with a long list of new comfort and performance features, including memory seats, mirrors and radio; steering wheel audio controls; dual power lumbar and reclining seats with luxury leather trim; night vision outside mirror; 16-inch tires and wheels; and speed-proportional steering.<BR>

	Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo also gets dual airbags, Select Trac all-wheel-drive, sport aluminum wheels, heated side mirrors, adjustable head rests, CD storage, rear cupholders and more.   <BR>
	Jeep Cherokee for 1996 is America's most affordable small sport utility, with an entry price of $15,145, including destination.<BR>
	Dodge Dakota for 1996 offers a four-cylinder engine with improved power and torque and an entry level price of $11,570, including destination.<BR>
	Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Prices and Destination Charges for Chrysler's 1996 model cars and trucks are attached.  Prices for the all-new Plymouth Breeze and Chrysler Sebring convertible, along with the 1996 Chrysler Sebring, Dodge Avenger, Dodge Ram Van and Wagon, and Eagle Talon, will be announced later this year.	<BR>

<P><center><PRTitle><B>CHRYSLER ASKS CARB TO RECONSIDER ZEV MANDATE, <BR>
CALLS FOR THIRD-PARTY TO ASSESS BATTERY TECHNOLOGY</B></PRTitle><BR>
<B> </B> </center><BR>
  <B> </B><P align ="left"><B><BR>
       Los Angeles, Ca -- </B><B> </B>In testimony before the California Air Resources Board (CARB), Chrysler Corporation  restated its desire to see the California Zero Emission Vehicle (ZEV) production mandate dropped and again requested that CARB appoint a neutral third-party science-based technology firm to assess the viability of electric vehicle battery technology.<BR>
	Speaking on behalf of Chrysler,  Gordon E. Allardyce, manager of environmental regulatory planning, also asked that CARB keep &quot;an open mind to changes in the LEV requirements&quot; as the corporation and industry go through the learning curve in phasing in new technologies that will inevitably uncover some early deficiencies in system durability.<BR>
	Despite serious economic and technological misgivings, Allardyce restated Chrysler's commitment to build an electric version of its next generation minivan as required by the California ZEV mandate.<BR>
	&quot;We believe California cannot achieve its Clean Air goals in a cost-effective manner by mandating any technology,&quot;  Allardyce said.   &quot;We are not opposed to electric vehicles; we oppose the production mandates applied over and above the (current California emission) requirements.  <BR>
	&quot;As demonstrated by AAMA (American Automobile Manufacturers Association) and others' studies, the ZEV  'electric car' mandate is grossly cost-ineffective,&quot; he continued.  &quot;Nonetheless, Chrysler will proceed with electric car development efforts, and will continue these efforts even if mandates are removed.&quot;<BR>
	Batteries for the planned Chrysler electric minivan remain a question.  Batteries meeting the United States Advanced Battery Consortium's mid-term goals will not, in Chrysler's estimation, be ready in time for the ZEV mandate in 1998.  In that case, Chrysler will be forced into utilizing batteries with even less potential, resulting in high costs and vehicle driving range well under 100 miles.<BR>

<P>(16794-S)	-more-<BR>
-2-<BR>
	&quot;With price and range limitations so great, we seriously question our ability to sell 2 percent of our total sales volume in EVs, i.e., 1,500 per year in California,&quot; Allardyce said.  &quot;The ARB staff report is unrealistically optimistic in translating the finding that many people travel less than 100 miles per day to a conclusion that these people represent a ready market for limited range expensive vehicles.  Chrysler would soon go out of business if it conducted its market research this recklessly.&quot;  <BR>
	To reasonably mediate the differences between the CARB and industry positions on the status of battery technology, Chrysler asked CARB on its visit to Detroit in March to assign a third-party technology organization to assess the status of battery technology.  This would be a credible organization of CARB's choosing; the industry would be willing to fund the project.<BR>
  	&quot;Obviously CARB is getting two stories in determining the status of the battery technology,&quot; said Chrysler Vice President of Engineering, Francois J. Castaing in a media briefing last week.  &quot;We are not alone in our assessment of the battery technology through the USABC (United States Advanced Battery Consortium).  The Department of Energy, Electric Power Research Institute and others have drawn the same conclusions we have -- that batteries meeting mid-term goals are the minimum requirement for an EV in 1998, and that technology will not be here in time (to meet the mandate).&quot;<BR>
	In addition to the serious problems with price and range, another impediment to market acceptance is the recharging infrastructure, he added.<BR>
	The realization of technology limitations has not come without significant effort and several other technological successes.  Testimony highlighted the fact that Chrysler was the first manufacturer to offer for sale all three of the major types of alternative fuel vehicles.   <BR>
	In 1992, Chrysler introduced a flex-fuel car that could run on M85,  a compressed natural gas full-size van, and the TEVan electric vehicle.<BR>
	&quot;With the FFV we met the TLEV (transitional low emission vehicle) standard,&quot; he said.  &quot;The CNG full-size van met the LEV standard, and earlier this year our CNG minivan met the ULEV standard.  The TEVan electric vehicle, not surprisingly, was certified as a ZEV.<BR>

<P>-more-<BR>
-3-<BR>

<P>
<P> 	&quot;Additionally, we anticipate that we will be able to eventually certify some of our smaller four-cylinder gasoline engines to the LEV and ULEV standards.  Some are already certified as TLEVs,&quot; Allardyce said.<BR>
	He added that the larger six and eight-cylinder gasoline engines present greater challenges, but we are hopeful of ultimate success using yet-to-be developed new technology.  California Phase II reformulated gasoline is absolutely essential to these efforts.<BR>
	&quot;Maintaining the LEV and ULEV standards for the full useful life of 100,000 miles or 10 years is a worthy goal, but one which is extremely difficult to achieve reliably,&quot; he said.<BR>

CHRYSLER ANNOUNCES SECOND STAGE<BR>
OF MINIVAN REPLACEMENT PRICING STRATEGY<BR>
</B></PRTitle><BR>
<B> </B> </center><BR>
  <B> </B><P align ="left"><B><BR>
       St. Michaels, Mary -- </B>Chrysler Corporation today announced the second stage of its minivan replacement pricing strategy.  The entry level versions of the short- and long-wheelbase Plymouth Voyager and Dodge Caravan, and the short-wheelbase Chrysler Town &amp; Country, will be base-priced the same or less than the vehicles they replace.<BR>
	&quot;We've said all along that affordability was high on our list of priorities, and this pricing action clearly demonstrates our commitment to providing high value products to our customers,&quot; said Theodor R. Cunningham, Chrysler Corporation Executive Vice President of Sales and Marketing, and General Manager of Minivan Operations.<BR>
	&quot;Now that the minivan pricing story is complete, there can be no doubt that Chrysler Corporation alone offers the full breadth of minivan market coverage, with entry level to luxury models, two bodystyles, eight powertrains, right- and left-side sliding doors, and new Easy Out Roller Seats&reg;.  And once all models go into production, we'll have all-wheel drive, in addition to front-wheel drive,&quot; Cunningham said.<BR>

<P>(29795-S)	-more-<BR>

<P>-2-<BR>

<P>	Plymouth Voyager and Grand Voyager, Chrysler Town &amp; Country,  Dodge Caravan and Grand Caravan models affected by this pricing action will have as standard equipment five mile-per-hour bumpers, dual air bags, dynamic side-impact protection, and will meet 1998 passenger car safety regulations.<BR>
<B>Plymouth Voyager </B><BR>
	When thinking of Plymouth, think of value.  And for good reason.<BR>
	An all-new 1996 Plymouth Voyager will begin at $16,720 including destination, and includes an all-new, 2.4-liter, 16-valve, DOHC four cylinder engine with a three-speed automatic transmission developing 150 horsepower, an Easy-Out Roller Seat&reg;, intermittent wipers, and full body anti-chip paint protection.<BR>

<H2>	&quot;Originally, we planned to offer all models with anti-lock brakes as standard equipment,&quot; said Cunningham.  &quot;But with affordability having become more and more important to customers, we decided a little flexibility was in order.  So the entry-level Plymouth is now an even better value, because it costs the same as the 1995 model.&quot;</H2>
<P>
<H2>	Anti-lock brakes are planned as a mandatory option until January 1996, increasing the base price to $17,135.  </H2>

OF ELECTRIC VEHICLE MANDATE</B></PRTitle><BR>

       Sacramento, Ca -- </B>  Chrysler Corporation dealers are joining auto dealers from across the state of California as they converge on Sacramento this week to discuss the economic impact of the impending Low Emission Vehicle (LEV) Program, including the Zero Emission Vehicle (ZEV) mandate in the state.<BR>
	While the Dealer Day business meetings will involve all California dealers,  Chrysler officials will meet separately with their dealers to brief them on expected costs and competitive business issues that will arise specifically from the ZEV -- or electric vehicle -- mandate.  <BR>
	Costs per average car across the fleet could be substantial to off-set the high costs -- some studies indicate as much as $2,000 per vehicle.<BR>
	&quot;We're now at the point where we can say with reasonable certainty that the electric vehicle mandate will create significant business issues for our dealers in California,&quot; said Eric Ridenour, Chrysler director of environmental &amp; energy planning.  &quot;Dealers will ultimately shoulder the burden of having to market cars that consumers may not want.  In addition to that, we know that all vehicle prices will likely rise to cover the high costs associated with electric vehicles.&quot;<BR>

	Ridenour added that the ZEV mandate also creates a serious competitive business situation since only the seven top manufacturer's are being forced to comply with the ZEV mandate.  &quot;The price differential between the top seven manufacturer's products and those of smaller manufacturers who do not have to meet the mandate, will have a serious impact on how our dealers do business.&quot;<BR>
	For instance, Chrysler and Mitsubishi market a common product under two names, the Eagle Talon and the Mitsubishi Eclipse through a joint-venture agreement.  If forced to absorb the high costs of electrics across its whole vehicle fleet, Chrysler's version of the vehicle could be as much as $2,000 higher than the Mitsubishi, since Mitsubishi is not one of the top seven.<BR>
	&quot;If you're an Eagle dealer, how many Talons are you going to sell?&quot; Ridenour said.  &quot;That's exactly the point we're making to the dealers.  There are dozens of competitive scenarios that arise from the mandate that will hurt business.  <BR>
	&quot;We also know that raising the average price of cars will mean older, higher emitting cars will stay on the road longer, slowing the near term reductions,&quot; Ridenour added.<BR>
	Chrysler was the first manufacturer to offer a fully safety certified electric <BR>

vehicle for sale with its electric minivan in 1993, and was the first to receive ZEV, LEV, and ULEV (Ultra-Low Emission Vehicle) certification from the state of California.  Ridenour said Chrysler is developing a new minivan to meet the mandate, but is pessimistic about the sales prospects.<BR>
	&quot;The success of electric vehicles is contingent upon an inexpensive and powerful battery and  an abundant electric refueling infrastructure, neither of which is available yet,&quot; he explained.   &quot;To date, neither are developing at a rate that will support the mandated volumes.  Forcing these vehicles on the public before they are ready will do more to harm the market's development than anything else.&quot;<BR>
	Chrysler is urging its dealers to voice their business concerns and to petition their state government to repeal the Zero Emission Vehicle mandate in favor of other cost-effective alternatives that will net the same clean air benefit without the serious economic impact.<BR>

       Highland Park, Mich. -- </B> Chrysler Corporation's international retail sales soared in the second quarter of 1994 to 35,212 units, a 40 percent increase over 1993.<BR>
	International retail sales in the first six months totalled 63,517 units, up 34 percent over the comparable 1993 period.  <BR>
	&quot;We've virtually doubled our International Sales volume over the past two years on the strenght of our Jeep vehicles and Voyager minivans.  And we're only beginning to enter the international markets with strong passenger cars,&quot; said Thomas C. Gale, Vice President of Design and International Operations. <BR>
	&quot;All of our products are more internationally oriented today.  Our International Sales organization is growing steadily and we're offering clients the customer dedication and service they are looking for.  That combination should provide solid growth for Chrysler's international business,&quot; Gale added.<BR>
	Chrysler Corporation total international sales were 79,602 units, including wholesale CKD shipments and sales to U.S. military personnel outside of North America, for the January through June period, up 31 percent over the first six months of 1993.<BR>

The Jeep Cherokee sales of 16,231 units rose 49 percent over 1993.  Sales of the Jeep Grand Cherokee, introduced at the end of 1992, reached 7,500 units for a 34 percent increase.<BR>
	Chrysler's most popular passenger car was the Chrysler Vision, selling 4,763 units in the first six months of 1994, compared to 1,210 sales in the same period of 1993.  The new Chrysler Neon, recently introduced in Taiwan and the Latin American region, already reported retail sales of 2,640 units.<BR>
	Europe is the largest retail market for Chrysler and Jeep vehicles outside of North America, reporting sales of 35,998 units, for an increase of 25 percent.  Germany was the volume leader in the region with sales of 7,136 units followed by France and Italy with sales of 5,328 and 4,082 units, respectively.<BR>
	Sales in the Asia-Pacific region rose to 15,930 units, up 105 percent from 7,780 units last year.  Taiwan led the region with sales of 6,865 units.  Right-hand drive Cherokee sales in Japan continued to increase reaching 5,794 units for the first six months of 1994.  Total sales in Japan were 6,770 units, up 260 percent.<BR>

95 SALES DIP ON PRODUCTION ISSUES</B></PRTitle><BR>
<B> </B> </center><BR>
  <B> </B><P align ="left"><B><BR>
       Highland Park, Mich. -- </B> Chrysler Corporation is reducing the option price for compressed natural gas (CNG) on its 1996 Dodge Ram Van and Wagon by<BR>

<P> $750.<BR>

<P>	Increased sales volumes and efficiency gains in production are the key triggers for the price reduction, said Mike Clement, manager of Alternative Fuel Vehicle Sales and Marketing.<BR>
	A 1996 B-3500 model van will offer CNG at a manufacturers suggested retail price (MSRP) of $3,838, compared with $4,588 in 1995.<BR>
	Weve been selling CNG vehicles since 1992 and weve gained valuable experience with the technology through that period of time, Clement said.  While its difficult to predict future market demand, were hopeful that increased sales volumes will lead to additional cost reductions.<BR>
	While model change over and tank availability issues pushed down 1995 sales of Chryslers CNG vehicles, 1996 sales are expected to increase significantly, Clement said.  <BR>

<P>(33595)<BR>
-more-<BR>

<P>-2-<BR>
	Chrysler sold 965 CNG vehicles in the 1995 model year, a decrease from  1,620 in 1994 because of a model change on the minivan line and a reduced availability of tanks for the full-size Dodge Ram Van and Wagon.<BR>
	The 1995 sales mix included  527 Ram Vans and Wagons; 313 minivans; 70 Ram pickup trucks; and  55 Dakota pickups.  Chrysler sold 467 CNG vehicles in 1993.  <BR>
	&quot;Model change-over and tank production issues meant we had to pass on some government fleet opportunities,&quot; Clement explained.  &quot;With those issues now behind us, we expect 1996 sales to approach 3,000 - 4,000 with our marketing efforts.<BR>
	&quot;The addition of the pickups in 1995 gave us a more comprehensive fleet offering in addition to our full-size Dodge Ram Van and minivan CNG models,&quot; Clement continued.  &quot;We're confident that increased awareness of CNG, coupled with our marketing efforts, will help us push sales up and maintain our industry-leading position.&quot;<BR>
	Chrysler Corporation will continue to lead the industry with CNG vehicle offerings in 1996 with a total of four vehicle offerings.<BR>
	The Dodge Ram 1500/2500 and Dodge Dakota pickup trucks, the Dodge Ram Van/Wagon and the all-new 1996 Chrysler minivans will feature CNG options.<BR>
	All of Chrysler's CNG vehicles will be certified as Inherently Low Emission Vehicles under Federal schedules. <BR>
-more-<BR>
	-3-<BR>
	Chrysler was also the first company to be certified in all of the major low emission categories as mandated by California law.  In 1994 Chrysler's CNG minivan was certified as the first ULEV; in 1993 the Chrysler TEVan was certified as a Zero Emission Vehicle (ZEV) and in 1992, the full-size Dodge Ram Van/Wagon CNG was certified as a Low Emission Vehicle (LEV).<BR>
	All of Chrysler's CNG offerings will be certified at the ULEV level for 1996, which is the most stringent and difficult to achieve beyond the Zero Emission Vehicle (ZEV) -- or electric vehicle -- mandate.  Chrysler's 3.3-liter  V-6 engine will power the minivan and the 5.2-liter V-8 will power the full-size van and the pickup trucks.<BR>

       Pontiac, Mi -- </B> Petersen's <U>4Wheel &amp; Off-Road</U> magazine announced that the new 1995 Dodge Ram Club Cab V-10 has won its 1995 &quot;4x4 of the Year&quot; award at a luncheon held here today.  This is the first time in the competition's thirteen-year history that there has been a back-to-back winner.  A 1994 regular cab 4x4 Dodge Ram took <U>4Wheel &amp; Off-Road</U>'s top honors last year.<BR>
	The <U>4Wheel &amp; Off-Road</U> competition is open to all manufacturers of new or substantially redesigned truck-based vehicles.  This year's competition included the all-new Chevrolet Blazer, the all-new Ford Explorer and the Ford <BR>
F-250 Power Stroke Diesel.  The vehicles were tested over a four-week period both on-road and under the most arduous of off-road conditions.<BR>
	According to David Freiburger, <U>4Wheel &amp; Off-Road</U>'s editor, &quot;We were amazed at the big Dodge Ram Club Cab's ability to perform so well in a variety of on- and off-highway situations -- especially when compared to its worthy down-size competitors.  The winning factor for the Ram was its balanced performance across our wide spectrum of testing.  The V-10 engine's power is <BR>
hard to beat.&quot; <BR>

       Detroit -- </B>Chrysler Corporation today announced it has chosen PacWest Racing as its partner for the 1996 North American Touring Car Championship (NATCC) race series.  PacWest will assist Chrysler in developing its 2.0 liter Dodge Stratus Super Touring Car with on-track refinements for road racing.<BR>
	Our motorsports programs showcase the development and technological advantage of the platform teams, said Lou Patane, Chryslers Executive Director - Brand Marketing.  The PacWest Touring Car Groups IndyCar racing experience is a fine complement to our production car engineering expertise we are putting into the Stratus Super Touring Car.<BR>
	Chrysler is developing the Stratus race car at its Chrysler Technology Center in Auburn Hills, Michigan.  The car is being designed and built within Chryslers unique platform team structure, utilizing many of the same engineers and technologies available to the company for mass production vehicle development.<BR>
	The international character of this series positions the Stratus here and abroad as a dynamic and technologically refined vehicle, adds Patane.  This will enhance Chryslers image in all our markets.<BR>

<P><center><PRTitle><B>1995 CHRYSLER CIRRUS NAMED MOTOR TREND CAR OF THE YEAR</B></PRTitle><BR>
<B> </B> </center><BR>
  <B> </B><P align ="left"><B><BR>
       Auburn Hills, Mich. -- </B><B>MOTOR TREND</B> magazine today announced the 1995 Chrysler Cirrus has won its 1995 &quot;Car of the Year&quot; award.  <BR>
	The <B>MOTOR TREND </B>editors considered all-new or significantly changed 1995 cars and minivans -- weighing factors such as technological advancement, value, performance, overall impact on the automotive market, and how successfully each meets its class objectives -- to identify the most significant new vehicle. <BR>
	In two separate ceremonies today, <B>MOTOR TREND</B> publisher Lee Kelley presented the award to employees of the Sterling Heights (Mich.) Assembly Plant where the Cirrus is assembled, and to representatives of the Large Car Platform Team responsible for the vehicle's development at the Chrysler Technology Center.  <BR>
	The Cirrus is positioned to go head-to-head with the best of the Japanese import entries and break their stronghold on the compact segment by offering a product that excels in the areas of design, packaging, safety, ride and handling, performance and value.<BR>

<P>(more)<BR>
(50494-S)<BR>

<P>
<P>-2-<BR>

<P>	&quot;This award is a tribute to the team of people who devoted themselves to developing a world-class car fully capable of competing with the best in the industry,&quot; said Chrysler Chairman Robert Eaton.  &quot;The team's challenge three<BR>
years ago was to design, engineer and manufacture a vehicle that would provide tough import-loyal customers with a legitimate domestic alternative.  	&quot;And I'm happy to report that even though the Cirrus has only been in the market a short time, we are currently at 165 percent of our monthly sales projections.  The plant has shipped more than 14,000 vehicles to dealers.&quot;<BR>
	&quot;The Chrysler Cirrus will continue to move the Chrysler brand in a new, younger direction,&quot; said Steve Torok, General Manager-Chrysler/Plymouth Division. &quot;As an entry point for the Chrysler brand, Cirrus will offer not only superior packaging but also a full cadre of standard features that add up to a terrific value over comparable Japanese imports.&quot;<BR>
	The Cirrus offers an advanced 2.5-liter V-6 engine that delivers 164 horsepower and 163 foot-pounds of torque matched to a fully-adaptive, electronic four-speed automatic transmission. <BR>
	Further, the Cirrus is well-equipped with standard features such as anti-lock brakes, speed proportional steering, air conditioning, cruise control, power windows, locks and mirrors, AM/FM cassette radio, personal security package, electric rear window defroster, fog lamps, illuminated visor vanity mirrors, and full folding rear seat.<BR>
(more)<BR>

<P>
<P>-3-<BR>

<P>	This is the third major award for the Cirrus since its introduction this fall.  <B>Popular Science</B> named Cirrus a Grand Award winner in its &quot;Best of What's New&quot; round up and <B>Popular Mechanics</B> awarded Cirrus its &quot;Design and Engineering&quot; award.<BR>
	Production of the Cirrus began in September at the Sterling Heights (Mich.) Assembly Plant. <BR>

<B> </B> </center><BR>
  <B> </B><P align ="left"><B><BR>
       Highland Park, Mich. -- </B>The allegations contained in the press release from the safety advocate group, the Center for Auto Safety, are inflammatory, misleading and without foundation. The issues are clear and have been communicated to NHTSA.  <BR>

<P>First, there is an on-going NHTSA investigation of 1990-1993 Chrysler minivan ABS systems. To date, the information obtained by both NHTSA and us has been very wide ranging with no clear pattern of problems. However, two separate 1992 safety recalls on the Bendix anti-lock brake systems, on both minivans as well as passenger cars, have addressed the two areas that seemed to have produced the largest number of complaints. Any possibility that an owner might experience the loss of the basic hydraulic braking system on their vehicles was addressed in these two recalls already. <BR>

<P>Second, the problems not associated with these recalls have been anecdotal. In the Center for Auto Safety release, these same elements are cited as if they are current, recurring and everyday problems. This simply is untrue.<BR>

<P>Third, even in those rare cases when the anti-lock feature of a brake system becomes inoperative, the owner still has conventional hydraulic brakes. Today, there are millions of vehicles on the road operating in a safe manner without ABS. Millions also continue to be sold without ABS.<BR>

<P>Fourth, it is true that a small number of Chrysler minivan owners of primarily 1990 and 1991 models, paid a lot of money to have their systems replaced when their vehicle no longer was covered by warranty. At this time, we were replacing the entire system, rather than individual components. Today, we now instruct our dealerships to carefully check the system and identify individual components that may not be functioning properly. <BR>

<P>This action, combined with a company policy recently enacted that limits any owner's cost of system repair or replacement to $600.00 for each service action, has very positively addressed the cost issue.<BR>

<P>Fifth, the particular anti-lock brake system under discussion is no longer being used on current Chrysler products.<BR>

<B>   </B><P align ="left"><B><BR>
       Auburn Hills, Mich. -- </B>Chrysler Corporation's U.S. sales in September were 22 percent ahead of a year ago, contributing to a new third-quarter volume record and capping the best model year in company history.<BR>
	<P>&quot;We've set consecutive quarterly sales records in a year that's been relatively flat for the industry as a whole,&quot; said James P. Holden, Executive Vice President - Sales and Marketing.<BR>
	<P>&quot;It's a continuing consumer endorsement of our lineup of innovative and exciting cars, trucks, minivans and Jeep&reg; vehicles,&quot; Holden said.  &quot;September's results are up from last month and they showed a daily sales rate substantially higher than a year ago.  It's a good sign that people like our new '97 models and they're buying them.&quot;<BR>
	<P>Chrysler's U.S. sales for September totaled 183,664 vehicles, compared with 157,004 a year ago.  That was an increase of 22 percent based on daily selling rate. It represented the best September for Chrysler since 1986, when sales of 212,327 set a record.<BR>
	<P>Chrysler passenger car sales were up 17 percent, with September records for Dodge Stratus and for the combined total of Chrysler's compact JA body cars.  Dodge Neon also set a September record.<BR>
	<P>Chrysler light truck sales were up 24 percent, breaking a September record established in 1994.

<P><center><PRTitle><B>CHRYSLER ADDS COMPUTER GAMES TO NEON ADVERTISING <BR>
</B></PRTitle><BR>
<B> </B> </center><BR>
  <B> </B><P align ="left"><B><BR>
       Highland Park, Mich. -- </B>  The advertising campaign for Chrysler Corporation's newest small car may be as &quot;dare to be different&quot; in attitude as the Neon itself. 	<BR>
	Chrysler may be the first advertiser to use a computer software game to reach its target market.<BR>
	A new space combat simulation game from LucasArts Entertainment Co. will be one element in a campaign to launch the Neon, from Dodge and Plymouth, this spring.  The game, &quot;TIE Fighter,&quot; is based on George Lucas' &quot;Star Wars&quot; trilogy.  The player is a new Imperial Navy Academy pilot, under the command of the fearsome Lord Darth Vader, and in pursuit of Luke Skywalker's Rebel Alliance starfighters. <BR>
	An interactive Neon ad, or &quot;electronic brochure,&quot; will preceed the demo of the game, according to Arthur C. (Bud) Liebler, Chrysler's Vice President of Marketing and Communications.  The menu options include performance, environment, room and ergonomics, design and durability, safety and pricing.<BR>
	Electronic Entertainment magazine will distribute 100,000 copies of the playable &quot;TIE Fighter&quot; special sample disk with its March issue.  The complete game, due out in April, will retail for $80.<BR>
(04694-C)	(more)<BR>
- 2 -<BR>
	&quot;This isn't a video game targeted to kids,&quot; Liebler said.  &quot;We're going after members of Generation X with disposable income.  They're young, mostly single or newly married and they are in the market for a car.&quot;<BR>
	A recent reader profile for Electronic Entertainment indicates a subscriber's average age is 26 years old with an average household income of more than $48,000.<BR>
	Interactive entertainment isn't the only unconventional avenue Chrysler's exploring to reach Generation X.<BR>
	Just last month, Chrysler sponsored an hour-long, docu-drama called &quot;Road Trip&quot;, in which Neon was the star but Chrysler chose not to advertise on the show.  Instead, public service announcements on projects not related to Chrysler business aired on the &quot;Road Trip&quot; broadcast.  Other venues include movie theaters, club racing, a music video made by an all-star lineup of pop stars, tie-ins with health clubs, concert and event ticket outlets, video arcades and grass roots racing.<BR>
	Unconventional is a good word for describing the Neon's attributes.<BR>
	&quot;Everything about the Neon challenges conventional wisdom -- from the way it was conceived, through its vehicle development, to what it delivers,&quot; Liebler said.  &quot;Because of this `dare to be different' attitude, we believe the Neon will set new, small car standards for fun-to-drive performance, safety, design, environmental sensitivity and overall value.&quot;<BR>
 	&quot;TIE Fighter&quot; is being created by Lawrence Holland and Edward Kilham, also  designers of &quot;X Wing,&quot; which has sold more than 500,000 copies worldwide.<BR>

<B> </B> </center><BR>
  <B> </B><P align ="left"><B><BR>
       Highland Park, Mich. -- </B> Health care costs down the road will take a competitive toll on all U.S. businesses whether or not they pay for health care today, Chryslers Walter Maher told some 500 members of the National Association of Women Business Owners at NAWBOs recent national conference in San Francisco.<BR>
	Maher, Director of Federal Relations for Chrysler, said the competitiveness of all businesseslarge and smallwill be affected by escalating health care costs.  As health care absorbs more and more of the dollars in our economy, less and less money is available for all other needs, be they education, infrastructure or the goods and services your businesses and mine sell, he said.<BR>
	Maher outlined three critical elements to watch as health care reform unfolds:  coverage for all, affordable costs and a system of equitable financing that holds each employer responsible for paying a fair share of the costs.<BR>
	No nation has succeeded in controlling health care costs without covering everyone, Maher noted.  But health care must also be affordablefor families, for businesses and for the economy.  The Clinton proposal, the Cooper plan and the <BR>

<P>(11894) 	-more-<BR>
	- 2 -<BR>
leading Republican plan for health care reform all presume employers will play a major role in financing health care in the United States.  Fairness dictates that all employers participate, recognizing the need for substantial assistance to small employers.<BR>
	The alternative, said Maher, is that some businessesregardless of sizewould carry more than their share to pick up the cost of uninsured citizens in the form of higher prices charged by doctors and hospitals to compensate for the uninsured.<BR>
	This extra load could make a difference in the competitiveness of your businessesthey certainly do in my business,  Maher said, noting that Chrysler competes against firms from countries that have lower national health care costs and spread costs fairly across all employers.<BR>
	And when Chrysler loses businesses to a company from another country, all of our U.S. suppliers feel it, too.  We are all in this together, Maher concluded.<BR>

<P><center><PRTitle><B>CHRYSLER FIRST TO TEST NEW, COMPETITIVE<BR>
NATIONAL NEWSPAPER AD RATES</B></PRTitle><BR>
<B> </B> </center><BR>
  <B> </B><P align ="left"><B><BR>
       Highland Park, Mich. -- </B> Chrysler Corporation is the charter advertiser in a program that ultimately could encourage national advertisers to significantly increase their newspaper advertising placements.<BR>
	The program was developed -- jointly by Chrysler and the Newspaper Association of America (NAA) -- to test national newspaper advertising that simplifies billing and is competitively priced.<BR>
	The first flight of ads, highlighting Chrysler's national minivan sale, began appearing this week in some of the 75 newspapers that make up the NAA coalition.  Chrysler-Plymouth will run two half-page four-color ads and Dodge a full-page ad during the next three weeks.  Another flight is scheduled for later this year.<BR>
	&quot;In the past, it was nearly impossible for national advertisers like Chrysler to deal with every major market newspaper directly,&quot; said Arthur C. (Bud) Liebler, Chrysler's Vice President of Marketing and Communications.  &quot;Newspapers generally didn't offer competitive prices for national advertisers and couldn't execute a buy on the date and in the section requested.  Making newspaper advertising work was costly and time consuming and, as a result, we didn't do very much of it.<BR>
(08694)	-more-<BR>

<P>-2-<BR>

<P>	&quot;Working with NAA, we've worked out a `one-order, one-bill' system that will simplify the entire process and make newspaper advertising more user-friendly and competitive for advertisers,&quot; Liebler said.<BR>
	NAA facilitated these buys by securing individual rates from each newspaper and providing Chrysler with a competitive blended rate through Publicitas Advertising Services, Stamford, Conn., which will also provide one-order, one-bill service that will serve as a model for NAA's Newspaper National Network (NNN) program.  <BR>
	&quot;The newspaper industry wants Chrysler's business,&quot; said Nicholas Cannistraro, NAA senior vice president for marketing and chief marketing officer.  &quot;We're pulling together to provide one-order, one-bill service, competitive rates and placement to earn that business.<BR>
	&quot;This is new national advertising that newspapers have not had in some time<BR>
and it is particularly gratifying that newspapers from both smaller and larger markets -- most with four-color capability -- chose to participate in the buy.

ON SELECT 1996 DODGE RAM PICKUP TRUCK MODELS</B></PRTitle><BR>
<B> </B> </center><BR>
  <B> </B><P align ="left"><B><BR>
       Highland Park, Mich. -- </B>As part of a national campaign designed to capitalize on the Dodge Rams tremendous popularity in the full-size pickup truck segment, Chrysler Corporation today announced consumer cash allowances on select 1995 and 1996 Dodge Ram regular and club cab models, effective today through December 31, 1995.<BR>
	The new incentives fall under the Magnum Power Sales Event, and will include advertising and promotional support highlighting Rams recent J.D. Power and Associates A.P.E.A.L. award and sales success in the marketplace.  Ram models covered under the new program include:<BR>
	-	Ram 5.2-liter V-8 models -- $400 cash allowance;<BR>
	-	Ram 5.9-liter V-8 models -- $400 cash allowance plus $270 			M.S.R.P. engine upgrade bonus;<BR>
	-	Ram 5.9-liter Cummins Turbo Diesel models -- $500 or alternate 		Mopar accessories.<BR>
	In addition, qualified commercial retail customers and Farm Bureau members may be eligible for additional savings.<BR>

<P>(41795)	- more -<BR>
	- 2 -<BR>
	This program is designed to expand the appeal and availability of the Dodge Ram pickup to an even larger audience, which is now possible due to the capacity increases at our St. Louis North Assembly Plant, said Martin R. Levine, General Manager, Dodge Car and Truck Division.  Ram has been in short supply ever since it was introduced two years ago, and many potential customers have been turned away.  We want to let those customers out there know that Ram regular and club cab models are now available in even larger numbers.<BR>
	In addition to 23 consecutive monthly records, Ram sales have topped 20,000 for eight consecutive months, including an all-time record in October 1995 with 23,611 units.  Current calendar-year sales through October are 214,213, 12 percent ahead of last years record pace.<BR>

<B> </B> </center><BR>
  <B> </B><P align ="left"><B><BR>
       Highland Park, Mich. -- </B> The American automotive industry is large and important to the economy, but is also fragile because it is battered around more than any other industry by every economic, technological, political and social change that takes place in the world.<BR>
	 Appearing at the Executives' Club of Chicago today, Chrysler Corporation Chairman Robert J. Eaton put the auto industry into perspective, with examples of quality, technology, political and environmental issues facing the industry.<BR>
	&quot;We can't afford to pay hundreds of millions in health care costs each year that are not ours. And we can't afford to waste billions of dollars on technologies that won't work instead of spending them on technologies that might,&quot; Eaton said.<BR>
	The chairman said that there is need for reasonable standards for cleaner vehicles, stressing the word reasonable.<BR>
	Discussing the California law mandating zero emissions, Eaton said the law forces Chrysler to build an electric vehicle -- with a retail cost of $100,000 -- but the law doesn't force anyone to buy it.<BR>
(14594)				      (more)<BR>

<P>.	-2-<BR>
	The nearly one ton battery pack needed to power the electric vehicle -- a minivan -- has the same amount of energy contained in 1.2 gallons of gasoline.<BR>
	&quot;I seriously doubt that there will be much consumer demand in California or anywhere else for an electric car that might not even get you to work and back if the traffic is heavy,&quot; Eaton said. &quot;But we'll meet the law.&quot;<BR>
	Heath care reform, he said, is an important issue for the auto industry and Chrysler, where health costs of about $1,100 are in each vehicle.<BR>
	&quot;...the penalty comes from the way we finance and distribute health care costs in this country. It's basically Robin Hood medicine -- shift the cost from those who can't or won't pay to those who will,&quot; Eaton continued.<BR>
	This cost shifting accounts for about 28 percent of Chrysler's health care costs.<BR>
	Eaton said Chrysler supports a system that makes coverage available to everyone, that distributes the costs equitably across society and that puts true cost containment in place.<BR>

       Highland Park, Mich. -- </B> Often referred to as Chrysler's &quot;best kept secret&quot;,  Eagle plays a very unique role within the Corporation.  The brand delivers sophisticated, expressive, technologically-advanced products that inspire driver confidence.<BR>
	&quot;Eagle attracts customers who historically have not considered our Dodge, Chrysler, or Plymouth vehicles,&quot; Ed Brust, General Manager, Jeep and Eagle Division, says.  &quot;These sales are incremental business to Chrysler Corporation,&quot; said Brust.  &quot;While Eagle has been successful in attracting these new buyers to Chrysler Corporation, the challenge now is to attract more of them.&quot;  <BR>
	&quot;As the reach-out brand, it is our responsibility to create a new path for the Corporation, communicate with new customers, explore new methods and take a few risks along the way.&quot;<BR>
	Eagle appeals to people who are less likely to have previously owned or visited one of Chrysler Corporation's other car dealers -- people who are more likely to trade an import or consider a non-Chrysler product as an alternative.<BR>
	Brust best describes the Eagle customer as independent, self-assured, open-minded, and well-educated. <BR>
(36794)	(more)<BR>

	&quot;People who buy Eagle products are thought-leaders, interested in technology and global issues,&quot; explains Brust. &quot;Passionate and successful, these customers live life rather than look at it.&quot;<BR>
	Talon, the brand's most visible entry, conveys Eagle's product personality and projects a unique brand attitude -- Eagle Talon sets the foundation for the brand.<BR>
	&quot;If you were starting from scratch to develop a brand of cars to satisfy a group of unique, intelligent individuals who live life to the fullest, Talon would be the first choice,&quot; said Brust. &quot;It absolutely personifies our prospects' passion for fun and achievement.&quot;<BR>
	Brust says Eagle combines the aggressive performance of Talon with the sophisticated style and handling of Vision, the outstanding value of Summit, two- and four-door,  and the versatility of Summit Wagon to offer distinctive, high-quality, automotive solutions to their customers' driving needs.<BR>
	Brust believes that in order to be truly appreciated, Eagle products must be driven.  Thus the brand's 1995 campaign, &quot;The Eagle Test Drive&quot;, aimed at getting customers unfamiliar with the brand turned on to Eagle.<BR>
	&quot;Eagle is indeed the provider of contemporary, technologically-advanced, sophisticated performance products that challenge the competition,&quot; said Brust. &quot;There has never been a better time for this brand.&quot;<BR>

OVER 360 DODGE VIPER OWNERS <BR>
TO GATHER FOR DREAM WEEKEND</B></PRTitle><BR>
<B> </B> </center><BR>
  <B> </B><P align ="left"><B><BR>
       Auburn Hills, Mich. -- </B> It is a &quot;club&quot; as unique as the vehicle itself.  To be a Dodge Viper owner means more than having a one-of-a-kind, no-holds-barred, pure high performance sports car.  It means being the possessor of a car whose very exclusivity made it an instant worldwide classic.  <BR>
	This weekend, over 360 Viper owners from as far away as Hawaii will converge on Auburn Hills to be a part of the first Viper Owners Invitational celebration.  Over 200 owners will even be bringing their Vipers, forming the largest single collection assembled in one place to date.<BR>
	Each owner has a unique story, be it the collector who filled out his classic collection with a Viper, to the factory worker who saved for thirty years for his dream machine, and it turned out to be a Viper. The Invitational will be a &quot;family reunion&quot; of sorts for these owners, giving each a chance to mingle as a part of the auto industry's most exclusive fraternity.  <BR>
	&quot;This is an owner's club like no other,&quot; said Dodge General Manager Martin R. Levine.  &quot;The passion these people have for their Vipers is unlike anything else in the industry.  We wanted to give them the opportunity to share their Viper passion and experiences with each other.&quot;<BR>

<P>(33994)	-more-<BR>

<P>-2-<BR>

<P>	Dodge Viper owners will also get a chance to talk to, and share experiences with the people whose vision for the best of both past and future came alive in Viper, including the three Viper &quot;fathers,&quot; Robert A. Lutz, Chrysler President and COO, Thomas C. Gale, Chrysler Vice President, Product Design and International Operations and Francois Castaing, Chrysler Vice President, Vehicle Engineering, all Viper owners themselves!  <BR>
	The event will include tours of the Chrysler Technology Center, the New Mack Assembly Plant where Vipers are hand-built, a day trip to the Dodge IROC race at Michigan International Speedway on Saturday, including an opportunity to drive on the racetrack during the all-Viper parade lap, evening parties and dinners and, of course, plenty of great driving.<BR>

<P><center><PRTitle><B>CHRYSLER INVITES AFRICAN AMERICANS TO TEST DRIVE NEW CIRRUS<BR>
</B></PRTitle><BR>
<B> </B> </center><BR>
  <B> </B><P align ="left"><B><BR>
       Highland Park, Mich. -- </B>Chrysler is extending an invitation to drive the new 1995 Chrysler Cirrus as part of its African American Test Drive Program, beginning December 1, 1994.<BR>
	Individuals are drawn from <U>Black Enterprise</U>, <U>Emerge</U> and<U> Essence</U> magazine subscriber lists, members of African American organizations, and ministers of Black churches throughout the United States.<BR>
	Each participant agrees to drive the Chrysler Cirrus for 2-3 days.  Drivers are then asked to fill out an evaluation form on their experience.<BR>
	&quot;Research has shown us that, for every demonstration drive conducted, three additional people drive the vehicle and three more are passengers,&quot; said Jim Cherfoli, Chrysler-Plymouth National Merchandising Manager.  &quot;It has been, and should be, a very effective means for us to increase awareness with our target buyers.&quot;<BR>

<P>
<P>(48794)	- more -<BR>

<P>- 2 -<BR>
	Provided in each test drive vehicle is a CD by recording artists Blackgirl, a vocal trio who is featured on &quot;2168: New Plateau,&quot; the television commercial for Chrysler Cirrus targeted to African Americans, produced by Don Coleman and Associates, Chrysler's African American advertising agency, headquartered in Southfield, MI.  The CD allows the driver to listen to &quot;cuts&quot; from Blackgirl while it describes Chrysler Cirrus' many features and benefits.	&quot;Take a look in the back seat,&quot; the voice on the CD prompts.  &quot;Would you believe, with all that rear-seat room, that Cirrus is a compact car?  It's the kind of room that only cab-forward engineering can provide.&quot;<BR>
	Chrysler Cirrus is the industry's first cab-forward designed compact.  Starting at $17,970 (including destination charges), the Cirrus features a  high level of standard equipment , including driver and passenger air bags, air conditioning, speed control, AM/FM cassette, folding rear seat, tilt wheel, side-impact protection and power windows.<BR>
	&quot;The Test Drive Program is just another example of the continuing emphasis Chrysler Corporation is placing on the important African American consumer market,&quot; said Christine MacKenzie, Manager of Corporate Advertising.<BR>
	The Chrysler Cirrus African American Test Drive Program runs through February, 1995.  It is expected that more than 1,500 participants will experience the new Chrysler Cirrus through this program.<BR>

<B>   </B><P align ="left"><B><BR>
       Auburn Hills, Mich. -- </B>Eager buyers have helped break another sales record for the Dodge Truck flagship -- more Dodge Ram Pickups have been sold in just nine months of 1996 than in any full calendar year in Chrysler Corporation history.<BR>
	<P>From January 1, 1996, through the end of September, Ram Pickup sales totaled 288,174. That compares with sales of 271,501 in all of 1995, the previous record year.<BR>
	<P>The new Ram Pickup was introduced for the 1994 model year. Since then, its bold styling and best-in-class payload capacity, tow ratings, powertrains and passenger comfort have propelled it to 34 consecutive monthly sales records. 	<P>Ram Pickup's share of its U.S. market segment has grown from 6.9 percent in 1993, when 95,542 were sold, to 20.4 percent for the first nine months of 1996. A year ago, it was the 11th best-selling nameplate in the industry. Today it is No. 5.<BR>

       Auburn Hills, Mich. -- </B>Chrysler Corporation today announced that its Kenosha, Wis. Engine Plant will produce an all-new, multi-valve 2.7-liter V-6 engine starting in the third quarter of 1997 for use in 1998 model year vehicles.<BR>

	Chrysler and UAW Local 72 reached an agreement to place the 2.7-liter V-6 engine at Kenosha Engine in December 1994.<BR>

<P><center><PRTitle><B>CHRYSLER'S CHELSEA (MICHIGAN) PROVING GROUNDS<BR>
CELEBRATES 40TH ANNIVERSARY</B></PRTitle><BR>
<B> </B> </center><BR>
  <B> </B><P align ="left"><B><BR>
       Chelsea, Mi -- </B>The mission of the Chrysler Proving Grounds is much the same as it was when it opened 40 years ago.  But the rules, and most assuredly the tools have changed.<BR>
	Today, Chrysler's cars and trucks undergo more strenuous testing than did the Chrysler, Plymouth, Dodge and DeSoto models of 40 years ago. <BR>
	&quot;We're still proving out what the customer will find when they drive our vehicles...but in accelerated time,&quot; said Sue Cischke, Executive Engineer -- Chrysler Proving Grounds and Durability Testing.  &quot;We have more sophisticated ways of measuring.  We have more extensive testing and our schedules are accelerated and on rougher roads.&quot; <BR>
	The result is durability testing -- 1990s style -- and that means a whole new level of error-proofing that was not possible in the 1950s.<BR>
	At the end of World War II, Chrysler conducted an exhaustive land search in southeast Michigan for a site for its first modern proving grounds. <BR>

<P>
<P>(more)<BR>

<P>(21594-S)<BR>
-2-<BR>
	At the time it was heralded as &quot;the newest, largest and most advanced of all automobile proving grounds in operation, covering 3,800 acres of the most difficult terrain man can devise&quot; (October 1953 edition of Chilton's Motor Age). To that point, the construction of the proving grounds about 60 miles west of Detroit was the largest private earth-moving contract ever let in the state of Michigan.<BR>
	The core of the Chrysler Proving Grounds remains as it was when it was dedicated on June 16, 1954 -- an 8.4-mile endurance road, a 4.7-mile oval track and 2.23 miles of straightaways.<BR>
	However, much has been added since then to the complex. Today, more than 200 test procedures are performed over the 45-mile network of paved, gravel and dirt roads that duplicate conditions found in the United States, Canada and Mexico and in the various laboratories. <BR>
	Tests monitor everything from loads, speeds, rates of acceleration and braking, to repeatedly turning on and off the windshield wipers and slamming deck lids.<BR>
	Changes that have taken place at the Chrysler Proving Grounds over the past 40 years have been prompted mainly by government regulations, the advent of computers, an increased emphasis on customer satisfaction, and the continous search for improved quality.<BR>
	The emissions laboratory was added to conduct tests to support the development and government certification process. Test vehicles are driven on chassis dynamometers according to standardized driving cycles. Along with duplicating on-the-road conditions, both temperature and humidity are controlled within a specified range. Vehicle exhaust is collected for analysis. <BR>
	(more)<BR>

<P>-3-<BR>
<B>FUTURE PLANS</B><BR>
	Future facility plans, based on Clean Air Act revisions, include testing for emissions and driveability at extreme high and low ambient temperatures, and the capability to test alternatively fueled vehicles.<BR>
	The impact test building houses an impact simulator, which can simulate a passenger car striking a solid barrier at 70 miles per hour. This is done by accelerating a mock-up of the vehicle from 0 to 70 miles per hour in less than one-tenth of a second. <BR>
	The Chrysler Proving Grounds also performs full-scale vehicle crash testing, development testing and federal motor vehicle safety compliance tests.<BR>
	The wind tunnel is used to test full-size cars and trucks for engine cooling, underhood temperatures, air conditioning performance, wind noise and aerodynamic design. Wind velocity in the tunnel simulates speeds up to 120 miles per hour on full-size vehicles and 150 miles per hour on 3/8 scale models. Temperatures can be controlled to 120 degrees Fahrenheit (49 degrees Celsius).<BR>
	The mileage accumulators accommodate 24 vehicles at one time. The dynamometers have the capability of driving a vehicle at 100 miles per hour. The test cycle desired is programmed and controlled by a computer. A robot device is used to shift manual transmission vehicles, and the blowers create air flow that matches the vehicle speed.<BR>
	The extensive use of salt to control ice on roads made a corrosion facility essential. In one year, the corrosion facility at the Chrysler Proving Grounds can simulate 10 years of corrosion by using a salt water trough, halo spray and humidity soak.<BR>
(more)<BR>

<P>-4-<BR>
	The vehicle dynamics facility is used for evaluating the steering, suspension and braking characteristics of vehicles during severe maneuvers at varying speeds up to 100 miles per hour.  The surface is 1 1/4 miles long, with banked turns at either end to help vehicles get to test speed. The test surface is approximately 19 acres of asphalt surface, similar to that found on a typical Michigan roadway.<BR>

<P><B>SLIPPERY SURFACES</B><BR>
	The skid traction facility is used to determine vehicle stability and stopping distance on slippery road surfaces of varying degrees.  It is made up of four individual traction surfaces 30 feet wide by 1,000 feet long, each having a different wet coefficient of friction. <BR>
	The most slippery surface is equivalent to wet ice on a cold winter day. One of the other surfaces simulates an asphalt road during the first half hour of light rain before the film of dirt, oil and rubber has been washed away. <BR>
	The least slippery surface is a normal concrete road after a steady rain has washed away the contaminants.<BR>
	Roads have been added and &quot;improved,&quot; which in most cases means more rugged, to test the durability characteristics of vehicles. The endurance road network encompasses the full range of road surfaces from smooth asphalt, to gravel, to moderately rough asphalt, to severely rough surfaces simulating off-road applications. <BR>

<P>(more)<BR>

<P>-5-<BR>
	The network of roads also contains many turns, curves and grades in an attempt to duplicate public roads. Many of the roads contain built-in bumps, dips and ripples to induce high stress into the test vehicle's suspension, body and tires. Two gravel roads are typical of country roads with washboard bumps, chuckholes and sharp turns. <BR>
	&quot;Chalma Road&quot; is a reproduction of a tortuous stretch of roadway outside of Mexico City. The cobblestones, potholes and grinding bumps of Chalma test the strength of suspensions and structures. <BR>
	Off-road vehicles are put through their paces in the &quot;Soup Bowl&quot;, part of a 1.6 mile system of paths and ruts containing turns, curves, grades and road conditions found in wilderness situations.<BR>
	The high-speed oval test track is used for high speed durability, simulated city traffic, endurance cycling of engines, transmission and rear axles, fuel economy measurements, brake performance and temperature measurements. The track itself is a six-lane concrete road 4.7 miles long. The curves are banked progressively from one degree at the inside lane to 26 degrees at the outside lane. This makes it possible, when desirable for test purposes, to drive a vehicle at 140 miles per hour in the outside lane without side thrust.<BR>
	Grades are used for durability testing and evaluation of hill climbing ability and parking brake performance. A 32-percent grade represents Arguella Blvd. in San Francisco. The track also has a 15-percent grade and a 7-percent grade, which is at least as steep as any interstate grade.<BR>

<P>
<P>(more)<BR>
-6-<BR>
<B>HI TECH TESTING</B><BR>
	Computers provide more sophisticated data collection and measuring than was available 40 years ago. <BR>
	At the end of each shift, drivers today put their comments into computer terminals and reports are made to the engineers, instead of writing them by hand on a clipboard as they did in 1954. Computerizing input allows the engineers to use the entire data base so that drivers' comments are not lost in the process of consolidating data. Engineers can quickly make product modifications to address driver comments. In some cases, data acquisition systems transmit information from the vehicles through telemetry by radio signal. <BR>
	The improvements at the Chrysler Proving Grounds continue into its next 40 years.<BR>
	An Automated Durability Road -- the first of its kind in the U.S. -- is under construction with plans for it to be fully operational next year.  Also under construction is an advanced skid traction facility to create even more slippery surfaces for anti-lock brake testing and development.<BR>

       Philadelphia -- </B>Chrysler Corporation will participate with the U.S. Department of Energy in the Super Clean Cities program in Philadelphia in 1996, with the goal of selling up to 1,000 compressed natural gas (CNG) vehicles.<BR>
	The program will last through September of 1996.  The long term marketing effort takes advantage of Greater Philadelphias status as a DOE designated Clean City where joint industry/government cooperation and incentives are providing the framework developing alternative fuel vehicle (AFV)  markets.  The Super Clean designation is a focused effort to substantially boost AFV sales and infrastructure in a specific market.<BR>
	This is a long term marketing effort focusing Chryslers resources and the resources of the Greater Philadelphia Clean Cities program to get a significant increase in the sales of natural gas vehicles, said Mike Clement, Chrysler manager of alternative fuel vehicles sales and marketing.  Our goal is to sell 1,000 CNG vehicles in that market during the 1996 model year.  Thats a significant task considering Chrysler sold about that amount nationwide last year.<BR>

<P>  <BR>
(34295)	-more-<BR>

<P>-2-<BR>

<P>	Under the cooperative program, Chrysler is providing sales incentives and merchandising support to its dealers, including support for use of demonstration vehicles.<BR>
	Dealers are also receiving specialized training in the sales and service of the CNG vehicles.<BR>
	The local utility companies, PECO Energy and The Philadelphia Gas Works, together with PAF Fueling will be responsible for developing the supporting refueling infrastructure to support customer vehicles.  Utilities are also providing sales incentives and PAF will provide special pricing for the fueling hardware.<BR>
	The DOE support through the Clean Cities program will be the glue that holds it all together, Clement said.<BR>
	Their role is to help coordinate all of these activities, provide publicity and help line-up customers, Clement added.<BR>
	 A similar program is planned for Atlanta later this year.  Clement said these two focused efforts should substantially clarify what the potential market for CNG vehicles is in major metropolitan areas.<BR>

SET FOR GRAND PRIX WEEKEND</B></PRTitle><BR>
<B> </B> </center><BR>
  <B> </B><P align ="left"><B><BR>
       Auburn Hills, Mich. -- </B><B> </B>Chrysler Corporation and the Southeast Michigan Dodge Dealers today announced sponsorship of the first-ever &quot;Neon Challenge&quot; as part of the ITT Automotive Detroit IndyCar Grand Prix weekend.  Hollywood celebrities, local Detroit personalities and national and international automotive media will compete in race-prepared Dodge Neons in a 30-minute SCCA-sanctioned race around the Raceway on Belle Isle Park.<BR>
	Crystal Bernard from the hit NBC comedy series &quot;Wings,&quot; Sean Patrick Flanery of the ABC television series &quot;The Chronicles of Young Indiana Jones,&quot;  Mark-Paul Gosselaar, who plays on the NBC comedy series &quot;Saved By The Bell:  The College Years&quot; and Michael Castner, who currently hosts the new E! series &quot;F.Y.E!,&quot; will be the Hollywood celebrities competing in the &quot;Neon Challenge.&quot;<BR>
	Local radio and television personalities who will participate include Mark Champion from WWJ, Steve Kostan of WRIF and Eric Smith from WXYZ-TV.<BR>

<P>(17494-S)	(more)<BR>
	-2-<BR>
	National automotive media participants will include Barry Winfield from <U>Car and Driver</U>, Joe Rusz of <U>Road &amp; Track</U>, Denise McCluggage from <U>AutoWeek</U>, Daniel Charles Ross from <U>Motor Trend</U>, Doug Weisz from <U>Automobile</U>, and Tony Swan from the <U>Detroit Free Press</U>.  Henny Hemmes from <U>Auto Week</U> in the Netherlands and Tiff Needell from BBC &quot;Top Gear&quot; are crossing the ocean to compete.<BR>
	&quot;Neon Challenge&quot; activities for the weekend include a practice session on Friday, June 10, at 6:15 p.m.; the qualifying race on Saturday, June 11, at 1:10 p.m.; and the &quot;Neon Challenge&quot; on Grand Prix Sunday, June 12, at 10:45 a.m.  	Drivers in the &quot;Neon Challenge&quot; will complete training at the Skip Barber Driving School prior to the event.<BR>
	Detroit is the first of three &quot;Neon Challenge&quot; races in 1994, to be followed by Des Moines in July and Dallas in September.  Chrysler also is launching an aggressive racing contingency awards program in conjunction with the SCCA.<BR>
	Chrysler selected Neon for the SCCA programs because of its nimble handling and fun-to-drive characteristics.  The cars will compete in mostly stock condition, with safety equipment added according to SCCA Showroom Stock specifications.  <BR>
	So how does Neon stack up?  Emerson Fittipaldi, defending Indianapolis 500 winner, two-time Formula One World Champion and the 1989 PPG Indy Car World Series Champ, recently put Neon to the test.<BR>
	&quot;It has a very quick steering wheel, a stable platform you feel you can lean on, and it doesn't roll much,&quot; said Fittipaldi.  &quot;You have a good feel in the car; it feels very light, very quick.  The response, the steering wheel...the ratio is very positive.&quot;<BR>
	(more)<BR>

<P>-3-<BR>
	Fittipaldi will serve as Grand Marshal of the &quot;Neon Challenge&quot; race in addition to competing in the ITT Automotive Detroit Grand Prix the same day.  He will also meet with the &quot;Neon Challenge&quot; drivers to share his knowledge of the course.<BR>
	When not in use during race weekend, the full stable of Neons, along with some Chrysler concept vehicles, will be showcased for public viewing in their own paddock in the general admission area of the track.  <BR>

       Highland Park, Mich. -- </B>The sultry, bass-toned, distinctive voice of R&amp;B singer Barry White has attracted listeners for more than 20 years.  White can be heard in concerts across the country during the Jeep&reg; Presents The Barry White Icon World Tour, sponsored by the Jeep Division of Chrysler Corporation.  <BR>
	&quot;The popularity of Barry White among 25-50 year olds is reflected through those drivers who have a love for style, adventure, excitement and energy,&quot; said Ed Brust, General Manager, Jeep and Eagle Division.  &quot;It's a perfect match for the Jeep brand.&quot;<BR>
	White also provides the voice-over for the soon-to-be released television commercial for the 1996 Jeep Grand Cherokee Limited, produced by Don Coleman &amp; Associates of Bingham Farms.<BR>
	The Jeep Presents The Barry White Icon World Tour began June 2 in Birmingham, Alabama, and will travel to more than 40 U.S. cities, including Detroit. <BR>

<B> </B> </center><BR>
  <B> </B><P align ="left"><B><BR>
       Highland Park, Mich. -- </B>Chrysler Corporation today announced second quarter net earnings of $956 million, or $2.35 per fully diluted common share ($2.61 per primary common share).  Second quarter and six months results represent records in:  <BR>
  	Quarterly net earnings of $956 million, exceeding the previous high of $938 million in the first quarter of 1994. Chrysler reported second quarter 1993 net earnings of $685 million.  <BR>
  	Quarterly pretax earnings of $1,593 million, surpassing the previous all-time high of $1,543 million in the first quarter of 1994.  In second quarter 1993, pretax earnings were $1,122 million.  <BR>
  	Pretax earnings for the first six months of 1994 were $3,136 million, an increase of $1,134 million or 57 percent over the $2,002 million in the comparable 1993 period.  <BR>
  	Second quarter total sales and revenues of $13.1 billion, an increase of $2.1 billion or 19 percent over second quarter 1993's $11.0 billion.  <BR>
(more)(25694)<BR>

<P>
<P>  	Total sales and revenues for the first six months of the year of $26.3 billion, an increase of $4.4 billion or 20 percent over the comparable 1993 results of $21.9 billion.  	<BR>
	Commenting on the quarter just ended, Chrysler Chairman Robert J. Eaton said: <BR>
	&quot;Strong consumer demand for Chrysler cars and trucks -- both in North America and around the world -- once again generated solid quarterly financial results.  Dealer inventories for many of our products, including minivans, Dodge and Plymouth Neon, Jeep&reg; Grand Cherokee and Dodge Ram, were in short supply for much of the quarter.<BR>
	&quot;As announced previously, we are carefully adding increased capacity over the next three years in response to this demand.  Our challenge for the coming year is to continue to make significant improvements in quality while managing the increasing costs of doing business including those associated with future government regulations.&quot;<BR>
	On June 30, 1994, Chrysler completed the sale of most of its Acustar soft trim operations for net proceeds totaling approximately $100 million.  The resulting gain was deferred and will be recognized over the five-year term of an accompanying supply agreement.<BR>
	Chrysler's worldwide factory unit sales in the first six months of 1994 were 1,443,400 --- an increase of 11 percent over the first six months of 1993.<BR>
	(more)<BR>

<P>
<P>	International retail sales in second quarter 1994 totaled 35,212 units, up 40 percent over the comparable 1993 period.  Chrysler sold 19,116 vehicles in Europe in second quarter 1994, an increase of 27 percent over the 15,095 units sold in the same 1993 period.  <BR>
	Chrysler Financial Corporation reported second quarter and six months pretax earnings for 1994 of $69 and $144 million, respectively, compared to $62 million and $112 million in the comparable periods of 1993.  Net earnings were $44 million for the second quarter of 1994, equaling 1993's second quarter net earnings. <BR>

       Highland Park, Mich. -- </B> Jeep&reg; provides full coverage of the sport utility vehicle market as no other manufacturer can.  It's a worldwide icon for &quot;go anywhere and do anything.&quot;  It's the reason why Jeep vehicles have been setting sales records in the United States, while taking off in Germany, Japan, England, Australia and 80-plus other countries.<BR>
	The heart and soul of the Jeep brand is Wrangler.  It offers open-top fun with legendary off-road capability to entry-level sport utility buyers as well as off-road enthusiasts.  Jeep Cherokee, the original four-door compact sport utility, combines superb on-road manners and performance with its proven off-road capability in an affordable package.  And the upscale Grand Cherokee offers luxury features and a car-like ride, while remaining true to the off-road capability of its Jeep bloodline.<BR>
	To build three of the key attributes - value, image and safety - that have made Jeep a global success, several refinements have been made to the 1995 lineup:<BR>
 	Jeep Wrangler adds a sporty new &quot;Rio Grande&quot; Edition, featuring an 	American Southwest look, to its affordable &quot;S&quot; model;<BR>

<P>(42894)	(more)<BR>
	- 2 -<BR>
 	Jeep has teamed up with the Orvis&reg; Company, the oldest continuously 	operating American supplier of outdoor sporting equipment, to create a top-of-the-line Orvis Edition Grand Cherokee Limited;<BR>
 	Jeep Cherokee now comes equipped with a standard driver-side air bag;<BR>
 	An available integrated child seat debuts on Jeep Grand Cherokee; and<BR>
 	Standard four-wheel anti-lock disc brakes are now on all Grand Cherokee 	models, replacing the disc/drum combinations.<BR>

       Highland Park, Mich. -- </B>	HIGHLAND PARK, Mich. -- Imagine what a college classroom would be like far into the future.  Chrysler Corporation did just that when it produced &quot;<B>2168: New Plateau</B>,&quot; the commercial for the new 1995 Chrysler Cirrus, targeted to African Americans.<BR>
	&quot;The Cirrus commercial subtly invites viewers to experience the technology of the 22nd century while watching an intergalactic student in her history class learn about the innovative technological advances of a 1995 'vintage' automobile,&quot;  said Ken Laurence, Chrysler-Plymouth National Advertising Manager.<BR>
	&quot;<B>2168: New Plateau</B>&quot; relates specific automobile attributes with contemporary and cultural cues of the African-American consumer market.  Featured in the spot is recording artists Blackgirl, a vocal trio who sing in the tradition of well-known R &amp; B groups of the 70's, yet with a distinctive, contemporary style of their own.<BR>
	&quot;The Chrysler Cirrus is the four-door sophisticated answer to transportation for African-American heads of households,&quot; said Edward Boyd, Chrysler Corporation's Account Director at Don Coleman &amp; Associates, Inc.  &quot;The styling of the <BR>
Cirrus will prove to be a viable <BR>
alternative for current and previous <BR>

       Auburn Hills, Mich. -- </B>Chrysler Corporation is notifying 35,000 owners of some 1991, 1992, and 1993 Cummins diesel engine-powered Dodge Ram pickups to have Dodge dealers inspect the fuel injection pump. <BR>
	Investigation and analysis of fuel pumps involved in reports of loss of engine speed control determined that the fulcrum lever pin, which controls fuel flow,  failed from fatigue.  This condition may allow increased fuel flow and engine speed.  (Vehicle speed can be reduced by braking.)  The pumps involved were produced between March 1991 and September 1991.  The fuel pumps are manufactured by Bosch.   <BR>
	In addition, some 1991, 1992 and 1993 trucks may have had a suspect fuel pump installed during warranty service.  These trucks are included in the notification.<BR>
	There has been one accident and no injuries reported related to this condition.<BR>

<P><center><PRTitle><B>CHRYSLER FORGES SERVICE TRAINING PARTNERSHIP WITH ATCON</B></PRTitle><BR>
<B> </B> </center><BR>
  <B> </B><P align ="left"><B><BR>
       Highland Park, Mich. -- </B>Chrysler Corporation, through its Dealership Service Development department, has forged a partnership with Applied Transportation Concepts, Inc. (ATcon) to bring advanced-level training to service managers at Chrysler dealerships across the country.<BR>
	A management consulting firm that specializes in service, parts, and body shop operations, ATcon is currently in its 11th year of operation.  Its active client base includes more than 3,000 customers, among them Toyota, Lexus and Cadillac.  <BR>
	&quot;In conversations with the other manufacturers we benchmarked, we identified the best Service Management training in the industry, and ATcon was the supplier,&quot; says Tom McRae, Manager, Dealership Service Development.  &quot;Based on what they were doing with other clients, Chrysler and ATcon sought out the best practices within the industry to help create the best professional service management training available for our dealer body.&quot;<BR>

<P>- 2 -<BR>
	Through this partnership, Chrysler will add four advanced-level courses to its dealership management education curriculum.  The ATcon series will introduce new service management techniques, including how to deploy <BR>
superior structures, operating techniques and methods for achieving Chrysler's strategic initiatives.  At the core of the training is a dual focus on customer satisfaction and service department profitability.<BR>
	According to ATcon Vice-President Terry Carlisle, the purpose of this focus is to ensure long-term viability of the service department.  &quot;If you do not make and keep customers happy, then long-term you will go out of business,&quot; says Carlisle.  &quot;If you focus only on making customers happy while neglecting your responsibility as a profit center, the end result is just as predictable.  At no time during our involvement with our clients will we attempt to separate the issues of customer satisfaction and departmental profits.  You must have satisfied customers and be profitable to survive.&quot;<BR>
	The advanced-level training program is made up of three training phases:  an orientation to the training; completion of the four training courses; and follow-up participation in performance groups for qualifying managers.<BR>
	The orientation session is designed to set the stage for training, and is recommended for both the service manager and dealer principal or general manager from each participating dealership.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>- 3 -<BR>
	In the second phase of training, service managers continue through the four, two-day sessions in the curriculum, each of which culminates in a final competency exam for certification.  Course titles and content include:<BR>
Session 1:	The Seven Controllables - Making money is not a prerogative, its a responsibility.<BR>
	Session 2:	The Evolution of Organization - Knowing all of your structural options and how they work.<BR>
Session 3:	Personnel - The employment process from hiring to firing.<BR>
Session 4:	Marketing - Beyond advertising, how to create a market approach.<BR>
	Managers who achieve certification in all four sessions will be invited to participate in performance groups, with the third phase of the training scheduled to start in the Spring of 1996.  According to McRae, these groups are designed to help service managers track performance, compare strategies, and continue the evolution of the service department in peer groups.  As a form of long-range follow-up and growth, each performance group formed will meet three times annually, led by an ATcon facilitator.<BR>
	Pilot tests of the program with select service managers concluded in November.  According to McRae, feedback from the pilot participants was &quot;overwhelmingly&quot; positive.  We are looking forward to the official rollout of the orientation sessions in all 25 zones in early 1995.<BR>

<P><center><PRTitle><B>CHRYSLER UNVEILS AN ALL-NEW SEBRING --<BR>
A NEW AMERICAN CLASSIC CONVERTIBLE</B></PRTitle><BR>
<B> </B> </center><BR>
  <B> </B><P align ="left"><B><BR>
       Pebble Beach, Ca -- </B>  Chrysler Corporation today took the wraps off its newest vehicle, the all-new 1996 Chrysler Sebring Convertible.<BR>
	New from the ground up, the Chrysler Sebring is a true four-seat convertible.  Now, even rear seat passengers will be able to enjoy top-down excitement without the discomfort normally associated with convertible automobiles.  Due to its cab-forward architecture, the Sebring Convertible has excellent visibility, outstanding interior room and a spacious trunk.<BR>
	&quot;I believe the Chrysler Sebring will redefine the convertible segment,&quot; said John Herlitz, Chrysler Vice President - Product Design, &quot;not only because of its stunning appearance, but because it possesses what we call 'functional luxury' -- comfort features that improve a vehicle's usefulness, rather than simply for the sake of adding bells and whistles.&quot;<BR>
	Chrysler has a rich history of building classic convertibles:  the Chrysler Imperial convertible sedan in the 1930s, the famous wood-sided Town &amp; Country convertible in the 1940s, the luxurious New Yorker convertible in the 1950s and the incomparable Chrysler 300 convertibles from the late '50s through the early '70s.<BR>
(32795-S)<BR>
-more-<BR>
-2-<BR>

<P>	Chrysler continued its streak of convertible leadership during the 1980s and early '90s with several LeBaron models, the best-selling convertible in the last decade.	&quot;The challenge for the new Sebring Convertible is to re-establish the benchmark,&quot; said Herlitz. &quot;We are again defining the classic American convertible in terms of design and packaging, engineering, safety, value and driving enjoyment.&quot;<BR>
	Unlike virtually every convertible in the world, the Chrysler Sebring Convertible is not a modified coupe.  Because Sebring was designed from the outset to be a convertible, it exhibits outstanding balance and body rigidity.<BR>
	The Sebring Convertible will be available in two models -- JX and the top-of-the-line JXi.  The Sebring JX will be powered by a 2.4 liter, 150 horsepower four-cylinder engine.  The JXi will be driven by a 164 horsepower, 2.5 liter V-6.  Both engines are mated to four-speed automatic transmissions.<BR>
	&quot;The Sebring Convertible is the continuation of Chrysler Corporation's revolutionary approach of not simply offering replacement vehicles to the market, but of leapfrogging established products,&quot; concluded Herlitz, <BR>
	The Chrysler Sebring Convertible will reach Chrysler-Plymouth dealers in the spring of 1996.<BR>

<B> </B> </center><BR>
  <B> </B><P align ="left"><B><BR>
       Highland Park, Mich. -- </B> Dodge Division of the Chrysler Corporation topped one million sales (U.S. market) for the 1994 model year today, breaking the barrier with almost two weeks to go in the model year.  <BR>
	Thanks to model year records from Dodge Ram, Intrepid and Viper, along with another strong year from America's top-selling minivan, Dodge Caravan (up two percent), and the debut of the Neon, Dodge broke the million sales mark for the first time in five years (1,021,718 in 1989). <BR>
	Dodge model year sales are running 11 percent ahead of 1993, with an industry share of 6.9 percent, 0.1 percent below its all-time high set in 1976.<BR>

<P><center><PRTitle><B>BATTERY ADVANCEMENTS AND INFRASTRUCTURE <BR>
KEY TO EVS FUTURE</B></PRTitle><BR>
<B> </B> </center><BR>
  <B> </B><P align ="left"><B><BR>
       Anaheim, Ca -- </B>The biggest roadblock facing the commercial success of electric vehicles will be consumers disappointed by poor driving range and the lack of viable recharging infrastructure, said Francois J. Castaing, Chrysler vice president of Vehicle Engineering.<BR>
	Speaking at the 12th International Electric Vehicle Symposium at the Disneyland Hotel and Convention Center, Castaing said that without a battery technology breakthrough and a serious push for refueling infrastructure, &quot;we run the risk of introducing a product in a poor state of development and create a situation that gives (EVs) a bad name, effectively slowing marketplace acceptance.&quot;<BR>
	Chrysler, which has been building EVs for about two years, will be able to  produce an electric vehicle in time for the 1998 Zero Emission Vehicle (ZEV) mandate.  He noted, however, that Chrysler is concerned that it has not been able to secure what it considers a commercially suitable battery for the vehicle.  <BR>
	&quot;Despite the considerable efforts of the United States Battery Consortium, the Department of Energy and National Laboratories, dozens of battery manufacturers and many others, no supplier has been able to sign-up for production of a mid-term battery that meets our production timing,&quot; Castaing said.<BR>
	Castaing emphasized that in the near-term, any measures that can be developed to remove the cost burden of the battery from consumers would be a place to start.  <BR>

<P>-more-<BR>
(50594-S)<BR>
	-2-<BR>

<P>	&quot;Removing the battery from the cost and pricing formula for consumer would be a significant step (toward marketability),&quot; Castaing explained.  &quot;Battery leasing programs, ownership of batteries by utility companies, or other subsidies need to be explored.&quot;<BR>
	Refueling infrastructure is also a key Chrysler concern.<BR>
	&quot;Since the mandate is imminent, we must maximize all the variables to ease EVs into the marketplace, &quot; Castaing continued.  &quot;This means real refueling infrastructure must be in place by 1998 if we are to have any chance of being successful.  This is an element that is out of Chrysler's control.<BR>
	&quot;With only a couple of years until the mandate, we have not heard when charging stations will be available and we understand that there are open issues regarding...the installation of even the home charging plugs,&quot; Castaing explained.<BR>
	He added that Chrysler's recent sales experience with Methanol and Compressed Natural Gas vehicles has proven that simply building the vehicle for the market will not automatically bring viable infrastructure.  &quot;This is a case where we acted on the assumption and promise that if we would build the vehicle, the fueling stations would soon follow.  Unfortunately, our potential fleet customers have responded that they are not completely comfortable with the refueling situation at this time, which has resulted in sales below our production capacities.&quot;<BR>
	Castaing said Chrysler's future electric vehicle, code-named the NS-electric, will be assembled in current Chrysler facilities and will be based on a next-generation version of its best-selling minivan, utilizing an AC powertrain supplied by Westinghouse.<BR>
 	&quot;(The vehicle) is something we understand and feel is our most manageable task in meeting the mandates,&quot; Castaing said.  &quot;We're most concerned about the battery itself because it directly relates to the vehicle's performance for the customer.&quot;<BR>

<P>-more-<BR>

<P>-3-<BR>

<P>	Castaing added that Chrysler is currently testing advanced lead acid batteries which are close to the USABC mid-term cost targets, but are not close to the range and performance goals.  Tooling and engineering work to fit the advanced lead-acid batteries to the NS-electric are now underway.  <BR>
	The advanced lead-acid batteries are demonstrating about 60 miles of usable range in optimal weather conditions.  By contrast, Castaing said prototypes of nickel-metal hydride batteries being tested by Chrysler are providing about 80-90 miles of range.<BR>
	&quot;This leaves us with the problem of introducing a nicely refined and attractive minivan that will have the equivalent of two-to-three gallons of gasoline range and will take eight to 12 hours to fill,&quot; he said.  &quot;But still, we are hopeful for the best battery possible and we will buy that battery whenever it becomes commercially viable.&quot;<BR>
	Chrysler was the first manufacturer to receive a ZEV certification for a fully safety certified production electric vehicle with its TEVan electric minivan in 1993.  About 50 of the vehicles have been sold to utility companies around the country over the last two years, Castaing said.<BR>

<P><center><PRTitle><B>CHRYSLER UNVEILS PLANS FOR A <BR>
NEW AMERICAN CLASSIC CONVERTIBLE</B></PRTitle><BR>
<B> </B> </center><BR>
  <B> </B><P align ="left"><B><BR>
       Chicago, Il -- </B>Chrysler, long an industry sales leader in convertible automobiles,  announced plans to introduce an all-new model later this year -- the 1996 Chrysler Sebring JX convertible.  The Chrysler-Plymouth Division of Chrysler Corporation revealed a rendering and announced the name of the new car today at the Chicago Auto Show.<BR>
	The Chrysler Sebring JX, an all-new Chrysler vehicle platform, is designed from the ground up to be a convertible -- not an altered coupe -- and as such will offer outstanding passenger room and body rigidity.<BR>
	Convertible automobiles were a common part of the American motoring landscape until the early seventies, when they gradually disappeared.  About a decade later, in 1982, Chrysler virtually reinvented the convertible market with the introduction of several small, fuel efficient, affordable convertibles, including the Chrysler LeBaron.<BR>
	But it was the second-generation LeBaron convertible, introduced in 1987, that single-handedly re-defined what a convertible for the eighties would be -- stylish, roomy, safe and affordable.  In fact, in 1989, at the height of its popularity, more than 46,000 Chrysler LeBaron convertibles were sold in a single year.<BR>
(06595-S)	-more-<BR>

<P>-2-<BR>
	The introduction of the Sebring JX convertible signifies a complete renewal of every Chrysler-branded product since the introduction of the Chrysler Concorde in 1993.  Since the Concorde, Chrysler has introduced the LHS, New Yorker and Cirrus sedans, the Sebring Coupe and the upcoming new Town &amp; Country minivan. 	<BR>
	&quot;The new Chrysler Sebring JX continues the string of new Chrysler products. In addition to assisting in the evolution of the Chrysler brand, the Sebring JX  will once again redefine the classic American convertible,&quot; said Steven A. Torok, General Manager of the Chrysler-Plymouth Division.  &quot;I can assure you that there will be nothing quite like it in the marketplace.  Chrysler has developed a reputation of bringing fresh approaches to established car segments.  Likewise, the Sebring JX won't be a 'me too' kind of car.  I believe it will set a new standard by which future convertibles are judged.&quot;<BR>
	The new Chrysler Sebring JX convertible takes Chrysler's signature cab-forward design to a new level, allowing for vehicle packaging never before seen in a convertible automobile.<BR>
	&quot;The car possesses a fresh and aggressive cab forward appearance that provides greatly improved interior space and usable trunk volume,&quot; added John E. Herlitz, Vice President - Product Design.<BR>
	&quot;And, if you detect more than a hint of Chrysler 300 heritage in the grille design and graphics, I can assure you that the coincidence is purely intentional!<BR>
	&quot;It's an exciting new car that will open the next chapter of Chrysler's continuing convertible excellence.&quot;<BR>

<P>(more)<BR>
-3-<BR>
	&quot;No longer will convertible-driving enjoyment be limited to the front-seat passengers,&quot; said Joe Caddell, General Product Manager - Small Car Platform.  &quot;The Sebring JX is a true four-seater.  It provides the design and the fun-to-drive excitement of a convertible, plus the spaciousness for four adults.  The unique Sebring JX successfully combines high-style with functionality.&quot;<BR>
	The 1996 Chrysler Sebring JX convertible will reach Chrysler-Plymouth <BR>

<P>showrooms late this fall.<BR>

       Highland Park, Mich. -- </B> Hundreds of thousands of miles make up the off-highway and four-wheel-drive trails that stretch across the nation's land. <BR>
	Maintaining the quality of that land must be the highest priority of every sport utility driver.<BR>
	&quot;Nature has a wonderful way of awakening the senses,&quot; says Mike Kane, Jeep&reg; Marketing Manager.  &quot;But when you venture beyond the paved road, be sure your sense of responsibility gets turned on as well.&quot;<BR>
	Jeep is a founding member of &quot;Tread Lightly!&quot;, a non-profit organization designed to promote off-highway use ethics and practices.<BR>
	&quot;Our message is simple -- use common sense and stay off unmarked trails,&quot; Kane said.  &quot;To reinforce this, we only show our Jeep products in settings that include an approved road or trail.&quot;<BR>
	The &quot;Tread Lightly!&quot; pledge can be easily summarized:<BR>
	<B>T</B>ravel only where motorized vehicles are permitted--never blaze your own trail.<BR>
	<B>R</B>espect the rights of hikers, skiers, campers and others to enjoy their activities 						<BR>
		undisturbed.<BR>

<P>		<B>E</B>ducate yourself by obtaining travel maps and regulations from public agencies, 		complying with signs and barriers and asking owners' permission to cross 		private property.<BR>
	<B>A</B>void streams, lakeshores, meadows, muddy roads and trails, steep hillsides, 		wildlife and livestock.<BR>
	<B>D</B>rive responsibly to protect the environment and preserve opportunities to enjoy 		your vehicle on wildlands.<BR>
	&quot;We made a long-standing effort to be environmentally responsible, long before it became politically correct to do so,&quot; added Kane.  &quot;Endorsing `Tread Lightly!' makes perfect sense to us at Jeep.&quot;<BR>

CHRYSLER INCREASES QUARTERLY DIVIDEND;<BR>
PLANS TO ACCELERATE PENSION PLAN FUNDING</B></PRTitle><BR>
<B> </B> </center><BR>
  <B> </B><P align ="left"><B><BR>
       Toledo, Oh -- </B> Chrysler Corporation today announced that its Board of Directors has voted to increase its quarterly dividend from $0.20 to $0.25 per share on the Company's common stock.  The dividend is payable July 15, 1994, to shareholders of record on June 15, 1994.<BR>
	Addressing shareholders at the Company's Annual Shareholders Meeting in Toledo, Ohio today, Chrysler Chairman Robert J. Eaton also disclosed that Chrysler's Board approved a new objective to fully fund its pension liability by the end of this year.<BR>
	&quot;We had not planned to increase the dividend again this quickly, or to fully fund our pension obligations this year,&quot; Eaton continued.  &quot;But because of our strong cash flow and what looks like a continued strong auto market and general economy, we believe these actions are warranted.&quot;<BR>
	At the end of 1993, Chrysler had $4.5 billion in cash.  At the end of the first quarter that had grown to $5.9 billion.<BR>

<P>-more-<BR>
(17594)<BR>
	-2-<BR>

<P>	With the dividend increase announced today, Chrysler's common stock dividend has increased by 67 percent in the past six months.<BR>
	The Board of Directors also declared a dividend of $1.15625 per share on the Chrysler 4.625 percent depositary shares, each representing 1/10 share of Series A convertible preferred stock.  The preferred stock dividend is payable July 15, 1994, to shareholders of record on June 15, 1994.<BR>
	At the end of 1992, Chrysler's unfunded pension liability stood at $3.9 billion.  It was $2.2 billion at the end of 1993.  During the first quarter of this year, an additional $700 million was put into the fund.<BR>
	Chrysler's credit rating has also seen substantial improvement over the last year.  Twelve months ago Chrysler was not rated investment grade.  Today, Standard and Poors rates Chrysler BBB+, the highest rating from S&amp;P since November 1975.  And last week Fitch upgraded Chrysler to an A- rating.  	&quot;These are aggressive actions we have taken today, but they indicate the level of confidence we have in ourselves, the strength of the automotive market and the overall economy,&quot; Eaton said.<BR>
	&quot;We demonstrated our confidence in the future earlier this year when we announced plans to spend $1.8 billion to add assembly and powertrain capacity that will improve Chrysler's maximum worldwide production capacity by some 500,000 units to approximately 3.5 million vehicles a year by 1996.<BR>

<P>-more-<BR>

<P>-3-<BR>

<P>	&quot;Chrysler has never been in such a strong financial position as it is today...never had the kind of product acceptance it has today...never had the cost discipline, the balance sheet, the organizational strength, the product development ability, or the product quality that it does today.<BR>
	&quot;But maybe more importantly, it has never had a stronger commitment to improve itself in every way than we do today.   We don't ever plan to lose that focus.&quot;<BR>

<B> </B> </center><BR>
  <B> </B><P align ="left"><B><BR>
       Highland Park, Mich. -- </B>Chrysler Corporation today announced 1993 fourth quarter and calendar year results.  These results represent records in:<BR>
	 Pre-tax earnings for any quarter of $1,224 million, surpassing the previous record of $1,122 million in the second quarter of 1993.  The comparable fourth quarter 1992 result was $646 million.<BR>
	 Net earnings for any fourth quarter of $777 million surpassing the previous record of $607 million in the fourth quarter of 1984.  The comparable fourth quarter 1992 result was $356 million.<BR>
	 Pre-tax earnings for any year of $3,838 million, surpassing the previous record of $2,417 million in the 1984 calendar year.  The comparable 1992 pre-tax earnings were $934 million. <BR>
	 Total sales and revenues for any quarter of $12.0 billion, surpassing the previous record of $11.0 billion in the second quarter of 1993.  The comparable fourth quarter 1992 result was $10.2 billion.<BR>
	 Total sales and revenues for any year of $43.6 billion, surpassing the previous record of $36.9 billion in 1992.<BR>
Fourth quarter primary earnings per share was $2.11 as compared to $1.12 for the fourth quarter of 1992.<BR>
(02194)	(more)<BR>

<P>- 2 -<BR>
	Included in the 1993 pre-tax earnings are gains on the sales of Mitsubishi Motors Corporation (MMC) stock and Acustar's plastics operations totalling $265 million.  Pre-tax earnings for 1992 included a $142 million gain on a sale of MMC stock, a $(110) million loss on Chrysler Canada, Ltd. investments and a $(101) million charge for the restructuring of Chrysler's car rental operations.  <BR>
	In fourth quarter 1993, Chrysler adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 112, Employers' Accounting for Postemployment Benefits.  The new standard requires the accrual of benefits provided to former or inactive employees after employment but prior to retirement.  Adoption of this accounting standard, effective January 1, 1993, resulted in an after-tax charge of, and the restatement of first quarter 1993 net results by, $(283) million.<BR>
	The net loss for calendar year 1993 was $(2,551) million, or $(7.62) per primary common share, and included the previously announced $(4,683) million charge for retiree health care (OPEB) and the $(283) million charge for postemployment benefits.  Net earnings for 1992 were $723 million, or $2.21 per primary common share, and included a favorable effect for an accounting change for taxes totalling $218 million.<BR>
	Chrysler Chairman Robert J. Eaton said:<BR>
  	&quot;A lot of very good things happened at Chrysler in 1993.  In fact, it was an exceptional year.  We successfully launched the Chrysler New Yorker and LHS, Dodge Ram pickup truck and Dodge/Plymouth Neon.  The quality of our vehicles continued to improve and we had record sales in many segments of the market.<BR>

<P>(more)<BR>

<P>- 3 -<BR>
	&quot;Volumes and margins were up for the year while incentive costs were lower.  Our pre-tax (automotive) profit per vehicle averaged $1,335 in 1993 and $1,727 in the fourth quarter.  In addition, we successfully negotiated equitable contracts with the UAW and CAW and the rating agencies have shown their confidence by returning us to investment grade.<BR>
	&quot;But right now our priority is keeping up the momentum and not to dwell on our accomplishments.  We have to remain focused and work hard to refine our processes -- this has become a way of life for us.<BR>
	&quot;The economic recovery in the United States continues at a slow pace, and our balance sheet still is not where we want it to be.  We remain committed to generating on-going cost reductions.  So, despite the achievements in 1993, we still have major challenges ahead of us for 1994 and beyond.&quot;<BR>
	The 1993 highlights include:<BR>
	 Chrysler's share of the North American car and truck market stood at 14.8 percent, compared to 13.4 percent for 1992 -- a 1.4 percentage point increase.<BR>
	 Retail unit sales of cars and trucks in the United States and Canada were 2,274,641 compared to 1,918,083 in 1992 -- a 19 percent increase.<BR>
	 Worldwide factory unit sales were 2,475,738 compared to 2,175,447 in 1992 -- a 14 percent increase.<BR>
	 International retail sales of 105,849 units were up 45 percent over 1992.  In Europe, Chrysler sold 60,683 vehicles, an increase of 35 percent over 1992 in a market that declined approximately 18 percent.<BR>
	(more)<BR>
- 4 -<BR>

<P>	In the first quarter of 1993, Chrysler's net loss was $(4,436) million, or $(13.68) per primary common share, including the OPEB charge and the retroactive charge for postemployment benefits.  In the second quarter of 1993, the company announced net earnings of $685 million, or $1.86 per primary common share.  The 1993 third quarter net earnings were $423 million, or $1.13 per primary common share.<BR>
	Chrysler Financial Corporation (CFC) reported 1993 net earnings of $129 million, compared to $231 million earned in 1992.  One-time accounting principle changes included in CFC's net earnings for 1993 and 1992 were a $(30) million charge for retiree health care and postemployment benefits and a $51 million favorable adjustment for a change in a tax accounting principle, respectively.<BR>

RICHARD PETTY RETURNS TO THE FOLD<BR>
AND TOP 1995 INDEPENDENT GETS FACTORY SUPPORT<BR>
</B></PRTitle><BR>
<B> </B> </center><BR>
  <B> </B><P align ="left"><B><BR>
       Highland Park, Mich. -- </B> King Richard Petty, legendary stock car driver, and businessman David Gandy  as Petty/Gandy Motorsports  will be one of the factory race teams in 1996 to run the Dodge Ram 1500 in the NASCAR SuperTruck series.  Petty has a rich history with the Chrysler Corporation, winning most of his 200 NASCAR races in the late 1960's and early 70's driving for Dodge and Plymouth.<BR>
	I am glad to be part of the team that brings the Chrysler Corporation and Dodge into NASCAR SuperTruck racing, said Petty.  Their level of support and factory involvement shows that Chrysler is serious about going racing.<BR>
	The primary sponsor for the #43 Ram pickup is the Cummins Engine Co., Inc.  The Group Vice President of Marketing for Cummins, C. Roberto Cordaro adds, Chrysler is one of Cummins largest customers.  We have enjoyed a close relationship with them since the introduction of Cummins engines as an option in the Dodge Ram pickup.  We look forward to continuing this relationship both on and off the track.<BR>
(38095)	(more)<BR>

<P>-2-<BR>
	The driver selection for the team is underway.<BR>
	Grier Lackey has spent most of his life around racing.  As the factory team chosen to run the #30 Team Mopar Dodge Ram pickup for the NASCAR SuperTruck series in 1996, he will again find himself in the thick of competition.<BR>
	Owner of Grandaddy Racing, Inc., Lackey ran the Ram pickup as an independent team in 1995, with respectable successes against the factory-backed competition.  The top-rated short-track driver and 1992 Winston Cup Rookie of the Year Jimmy Hensley will drive the #30 Ram pickup in 1996.<BR>
	The primary sponsor for the truck will be the Mopar Parts Division of Chrysler.  Notes Larry Baker, General Manager - Mopar Parts Division, Mopar has been there all along as part of the team with the right parts and engineering support.  In fact, in the past few years alone weve developed a whole series of race blocks and heads for a variety of short track events  basic race pieces that apply directly to this SuperTruck effort.  This gives us a real running start.<BR>

AFTER SIX EXCITING SEASONS</B></PRTitle><BR>
<B> </B> </center><BR>
  <B> </B><P align ="left"><B><BR>
       Highland Park, Mich. -- </B> Dodge announced today that it will discontinue its sponsorship of the International Race of Champions (IROC) series at the conclusion of the 1995 season.  The July 29 race at Michigan International Speedway will be the final IROC race for the Dodge Avenger.<BR>
	&quot;We had a great run in Dodge IROC,&quot; said Dodge General Manager Marty Levine.  &quot;Our six years with IROC gave us a great opportunity to show the 'New Dodge' to millions of racing enthusiasts.&quot;  <BR>
	While race fans will remember Dodge's tenure in IROC for its record-setting speeds and down-to-the-wire finishes, the series may have served its greatest role for the Dodge brand in helping it introduce the Avenger sport coupe.  Many months before the public introduction of the production Avenger, the race version made its debut in the first Dodge IROC race of the 1994 season in Daytona Beach, Fla..  After racing it for the entire 1994 season, Dodge unveiled the production Avenger at the final race to a crowd that was by then well aware of the vehicle from its IROC success.<BR>
	&quot;As we move on in our business and explore other potential opportunities in racing, we will look back fondly on the IROC series and the opportunity it gave us to show the excitement of Dodge in such a great light,&quot; Levine said.<BR>

1994 DODGE RAM AND 1995 PLYMOUTH/DODGE NEON <BR>
EARN POPULAR MECHANICS &quot;DESIGN &amp; ENGINEERING AWARD&quot;</B></PRTitle><BR>
<B> </B> </center><BR>
  <B> </B><P align ="left"><B><BR>
       Highland Park, Mich. -- </B>  The 1994 Dodge Ram full-size pickup truck and 1995 Plymouth/Dodge Neon received &quot;Design and Engineering Awards&quot; from <U>Popular Mechanics</U> magazine for outstanding achievement in the automotive field, and are featured in the magazine's January 1994 issue.<BR>
	&quot;The Ram pickup breaks new ground in technology with standard driver's side air bag and available four-wheel antilock brakes.  Couple that technology to the bold new big-truck front end styling and the Ram truly sits apart from the rest of the pickup crowd,&quot; said <U>Popular Mechanics</U> Editor-in-Chief Joe Oldham.<BR>
	&quot;We recognize Neon for new efficiencies realized in the car's development process, costing millions less from concept to Job One compared to other new cars.  It is a classic example of American ingenuity meeting its overseas competition head on,&quot; Oldham added.<BR>
	The products were selected by the magazine's editors from thousands of nominations in eight categories: automotive, science and technology, electronics,  photography, home improvement, boating, outdoors, and telecommunications.<BR>
	The Ram's success has been validated with 14 commendations from magazines and more than 151,000 dealer orders -- or 75 percent of the plant's 1994 model year capacity. Ram production began this past July at the Dodge City Truck Assembly Plant in Warren, Mich.  <BR>
	The 1995 model Neon, Chrysler's all-new small car entry, is rivaling the Ram's early success with more than 57,000 total orders in the first two weeks that the cars have been on sale, which includes sales to Canada, product evaluation, fleet and fast feedback rental programs.  Neon has already received six honors, including &quot;Automobile of the Year.&quot;  Production began November 1 at the Belvidere (Ill.) Assembly Plant. 	<BR>

JEEP&reg; KICKS-OFF 1995 JAMBOREE EVENTS<BR>

  <B> </B><P align ="left"><B><BR>
       Highland Park, Mich. -- </B> If you appreciate the thought of roaming freely on a ranch ... traversing canyon trails ... exploring landmarks of the gold fever age ... navigating an original Native American footpath ... climbing a mule trail formerly used by prospectors ... or winding your way past pre-Revolutionary homes, historic markers and a cave used by pioneers as a church, Jeep&reg; has something that will likely interest you -- we call it Jamboree.<BR>
	&quot;Jeep Jamborees are weekend adventures exclusively for Jeep owners in seldom-seen, hard-to-reach places -- locations Jeep Wrangler, Cherokee and Grand Cherokee were meant to go,&quot; said Mike Kane, Jeep Marketing Manager.  <BR>
	&quot;They involve responsible off-highway driving for both inexperienced and experienced drivers over spectacular terrain,&quot; added Kane.  &quot;They combine the personality and charm of the people and landmarks that make it unique, to create an event that must truly be experienced to be appreciated.&quot;  <BR>
	The 1995 Jeep Jamboree events kicked-off in February and will run through October.  Jamborees involve participants taking Jeep vehicles &quot;off-highway&quot; and on trails for two- to three-day periods in various scenic locations around the country.  Levels of difficulty vary, depending on the location.<BR>
	Cost to participate is $165 per adult, $85 for children age 7 to 14, $55 for children age 3 through 7, and free for children under 2.  Meals are included.<BR>

       Highland Park, Mich. -- </B><B> </B>In a unique program to recognize the importance of design in industry and commerce, Chrysler has revealed plans for the second annual Innovation In Design Awards.<BR>
	Program co-chairs Chee Pearlman, editor of <U>I.D.</U>, and Michael Sorkin, principal of the Michael Sorkin Studio, announced the panel of judges for the 1994 competition, which will be concluded with an awards presentation ceremony on July 28, at the Pacific Design Center in Los Angeles.  <BR>
	In addition to Pearlman and Sorkin, this year's panel includes: J. Max Bond, Jr., AIA, a partner of Davis, Brody &amp; Associates; David M. Kelley, California entrepreneur, educator, engineer and venture capitalist; William J. Mitchell, Professor of Architecture and Media Arts and Sciences and Dean of the School of Architecture and Planning at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology; Eric Owen Moss, FAIA, celebrated author, lecturer and architect currently working on projects in Spain and France; Lorraine Wild, a member of the faculty and former Director of the Program in Graphic Design at California Institute of the Arts, and a partner in Reverb design, Los Angeles. <BR>

<P><B>(12194)</B>	<B>-more-</B><BR>

<P>- 2 -<BR>

<P>	Representing Chrysler Corporation on the 1994 panel of judges is Trevor M. Creed, Director - Jeep/Truck and Interior Design, responsible for directing interior and exterior designs for Jeep/Truck programs and overseeing the design for all future passenger cars, including interior, trim fabric and color, and exterior body colors. <BR>
	More than 100 designers and design companies in the fields of architecture, industrial and product design and graphic design, were nominated for the 1993 award by some of the top members in the design community.  Judges graded the entries on such criteria as technological benefit, beauty and accessibility to a diverse range of people.<BR>
	Last year's awards went to two companies -- Apple (for its Industrial Design Group) and Cross Colours clothing; a design team -- Ellen Lupton and J. Abbot Miller; and three individuals -- John Hejduk, Dr. Paul J. MacCready and Gaetano Pesce.  The winners each received the Chrysler Innovation In Design Award -- a crystal prism designed by Tiffany -- and $10,000,  in ceremonies held at the Smithsonian Institute's Cooper-Hewitt Museum.<BR>
	The Innovation In Design Award program was developed by Chrysler-Plymouth Division of Chrysler Corporation, in conjunction with Bozell Worldwide Advertising, to recognize the country's &quot;forward-looking, socially engaged designs and designers.&quot;<BR>

  <B> </B><P align ="left"><B><BR>
       Highland Park, Mich. -- </B>Covering the sport utility vehicle market as no other manufacturer can, the Jeep&reg; brand continues its strong presence in the 1994 model year with three unique models for the customer looking for performance, durability, luxury and versatility.<BR>
	Led by the upscale Grand Cherokee, augmented by the affordably priced and classic Cherokee, plus the icon of driving fun and outdoor adventure, the Wrangler, Jeep is well-positioned to satisfy any buyer.<BR>
	Grand Cherokee, a powerhouse with the only V-8 engine and driver's side air bag in a compact sport utility, takes a significant safety-related step by adding rear seat headrests and front and rear door beams for occupant protection in side impact situations.  The door beams are also included in the 1994 Jeep Cherokee, which also incorporates increased roof crush resistance.<BR>
	Grand Cherokee also now provides four-wheel disc brakes standard on its Limited model, as well as anti-lock brakes.  The Laredo model now comes with a host of additional standard equipment, including power windows and door locks, and upgraded wheels and tires.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>(09294)	- more - <BR>

<P>- 2 -<BR>
	The entry level Grand Cherokee has been renamed SE and also upgraded with the features customers indicated they wanted most.  <BR>
	The Grand Wagoneer model has been discontinued to allow increased capacity for expanded production of Grand Cherokee Laredo and Grand Cherokee Limited models.	<BR>
	The original Cherokee, in its 11th model year, offers an increased performance torque converter with its 4.0-liter, 6-cylinder &quot;power Tech Six&quot; engine.<BR>
	A 3-speed automatic transmission is available with the 2.5-liter, 4-cylinder engine on Wrangler for the first time.<BR>
	In addition, both Cherokee and Wrangler add a center high-mounted stop light as an easily visible safety alert to following vehicles.<BR>
	By mid-year, Cherokee and Wrangler also will receive the ozone-preserving refrigerant, R-134A, for air conditioning systems.  Grand Cherokee was introduced with R-134A in the 1993 model year.<BR>
	Cherokee continues to offer the right-hand drive rural postal carrier vehicles in the four-wheel-drive configuration, but will add a two-wheel-drive version for 1994.<BR>

 TO CREATE `SIZEABLE' FLEET MARKET<BR>

<B> </B> </center><BR>
  <B> </B><P align ="left"><B><BR>
       Highland Park, Mich. -- </B>  A &quot;fairly sizeable&quot; fleet market will evolve for compressed natural gas vehicles (CNG) as a result of Chrysler Corporation's being recognized by the state of California as the first company to reach the lowest emission status possible to date for natural gas-powered vehicles.<BR>
	The Chrysler vehicles -- the 1994 Dodge Caravan, Caravan C/V, and Plymouth Voyager -- are the first to be certified by California Air Resources Board (CARB) as Ultra Low Emission Vehicles (ULEV).  The only cleaner burning vehicles on the market today are electric vehicles.  Last year the full-size CNG Dodge Ram Van and Wagon were certified by California as the first Low Emission Vehicles (LEV).<BR>
	There are currently 75 CNG refueling stations in Southern California and more than 600 will be added to the region by the year 2000.  A majority of the existing stations have been built by Southern California Gas Company, which has led the charge with Chrysler to help create an infrastructure for CNG vehicles.  <BR>
	A. Michel Clement, Chrysler's manager of alternative fuel vehicle sales and marketing, estimates Chrysler can sell 2,000 CNG minivans in 1994.  In 1993, Chrysler sold about 50 electric vehicles, 445 CNG vans and 5,432 vehicles that can run on a methanol-gas mixture.  <BR>

<P>- 2 -<BR>

<P>	&quot;With significant incentives and certain tax exemptions, it's going to create a fairly sizeable market,&quot; Clement said.  &quot;CNG vehicles are one more viable solution to our air management problems.&quot;<BR>
	Chrysler is scheduled to launch similar programs in the San Francisco-Sacramento area, New York City and in the Baltimore-Washington, D.C. corridor by the end of April.<BR>
	The incentives virtually eliminate the added cost of producing CNG vehicles.  The manufacturer's suggested retail price will be about $22,000 for CNG minivans and $17,400 to $26,200 for full-size vans.  <BR>
		The incentives include $1,750 from SoCal; a $500 fleet purchase incentive for minivans and $2,000 for full-size vans from Chrysler; a federal income tax deduction of $2,000 per vehicle and a state sales tax exemption for the incremental cost of operating a certified, low-emissions vehicle.<BR>
	Additional incentives with funding caps are available as well.  California Energy Commission will offer $1,500 tax credit for minivans and $1,000 for full-size vans (up to $750,000 in 1994).  <BR>
	Compressed natural gas is cheaper than gasoline -- about 80 cents a gallon as compared to $1.10 a gallon of gasoline.  More importantly, emissions from these CNG vehicles will be significantly less and in fact, very comparable with an electric vehicle when you include the emissions from power plants to generate the electricity.       <BR>

<P>(more)<BR>

<P>- 3 -<BR>

<P>	CNG minivans and full-size vans have a range of 160 miles city and 180 miles highway.  The CNG minivans get better mileage than their gasoline-powered counterparts, but can store only about 9 gallons of equivalent gasoline.  Current battery technology for electric vehicles can only provide a range of less than 100 miles.<BR>
	&quot;While a CNG vehicle has somewhat less range than their gasoline-powered counterpart, the performance in every day driving is virtually the same,&quot; Clement said.  &quot;Performance can be a drawback for electric vehicles and the $100,000 price tag is a big detriment.&quot;<BR>
	While somewhat limited, the 160 - 180 mile range of the CNG vehicles is enough to entice potential fleet customers, Clement said.<BR>
	&quot;Many fleet customers have a fixed driving pattern with a limited range,&quot; Clement explained.  &quot;A plumber in Los Angeles isn't likely to make a house call in San Diego!&quot;<BR>
	Target markets include shuttle vehicles for airports, van pools and military bases; delivery trucks and courier services; utility trucks; vehicles used within an assembly plant compound and service trucks for trades such as plumbers, electricians and carpenters.<BR>
	Other potential users might include environmental organizations, educational institutions, health care providers and organizations servicing children and the elderly.<BR>

       Auburn Hills, Mich. -- </B>Led by new highs for the Dodge and Jeep&reg; brands, Chrysler Corporation set a November record for sales and posted its 13th consecutive month with a year-over-year sales increase.<BR>
	<P>Chrysler's U.S. sales totaled 179,628 vehicles in November, an increase of 1 percent over last year.  With sales of 177,073, November 1995 held the previous record for the month.<BR>
	<P>&quot;Our new 1997 lineup continues to generate healthy traffic at our dealerships,&quot; said James P. Holden, Executive Vice President - Sales and Marketing.  &quot;We're especially pleased by our retail numbers -- they set a November record along with Dodge, Jeep&reg; and the company as a whole.&quot;<BR>
	<P>The Dodge Division set its 10th monthly record since the year began, with sales of 95,022.  That compares with 94,935 in November 1995, the previous record.  Sales of Jeep&reg; vehicles totaled 42,835 in November; the previous record for the month was 38,353 in 1994.<BR>
<P>Chrysler truck sales, including minivans and Jeep&reg; vehicles, totaled a record 127,527 in November, 7 percent ahead of a year ago, when sales were 118,821. Car sales were down 11 percent at 52,101, compared with 58,252 a year ago.<BR>
	<P>Chrysler sales for the calendar year through the end of November were 2,271,022 vehicles -- an increase of 14 percent from a year ago, when year-to-date sales totaled 1,986,540.<BR>
	<P>Chrysler's sales this year have shattered the company's full-year record in less than 11 months.  That 1988 record -- 2,208,057 vehicles -- fell November 22 when 1996 sales reached 2,214,289.<BR>

  <B> </B><P align ="left"><B><BR>
       Highland Park, Mich. -- </B>- Clint Eastwood and Richard Burton overcame tremendous odds in successfully completing their mission in the movie &quot;Where Eagles Dare.&quot;  In the automotive marketplace, another team of &quot;eagles&quot; are off to a thrilling start -- only this time it's the Eagle brand of Chrysler Corporation.<BR>
	&quot;Team Eagle,&quot; formed to develop a business plan to tackle the Eagle brand-building challenge, took flight this past summer with the &quot;Eagle Test Drive&quot; campaign.  <BR>
	Designed to combine the product superiority of its line-up with an integrated approach involving merchandising, advertising, public relations and the more than two thousand dealers, the &quot;Test Drive&quot; theme has already begun to generate unprecedented one-to-one dialogue between Eagle prospects, owners and dealers.<BR>
	&quot;We're reaching consumers with the Eagle message in ways we've never done before,&quot; said Ed Brust, General Manager, Jeep and Eagle Division.  &quot;We're taking our message and products right to the consumer, making it easy and fun to be a part of the Eagle experience.&quot; <BR>

<P>(42694)	(more)<BR>

<P>- 2 -<BR>

<P>	The cornerstone of the new campaign is the Eagle Information Center, where consumers can call 1-800-2 TEST EAGLE for product information and to schedule test drive appointments.  The number is utilized prominently in all Eagle marketing initiatives, including the all-new advertising campaign (with popular television talk show host Greg Kinnear) and one-to-one marketing programs, including the &quot;Eagle Talon Social Club Challenge&quot; and &quot;Eagle Encounter&quot; lunchtime programs. <BR>
	The inaugural &quot;Eagle Talon Social Club Challenge&quot; was held September 17 at Chrysler's Technology Center in Auburn Hills, Mich., giving over 450 individuals the opportunity to drive Eagle Talons through a fun and challenging autocross course. <BR>
	Event attendees also participated in &quot;Eagle-type&quot; activities, such as roller blading on the Chrysler Test Track, tennis, and live music.  The event was held in conjunction with the Sport and Social Clubs of the U.S., a sports-based and special events group organization with 60,000 members in 18 cities nationwide.  The organization brings together individuals on an informal basis through co-ed league sports and special events.<BR>
	The Eagle Encounter lunchtime programs, which begin Thursday, October 6 at Faneuil Hall in Boston and continue in Denver (October 13) and Atlanta (October 27), are also designed to bring Eagle to its target audience and build one-to-one relationships in open, outdoor settings. <BR>

<P>(more)<BR>
	- 3 -<BR>

<P>	&quot;We've been very pleased with the success of the campaign so far in establishing long-lasting, individual relationships with customers,&quot; said Brust.  &quot;The Eagle product lineup (Vision, Talon, Summit and Summit Wagon) are the best kept secrets in the industry.  We feel that's beginning to change.&quot;<BR>

IN INFORMATION HIGHWAY &quot;FAST LANE&quot;</B></PRTitle><BR>
<B> </B> </center><BR>
  <B> </B><P align ="left"><B><BR>
       Highland Park, Mich. -- </B>In the coming age of the information superhighway, the fast lane will be reserved for messages of importance.  Knowing what's important to each and every customer will assure timely and mutually beneficial dialogue.<BR>
	That's the point of &quot;Command,&quot; a state-of-the-art automated information system designed by Chrysler and scheduled for exclusive use by Chrysler and its customers beginning April 15. <BR>
	The Command database combines information provided to Chrysler by its customers and prospective customers with information available from other consumer research sources.  It has two primary objectives: to improve the level of customer service and to market products and services in a more intelligent and consumer-friendly manner.<BR>
	&quot;In a word, Command makes us smart,&quot; said Theodor R. Cunningham, Executive Vice President -- Sales and Marketing and General Manager -- Minivan Operations.  &quot;It consolidates and centralizes information that already existed in various pockets of the company -- the sales organization, customer relations, <BR>

<P>(10794)	(more)	<BR>

<P>- 2 -<BR>
marketing, or in parts and service -- and organizes it in a way that makes it<BR>
meaningful and useful to everyone.  And, as we've all learned by now, the smarter we get, the happier our customers become.&quot;<BR>
	The Command database consists of basic demographic information about Chrysler customers and prospective customers, vehicle purchase history, customer comments on their dealership experience, warranty repair information, and other information of record relevant to Chrysler's customer service and marketing efforts.<BR>
	&quot;Command is a very powerful tool that puts the customer first in terms of both its intended use and its design,&quot; Cunningham said.  <BR>
	&quot;Not only does it cut through the clutter we all expect to encounter on the information superhighway, it will actually eliminate clutter by assuring that our individual customers receive only those Chrysler messages that are important to them.&quot;  Examples include specific service information for an owner's vehicle, or product information on only those products that are likely to be of interest to a specific customer, delivered at a time when he or she is likely to be in the market for a new car or truck. &quot;By eliminating wasteful communication, we not only do away with a huge nuisance, but we can make major cost reductions which ultimately benefit both Chrysler and its customers,&quot; Cunningham added.<BR>
	By design, Command also contains the most technically advanced safeguards associated with this type of information system -- including privacy and confidentiality safeguards.  A specially-designed Command Privacy Code prohibits <BR>

<P>(more)<BR>

<P>- 3 -<BR>
altogether any access to Command by third parties, and it even places strict limitations on access within Chrysler, with Chrysler Marketing Operations as the control point.<BR>
	Command is expected to initially consolidate information from approximately eight million Chrysler customer households.  <BR>

  <B> </B><P align ="left"><B><BR>
       Los Angeles,Ca -- </B>With production planning deadlines fast approaching,  Chrysler Corporation today announced it will use the Electrosource Horizon advanced lead-acid battery in its next-generation electric minivan.<BR>
	&quot;The Horizon battery is a considerable improvement over the conventional lead-acid technology found in the market today,&quot; said Robert Feldmaier, executive engineer for Chrysler's electric minivan program.  &quot;While this is not the hoped for 'mid-term' battery technology we've been pushing for, we have great confidence in Electrosource's ability to follow through with production targets.  Clearly, Electrosource deserves considerable credit for being one of the only companies able to follow through on the challenge to mass manufacture a battery for use in an electric vehicle.&quot;   <BR>
	While there has been some movement toward manufacturing &quot;mid-term&quot; technologies such as a nickel-metal hydride battery, Feldmaier said it has become clear in the last several months that those batteries will prove too costly and too scarce to satisfy Chrysler's timing and volume needs before the 1998 Zero Emission Vehicle Mandate (ZEV).<BR>
	Feldmaier said based on the batteries available, its new electric vehicle will be limited to about 60-70 miles of range in optimal conditions.  Range will be significantly reduced with use of accessories like the air conditioner or heater, or when driven in inclement weather, or in hilly terrain.<BR>
	&quot;The range and cost issues continue to be our biggest concern,&quot; Feldmaier said.  &quot;The Horizon battery has by far the best cost picture for the near-term when compared to more experimental technologies like nickel-metal hydride.  Unfortunately, we know that even with the Horizon battery, total vehicle costs are going to be very high and very difficult to move in a mass consumer market.&quot;<BR>
(15095)	-more-<BR>

<P>-2-<BR>
	The United States Advanced Battery Consortium (USABC) &quot;mid-term&quot; goals outline a battery that would provide the minimum required performance to power a consumer-viable electric vehicle.  The goals, established by the U.S. automakers, the U.S. Department of Energy, and the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI), specify a battery that would provide about 100-125 miles of driving range at a cost of about $150 per kilowatt hour (or about $4,500 - $6,000  for a typical electric vehicle) and would last about five years.  <BR>
	Chrysler Vice President of Vehicle Engineering, Francois J. Castaing, said the battery, vehicle costs and lack of dedicated refueling infrastructure remain the biggest barriers to bringing electric vehicles to market.  <BR>
	&quot;For the last two years, we've been hearing optimistic messages about the availability of an advanced battery that would meet the mid-term battery goals of the USABC for range and cost,&quot; Castaing said.  &quot;We've waited eagerly for the manufacturer of such a battery to sign a purchase order to meet all of our cost, timing and volume needs, yet none has come to us with a current product that is within reasonable reach of  all the mid-term targets.&quot;<BR>
	With economy of scale, the Horizon battery is expected to close in on the mid-term cost targets, but will initially fall short of range targets.  It is also expected that the packs will likely need replacing in the vehicle in less than five years.   <BR>
	&quot;We're encouraged by the gains that have been made with the Horizon battery,&quot; Feldmaier said.  &quot;Considering that our first electric minivan, the TEVan, needed a very expensive nickel-cadmium battery to get about the same 70 miles of range, the Horizon is a very real accomplishment.  However, without sufficient range and with the high costs of replacing the batteries, we are concerned the resulting vehicle will not satisfy our consumers.&quot;<BR>
	Castaing said the best initial markets for the new Chrysler electric minivan will be specialized fleets until a battery breakthrough occurs.  <BR>

<P>-more-<BR>

<P>-3-<BR>
	The prospects for manufacturing and selling vehicles at the mandated volumes for 1998 are not realistic, Castaing said.<BR>
	&quot;As I've said many times, we know we can build the vehicle -- the flashlight, if you will,&quot; he explained.  &quot;Finding a lightweight, inexpensive and powerful battery remains the barrier to a mass market.  The Electrosource Horizon battery is a solid indication that we're moving forward in the right direction.  But the reality remains that our new electric vehicle will be very expensive and will have the equivalent of a two gallon gas tank that takes eight hours to fill on normal house electric current.  	&quot;But even the fueling is an issue,&quot; Castaing continued.  &quot;We've yet to hear of a developed plan for providing real refueling infrastructure in the mandated markets.  These restraints are best dealt with in experimental fleets, not consumer markets.&quot;<BR>
	On the issue of costs, Castaing added that, &quot;Chrysler is among the world's lowest cost manufacturers of automobiles.  We've taken painstaking efforts to use this expertise to control and minimize the cost of our electric minivan, such as building it on the same assembly line as our gasoline version.  Despite our considerable efforts, we know vehicle costs are going to be very high.&quot;	<BR>
	According to some studies, costs for electric vehicles in the 1998-2003 time frame will be as much as $21,000 more than a comparable gasoline car.  If all consumers in the mandated markets have to absorb that cost to make the electrics marketable, the price of an average gasoline car could increase by as much as $2,000 to subsidize the electric vehicles.<BR>

<P><center><PRTitle><B>CHRYSLER SPRINGS FORWARD WITH <BR>
BEST APRIL SALES IN COMPANY'S HISTORY</B></PRTitle><BR>
<B> </B> </center><BR>
  <B> </B><P align ="left"><B><BR>
       Highland Park, Mich. -- </B> Chrysler continues to topple monthly sales  records this spring, posting its best April in history on sales of 211,327 cars and trucks.   The new monthly mark surpasses the April 1988 record of 196,372.<BR>
	It was also Chrysler's best ever April for total truck and minivan sales.  Total truck sales of 131,522 bested the April record of 115,809 of a year ago, while minivan sales of 54,960 in the month broke the previous year's record of 51,978.  Twelve individual vehicle records were set for the month, including the best April in Chrysler history for the Dodge Caravan (28,756) and Chrysler Town &amp; Country (3,885) minivans.   <BR>
	&quot;We're running out of adjectives to describe our sales success, but our record-setting pace is continuing,&quot; said Theodor R. Cunningham, Executive Vice President - Sales and Marketing, and General Manager - Minivan Operations.  &quot;It comes down to simple logic: Keep building great cars, trucks and minivans, and people will buy them.&quot;    <BR>

<P>(16294)	- more - <BR>

<P>- 2 - <BR>
	Total vehicle sales were up 10 percent from April of 1993, while retail sales rose 14 percent, marking the 29th consecutive monthly increase in retail sales.  <BR>
	Total truck sales climbed 14 percent from a year ago.  Truck retail sales jumped 16 percent from 1993 numbers. <BR>
	Car sales of 79,805 represented the best April in five years.  Total car sales rose five percent, with retail sales increasing 11 percent over 1993.<BR>
	Along with the April records for Dodge Caravan and Chrysler Town &amp; Country, Dodge Ram (19,740 in April), Intrepid (12,174) and Viper (210); Chrysler Concorde (6,166), LHS (3,551) and New Yorker (1,947); and Jeep Grand Cherokee (19,744) and Wrangler (7,569) set monthly marks.  In addition, Neon sales of 16,034 increased 20 percent from March, with dealer orders running at over 134,000 units.<BR>
	&quot;The `doom-and-gloomers' and `naysayers' can pontificate all they want about what they believe is a declining auto industry, but the truth is in the numbers.  Chrysler - and the whole industry - is strong and the future looks just as bright,&quot; Cunningham said.<BR>

  <B> </B><P align ="left"><B><BR>
       Highland Park, Mich. -- </B> Designing a sports car typically represents the high point in an automotive engineers career.  However, according to Chrysler Corporations new print ad, the launch of the Dodge Viper represented just the beginning of a stunning three-year-run which has resulted in a complete lineup of award-winning new vehicles.<BR>
	The ad, titled This Is One Of The Most Revolutionary Automobiles Ever: Not Bad For The Oldest Car In Our Lineup, first appeared yesterday in selected major daily newspapers nationwide.  It highlights Chryslers commitment to product innovation, beginning with the launch of the Dodge Viper sports coupe in 1992.<BR>
	Since the Dodge Viper was introduced, our commitment to innovation has resulted in a complete line of 26 new vehicles - none of which existed a mere 40 months ago, the ad reads.  In fact, were planning a major or new product launch on average, every three months through the 2000 model year.<BR>

<P>
<P>(37695)	- more -<BR>

	The ad is the second in recent weeks which cites the companys unmatched momentum in the auto industry.  It points to numerous product awards and major design and engineering advancements, including <I>Motor Trends</I> 1995 Car of the Year award for Chrysler Cirrus and 1994 Truck of the Year award for Dodge Ram pickups, along with the innovative Easy Out Roller Seats and dual sliding doors on the all-new 1996 Chrysler, Dodge and Plymouth minivans. <BR>

<P><center><PRTitle><B>DODGE EXPANDS LINE-UP WITH EXPRESSIVE AVENGER SPORT COUPE</B></PRTitle><BR>
<B> </B> </center><BR>
  <B> </B><P align ="left"><B><BR>
       Highland Park, Mich. -- </B>
<P>	Dodge looks to hit another product home run with the addition of the all-new 1995 Dodge Avenger sport coupe.  Already one of the freshest line-ups in the automotive industry -- from the back-to-basics Viper supercar, to the cab-forward Dodge Intrepid sedan, to the huggable new Dodge Neon, to the rugged Dodge Ram pickup, to the best-selling Dodge Caravan minivan and the soon-to-be-released Dodge Stratus compact sedan -- the Dodge Division has emerged as the industry's image leader and continues to attract new customers with groundbreaking design, fun-to-drive performance, industry-leading safety features and value.<BR>
	With the addition of the Avenger, Dodge adds one more strong player to this potent line-up.  The sleek, expressively designed Avenger is aimed at the sport coupe buyer who wants it all: comfort, style, driving enjoyment and affordability.<BR>

<P>
<P>(33694-S)	(more)<BR>

<P>
<P>-2-<BR>

<P>	&quot;The sport coupe market as it stands today is generally one based on trade-offs,&quot; said Dodge General Manager, Martin R. Levine.  &quot;Buyers could get a sporty car and sacrifice roominess and comfort, or they could get a roomier car but lose performance, handling and style.  But when it comes to Avenger, compromise has been replaced by balance -- the balance of spirited driving, yet a comfortable and safe car, the balance of high style, yet priced affordably, and a balance of an expressive design without giving up the versatility of a roomy interior.&quot;<BR>
	A product of Chrysler Design, the Avenger carries recognizable Dodge design cues, including the signature Dodge front end, Stealth-like rear lamps, even a hint of Viper in its aggressive road stance.<BR>
	&quot;This is a segment of the market where owners want their cars to define who they are,&quot; Levine said.  &quot;They want something sporty, but more sophisticated than the traditional 'muscle car' -- and they don't want or need a family sedan.  They want to be noticed.&quot;<BR>
	&quot;For Dodge dealers, Avenger rounds out a full range of vehicle choices,&quot; continued Levine.  &quot;Not since the Dodge Daytona have dealers had a true two-door sport coupe to sell.  But make no mistake, the Avenger is no Daytona.  Avenger is all-new, much more technologically advanced, and appeals to a broader range of driving enthusiasts.&quot;<BR>
	Dodge Avengers will begin arriving in dealer showrooms in October 1994.<BR>

<P><center><PRTitle><B>CHRYSLER CELEBRATES MINIVAN 10TH ANNIVERSARY<BR>
WITH SOME REAL MILESTONES</B></PRTitle><BR>
<B> </B> </center><BR>
  <B> </B><P align ="left"><B><BR>
       Highland Park, Mich. -- </B>Chrysler Corporation today continued the 10th anniversary year celebration of its class-leading minivans at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit by highlighting two impressive &quot;four millionth&quot; milestones.<BR>
	Chrysler Chairman Robert J. Eaton presented the Highland Park (MI) Public School District with a new 1994 Plymouth Voyager - the four millionth minivan built for retail sale - packed with more than 4,000 books.  The donation commemorates more than four million books read by first and second graders around the country through &quot;Running Start,&quot; a Reading is Fundamental program created by a grant from the Chrysler Corporation Fund.  The Highland Park district was one of the original districts to sign on for the motivational reading program in 1989.  The Chrysler/Plymouth Division provided the vehicle, which was accepted by Highland Park School Superintendent Dr. Eugene Cain.  The books were donated by Chrysler and journalists attending the Auto Show.<BR>
	&quot;Reading four million books is a feat in itself, but it's not often that a manufacturer has the opportunity to produce four million of one kind of vehicle,&quot; said Eaton.  &quot;And, it's even more of a milestone to sell your four millionth vehicle.&quot;<BR>

<P>(00594-S)	(more)<BR>

<P>-2-<BR>
	To celebrate the four millionth minivan sold to a customer, Eaton invited Ken and Jayne Morrison of Plymouth, Minn., to the Auto Show to accept delivery of that milestone vehicle, the Dodge Grand Caravan they purchased in mid-December  The Morrisons were surprised by Eaton when he told the family they'd be given the vehicle free.<BR>
	&quot;The Morrison family is typical of the kind of loyal Chrysler minivan customers we've attracted over our 10 years of minivan leadership,&quot; said Eaton after explaining that the Morrisons traded in their 1988 Dodge Caravan for a new 1994 Dodge Grand Caravan.  <BR>
	&quot;The Dodge Caravan and Grand Caravan, Plymouth Voyager and Grand Voyager, and the Chrysler Town &amp; Country provide full minivan market coverage,&quot; according to Theodor R. Cunningham, Executive Vice President-Sales &amp; Marketing &amp; General Manager-Minivan Operations.  &quot;Chrysler Corporation is the only company that does that, providing a minivan for every budget, demand and taste.<BR>
	&quot;That's also the reason, over the last 10 years, our minivans have developed the highest owner loyalty of any vehicle sold in the United States, higher even than Mercedes, Lexus, Honda or anyone else,&quot; he added.<BR>

  <B> </B><P align ="left"><B><BR>
       Highland Park, Mich. -- </B> In a new ad titled Were expanding our markets.  One planet at a time, Chrysler emphasizes the important role its international operations have played in continuously building on a major aspect of the companys success -- momentum.<BR>
	The ad, which first appeared yesterday in selected major daily newspapers, showcases Chryslers recent growth in markets around the world, with overseas sales jumping from 126,000 units in 1993 to over 203,000 by 1996. <BR>
	This positive momentum has helped Chrysler Corporation become one of the worlds most renowned automotive manufacturers; and recently, among the fastest expanding, the ad reads.  In 1992 Chrysler International contributed approximately $1.9 billion to total revenues with sales in 22 countries.  This year, those numbers are projected to reach $4.0 billion with sales in over 100 countries.<BR>

<P>
<P>(39295)	- more -<BR>
	- 2 -<BR>
	This is the third ad in recent weeks which cites the companys unmatched momentum in the automotive industry.  It points to Chryslers commitment to numerous markets around the world, including its Jeep manufacturing facility in Beijing, China (in operation since 1985); its distributorships in the Latin American countries of Brazil and Argentina, which will be 100 percent owned by Chrysler; and its European operations, where Chrysler sold more vehicles in Europe last year than Mercedes-Benz sold in the United States.<BR>
	The ad will appear in this weeks editions of major news magazines and in major newspapers.<BR>

<B> </B> </center><BR>
  <B> </B><P align ="left"><B><BR>
       Highland Park, Mich. -- </B>Introduced a decade ago with both two-door and four-door bodystyles -- the latter whose immediate popularity with buyers was to stun competitors and become the industry benchmark -- the Jeep&reg; Cherokee marches into its 1994 model year as still an extremely successful player in the compact sport utility market.<BR>
	Not only has the Cherokee improved markedly with each passing year, it has successfully withstood the challenges of all competitive makes -- both domestic and import -- and, early in the 1993 model year, even made room for an upscale sibling, the Jeep Grand Cherokee.<BR>
	Upon the arrival of the Grand Cherokee, the original Cherokee was repositioned to appeal to a younger, more budget-conscious buyer, but also targeted certain new niche markets with a police unit, a rural postal route truck and a right-hand-drive version for export.<BR>
	Cherokee continues to provide full Jeep capability at an affordable price.  The model lineup for 1994 includes the Cherokee SE, Sport and Country.  Each is available in either four-wheel- or two-wheel-drive configurations, as well as two-door or four-door bodystyles.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>(09494)	- more - <BR>

<P>
<P>- 2 -<BR>
	Cherokee's 4.0-liter, in-line 6-cylinder engine receives a higher performance torque converter, which translates into added responsiveness.<BR>
	Cherokee Sport and Cherokee Country models for 1994 feature the 4.0-liter powerplant, as standard, capable of producing 190 horsepower at 4,750 rpm and 225 pound feet of torque at 4,000 rpm.<BR>
	The 4.0-liter is an option on SE models.  A 5-speed transmission is standard across the line and a 4-speed automatic optional with this engine on all models.<BR>
	The 2.5-liter, 4-cylinder engine, standard on the SE, has 130 horsepower at 5,250 rpm and 149 pound feet of torque at 3,250 rpm.   A 5-speed manual transmission is standard with the 2.5-liter engine; the 3-speed automatic optional.<BR>
	The 1994 Cherokee introduces a center high-mounted stop light as an added, highly visible safety alert for following vehicles.<BR>
	Increased roof crush resistance is built into the 1994 Cherokee as are door beams inside the front and rear doors to provide occupant protection from side impact intrusions.<BR>
	Continuing from 1993 are the right-hand drive rural postal carrier vehicles with four-wheel-drive.  In 1994, a two-wheel-drive version has been added on both two-door and four-door Cherokee models.  Right-hand drive Cherokees began production earlier this year for export only.<BR>
	Along with Jeep Wrangler, Cherokee will incorporate non-CFC R-134A refrigerant in its air conditioning system later in this model year.  This refrigerant is viewed as less threatening than freon gas to the earth's atmospheric ozone layer.  Grand Cherokee was introduced with R-134A refrigerant.<BR>

<P>	Off-highway enthusiasts will have at their disposal a choice of either Jeep's popular &quot;Command-Trac&quot; part-time, four-wheel-drive system or the &quot;Selec-Trac&quot; full-time four-wheel-drive system.  Both are optional equipment.<BR>
	&quot;Selec-Trac&quot; allows for easy shifting from two-wheel- to four-wheel-drive high at any time and speed, while &quot;Command Trac&quot; offers this feature only in low traction situations.<BR>
	Cherokee SE, Sport and Country all provide a full array of standard equipment, including power front disc brakes, full stainless steel exhaust system, full instrumentation, tinted glass and power steering.<BR>
	Options include the full-time &quot;Selec-Trac&quot; transfer case, four-wheel anti-lock brakes, air conditioning, six-way power driver's seat, power windows and door locks with keyless entry, illuminated entry, speed control, tilt steering, leather seats and color-keyed leather-wrapped sport steering wheel. <BR>

JEEP&reg; TAKES TO THE TRAIL <BR>
IN AN OLD WEST OFF-HIGHWAY ADVENTURE<BR>
</B></PRTitle><BR>
<B> </B> </center><BR>
  <B> </B><P align ="left"><B><BR>
       Highland Park, Mich. -- </B> Jeep&reg; owners will experience firsthand the traditions of the Old West -- cowboys, longhorns, rustic charm and miles of rugged<BR>
trails -- at the Second Annual Y. O. Ranch Jeep Jamboree March 2-5, 1995.  The <BR>
Y. O. Ranch, located in the Texas Hill Country, plays host to Jeep enthusiasts, for <BR>
a two-day off-highway driving adventure.  <BR>
	Established in 1880, the 40,000-acre Y. O. Ranch is home to a substantial herd of Texas longhorn cattle, which were on the brink of extinction several decades ago.  The ranch is also one of the Southwest's largest deer and exotic game preserves with various species of exotic wildlife -- including zebra, ostrich, and giraffe -- roaming freely on the ranch.  In addition, several historical buildings are preserved on the ranch, including a stagecoach from the 1850's, a Wells Fargo office, and a pioneer cabin and schoolhouse.<BR>
	The Jeep Jamboree legend was started in 1952 when Mark A. Smith and some of his colleagues in the El Dorado County (California) foothills led a small group of Jeep enthusiasts over the treacherous Rubicon Trail from Georgetown to Lake Tahoe.  Today Chrysler Corporation's Jeep and Eagle Division sponsors 26 Jamborees across the United States for Jeep owners.  Jamborees are considered the perfect fit for Jeep.  <BR>

	Ed Brust, General Manager - Jeep and Eagle Division, says that most people buy a Jeep for the added security achieved through the superior traction and controllability of a four-wheel-drive vehicle.	<BR>
	&quot;Jeep vehicles are legendary for doing things others cannot and the real power of   a legend is where it takes you, &quot; says Brust.  &quot;It's an important part of the Jeep vehicle to be have the capability to go to some seldom seen, hard-to-reach place.  <BR>
	Jeep is a founding member of &quot;Tread Lightly!,&quot; a non-profit organization designed to promote off highway use, ethics and practices.  &quot;When you venture beyond the paved road, its important to remember your responsibilities to the environment,&quot; said Brust.  &quot;At Jeep, our message is simple, use common sense and stay on approved trails.&quot;<BR>

<B> </B> </center><BR>
  <B> </B><P align ="left"><B><BR>
       Highland Park, Mich. -- </B> Increased consumer confidence and demand for Chrysler products led the corporation to recently announce a substantial expansion of assembly and powertrain capacity over the next three years.  This action will result in an increase of worldwide production capacity of 500,000 units to 3.5 million vehicles a year by 1996 and could potentially add up to 6,000 new jobs at Chrysler facilities in the U.S. and Canada. <BR>
	&quot;For the last several months, we've had strong and rapid improvement in consumer confidence, which in turn has increased our sales momentum,&quot; said Robert J. Eaton, Chrysler Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.  &quot;We are optimistic about 1994 and remain cautiously optimistic about our prospects for the next three - five years.&quot; <BR>
	Demand for Chrysler vehicles - particularly trucks, minivans and Jeep&reg; vehicles - is very strong in today's market.  In addition, Chrysler's redesigned cars are generating renewed interest in the market and the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), is presenting additional volume opportunities.  The NAFTA agreement has already allowed Chrysler to begin shipments of Toledo (Ohio) - built Jeep Cherokees to the Mexican market for the first time in January 1994.  <BR>
(11194)	(more)<BR>

<P>- 2 -<BR>
	For the full year, 1994 Jeep Cherokee exports to Mexico are projected to exceed 3,000 units.  In 1993, no Jeep Cherokees were shipped to Mexico.  In total, Chrysler plans to ship 15,000 cars and trucks to Mexico in 1994 compared to only 5,800 in 1993.<BR>
	&quot;When you add up all the positive signs in the economy there is some reason for optimism on the jobs front,&quot; Eaton said.  &quot;But we all -- employers, unions, government -- need to work cooperatively if additional gains are to be made.&quot;<BR>

WITH GRAND PRIX VINTAGE RACE AND EXHIBITION<BR>

       Highland Park, Mich. -- </B>They come from all walks of life, all levels of experience, and all parts of the southwest.  But they have two things in common.  They are competitive individuals, and they love cars -- especially fast, rare, vintage race cars.  <BR>
	Some 300 of these impassioned individuals will convene again this year in Palm Springs -- as racers first did more than 40 years ago -- to match wits and machines in the Chrysler Grand Prix, November 17-19.  They will also come to see  the first public exhibition of a portion of the Robert Pond collection of fine automobiles.<BR>
	And once again, the city of Palm Springs will enter a time warp -- locked in those exciting post-World War II years when the American love affair with cars was in full bloom.<BR>
	This is one of the best venues in the country for the fast-growing sport of vintage racing, in part because of its historical importance to sports car racing, and also because so many people in Palm Springs and throughout southern California share our own passion for the automobile, said A. C. Bud Liebler, Vice President -- Marketing and Communications.  Few other events focus so strongly on what we, at Chrysler, are really all about.<BR>
(39795)	- more -<BR>
	- 2 -<BR>
	The racing weekend will feature nearly 300 vintage sports cars, CanAm and open wheel Formula cars -- along with drivers and teams -- competing over three days on a 1.6 mile, 10-turn circuit located in the heart of the city, with the Wyndham Hotel serving as race headquarters.  The races are sanctioned and managed by the Vintage Auto Racing Association.<BR>
	At track-side, the Palm Springs Convention Center will display for the first time some 85 vehicles that are part of a collection owned by Californian Robert Pond.<BR>
	This year marks the 10th anniversary of the Palm Springs road races, and is the second anniversary of Chrysler Corporations title sponsorship.  Chrysler has also hosted the Bob Hope Chrysler Classic in Palm Springs for the past 47 years.<BR>

<P><center><PRTitle><B>ULEV EMISSION STATUS FOR CHRYSLER CNG VEHICLES<BR>
 TO CREATE `SIZEABLE' FLEET MARKET<BR>
</B></PRTitle><BR>
<B> </B> </center><BR>
  <B> </B><P align ="left"><B><BR>
       Highland Park, Mich. -- </B>  A &quot;fairly sizeable&quot; fleet market will evolve for compressed natural gas vehicles (CNG) as a result of Chrysler Corporation's being recognized by the state of California as the first company to reach the lowest emission status possible to date for natural gas-powered vehicles.<BR>
	The Chrysler vehicles -- the 1994 Dodge Caravan, Caravan C/V, and Plymouth Voyager -- were certified by California Air Resources Board (CARB) last month as Ultra Low Emission Vehicles (ULEV).  The only cleaner burning vehicles on the market today are electric vehicles.  Last year the full-size CNG Dodge Ram Van and Wagon were certified by California as the first Low Emission Vehicles (LEV).<BR>
	There are currently 41 CNG refueling stations in Northern California and a projected 98 by the end of the year.  Pacific Gas and Electric Co. (PG&amp;E), along with Chrysler, has led the charge to help create an infrastructure for CNG vehicles.  <BR>
	Mike Clement, Chrysler's manager of alternative fuel vehicle sales and marketing, estimates Chrysler can sell 2,000 CNG minivans in 1994.  In 1993, Chrysler sold about 50 electric vehicles, 445 CNG vans and 5,432 vehicles that can run on a methanol-gas mixture.  <BR>
(07394)		(more)<BR>

<P>- 2 -<BR>

<P>	&quot;With significant incentives and certain tax exemptions, it's going to create a fairly sizeable market,&quot; Clement said.  &quot;CNG vehicles are one more viable solution to our air management problems.&quot;<BR>
	Chrysler is scheduled to launch similar programs in New York City and in the Baltimore-Washington, D.C. corridor by the end of April, and nine other cities with major pollution problems by the end of the year.<BR>
	The incentives virtually negate any price penalty created by converting a vehicle to CNG.  The manufacturer's suggested retail price will be about $22,000 for CNG minivans and $17,400 to $26,200 for full-size vans.  <BR>
		The incentives include more than $2,600 from PG&amp;E; a $500 fleet purchase incentive for minivans and $2,000 for full-size vans from Chrysler; a federal income tax deduction of $2,000 per vehicle, and a state sales tax exemption for the incremental cost of buying a certified, low-emissions vehicle.<BR>
	Additional incentives with funding caps are available as well.  California Energy Commission will offer a $1,500 incentive for minivans and $1,000 for full-size vans (up to $500,000 in 1994).  The state of California offers an income tax credit of $1,000 on minivans and up to $2,000 on full-size vans (up to $750,000 in 1994).  <BR>
	Compressed natural gas is cheaper than gasoline -- about 80 cents a gallon as compared to $1.10 a gallon of gasoline.  More importantly, emissions from these CNG vehicles will be significantly less and in fact, very comparable with an electric vehicle when emissions from power plants to generate the electricity are included.       	(more)<BR>

<P>- 3 -<BR>
	CNG minivans and full-size vans have a range of 100-150 miles city and 150-200 miles highway.  Current battery technology for electric vehicles can only provide a range of less than 100 miles.<BR>
	&quot;While a CNG vehicle has somewhat less range than their gasoline-powered counterpart, the performance in every day driving is virtually the same,&quot; Clement said.  &quot;Performance can be a drawback for electric vehicles and the $100,000 price tag is a big detriment.&quot;<BR>
	While somewhat limited, the range of CNG vehicles is enough to entice potential fleet customers, Clement said.<BR>
	&quot;Many fleet customers have a fixed driving pattern with a limited range,&quot; Clement explained.  &quot;A plumber in San Francisco isn't likely to make a house call in Sacramento!&quot;<BR>
	Target markets include shuttle vehicles for airports, van pools and military bases; delivery trucks and courier services; utility trucks; vehicles used within a production plant compound and service trucks for trades such as plumbers, electricians and carpenters.<BR>
	Other potential users might include environmental organizations, educational institutions, health care providers and organizations servicing children and the elderly.<BR>

       Highland Park, Mich. -- </B>The Chrysler Neon has been elected &quot;World Car 1994&quot; by an international jury of automotive writers.  Second and third were the Ford Mondeo and Toyota Celica respectively.  <BR>
	The &quot;World Car&quot; election is organized by the Italian magazine &quot;Motor.&quot;  Among the participating media are the French publications &quot;L'Argus de l'Automobile&quot; and &quot;Echappement,&quot; the Hong Kong-based magazine &quot;China Car-Drive,&quot; the Swedish magazine &quot;Automobil&quot; and the American publications &quot;Robb Report&quot; and &quot;Automobile Magazine&quot;.  With the 1994 Award, Neon succeeds the Mazda 121, Mercedes S and the Nissan Micra, the 1991, 1992 and 1993 winners.<BR>
	Sergio Favia del Core, Editor in Chief of &quot;Motor&quot;, presented the World Car 1994 Award to Chrysler Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Robert J. Eaton, lauding Neon's international design and character:  &quot;This is the first All-American car -- designed, engineered and produced in the United States -- that really is suitable for the European and Asian markets.<BR>
	&quot;On top of its compact dimensions, roomy interior, 2-liter, 16-valve engine, fun-to-drive handling and high standard of safety equipment, the Chrysler Neon offers a unique styling that will appeal to the taste of people on every continent.&quot;<BR>

       Highland Park, Mich. -- </B>- When the Mayflower sailing ship badge first appeared on Plymouth vehicles in 1928, it was said to represent the &quot;endurance and strength, rugged honesty...and freedom from limitations.&quot;  In 1995, a post-modern version of the badge returns to signify the brand's rejuvenated image of freedom and expressiveness.<BR>
	The new badge, unveiled today at the North American International Auto Show, will begin appearing later this year on the Plymouth Neon and the new Plymouth Voyager.<BR>
		&quot;This badge represents more than just a logo change for Plymouth,&quot; said Chrysler-Plymouth General Manager Steve Torok. &quot;It serves as a symbolic confirmation of the fundamental values of the new Plymouth; to provide compelling and expressively-designed vehicles to the entry-level market.&quot;  <BR>
	The Mayflower badge, in its original form, appeared on millions of Plymouth vehicles from 1928 through the 1950's.<BR>

       Highland Park, Mich. -- </B>Make no mistake, Generation X will know what the Neon is if Chrysler Corporation's lifestyle marketing programs are on target.<BR>
	From major sporting events to health clubs to music videos to movie theaters, Chrysler will launch an &quot;aggressive&quot; February-March campaign in an effort to create awareness for its newest small car.  Many of the venues are new to Chrysler, and in some cases, new to advertisers.<BR>
	&quot;Neon was developed in a &quot;dare to be different&quot; environment, so we decided to push the envelope in marketing as well,&quot; said Arthur C. &quot;Bud&quot; Liebler, Vice President of Marketing and Communications.  &quot;Movie theaters, video games and cause-related music videos are either new areas or venues we haven't tried for a while.  We think they are right on target for Generation X.&quot;<BR>
	The Neon advertising campaign will reach 95 percent of its target audience 25 times in the first quarter, Liebler added.<BR>
	Sponsoring concerts, bands or artists is not new, but Chrysler has found a way to associate with a variety of music genres and at the same time support a good cause.<BR>
(04694-A)	(more)<BR>

<P>- 2 -<BR>
	It's called Recording Artists Against Drunk Driving (RADD), and as the title implies, top name artists from rock, country, pop and rap have come together to make a music video, public service announcements (PSA) and a compact disc of select recordings to deliver the &quot;Don't Drink and Drive&quot; message.<BR>
	The music video, set to debut on the American Music Awards Feb. 7 on ABC-TV, will feature a Neon, Dodge Viper and Plymouth Prowler in an all-star cast recording of the Beatles' &quot;Drive My Car.&quot;<BR>
	The compact disc will be released in March, retailing for $6.99 through a 900 number, and will include the all-star version of &quot;Drive My Car&quot; and nine other cuts from artists who contributed to &quot;Drive.&quot;  The RADD collection will be sponsored by Neon and a Neon brochure will be included with each CD, which will also feature an 800 number on the jacket for more information.  RADD has ordered 250,000 CDs.<BR>
	The National Association of Broadcasters has agreed to send the PSA to its 900-member television stations.  The PSA will also be shown in 250 video arcades in a special promotion with Aladdin Video Arcades. <BR>
	&quot;We're not trying to be self righteous and say `Don't drink,'&quot; Liebler said.  &quot;All we're saying is, `If you do it, think about the consequences.'  Give your keys to someone else.  Don't make the wrong decision and get behind the wheel.&quot;<BR>
	Chrysler will continue its commitment to a drunk driving program, in which uniquely engineered vehicles allow sober drivers to experience the dangers of driving drunk.  In the last six years, the Chrysler-sponsored drunk driving simulator has visited 550 high schools and dealerships and made an estimated 1.5 million impressions.<BR>
(more)<BR>

<P>- 3 -<BR>
	In 1994, two Neons will be equipped to simulate the effect alcohol has on a driver's reflexes.  Impressions are expected to top 200,000 for the 250 planned events scheduled for the year.<BR>
	Music stores, music videos and concerts won't be the only venues highlighting Neons this spring.  In fact, picking up tickets to a concert, ballgame or other events will serve as another marketing tool for Neon.  More than 6 million TicketMaster envelopes during the next six months will be printed with an image of Neon and will contain information about the car.<BR>
	The Neon also will be featured on 7,100 movie screens in 2,500 theaters during February.  The promotion with Screenvision Cinema Network and Cineplex Odeon Cinemas Corp., is the largest buy Chrysler has ever made for commercial time in advance of movie previews.  The promotion starts Feb. 4 and features the 60-second spot seen on the Super Bowl.  The advertising flight will be shown with new movie releases such as &quot;I'll Do Anything,&quot; with Nick Nolte and Albert Brooks; &quot;My Girl 2&quot; with Dan Aykroyd and Jamie Lee Curtis; and &quot;The Getaway,&quot; with Alec Baldwin, Kim Basinger and James Woods.  Movie posters promoting Neon will be on display in the theater lobbies.<BR>
	Neon already made its debut on the small screen.  Just last month, Chrysler sponsored an hour-long, docu-drama called &quot;Road Trip&quot;, in which Neon was the star but Chrysler chose not to advertise on the show.  Instead, public service announcements on projects not related to Chrylser business aired on the &quot;Road Trip&quot; broadcast.<BR>
(more)<BR>

<P>- 4 -<BR>
	Even the place where Generation X works out will not go untouched.  Bally's Health Clubs will offer three weeks membership free to anyone who test drives a Neon.  Bally clubs will generate 350,000 visits per day during the two-month promotion.  Neons kiosks will be on display in the lobbies of 351 clubs and vehicle displays will be in front of those clubs that have space.<BR>
	Neon also will be part of a 25-college health and fitness tour this spring.  Students can enjoy activities such as Velcro wall jumping, rock wall climbing and bungee running, in which a contestant runs a 50-yard dash with a bungee cord wrapped around the waist, puts a mark in the ground just before being sprung back.  Neon ride and drives will be available to participating students.<BR>
	In the racing arena, Neon will be exposed through a grass roots racing program offered to the Sports Car Club of America's (SCCA) 51,000 members.  It's estimated that SCCA members influence another 400,000 people and their automotive purchases.  Chrysler is also introducing a $220,000 contingency awards program for SCCA club racing and solo racing.  Winning purses range from $200 to $5,000, depending on the event.<BR>
	As for community groups, Chrysler will join forces with The U.S. Junior Chamber of Commerce.  The company will provide Neon demonstration drives and support fund raising efforts for 300 chapters in 1994, advertise in the Jaycees Magazine, develop special direct mail programs to Jaycees, and display Neons at the Junior Chamber's annual meeting and local chapter meetings. <BR>

<P><center><PRTitle><B>CHRYSLER AND UAW BEGIN DISCUSSIONS<BR>
ON THIRD SHIFT FOR BELVIDERE PLANT</B></PRTitle><BR>
<B> </B> </center><BR>
  <B> </B><P align ="left"><B><BR>
       Belvidere, Il -- </B> Chrysler Corporation announced today that it has begun discussions with the UAW in order to add a third production shift at the Belvidere, Illinois plant for its hot-selling Dodge and Plymouth Neons.<BR>
	The addition of a third shift, which is contingent upon parts availability as well as successful discussions with the union, and state and local governments, could go into effect at the plant in August 1995, in time for 1996 model year production.  <BR>
	Belvidere currently builds about 1,000 Neons a day on two eight-hour shifts.  Current plant employment is about 3,750.<BR>
	A third shift could add about 400 Neons a day, and approximately 700-800 employees.  Applications for third shift positions are not being taken at this time; more information on  job possibilities will be released after an agreement is reached with the UAW.  <BR>
	Chrysler began producing the Neon four-door sedan in November 1993, and a second shift was added just two weeks after the launch.   The plant began producing two-door Neon Coupes earlier this month.  <BR>

<P>(45194-S)	(more)<BR>
	- 2 -<BR>

<P>	More than 190,000 Neons have been built at Belvidere.  Under full production, the plant has the capacity to produce about 250,000 cars annually on two 8-hour shifts.  With a third shift, the plant will be able to produce more than 370,000 units a year.<BR>
	Since Neon's introduction, sales of the car that <U>Automobile</U> magazine tabbed its 1995 &quot;Automobile of the Year&quot; have been sizzling.  Current inventory at Dodge and Plymouth dealerships  is a 40 days'  supply.  Automakers consider a 60 day supply nominal.<BR>

  <B> </B><P align ="left"><B><BR>
       Highland Park, Mich. -- </B>Trails originating from Native American footpaths <BR>

<P>and pre-Revolutionary settlers in the Berkshire Hills will be the scene of Chrysler <BR>

<P>Corporation's annual Mohawk Jeep&reg; Jamboree October 19-22.<BR>

<P>	Less than two hours from Boston, the trail starts in the beautiful<BR>

<P>Massachusetts town of Charlemont before winding over old stagecoach routes<BR>

<P>and logging roads. Historical markers along the way even include a cave once used<BR>

<P>by pioneers as a church.  Fishing enthusiasts will find paradise in the Deerfield<BR>

<P>River, where trout, salmon and bass are plentiful.<BR>

<P>	The Mohawk Jamboree features Jeep vehicles, including the significantly<BR>

<P>redesigned Grand Cherokee for 1996, as well as the Cherokee and Wrangler -- all<BR>

<P>ideal vehicles to travel the Mohawk and savor the brilliant changes of the fall<BR>

<P>colors.<BR>

<P>	&quot;Each Jeep is a passport to nature,&quot; said Ed Brust, General Manager of the <BR>

<P>Jeep-Eagle Division. &quot;Jeep stands for the original, accept-no-substitute vehicle <BR>
 <BR>
capable of  taking you to seldom-seen, hard-to-reach places.&quot;<BR>

<P>(38395)	(more)<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>-2-<BR>

<P>
<P>	Like all Jamborees, the aim is to enjoy the outdoors and respect the<BR>

<P>environment at the same time. Brust advises every driver to follow the Jeep<BR>

<P>Jamboree's &quot;Tread Lightly!&quot; program.<BR>

<P>	&quot;When you venture beyond the paved road, it's important to remember your<BR>

<P>responsibilities to the environment,&quot; Brust said. &quot;At Jeep, our message is <BR>

<P>simple: use common sense, drive safely and stay off unmarked trails.&quot;<BR>

<P>	The Mohawk Jamboree, which is one of more than two-dozen Jamborees <BR>

<P>sponsored around the country each year by Chrysler, allows Jeep enthusiasts to<BR>

<P>either gain or renew their respect for what their vehicles are capable of in off-<BR>

<P>highway driving.<BR>

<P>	&quot;Jamborees such as our Mohawk event have introduced thousands of Jeep <BR>

<P>owners to a new realm of four-wheeling that puts some of the most beautiful parts <BR>

<P>of this country right at their door, literally,&quot; said Mark Smith, founder of the Jeep<BR>

<P>Jamborees and technical consultant for Jeep.<BR>

<P>	On a scale of  one to 10, the Mohawk Jamboree has a trail rating of <BR>

<P>between 4 and 6, higher when conditions are wet.<BR>

<P><center><PRTitle><B>DODGE AND PLYMOUTH BRING THE DEALERSHIP HOME WITH<BR>
NEW INTERACTIVE CD-ROM CAR CATALOG</B></PRTitle><BR>
<B> </B> </center><BR>
  <B> </B><P align ="left"><B><BR>
       Highland Park, Mich. -- </B> The Chrysler-Plymouth and Dodge Divisions of Chrysler Corporation announced today that they will be opening 20 million new dealerships across the country.  Well, sort of.  With the introduction of the industry's first new fully interactive catalog on CD-ROM, Dodge and Plymouth are offering personal computer owners the chance to do their initial shopping of the hot new 2- and 4-door sub-compact Neons in the comfort and convenience of their homes.<BR>
	Fashioned as a futuristic version of the traditional &quot;printed&quot; car catalog, the Neon CD-ROM Catalog gives Neon shoppers the chance to step into the interactive age to shop for a car.  Consumers have the opportunity to see commercials and running video footage, learn about Chrysler Corporation's customer service commitment, and look at color and option choices.  Those choices can then be computer printed, and taken to a dealership for ordering or purchasing a new Neon.   <BR>

<P>

	&quot;We are in an interactive age, where people can shop for, and buy, almost anything without ever leaving their home,&quot; said Dodge General Manager Martin R. Levine.  &quot;And CD-ROM owners have become comfortable in relying on their computers, for both educating and shopping.  We felt an interactive Neon car catalog was perfect for this market.&quot;<BR>
	The CD-ROM segment of the personal computer market is one of the fastest growing in the industry.  Sales of CD-ROM drives are projected to pass 11 million in 1994 versus five million last year, while software programs are expected to exceed 4,500 by the end of the year.<BR>
	With the capacity to store digital quality audio, full motion video and high quality art and photography, CD-ROM uses are virtually endless.  In addition, the storage capacity of a single CD-ROM disc can exceed that of 700 floppy discs.<BR>
	The Neon catalog is unique because it will also offer a variety of musical selections on the disc, including hits from popular Generation X artists Joe Public, EMF and generational crossover sensation Tony Bennett.  Music recorded on CD-ROM discs can also be played in a home or vehicle compact disc player.  Additionally, the Dodge Neon disc contains a demonstration of the popular Lucas Arts game &quot;Star Wars Rebel Assault.&quot; <BR>
	<BR>

<P>	&quot;CD-ROM represents yet another frontier for us into the lifestyle of the Neon buyer,&quot; said Chrysler-Plymouth General Manager Steven A. Torok. &quot;Not only are more CD-ROM systems being purchased by young singles and young families, but they are relying more and more on CD-ROM to make their buying decisions.  CD-ROM is a resource that we can't afford to ignore.&quot;<BR>
	The CD-ROM discs will be distributed to Neon shoppers at Chrysler-Plymouth and Dodge dealerships beginning in the next two weeks, and can also be seen on special discs offered by <I>Newsweek</I> and <I>Electronic Entertainment</I> magazines.  In addition, the Neon CD-ROM discs will also be available at auto shows, the Plymouth Health and Fitness tour and other Neon special events.	<BR>
	Plymouth will also offer its CD-ROM via &quot;SHOPPING 2000,&quot; the first multiple consumer catalog collection to offer images and music on the World Wide Web.  Plymouth Neon video clips will also be available for online delivery.  SHOPPING 2000 will be bundled with Dell, CompuServe and PC Connections hardware and software sold to consumers via direct mail.  <BR>

<P><center><PRTitle><B>EAGLE TAKES FLIGHT THIS WEEKEND <BR>
WITH LAUNCH OF DIRECT-TO-CONSUMER CAMPAIGN</B></PRTitle><BR>
<B> </B> </center><BR>
  <B> </B><P align ="left"><B><BR>
       Highland Park, Mich. -- </B>Eagle continues to build brand awareness this weekend with the first of several integrated marketing programs designed to establish one-to-one consumer relationships. <BR>
	The Eagle Talon Social Club Challenge will be held this Sunday, Sept., 18 from 9 a.m. - 6 p.m. at Chrysler's Technology Center in Auburn Hills, Mich.  The program's main event -- designed to capitalize on the marketing campaign's &quot;Test Drive&quot; theme -- is a co-ed team driving competition in 1995 Eagle Talons on a professionally designed race course.  Developed in conjunction with the Detroit chapter of the Sport and Social Clubs of the U.S., over 400 Social Club members have registered to form 170 teams to compete in the driving challenge.<BR>
	In addition, other sports and life-oriented activities will be held at CTC to immerse Social Club members in the image of Eagle, including an in-line skating course, mountain bike racing and a fast serve tennis challenge and clinic.<BR>
	&quot;As the reach-out brand, it is our responsibility to create a new path for the Corporation, communicate with new customers, explore new methods and take a few risks along the way,&quot; said Ed Brust, General Manager, Jeep and Eagle Division.<BR>
(39794)	(more)<BR>

<P>- 2 -<BR>
	The 1995 Eagle vehicles -- part of the line-up offered by Chrysler Corporation's Jeep and Eagle Division -- includes the all-new Eagle Talon and refined versions of the Eagle Vision, Eagle Summit Wagon, Summit Coupe and Sedan.<BR>
	In order to be truly appreciated, Brust believes Eagle products must be driven.  Thus, the brand's 1995 campaign, &quot;The Eagle Test Drive,&quot; is aimed at getting customers unfamiliar with the brand turned on to Eagle.<BR>

<P><center><PRTitle><B>MOPAR ACCESSORIES FOR JEEP&reg; MAKE LIFE A LITTLE EASIER ON JAMBOREE TRAIL</B></PRTitle><BR>
<B> </B> </center><BR>
  <B> </B><P align ="left"><B><BR>
       Highland Park, Mich. -- </B> If you're planning to take your Jeep&reg; Wrangler, Cherokee, or Grand Cherokee on a Jeep Jamboree off-highway expedition, you'll want to be sure that your vehicle is properly outfitted.  Chrysler Corporation's Mopar Parts Division offers a variety of factory-engineered accessories to improve vehicle safety, utility, and performance, as well as appearance protection on the Jamboree trail.<BR>
	High on the Jeep Jamboree equipment needs list are safety-oriented accessories such as skid plates, winches, tow hooks, and auxiliary lights.  Mopar offers Bumper-Mounted Winches for Wranglers in 6,000 and 8,000 pound capacities, to help rescue your fellow adventurers if they get stuck.  Winches are also available for Cherokees.<BR>
	For Jamboree trails rated four and above, properly mounted tow hooks are a must, to give your trail mates something to latch onto when you're the one who's stuck.  And, if your Jamboree trail is riddled with rocks and ruts, a skid plate is essential to protect your undercarriage from potential damage.<BR>
	If you encounter rain or fog on the Jamboree trail,  Mopar fog lights can be &quot;life savers&quot; because they increase visibility.  Mopar off-road lights illuminate those dark forests and canyon trails.  Mopar off-road and fog lights come in several sizes, and in black, stainless steel, and bright chrome finishes.  <BR>

<P>
<P>(16795)	(more)<BR>
	- 2 - <BR>

<P>	Mopar Grille/Brush Guards also protect vehicle paint finishes from trail brush and tree limbs.  They are manufactured of heavy duty, corrosion-resistant black or silver anodized aluminum, or steel with black powder-coated finish.  Wrangler Guards are also available in aluminum with a gold anodized finish.<BR>
	Other popular Mopar appearance protection accessories are Front End Covers for Wrangler and Cherokee.  These covers provide protection against the mud, stones, debris, and insects you'll encounter on the back-road trails.  Unique two-piece construction allows you to open the hood without removing the cover.<BR>
	For Wrangler owners who want to maximize storage space, the Mopar Add-A-Trunk creates three cubic feet of lockable storage space behind the rear seat.  This accessory provides a safe, secure, out-of-sight place to lock valuables.<BR>
	If enhanced vehicle performance is on your mind,  Mopar Performance manufactures a variety of performance parts including a high performance engine computer for 1993-95 Grand Cherokees.  This easy-to-install, direct replacement computer increases the 5.2L engine's performance by as much as 24 horsepower and up to 26 ft/lbs of additional torque for extra off-highway performance.  It is emissions exempt (C.A.R.B. E.O. #D-265-3) and approved for use in all 50 states.  <BR>
	Mopar also offers the latest in factory audio systems designed to complement the vehicle's instrument panel.  A Mopar AM/FM Stereo Radio with CD Player and AM/FM Stereo Radio with Cassette Player provide exceptional sound for Wrangler, Cherokee and Grand Cherokee owners.  <BR>

<P>
<P>(more)<BR>
	- 3 -<BR>

<P>	Wrangler owners will appreciate the security and convenience of a special &quot;pull-out&quot; AM/FM CD Radio that can be temporarily removed when the vehicle is left unattended with its top down.  Additionally, Mopar offers a Six-Disc CD Changer and Overhead Speaker Systems designed and engineered specifically for Jeep vehicles.  <BR>
	In the summer, the trails can get pretty hot.  A Mopar Sun Bonnet for the Wrangler provides protection from the sun, yet allows a breezy, open air feel.  It's made of durable vinyl and comes in frost white, black, spice mint-green, salmon, orchid, yellow, or red.  To protect your cargo from the elements, a matching Mopar Tonneau <BR>
Cover is also available in each color.<BR>
	Another practical accessory you'll appreciate is a Mopar Spare Tire Carrier for Cherokee and Grand Cherokee.  Mounting your spare tire on the rear outside tire carrier increases interior storage space and allows more convenient access to the spare tire.  <BR>
	To keep your spare clean and dry, a Mopar Spare Tire Cover is offered in a variety of factory colors, including a Jeep Jamboree edition that lets people know you're a true Jeep off-highway adventurer.  Spare Tire Covers that match the Sun Bonnet and Tonneau Cover colors are also available for Wrangler.  <BR>
	Before heading off on your Jeep Jamboree expedition, see your local Jeep and Eagle dealer for a copy of the Wrangler, Cherokee or Grand Cherokee accessory brochure.  Each brochure provides detailed information on these and many other Mopar factory-engineered accessories.  <BR>

       Palm Springs, Ca -- </B> Imagine receiving personal instruction from a pro like Tom Kite, hitting a few golf balls with him, all the while competing for fantastic prizes.  And not having to pay for the experience.  That dream will come true for 20 lucky fans and journalists in the first Chrysler Precision Golf Challenge.<BR>
	The exclusive event -- which will serve to kick-off the Bob Hope Chrysler Classic Week -- is designed to pit professional golfers, consumers and media members together as teams competing against one another.  The event begins at 2:30 p.m., on Monday, February 14, 1994, at host course Indian Wells, G.C. <BR>
	Ten teams, each consisting of one professional golfer, one golf fan and one journalist, will compete in the event.  Each team member is allowed three shots at the target, from approximately 100 yards out.  Points are awarded on proximity to the hole.  After the three team members' best shots are tabulated, the team with the most points wins.<BR>
	&quot;It's a perfect example of direct consumer involvement,&quot; said Steve Torok, Chrysler-Plymouth General Manager.  &quot;After all, what golfer wouldn't want to play and discuss golf with someone like Tom Kite.&quot;<BR>
(04894)	-more-	<BR>

<P>-2-<BR>

<P>
<P>	Consumers won the chance to compete -- by signing up at participating golf clubs where Hogan products are sold -- and will vie for the following prizes:<BR>
First Prize:	Use of a Chrysler vehicle for one month<BR>
Second Prize:	A set of Hogan irons<BR>
Third Prize:	A Hogan golf bag<BR>
	Professional golfers and media members will win prizes as well. <BR>
	But they're not the only winners.  Reading Is Fundamental, Inc., the nation's largest children's literacy organization, will receive the use of a Chrysler vehicle for one year in the names of the winning team.  In addition, Desert Charities, the official charity of the Bob Hope Chrysler Classic, will receive a $1,000 check in the winners' names.<BR>

<B> </B> </center><BR>
  <B> </B><P align ="left"><B><BR>
       Highland Park, Mich. -- </B>No matter how tough and unstoppable Jeep&reg; Grand Cherokee, Cherokee and Wrangler are designed to be, there are certain obstacles that will bring them to a quick halt -- wildflowers, plants and streams, for example. <BR>
	Chrysler Corporation's Jeep brand is committed to the demonstration of responsible four-wheeling in all of its advertising.  In fact, a 1993 Jeep print ad uses a photo of a wildflower with the verbiage, &quot;At Jeep, This Is A Stop Sign&quot;.  <BR>
	&quot;Every ad we produce must meet the criteria we have established in concert with our Jeep Environmental Council,&quot; said Mary Suchara, Manager - Jeep Advertising.  &quot;The Council's primary objective is to ensure that Jeep stands for leadership in responsible four-wheeling.&quot;  <BR>
	The Jeep Marketing Environmental Council consists of representatives from the U.S. Forest Service, Bureau of Land Management, &quot;Tread Lightly!&quot;, California Association of  Four Wheel Drive Clubs, The United Four Wheel Drive Association and the Jeep and Eagle Division of Chrysler Corporation.<BR>
	The Council was established in 1989 to provide guidance in the development of Jeep communications that project an environmentally responsible image, as it relates to four-wheel drive activity.  <BR>
	&quot;We realize that our position in communicating with outdoor enthusiasts includes taking a responsible position toward the preservtion and use of our natural resources,&quot; said Suchara.   <BR>
(09495)	( more ) <BR>
	- 2 -<BR>

<P>	Suchara explained that the council's mission statement is comprised of three objectives. <BR>
	&quot;The council minimizes the potential for creating Jeep advertising and merchandising that could depict vehicles being used improperly off-highway,&quot; she said. &quot;They provide guidelines for the development of environmentally responsible marketing and communications and serve as an authoritative, credible review board.&quot; <BR>
	Chrysler Corporation's commitment is endorsed by a Corporate policy which consists of environmental principles to guide its employees worldwide in an environmentally responsible manner in their daily activities and business practices.<BR>
	&quot;We realize that our position in communicating with outdoor enthusiasts includes taking a responsible position toward the preservation and use of our natural resources,&quot; said Suchara.<BR>
	She added that Chrysler remains a leading corporate force in `Tread Lightly', an educational program designed to inform off-highway and other recreational vehicle users of their responsibilities to the environment.<BR>

       Highland Park, Mich. -- </B>Chrysler Corporation set an all-time record for calendar year retail sales to dealers in 1994, smashing the previous record set in 1988 by 133,056 units.  Total 1994 car and truck sales of 2,203,995 reflected an eight percent improvement over 1993.  The total sales number included 23 separate divisional and product line records for the calendar year -- including best total truck sales in the Corporation's history -- and five major records in similar categories for the fourth quarter. <BR>
	&quot;I think this year we broke the record for breaking records,&quot; said Theodor R. Cunningham, Executive Vice President -- Sales and Marketing and General Manager -- Minivan Operations.  &quot;We beat the old total truck sales record by nearly 180,000 units.  It was our best year ever for minivans -- despite growing competition, best year ever for Dodge Truck, best year ever for Jeep&reg; and for the Jeep-Eagle Division, and the list goes on.  And, in fact, I'm beginning to sound like a broken record myself when I reiterate that the most impressive number of all -- our best calendar year retail performance in the history of the Corporation -- is a credit to our outstanding dealer network and to some truly great products.&quot;  <BR>

	Total vehicle sales for December were 168,435, an increase of five percent over last year, and the best December performance in six years.  It was the 35th consecutive monthly increase and also included the Company's best-ever retail performance for December.<BR>
	December car sales of 63,057 were up four percent from December 1993, and also reflected a 25 percent increase in retail sales to dealers.<BR>
	Dodge Intrepid again led the way with sales of 11,558, followed by the new Chrysler Cirrus with 6,775, Chrysler New Yorker and LHS with 5,460, Chrysler Concorde with 4,762, and Eagle Vision with 2,374.  It was the 17th consecutive monthly record for Dodge Intrepid and the fifth consecutive record for Eagle Vision.<BR>
	Total truck sales of 105,378 were up five percent from last year -- the 41st consecutive monthly increase and the 11th consecutive monthly record.<BR>
	Dodge Truck also posted its 11th consecutive monthly record with sales of 54,628  -- primarily on the strength of Dodge Ram, which charged ahead by 38 percent over last year on sales of 19,763 units.<BR>
	Both Jeep and the Jeep-Eagle Division set separate third consecutive monthly sales records.  Jeep Wrangler also set a new December record with sales of 4,834, posting its fourth consecutive monthly record.<BR>

CHRYSLER SPONSORS MAJOR <BR>
SOUTH AFRICAN ART EXHIBITION IN U.S.</B></PRTitle><BR>
<B> </B> </center><BR>
  <B> </B><P align ="left"><B><BR>
       Highland Park, Mich. -- </B>  Chrysler Corporation announces its sponsorship of a brand new South African Art exhibition entitled, <I>Panoramas of Passage:  Changing Landscapes of South Africa</I>, which will make its United States' debut in Washington, D.C. and travel to major museums across the country.<BR>
	Jointly organized by the Meridian International Center in Washington, D.C. and the University of Witwatersrand Art Galleries in Johannesburg, this major exhibition of South African art will open at the Meridian Cafritz Galleries in mid-October.<BR>
	More than 80 South African artists, representing the multi-racial aspect of the new South Africa, will be featured in the exhibit.  Approximately 100 of the artists' works will be on display, including stone rubbings, oils, acrylics, watercolors, lithography, wood sculpture, photographs and videos.<BR>
	&quot;The pieces in this exhibition tell the story of the hard work and determination of the people of South Africa.  Not only does it reveal the pain and the struggle, but it also tells the story of triumph and hope,&quot; said A.C. (Bud) Liebler, Chrysler's Vice President--Marketing and Communications.<BR>
(31495)	<B>- more -</B><BR>
	-2-<BR>
	The theme of <I>Panoramas of Passage</I> highlights a broad interpretation of landscape.  Land, its possession and dispossession and the many ways it has been used or abused, has been at the heart of political and cultural issues in South Africa for many years.<BR>
	The United States tour will be presented in cooperation with the Embassy of South Africa.  Franklin Sonn, the Ambassador of South Africa said, &quot;<I>Panoramas of Passage</I> is a timely and important undertaking which will provide an opportunity for Americans to appreciate what has produced the miracle of the new South Africa.  The exhibition is reflective of the new realities of South Africa's government of National Unity.&quot;<BR>
<I>	Panoramas of Passage</I> premiered in South Africa at the renowned Grahamstown Festival in July.

       Auburn Hills, Mich. -- </B>Chrysler Corporation announced today that its daily sales rate set a record for June and that its sales total for April through June was the highest for any quarter in the Company's history.<BR>
	June sales in the United States totaled 228,828 vehicles, compared with 236,404 a year ago, when June sales set a record for any month. There was one less sales day in June this year, so the daily sales rate was 1 percent higher than a year ago, breaking a record.<BR>
	The June performance brought Chrysler's second-quarter sales total to 704,586 vehicles, smashing the any-quarter record of 630,737 set in the April-June period of 1994.<BR>
	&quot;We're continuing to see strong demand for our innovative cars, minivans, trucks and Jeep&reg; vehicles,&quot; said James P. Holden, Executive Vice President - Sales and Marketing. &quot;We've had eight months in a row with year-over-year increases in the sales rate. And we've followed a record first quarter with a second quarter that's better than any in the Company's history.<BR>
(more)<BR>
- 2 -<BR>
	&quot;We're in good shape overall when it comes to production capacity and things seem set for a solid summer to follow a fantastic spring,&quot; Holden said.<BR>
	Quarterly records were set by the Dodge Division, the Jeep/Eagle Division, Dodge Ram Pickup, Dodge and Plymouth Neon, and for the combined total of JA-body cars, Chrysler Cirrus, Dodge Stratus and Plymouth Breeze.<BR>
	Total truck sales for the quarter were 448,467 -- the first time they have surpassed 400,000. The previous record was 396,438 in 1994's second quarter.<BR>
	Second-quarter car sales were 256,119 -- the highest quarterly total since the July-September period of 1989. <BR>
	Among June's sales records were the combined total for the JA cars, Dodge Ram Pickup, Jeep&reg; Wrangler and the Town &amp; Country, Chrysler's luxury minivan. Dodge truck sales set a 14th consecutive monthly record.<BR>

<P><center><PRTitle><B>ALL-NEW, WELL-EQUIPPED CHRYSLER CIRRUS INTRODUCED AT $17,970</B></PRTitle><BR>
<B> </B> </center><BR>
  <B> </B><P align ="left"><B><BR>
       Auburn Hills, Mich. -- </B>Chrysler Corporation today announced the Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price for the new cab-forward 1995 Chrysler Cirrus LX luxury sports sedan is $17,970, which includes destination charges.<BR>

<P>	&quot;This is a well-equipped vehicle that takes into consideration all the features customers in the compact/midsize sedan market told us they would like,&quot; said Steve Torok, General Manager, Chrysler/Plymouth Division.  &quot;We learned buyers in this segment want to purchase a well-equipped car without the hassle of sifting through a long list of options.  They have asked us to simplify the complexity and we're responding with two models.&quot;<BR>

<P>	As a result, standard equipment on the Cirrus LX will include a 2.5L, 24-valve SOHC, V-6 engine mated to a fully-adaptive electronic four-speed automatic transmission; antilock brakes; speed proportional steering; air conditioning; power windows, locks and mirrors; AM/FM cassette radio; personal security package; driver's manual seat height adjuster and lumbar support; cruise control; full folding rear seat; grab handles; illuminated visor vanity mirrors; reading lamps; tilt steering column; electric rear window defroster; fog lamps; trunk cargo net; and floor mats.<BR>

<P>	The top-of-the-line Cirrus LXi will reflect this same philosophy, adding touring level suspension, 15-inch aluminum wheels and all-season touring tires, leather <BR>

<P>
<P>(36294-S)	(more)<BR>

<P>-2-<BR>

<P>interior including steering wheel and shift knob, theft alarm, premium 100-watt audio system including power antenna, and eight-way power driver's seat, for the price of $19,900, which includes destination charges.<BR>

<P>	The vehicle will go on sale at Chrysler/Plymouth dealerships throughout the United States at the end of October 1994.<BR>

<P>	Cirrus was developed by the company's Large Car Platform Team to go head-to-head with the major import competition.  It offers more standard equipment at a lower cost than any vehicle in its class.  Chrysler Cirrus will list from $1,200 to $5,000 less than vehicles such as Nissan Altima, Honda Accord and Toyota Camry, comparably-equipped.<BR>

<P>	&quot;We're confident the Cirrus offers the right combination of visually-distinctive design, outstanding interior package, true &quot;fun-to-drive&quot; handling and performance, along with a full complement of safety features -- all at an affordable price,&quot; said Torok.  &quot;Buyers who are looking to replace a similarly-sized import vehicle, or even one smaller, will find Cirrus offers much more for less.&quot;<BR>

<P>	While the Chrysler Cirrus is positioned in the luxury end of the four-door compact/midsize market, its counterpart the new Dodge Stratus, available in early February 1995, will broaden coverage of the line by appealing to more price-sensitive buyers who want a standard four-cylinder versus V-6 equipped package.<BR>

<P>	While final prices and specifications have not been established for Dodge Stratus, it is anticipated that it will be fully competitive with both its domestic and import competition.   A 2.0L, 16-valve SOHC, four-cylinder engine mated to a five-speed manual transmission will be the base powertrain.  The featured powertrain will be a new 2.4L, 16-valve DOHC, four-cylinder engine with a fully-adaptive electronic four-speed automatic transmission. The V6 engine will also be available.<BR>

       Highland Park, Mich. -- </B> More than 1,000 Jeep&reg; owner/enthusiasts from all over the nation will gather in the heart of the Rockies for a three-day festival September 8-10 as Chrysler Corporation hosts its first-ever annual `Camp Jeep.'<BR>
	The weekend-long extravaganza, to be held 24 miles southeast of Vail in Camp Hale, Colorado, will emphasize the environment, education and <BR>
entertainment. Camp Jeep is designed to let Jeep owners learn more about the off-highway capabilities of their vehicles, and discover first-hand why Jeep is the premier name in sport-utility vehicles.<BR>
	&quot;Owning a Jeep means having a passport to the Great Outdoors at a <BR>
moment's notice,&quot; said Ed Brust, General Manager, Jeep and Eagle Division. <BR>
&quot;Camp Jeep is a dream come true for many of our loyal owners.&quot;<BR>
	Activities planned for Camp Jeep include a 4x4 vehicle training course <BR>
with tips from experts on how to enjoy off-highway driving in a safe and <BR>
responsible manner. Roughly 30 trails, each one designated for beginner, <BR>
intermediate or advanced drivers, will be available for use in half-day and full-day formats.<BR>
(31395)- more -<BR>
<B>-2-</B> <BR>
	Other Camp Jeep activities include hiking and mountain biking on thousands of acres under a special permit issued by the U.S. Forest Service. There will also be fly-fishing seminars from The Orvis&reg; Company experts, and a Saturday concert featuring Kenny Loggins and Michael McDonald. A historical vehicle collection highlighting 50 years of civilian Jeep vehicles will be on display, and owners are being encouraged to discuss their products with a wide range of Jeep engineers and designers.<BR>
	An Environmental Center featuring a forum on environmental issues and <BR>
concerns is also on the Camp Jeep activity list. Chrysler is working with the <BR>
National Forest Foundation on a re-vegetation plan for the area, and will<BR>
fertilize an adjacent area for elk to graze.<BR>
	The registration fee for the three-day event is $195 per Jeep vehicle (there is no per-person charge). Registrations will be taken on a first-come, first-serve basis, with attendance limited to 2,500 Jeep vehicles. Owners interested in attending Camp Jeep should call 1-800-789-JEEP to register or for more information.<BR>

       Auburn Hills, Mich. -- </B>The 1995 Chrysler Cirrus and Dodge Stratus, Chrysler's newest entry into the compact car market, received &quot;Design and Engineering Awards&quot; from <U>Popular Mechanics</U> for outstanding achievement in the automotive field, and will be featured in the magazine's January 1995 issue.  The products were selected by the magazine's editors from thousands of nominations in eight categories.<BR>
	&quot;Even if they didn't have a brand-new 2.4 -liter engine, crash-resistant technology, new serviceability and luxury appointments, Chrysler's Cirrus and Dodge's Stratus would still win a Design and Engineering Award simply because they are the best looking cars of '95,&quot; said <U>Popular Mechanics</U> Editor-in-Chief Joe Oldham.<BR>
	&quot;Chrysler takes its cab-forward styling to the next level with these cars, and they'll go head-to-head with the best of their class,&quot;  added Oldham.  &quot;Cirrus and Stratus deliver fun-to-drive performance and handling to back up their terrific looks.&quot;  <BR>
	 The 1995 Chrysler Cirrus is arriving in dealer showrooms this month.  The  Dodge Stratus will be available in January, 1995.<BR>

<P><center><PRTitle><B>CHRYSLER SCORES BEST NOVEMBER EVERIN BOTH TOTAL AND RETAIL SALES</B></PRTitle><BR>
<B> </B> </center><BR>
  <B> </B><P align ="left"><B><BR>
       Highland Park, Mich. -- </B>  Chrysler Corporation recorded the best November sales performance in the Company's history -- in both total vehicle sales and in retail sales.  Total sales of 168,112 were one percent ahead of last November, the previous record, while retail sales moved ahead by five percent.<BR>
	&quot;Once again, we're especially delighted with the numbers behind the numbers -- the continued increases in our retail sales by dealers,&quot; Theodor R. <BR>
Cunningham, Executive Vice President - Sales and Marketing and General Manager - Minivan Operations, said.  &quot;By the retail sales measure, trucks climbed four percent and cars were up seven percent.  Not only is this a sign of robust business, it's the best possible indicator of strong consumer demand for our products,&quot; Cunningham said.<BR>
	New November records for total sales were set by Jeep&reg;, Dodge Truck and Corporate Truck -- adding up to a seven percent increase in overall truck sales to 106,665 units.  November marked the 40th consecutive monthly increase for truck sales.  <BR>
	<BR>
<B>-more-</B><BR>
(51594)<BR>
 - 2 -	Dodge Truck sales totaled 53,320, up 17 percent over last November and the tenth consecutive monthly increase.  Dodge Ram led the way with a 60 percent leap over last year to 20,488 units -- smashing a record set in 1977 by nearly 6,000 units.  Jeep&reg; vehicles combined for total sales of 38,353, including a new November record for Jeep Wrangler, with sales of 5,904, and another new record for Jeep Grand Cherokee, with sales of 21,634.<BR>
	Total car sales of 61,447 were eight percent below last year, despite new November records for Chrysler Concorde and LHS, Dodge Intrepid and Eagle Vision, and a 4,499-unit blast-off by <U>Motor Trend</U> magazine 'Car of the Year' Chrysler Cirrus.  The deficit is due primarily to depletion of  the long-running and high volume Dodge Shadow and Spirit and Plymouth Sundance and Acclaim.  In setting its fourth consecutive monthly record, Eagle Vision helped lead the Jeep-Eagle Division to its best November ever, with total vehicle sales of 43,890.  <BR>

CHRYSLER AND TOP MUSICIANS BAND TOGETHER <BR>
TO STOP DRUNK DRIVING</B></PRTitle><BR>
<B> </B> </center><BR>
  <B> </B><P align ="left"><B><BR>
       Los Angeles, Ca -- </B> With the goal of stopping alcohol-related traffic fatalities, Chrysler Corporation will team with some of the world's top recording artists in an endeavor called Recording Artists Against Drunk Driving (R.A.D.D.).  Chrysler will be the underwriting supporter of R.A.D.D., a non-profit organization started in 1986 to use the popularity of musicians to carry the message that drinking and driving is a deadly combination.<BR>
	With the incidence of drunk driving fatalities hitting the younger generation the hardest, R.A.D.D. was founded by then-San Jose, Calif., radio personalities Ken Anthony and Mort Weinstein as a vehicle to reach this audience.  Chrysler Corporation will sponsor an all-star music video as well as commit funding to support the day-to-day operations of R.A.D.D., allowing the organization to get its message out through print, audio and video Public Service Announcements (PSA's) through 1994.<BR>
	&quot;R.A.D.D. has a unique opportunity to reach their target audience - namely people under the age of 35 - through the efforts of these recording artists,&quot; said A.C. &quot;Bud&quot; Liebler, Chrysler Vice President, Marketing and Communications.  &quot;This <BR>
group is influenced by what they hear on the radio and what they see in music<BR>
videos.  By communicating the deadly consequences of drinking and driving, we have a real opportunity to make a difference.&quot;<BR>
(05694)	-more-<BR>

<P>-2-<BR>
	While it has been around since 1986, R.A.D.D. will make a dramatic re-birth with the introduction of the &quot;Drive My Car&quot; video, an all-star music video featuring over 20 recording artists - including Clint Black, Clarence Clemmons, Phil Collins, Los Lobos, Paul McCartney, Patty Smyth, Ringo Starr and Travis Tritt - singing the legendary Beatles tune.  <BR>
	The video will make its debut on Monday, February 7 on the American Music Awards (ABC-TV, 9:00 p.m. EST).<BR>
	R.A.D.D. will follow-up the release of the video with a series of audio and video PSA's and a compact disc of recordings aimed at delivering the &quot;Don't Drink and Drive&quot; message.    <BR>
	&quot;Through the work of R.A.D.D., we will reach the most susceptible age group to drinking and driving,&quot; Liebler said.  &quot;But it won't be done in an abrasive, self-righteous way.  All we're saying is, `If you drink, please don't drive.  Give up the keys to someone who is sober.' We think this approach will hit home.&quot;<BR>
	Chrysler will use a unique angle of linking a product that is certain to be popular with younger audiences to tie into the important message.  R.A.D.D. will use the new Dodge/Plymouth Neon in the &quot;Drive My Car&quot; video, as well as in promotional materials and in R.A.D.D.-supported events. <BR>
	&quot;People have always identified with products that are popular and fun, and Neon is sure to be one of these products,&quot; Liebler said.  &quot;We hope that by linking Neon with the musicians in R.A.D.D., our key audience will pay more attention to the message that drinking and driving is a deadly combination.<BR>

<P>-more-<BR>

<P>-3-<BR>
	&quot;This isn't just about marketing a product, it's about taking on responsibility to help stamp out one of the top killers in this age group.&quot;   <BR>
	Chrysler will offer the compact disc in March through a special 900-number.  The disc will include the &quot;Drive My Car&quot; track, as well as nine other car-related songs.  The disc will sell for $6.99, with all proceeds from the endeavor going to assist in further underwriting R.A.D.D.'s efforts.  <BR>
	Just as the recording industry provides R.A.D.D. with unique avenues to carry out the message against drunk driving, Chrysler will use some of its own channels to help generate awareness.  Chrysler will link R.A.D.D. with its &quot;Jeep/Eagle Health and Fitness Tour, Sponsored by Plymouth/Dodge Neon&quot; a 25-city campus expo designed to show college students healthy lifestyle choices.<BR>
   	R.A.D.D. will also become a part of the Chrysler Drunk Driving Simulator tour, a massive campaign designed to show drivers the effects of drinking on human motor skills.  A special Neon uses a portable computer to simulate the affects drinking has on the reactions of a person.  By dialing in the driver's weight and amount of alcohol that person might consume at a party or at a bar over a given length of time, the car becomes drunk.  The driver then has to negotiate a course with the reactions of a drunk person built into the steering and the brakes.  Since its inception in 1988, the Drunk Driving Simulator has sent a sobering message to over 90,000 drivers across the country.<BR>

WITH TRUCK SALES TOPPING BEST MAY EVER</B></PRTitle><BR>

  <B> </B><P align ="left"><B><BR>
       Highland Park, Mich. -- </B> Total Chrysler vehicle sales of 207,754 amounted to the best May sales performance in six years, and the third consecutive month of sales topping 200,000 units -- a Corporate milestone.<BR>
	For total truck sales, it was the best May performance in Company history, with 128,581 units representing a six percent increase over last year.  Dodge Ram sales zoomed 218 percent over last May to 20,428, also beating the best-May-ever record of 17,094 set in 1978.  Jeep&reg; Grand Cherokee also turned in the best May ever with sales of 20,145.  Jeep&reg; Wrangler broke an all-time high set just two months ago on sales of 8,078. <BR>
	Total car sales of 79,173 were off five percent from last year.  However, Dodge Intrepid sales of 11,824 led a series of May sales records that also included Chrysler Concorde, New Yorker and LHS.  Plymouth and Dodge Neon recorded the best month yet with combined sales of 18,373 -- a 19 percent jump over April.<BR>

<P>	&quot;Thanks largely to the efforts of our dealers, we've enjoyed one incredible spring, and it appears that sales continue to be strong as we head into the summer months, despite the fact that our stocks are getting lower,&quot; Theodor R. Cunningham, Executive Vice President -- Sales and Marketing and General Manager -- Minivan Operations, said.  <BR>
	Chrysler has a 48-day supply of cars and a 43-day supply of trucks, overall, with less than 30-days' supply of its hottest sellers.  <BR>
	&quot;Even though our total car sales were off slightly, we actually saw our retail car sales numbers increase by one percent -- the best results in four years.  In addition, our truck sales at retail were up eight percent over last year,&quot; Cunningham said.<BR>

TO HELP REVOLUTIONIZE EDUCATION</B></PRTitle><BR>
<B> </B> </center><BR>
  <B> </B><P align ="left"><B><BR>
       Lansing, Mi -- </B>Calling America's  workforce &quot;educationally unprepared to compete with other workforces around the world,&quot; the Vice Chairman of Chrysler Corporation challenged business to &quot;take the lead in revolutionizing America's education system.&quot; <BR>
	&quot;While educators seek to reform their institutions, we in business are revolutionizing ours to keep ahead of global competition,&quot; said Thomas G. Denomme, in a speech today to the Michigan Business Leaders for Education Excellence (MBLEE)  &quot;We don't have time to work for incremental reform in education.  This kind of reform won't keep us competitive.  It's going to take a revolution.&quot;<BR>
	For years, said Denomme, the Big Three and many other businesses have sought education reform in a variety of ways: by advocating a longer school year, for example, by developing school-to-work programs with schools, and by donating millions of dollars toward special educational programs.<BR>

<P>(more)<BR>
(45594)<BR>

<P>-2-<BR>
	&quot;Despite these efforts, the young people coming to us from our schools -- the same schools we support with our tax dollars -- are continuing to fall short of our needs, putting our nation and our future standard of living, competitively speaking, at risk,&quot;  said Denomme.<BR>
	Denomme spoke at an MBLEE conference held today at the Holiday Inn-South, in Lansing.  MBLEE is a coalition of Michigan businesses connected with the Business Roundtable.  This initiative works in conjunction with the University of Michigan and the Michigan Chamber of Commerce and seeks a responsible agenda for education reform in Michigan.<BR>
	Citing the needs of the Big Three, Denomme said that, between now and the year 2000, roughly half the 200,000 hourly workforce of Chrysler, Ford and General Motors will be eligible for retirement. <BR>
	&quot;This change is nothing short of a workplace revolution,&quot; said Denomme.<BR>
	&quot;This huge turnover gives us the opportunity to put in place the  most highly skilled and well-trained workforce any auto company has ever had.<BR>
	&quot;If we do this right, our labor force can rival those in Germany and Japan, in terms of their academic training and technical knowledge.<BR>
	&quot;But it won't be easy,&quot; he said, because of at least &quot;three fundamental barriers to reaching parity with Japan and Germany:&quot;<BR>
	One, the United States is the only industrialized nation without a first-class system of school-to-work education.<BR>
	Two, even though 75 percent of America's high school graduates won't graduate from a four-year college, most high school curricula is college prep.<BR>
(more)<BR>

<P>-3-<BR>
	Three, between 1992 and the year 2000, almost 90 percent of the jobs created in America will require post-secondary levels of literacy and math skills, but only half of the new entrants to the labor force are likely to possess such skills. <BR>
	&quot;Somehow,&quot; Denomme said, &quot;business has got to encourage educators to embrace fundamental change.  And once they do, to make changes at a faster rate than is currently being done.&quot;<BR>

       Auburn Hills, Mich. -- </B>Chrysler Corporation today announced increased suggested retail prices on certain 1997 Chrysler, Dodge and Plymouth vehicles.<BR>
	<P>The increases, which take effect with vehicles shipped January 7, 1997, range from $30 on Dodge Stratus and Plymouth Breeze  to $200 on all-wheel-drive models of Dodge Grand Caravan and Chrysler Town &amp; Country.  A number of option price increases also take effect January 7, and many of the base price changes are for vehicles on which these options are standard. <BR>
	<P>In addition, prices for entry-level Dodge and Plymouth Neon have been revised to reflect addition of an AM/FM radio with four speakers and dual remote exterior mirrors as standard equipment. Since fall, all entry-level Neons have been produced with this equipment, so the base price increase results in no change to the current delivered price.  <BR>

       Highland Park, Mich. -- </B> Chrysler Corporation set a new all-time monthly record with March sales of 230,386 cars and trucks.  The old record of 223,787 vehicle sales was set in March 1988.<BR>
	Total truck sales of 141,715 were also a historic high, beating the June 1993 record of 122,439.  Dodge Division also set a new monthly record with sales of 111,994, breaking the old mark of 110,893 set in September 1986.  And Chrysler Town &amp; Country, Dodge Caravan and Plymouth Voyager minivans posted an all-time first quarter record of 140,773 sales and the second best sales month ever with March sales of 60,113.<BR>
	&quot;We can credit higher sales to a strengthening economy and rising consumer confidence, but records like these are the direct result of just two things . . . hard work and great product.  They were earned through the efforts of our employees and our suppliers to design and build dramatically new products that represent real value; and the dedication of our dealer network to back those products with outstanding customer service,&quot;  said Theodor R. Cunningham, Executive Vice President - Sales and Marketing, and General Manager - Minivan Operations.<BR>
	Total vehicle sales were up 23 percent from March of last year, while retail sales climbed by 33 percent -- the 28th consecutive monthly increase in retail sales.<BR>

	March was also Chrysler's best car sales month since August 1989, with total sales of 88,671 units -- 13 percent over last year.  Plymouth and Dodge Neon led the charge on combined sales of 13,824, with Dodge Intrepid turning in a best-ever performance at 13,498. A best month ever record was also set by Chrysler Concorde, and best March sales records were turned in by Plymouth Sundance and Dodge Shadow.<BR>
	Total truck sales in March were 29 percent ahead of March 1993 -- the 32nd consecutive monthly increase.  Best month ever records were set by Dodge Ram, Jeep&reg; Wrangler, and Chrysler Town &amp; Country.  Dodge Ram sales of 20,618 were 110 percent ahead of last year -- breaking a March 1977 record of 20,008.  Jeep Wrangler set the 16th consecutive monthly record with sales of 7,920 units. Chrysler Town &amp; Country set a best month ever record with sales of 4,096 luxury Minivans.  March sales records were set by Dodge Caravan at 30,805, Plymouth Voyager at 25,212, and Jeep Grand Cherokee at 21,461.<BR>

<P><center><PRTitle><B>CHRYSLER ANNOUNCES TWO ALTERNATIVE FUEL VEHICLES,<BR>
UPSWING IN '94 CNG SALES</B></PRTitle><BR>
<B> </B> </center><BR>
  <B> </B><P align ="left"><B><BR>
       Auburn Hills, Mich. -- </B> Dodge Truck will offer both its Dodge Ram 1500/2500 and Dodge Dakota pickup trucks as Compressed Natural Gas-powered (CNG) vehicles in 1995, making Chrysler Corporation the nation's largest manufacturer of alternative fuel vehicles.<BR>
	Demand for Chrysler's CNG vehicles is up sharply by fleet -- and some consumer --  customers in the 1994 model year with a near three-fold increase in sales over 1993.  Chrysler sold 1,450 CNG vehicles in the 1994 model year.  The mix included about 1,000 Ram Vans and 450 minivans.  Chrysler sold 445 CNG vehicles in 1993.  <BR>
	&quot;Because of the approaching Clean Air schedules in states such as California, alternative fuel fleet vehicle demand continues to increase,&quot; explained A. Mike Clement, manager of alternative fuel vehicles sales and marketing.  &quot;The pickups give us a more comprehensive fleet offering in addition to our full-size Dodge Ram van and minivan CNG models.  We're confident that increased awareness of CNG, coupled with our marketing efforts, will help us to find a reasonably solid market.&quot;  <BR>
	With the announcement, Chrysler will be offering six production vehicles with alternative fuels in 1995.  In addition to the pickups, Chrysler offers the Dodge Ram Van and Wagon CNG, the Dodge Caravan/Plymouth Voyager CNG, the Dodge Intrepid methanol Flexible Fuel Vehicle (FFV) and the Dodge Caravan/Plymouth Voyager Electrics.  <BR>
(22594-S)	-more-<BR>
-2-<BR>
	Chrysler is also the first and only manufacturer to certify vehicles in the three cleanest categories under California's Low Emission Vehicle schedules.  The Ram Van and Wagon CNG are certified as Low Emission Vehicles (LEV), the Caravan/Voyager CNG are certified as Ultra Low Emission Vehicles (ULEV) and the Caravan/Voyager Electrics are certified as Zero Emission Vehicles (ZEV).    All the CNG vehicles meet the federal Inherently Low Emission Vehicle (ILEV) standard.<BR>
	The pickups are targeted for LEV status under California Clean Air schedules and will be built at Chrysler's Warren, Mich. Truck Assembly Plant.  The CNG completion work will be conducted at Chrysler's CNG/Electric Vehicle Completion Center in Windsor, Ontario.<BR>
	The CNG Dakota and Ram are powered by a 5.2-liter V-8 engine and the CNG is stored in one main tank in the bed of the truck.  The fuel is stored at about 3,000 pounds per square inch (psi) pressure, providing the equivalent of about 17 gallons of gasoline on the Ram and about 14 gallons on the Dakota.  Range will typically be about 200 miles for each vehicle. <BR>
	The CNG option for the pickups will cost about $5,000 over the regular vehicle price.  However, Clement said incentives from state and federal governments, gas utilities, and other  sources can reduce or sometimes eliminate the additional cost.   For instance in California, incentives total more than $4,000 from combined sources.<BR>
	Chrysler's ongoing dealer marketing, sales and service program is the only one of its kind dedicated to alternative fuel vehicles.  The program targets Clean Air Act non-attainment cities like Los Angeles, San Francisco, and New York, bringing dealers, utilities and Chrysler together in a market to help develop fleet and consumer markets for CNG vehicles.<BR>
	-more-<BR>

<P>-3-<BR>
	As part of the program, Chrysler urges dealers to stock CNG vehicles for fleet and retail markets.  In return, Chrysler provides a full-line of sales, marketing and service training support.  Utilities work with their local dealerships to develop the customer base and commit to developing refueling infrastructure.<BR>
	Clement said Chrysler CNG sales could top 4,000 in 1995.  But while the CNG vehicles are an attractive and marketable solution to severe air pollution problems, there are some drawbacks to the technology.<BR>
	&quot;While natural gas vehicles are somewhat restricted by range due to fuel storage constraints, they are able to achieve extremely low emission levels without diminishing the basic performance and serviceability characteristics of the vehicle,&quot; said Richard Geiss, Executive Engineer for Jeep/Truck powertrain.  &quot;These are essential in making them attractive to fleet and retail consumers.   It is also essential that utility companies continue to develop refueling infrastructure.  Many utilities have established plans to develop the infrastructure further and have worked closely with Chrysler to move the market along.  Together, we have formed a very effective team.&quot;<BR>

	Chrysler established these awards to encourage and recognize the efforts of SEMA members that manufacture products for Dodge Truck and Jeep vehicles.  Judging for the awards was done by Chrysler's Jeep and Dodge Truck Image Team, a cross-functional team representing the disciplines of engineering, design, marketing, vehicle development and public relations.<BR>
	The judges were led by Rick Aneiros, Jeep and Dodge Truck Product Design Chief.  According to Aneiros, &quot;We were excited by the caliber of products that SEMA members are producing for our vehicles.  As we'd expected, the competition was tough.  However, following numerous trips through the exhibit floor and some long discussions by the Image Team judges, we finally agreed on the winners.&quot;<BR>
	The <U>1994 Chrysler SEMA Product Excellence Grand Award</U> was captured by Leer Specialty Products, in recognition of the overall quality of execution of the components displayed on a 1995 Dodge Ram Club Cab.  The extensive ground effect treatment, hooded mirrors, body-colored bug deflector and paint scheme/graphics were all cited as being well-balanced and in harmony with the truck's design and form.  Also praised was the innovative interior treatment to the box and a functional pop-up tonneau cover that was attached without drilling or permanent body attachments.<BR>

(47894-S)<BR>

<P>-2-<BR>

<P>	In addition to the Grand Award, Chrysler presented the following four awards recognizing product excellence. <BR>
	<U>1994 Chrysler SEMA Design Excellence Award</U> - Awarded to U.S. Concepts Corporation for its 4-door Dodge Ram Sport-Utility truck conversion.  U.S. Concepts was cited for its innovation in using reversed front doors in the rear, enabling a smooth blend of the door and quarter forms without requiring further major modifications.  Furthermore, with the hinges mounted on the C-pillar, U.S. Concepts provided excellent rear entry and egress.  The neat, clean and uncluttered exterior treatment, as well as tasteful interior upgrades, were also mentioned as strengths of the conversion.<BR>
	<U>1994 Chrysler SEMA Workmanship Excellence Award</U> - Awarded to Warn Industries, Inc., for its fender flares developed exclusively for the Dodge Ram pickup truck.  Warn Industries was cited for its fender flare design which both blends with and enhances the existing body surface allowing for increased track while maintaining wheels-to-body flushness.  The use of gasket material, which ensures uniform adherence to the truck's surface for flushness, and the attention to detail in fitting around the existing body trim were also seen as positive attributes.<BR>
	<U>1994 Chrysler SEMA &quot;Originality of Concept&quot; Excellence Award</U> - Awarded to Bestop, Inc., for its innovative designs of soft tops and accessories for the Jeep Wrangler.  Bestop was cited for its &quot;Windjammer&quot; rear windscreen and &quot;Trailcover&quot; tonneau top, products that have a natural synergy with the Jeep Wrangler as a lifestyle and recreational vehicle.  &quot;Clever and easy-to-use&quot; were adjectives that were universally applied to Bestop products for the Wrangler by the Image Team judges.<BR>

<P>
<P>(more)<BR>

<P>-3-<BR>

<P>	<U>1994 Chrysler SEMA &quot;Significance for Future Market Growth&quot; Product Excellence Award</U> - Awarded to Vortech Engineering, Inc., for its supercharger kit designed for the 5.9 liter Dodge Magnum V-8 and shown on a Dodge Ram truck.  Aftermarket performance products for the Dodge Truck line were cited as a potential growth opportunity for SEMA members.  Vortech's supercharger was seen as an excellent example of integrating performance parts into the Ram's underhood environment in a manner which provides functional improvement with a minimum of change to the original engine componentry.  The Dodge Ram truck used to showcase Vortech's supercharger was also praised for complimenting the overall performance image.<BR>

<B>   </B><P align ="left"><B><BR>
       Auburn Hills, Mich. -- </B>Chrysler Corporation has notified approximately 675,000 owners of 1991 and 1992  model - year minivans, Dodge Shadow and Plymouth Sundance vehicles to have dealers inspect  the steering wheel for cracks.  <BR>
	<P>Specifically, the recall includes 1991 and 1992 model year Chrysler, Dodge and Plymouth brand minivans produced from January 1991 through June 1992.  Plymouth Sundance and Dodge Shadow 1991 and 1992 models in the recall include those with four-cylinder engines and manual transmissions, produced from July 1990 through June 1992. <BR>
	<P>In very rare instances, cracks may occur in the steering wheel due to metal fatigue.  Drivers will experience obvious warning with the steering wheel becoming noticeably loose.  Dealers will inspect the steering wheel for cracks and replace the steering wheel if necessary.  If no cracks are apparent, a retainer plate will be installed where the steering wheel attaches to the steering column, to prevent the remote possibility of future separation.  <BR>
	<P>Chrysler Corporation is not aware of any accidents or injuries.<BR>

<P><center><PRTitle><B>CHRYSLER TO OFFER 1996 MINIVANS AS CNG</B></PRTitle><BR>
<B> </B> </center><BR>
  <B> </B><P align ="left"><B><BR>
       Highland Park, Mich. -- </B>Chrysler Corporation will offer the 1996 Grand Voyager and Grand Caravan minivans as Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) vehicles, giving Chrysler the most comprehensive CNG vehicle line in the industry.<BR>
	Chrysler also recently announced it is the first major manufacturer to receive Inherently Low Emission Vehicle (ILEV) certification from U.S. EPA for four of its compressed natural gas (CNG) vehicles.  All 1996 Chrysler CNG vehicles will be certified as Ultra Low Emission Vehicles (ULEV) under California clean air schedules.<BR>
	The 1996 CNG minivans will be offered in the long-wheel-base configuration for the first time, allowing the addition of a fifth tank and more than the equivalent of 10 gallons of gasoline.  That will boost the minivans range to more than 200 miles.<BR>
	&quot;The introduction of the new Dodge Caravan CNG continues a three year string of introducing new alternative fuel vehicles (AFVs) and will insure that Chrysler continues its AFV sales leadership,&quot; said Mike Clement, manager of alternative fuel vehicles fleet sales and marketing.  &quot;Being the first major manufacturer to receive ILEV certification for our other CNG vehicles also solidifys Chrysler's commitment to bringing meaningful alternative fuel vehicles to market.&quot;<BR>
(31095)	-more-<BR>

<P>-2-<BR>

<P>	The new Dodge Grand Caravan and Plymouth Grand Voyager CNGs will be available as a late 1996 model year vehicles and are the company's sixth major alternative fuel vehicle introduction in three years.<BR>
	With the ILEV announcement, Chrysler is the first company to be certified in all of the major low emission categories as mandated by California law.  Last year, the 1994 Chrysler CNG minivan was certified as the first ULEV; in 1993 the Chrysler TEVan was certified as a Zero Emission Vehicle (ZEV) and in 1992, the full-size Dodge Ram Van CNG was certified as a Low Emission Vehicle (LEV).Chrysler was the first manufacturer to receive a ULEV certificate in January 1994 with its current generation minivan running on CNG.  <BR>
	The ULEV standard is the most stringent and difficult to achieve beyond the Zero Emission Vehicle (ZEV) -- or electric vehicle -- mandate.  Chrysler's 3.3-liter V-6 engine will power the minivan and the 5.2-liter V-8 will power the full-size van and the pickup trucks.<BR>
	&quot;While most manufacturers are planning small four-cylinder gasoline-powered ULEVs for the turn of the decade, large displacement engines are a much more difficult proposition,&quot; said Reginold Modlin, manager of environmental and energy planning.  &quot;Using CNG may be the most technological and cost effective way of providing larger displacement engines at the ULEV level.<BR>

<P>-more-<BR>

<P>-3-<BR>

<P> 	The CNG minivan is powered by a 3.3-liter V-6 engine and stores the CNG in five main tanks located under the minivan body with no intrusion on passenger space.<BR>
	The fuel is stored at about 3,000 psi and with proper fueling equipment, can be stored as high as 3,600 psi, or about the equivalent of 11 gallons gasoline further extending range.<BR>
	Compared to gasoline vehicles, CNGs using a special three-way catalyst produce significantly less carbon monoxide (CO) and non-methane hydrocarbon emissions.  <BR>

       Highland Park, Mich. -- </B> The 1994 Dodge Ram Pickup was introduced<BR>
   at the beginning of the model year as one of the most distinctively styled<BR>
   trucks in the marketplace.  It will close out the 1994 model year as a record-<BR>
   setter.<BR>
     With almost a month to go, Dodge Ram Pickup today set a new Model<BR>
   Year record for sales in the U.S. market with a total of 187,668 units.  That<BR>
   breaks the old record of 187,633 set in 1987.  Full model year sales for the<BR>
   period Oct. 1, 1993 to Sept. 30, 1994 are expected to approach 200,000<BR>
   units.<BR>
     Since the introduction of the T300 last August, Ram Pickup has recorded<BR>
   several other records as well, including its best six-month sales ever in history<BR>
   (January - June with 112,202 units), its best quarter sales ever in history<BR>
   (60,837 units in the second quarter of 1994), and its best month ever in<BR>
   history (20,669 units in June 1994).<BR>
     In addition, with nine consecutive monthly records and sales running<BR>
   159 percent higher than a year ago, Ram Pickup has more than doubled its<BR>
   share in the Industry Light Pickup segment to 12.6 percent, 6.4 percentage<BR>
   points higher than model year 1993 (6.2 percent).<BR>

<P><center><PRTitle><B>CHRYSLER REPORTS RECORD THIRD QUARTER RESULTS</B></PRTitle><BR>
<B> </B> </center><BR>
  <B> </B><P align ="left"><B><BR>
       Highland Park, Mich. -- </B>Chrysler Corporation today announced third quarter 1994 net earnings of $651 million, or $1.60 per fully diluted common share ($1.76 per primary common share), -- a 107 percent improvement in net earnings over the same 1993 period after excluding the third quarter 1993 gain of $58 million on the sale of Mitsubishi Motors Corporation stock and a $51 million favorable income tax adjustment.<BR>
	Third quarter and first nine months 1994 records include:<BR>
 Third quarter net earnings of $651 million, exceeding the previous record of $423 million in third quarter 1993.<BR>
	 Third quarter primary earnings per common share of $1.76, surpassing the previous record of $1.42 in third quarter 1989.<BR>
 Third quarter pretax earnings of $1,063 million, exceeding the previous all-time high of $612 million in third quarter 1993.<BR>
 Pretax earnings for the first nine months of 1994 of $4,199 million, an increase of $1,585 million or 61 percent, over the previous record of $2,614 million in the comparable 1993 period.<BR>

<P>- 2 -<BR>
 Third quarter total sales and revenues of $11.7 billion, an increase of $2.0 billion or 20 percent, over the previous record of $9.7 billion in third quarter 1993.<BR>
 Total sales and revenues of $38.0 billion for the first nine months of 1994, an increase of $6.4 billion or 20 percent, over the previous record of $31.6 billion in the comparable 1993 period.<BR>
	Chrysler Chairman Robert J. Eaton said:<BR>
	&quot;We're very pleased with the third quarter results.  Strong retail demand for the Dodge and Plymouth Neon, Jeep Grand Cherokee, Dodge Ram, Chrysler minivans and our other products has allowed us to reduce incentives despite increased competition.   We are very encouraged by the high degree of acceptability our products are enjoying in the marketplace.&quot;<BR>
	Eaton said the third quarter results reflected Chrysler's strong product strategy, commitment to quality and cost management, and continuous improvement in all areas of our business.<BR>
	Chrysler's retail unit sales in the third quarter of 1994 were 204,061 cars and 348,564 trucks and minivans in the United States and Canada, compared to 220,922 cars and 309,979 trucks and minivans in the third quarter of 1993.<BR>
	Chrysler's worldwide factory unit sales in the first nine months of 1994 were 2,037,157, an increase of 12 percent over the comparable 1993 period.  <BR>
	International retail sales for the first nine months of 1994 totaled 95,172 units, up 19 percent over the same 1993 period.  Chrysler sold 52,161 vehicles in Europe in the first nine months of this year, an increase of 13 percent over the same 1993 period.<BR>

<P>	Chrysler's sales in the Far East continue to grow substantially.  Retail sales in Taiwan for the first nine months of 1994 increased 71 percent over 1993 levels to 11,810 units, while year-to-date retail sales in Japan grew to 10,409 units from 3,586 units for the same period in 1993.<BR>
	Chrysler Financial Corporation (CFC) reported third quarter 1994 net earnings of $50 million, compared to $22 million earned in the third quarter of 1993.  Included in third quarter 1993 net earnings is an unfavorable tax adjustment of $16 million reflecting the impact of the new corporate income tax rate on CFC.  Pretax earnings for the third quarter and first nine months of 1994 were $82 million and $226 million, respectively, compared to $64 million and $176 million for the same 1993 periods. <BR>

<P><center><PRTitle><B>CHRYSLER FORGES SERVICE TRAINING PARTNERSHIP WITH ATCON</B></PRTitle><BR>
<B> </B> </center><BR>
  <B> </B><P align ="left"><B><BR>
       Highland Park, Mich. -- </B> Chrysler Corporation, through its Dealership Service Development department, has forged a partnership with Applied Transportation Concepts, Inc. (ATcon) to bring advanced-level training to service managers at Chrysler dealerships across the country.<BR>
	A management consulting firm that specializes in service, parts, and body shop operations, ATcon is currently in its 11th year of operation.  Its active client base includes more than 3,000 customers, among them Toyota, Lexus and Cadillac.  <BR>
	&quot;In conversations with the other manufacturers we benchmarked, we identified the best Service Management training in the industry, and ATcon was the supplier,&quot; says Tom McRae, Manager, Dealership Service Development.  &quot;Based on what they were doing with other clients, Chrysler and ATcon sought out the best practices within the industry to help create the best professional service management training available for our dealer body.&quot;<BR>

(03395)<BR>

<P>- 2 -<BR>
	Through this partnership, Chrysler will add four advanced-level courses to its dealership management education curriculum.  The ATcon series will introduce new service management techniques, including how to deploy <BR>
superior structures, operating techniques and methods for achieving Chrysler's strategic initiatives.  At the core of the training is a dual focus on customer satisfaction and service department profitability.<BR>
	According to ATcon Vice-President Terry Carlisle, the purpose of this focus is to ensure long-term viability of the service department.  &quot;If you do not make and keep customers happy, then long-term you will go out of business,&quot; says Carlisle.  &quot;If you focus only on making customers happy while neglecting your responsibility as a profit center, the end result is just as predictable.  At no time during our involvement with our clients will we attempt to separate the issues of customer satisfaction and departmental profits.  You must have satisfied customers and be profitable to survive.&quot;<BR>
	The advanced-level training program is made up of three training phases:  an orientation to the training; completion of the four training courses; and follow-up participation in performance groups for qualifying managers.<BR>
	The orientation session is designed to set the stage for training, and is recommended for both the service manager and dealer principal or general manager from each participating dealership.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>- 3 -<BR>
	In the second phase of training, service managers continue through the four, two-day sessions in the curriculum, each of which culminates in a final competency exam for certification.  Course titles and content include:<BR>
Session 1:	The Seven Controllables - Making money is not a prerogative, its a responsibility.<BR>
	Session 2:	The Evolution of Organization - Knowing all of your structural options and how they work.<BR>
Session 3:	Personnel - The employment process from hiring to firing.<BR>
Session 4:	Marketing - Beyond advertising, how to create a market approach.<BR>
	Managers who achieve certification in all four sessions will be invited to participate in performance groups, with the third phase of the training scheduled to start in the Spring of 1996.  According to McRae, these groups are designed to help service managers track performance, compare strategies, and continue the evolution of the service department in peer groups.  As a form of long-range follow-up and growth, each performance group formed will meet three times annually, led by an ATcon facilitator.<BR>
	Pilot tests of the program with select service managers concluded in November.  According to McRae, feedback from the pilot participants was &quot;overwhelmingly&quot; positive.  We are looking forward to the official rollout of the orientation sessions in all 25 zones in early 1995.<BR>

       San Diego -- </B> Based on successful test market results in Milwaukee and Portland, Oregon, the Plymouth Division of Chrysler Corporation has expanded its &quot;Plymouth Place&quot; interactive shopping areas to five more cities, including two shopping malls in the San Diego area.<BR>
		&quot;Test market results from our first Plymouth Place stores show not only substantial, but sustained increases in sales and awareness of the Plymouth brand,&quot; said Plymouth National Marketing Plans Manager Steve Bruyn. &quot;We are confident that the expansion of Plymouth Place to additional markets around the country will have the same results and help Chrysler win back a significant share of the economy car market.&quot;<BR>
	Plymouth Place is an ideal first step in the shopping process, when people want to browse without sales pressure. Each mall site has product advisers who are knowledgeable about the Plymouth product line, and can refer interested customers to a Chrysler-Plymouth dealer in the area.<BR>
	The main feature of Plymouth Place is an interactive computer called the `Tech Cart.'  It's touch-activated system lets users select vehicle options, check pricing and even compare specifications with competing models. Users can get a printout of their chosen vehicle and dealership locations.<BR>
(37295)	- more - <BR>
	-2-<BR>
	The success of Plymouth Place in the very diverse Milwaukee and Portland test markets started earlier this year is evident. Plymouth's retail sales jumped 78 percent in the Milwaukee area and 58 percent in the Portland area in the first four months of Plymouth Place operations in those areas. That compares with a national increase of 42 percent in the same period.<BR>
	 Moreover, about 65,000 consumers visited Plymouth Place in Milwaukee between February 1 and July 31, while more than 35,000 people visited Plymouth Place in Portland. Of those, more than 20,000 obtained Tech Cart printouts.<BR>
	The number of printouts is significant because accessing the full range of the Plymouth Place Tech Cart's information can take more than 15 minutes. &quot;That means customers are showing more than idle curiosity when they come to Plymouth Place,&quot; said Bruyn.<BR>
	Plymouth Place not only provides a glimpse at the future of car shopping, but also shows how Plymouth is committed to reaching out to a new generation of consumers. Plymouth Place can also be visited on the World Wide Web at http://www.plymouthcars.com.<BR>
	 &quot;We are answering the needs and wants of many younger buyers who have grown up with computers and are now used to relying on new technology to get information,&quot; said Bruyn. &quot;Plymouth Place is the ideal spot to meld this technology with the car shopping process.&quot;<BR>

         The first Plymouth Place in-mall shopping stores were opened earlier this year in Portland and Milwaukee to raise awareness of the Plymouth brand among consumers, many of whom are buying a new vehicle for the first time.  Plymouth Place locations in St. Louis, as well as the Washington/Baltimore area and Dallas started operations within the last four weeks.<BR>
	Plymouth has been undergoing a complete revitalization as Chrysler repositions the brand to meet the needs and desires of younger buyers -- especially women -- seeking a high blend of style, value and versatility. With the Neon subcompact coupe and sedan and the redesigned Voyager/Grand Voyager minivans already in the line, Plymouth will soon introduce the Breeze, a compact sedan based on the successful Chrysler Cirrus and Dodge Stratus.<BR>
	The first Plymouth Place locations in the San Diego area include Fashion Valley Center at Highway 163 and Friars Road; and Plaza Bonita, at Interstate 805 and Sweetwater Road in National City. Those sites are tentatively scheduled to run through the end of October, with other locations to be determined. <BR>

<P><center><PRTitle><B>WITH ITS EXCITEMENT AND SPIRIT, <BR>
THE NEON CHALLENGE IS A PERFECT FIT FOR DODGE		</B></PRTitle><BR>
<B> </B> </center><BR>
  <B> </B><P align ="left"><B><BR>
       Highland Park, Mich. -- </B>- For the celebrity drivers in the Dodge Neon Challenge, the race is an opportunity to show they are more than just a success in television or politics or journalism.  For Dodge, the event is an opportunity to show the Neon is more than just another successful compact.  For the fans in the grandstands, the series provides a competitive, fun filled racing spectacle.<BR>
	Dodge is back for its second season of Neon Challenge celebrity races in an effort to show the racing world that its new image of spirited performance is alive and growing.<BR>
	&quot;Our brand is very distinctive within the Corporation,&quot; said Dodge General Manager Marty Levine.  &quot;It's aggressive, dynamic, expressive and fun.  It's almost maverick.  We don't have a lot of respect for conventional wisdom.<BR>
(22695-S)	-more-<BR>

<P>-2-<BR>
	&quot;And our brand positioning fits in perfectly with this series.  Face it, it's a bit maverick to go around the country with local and national celebrities and race a production car on grand prix-class road courses.  Most companies wouldn't do it  frankly because most cars <U>couldn't</U> do it.  But the Neon lives up to the challenge.&quot;<BR>
	While the Neon Challenge shows the true spirit of the car, it also allows Dodge to show its sporty, performance-driven image in a race setting, a fitting setting for the brand.<BR>
	&quot;The phrase 'spirited performance' at Dodge means more than just straight-line speed, it means an exciting total driving experience,&quot; Levine said.  &quot;Road courses like the ones where we'll be racing the Neons provide Dodge the opportunity to show our complete package of speed and handling.&quot;<BR>
	Another key element of the event is that the Neons are virtually identical to their showroom counterparts, allowing for maximum recognition for Neon and Dodge.<BR>
	&quot;The spirit of Neon remains intact on the race track,&quot; Levine said. &quot;It is very difficult to convince consumers that the performance you witness on the race track will translate to your production car if it doesn't look and behave the same.&quot;<BR>
	There are three Dodge Neon Challenge races on the schedule this year:  the Dodge Dealers Grand Prix at Lime Rock Park in Lime Rock, Conn., on May 29; the ITT Automotive Detroit Grand Prix on June 11; and the Medic Drug Grand Prix of Cleveland on July 23.  <BR>

<B>   </B><P align ="left"><B><BR>
       Auburn Hills, Mich. -- </B>Hundreds of thousands of miles make up the off-highway and four-wheel-drive trails that stretch across the nation's land.  Maintaining the quality of that land must be the highest priority of every sport-utility vehicle driver.<BR>
	&quot;Nature has a wonderful way of awakening the senses,&quot; said Mike Kane, Jeep&reg; Marketing Manager. &quot;But when you venture beyond the paved road, be sure your sense of responsibility gets turned on as well.&quot;<BR>
	Jeep is a founding member of &quot;Tread Lightly!&reg;&quot;, a non-profit organization funded by sponsorships from leading outdoor recreation companies and vehicle manufacturers. Tread Lightly! is dedicated to promoting off-highway use ethics and practices.<BR>
	&quot;Our message is simple -- use common sense and stay off unmarked trails,&quot; Kane said.  &quot;To reinforce this, in all our marketing and advertising we only show our Jeep products in settings that include an approved road or trail.&quot;<BR>
(more)<BR>
-2-<BR>
	The &quot;Tread Lightly!&quot; pledge can be easily summarized:<BR>
	<B>T</B>ravel only where motorized vehicles are permitted--never blaze your own trail.<BR>
	<B>R</B>espect the rights of hikers, skiers, campers and others to enjoy their activities undisturbed.<BR>
	<B>E</B>ducate yourself by obtaining travel maps and regulations from public agencies, complying with signs and barriers and asking owners' permission to cross private property.<BR>
	<B>A</B>void streams, lakeshores, meadows, muddy roads and trails, steep hillsides, wildlife and livestock.<BR>
	<B>D</B>rive responsibly to protect the environment and preserve opportunities to enjoy your vehicle on wildlands.<BR>
	&quot;We made a long-standing effort to be environmentally responsible, long before it became politically correct to do so,&quot; added Kane.  &quot;Endorsing `Tread Lightly!' makes perfect sense to us at Jeep.&quot;<BR>
	For more information on &quot;Tread Lightly!&quot;, contact Lori McNeely, the organizations executive director, at 1-800-966-9900.<BR>

<P><center><PRTitle><B>CHRYSLER TO TEST RECYCLED/REMANUFACTURED<BR>
ANTI-FREEZE FOR FUTURE PRODUCTS</B></PRTitle><BR>
<B> </B> </center><BR>
  <B> </B><P align ="left"><B><BR>
       Auburn Hills, Mich. -- </B>Chrysler Corporation will begin testing fully recycled and remanufactured anti-freeze for possible use in future products.  <BR>
	&quot;This aggressive program is expected to reduce the amount of used anti-freeze getting into the environment by creating a market for remanufactured anti-freeze as a Chrysler factory fill fluid,&quot; said Robert J. Kainz, Chrysler's senior environmental toxicologist for Environmental and Energy Affairs.  &quot;This will break new ground for Chrysler's environmental initiatives in using recycled materials.&quot;<BR>
	Kainz said the biggest test will be getting consumers to warm up to the idea of using remanufactured fluids in their vehicles.<BR>
	&quot;Given the considerable attention to recycling, we're optimistic that the idea of recycled coolants and oils will find consumer acceptance,&quot; Kainz said.  &quot;From Chrysler's perspective, we believe the remanufactured coolant we are testing will be as good, if not better than, new coolant.&quot;<BR>
	He added that it is critical to understand that the coolant will go through an extensive refining process.  Through the process, the coolant will actually be refined to a higher degree than new coolant.<BR>
(more)<BR>
(08094-S)<BR>
	-2-<BR>
	Work will begin with four major chemical companies this spring to determine the feasibility of putting remanufactured Ethylene-Glycol anti-freeze in new Chrysler vehicles.  Chrysler will assess the performance and environmental advantages of using the remanufactured coolant.  If they get positive results, engineers are betting that re-used anti-freeze will find widespread acceptance in the OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer) market.<BR>
	Increasing anti-freeze recovery rates is a sound environmental business objective for Chrysler, according to Mark Bindbeutel, Chrysler's pollution prevention manager, Environmental and Energy Affairs.<BR>
	&quot;The more Chrysler works toward root-cause elimination, waste minimization and recycling of hazardous materials, the more cost efficient it will become,&quot;  Bindbeutel said.  &quot;And when you consider that the effort may yield a higher quality product, it makes even more sense.  In the case of remanufactured anti-freeze, this potential exists.&quot;<BR>
	The recycled anti-freeze testing will address mileage, corrosion and evaporation issues, too, Kainz said.<BR>

	In presenting the award,<I> Popular Mechanics</I> Editor-In-Chief Joe Oldham said, Chrysler defined the segment when it introduced its first minivans more than 10 years ago and now they are re-defining it with the new Dodge Caravan, Plymouth Voyager and Chrysler Town &amp; Country.  Chryslers minivans set standards in packaging, comfort, car-like handling, performance and styling.<BR>
	As has historically been the case, Chrysler Corporations 1996 minivans offer the broadest line-up the world over, with more range, body styles, features, powertrain choices, individuality and value.<BR>
	These vehicles include minivan industry-first features such as a driver-side sliding door, Easy Out Roller Seats&reg;, dual zone climate control and a windshield wiper de-icer.<BR>

<P>(38695-S)					(more)<BR>

<P>-2-<BR>

<P>	Were especially gratified to win this award, since our all-new minivans are engineered to ride and handle better than any other ever built, said Theodor R. Cunningham, Chrysler Executive Vice President of Sales, Marketing and General Manager of Minivan Operations.  And by all accounts these vehicles are receiving kudos for their unique combination of aggressive aerodynamic styling and interior package improvements.<BR>
	Chrysler Corporation began sales of its long-wheelbase minivans -- the Plymouth Grand Voyager, Chrysler Town &amp; Country and Dodge Grand Caravan -- in March.  Short-wheelbase vehicles followed in July.  Vehicles for the North American market are manufactured in St. Louis, Missouri and Windsor, Ontario facilities.<BR>

<B> </B> </center><BR>
  <B> </B><P align ="left"><B><BR>
       Auburn Hills, Mich. -- </B>When engineers at Chrysler Corporation demanded that the new 1995 Dodge and Plymouth Neon be &quot;fun to drive,&quot; they considered more than just the roads and highways in their own neighborhoods.  They also wanted the car to perform at their local race track.<BR>
	Enter the new special-edition Neon American Club Racing (ACR) car.<BR>
	Produced in Chrysler's Belvidere (Ill.) Assembly Plant alongside the regular production Neon, the &quot;Competition Package&quot; is available in either the Dodge or Plymouth versions.  This allows anyone to purchase a competition-ready showroom stock car direct from their local participating Chrysler-Plymouth or Dodge dealership, with prices starting at $10,550 MSRP.  To date, over 170 would-be racers have already placed orders for the vehicles.<BR>

<P>
<P>(more)<BR>
(18894-S)<BR>
-2-<BR>
	The Neon Competition Package  includes: a performance tuned suspension with front and rear anti-roll bars, four wheel disc brakes, 5-speed performance ratio manual transaxle, a faster ratio steering box, 14&quot; x 6&quot; aluminum five-spoke wheels shod with Goodyear 175/65-R14 speed rated <BR>
tires, Sport front and rear fascias and a body colored grille bar, tachometer, right side remote mirror, and improved cooling capacity.  This is in addition to all the standard features of the four-door, such as driver- and passenger-side airbags, four-wheel independent suspension, and the powerful 132 horsepower, 2.0-liter, SOHC engine.<BR>
	On the track, the Neon's cab-forward layout provides a stable and predictable platform, ideal for the novice race driver.  Within its 171.8 inches in overall length, Neon has a long 104-inch wheelbase, giving it a solid, sure-footed feel even at its estimated 125 mph top speed.<BR>
	&quot;The Competition Package makes the Neon an extremely neutral front-wheel-drive vehicle, due to the added front and rear roll stiffness,&quot; notes Gary Johnson, Engineering Program Manager, Motorsports and Special Events.  &quot;The suspension geometry was enhanced by revising the strut tuning, which provided very predictable and linear limit handling.  Additionally, four wheel disc brakes provide solid braking performance.  These features help the novice driver quickly and safely find the limits of the vehicle, and in turn, rapidly improve lap times.&quot;<BR>
(more)<BR>

<P>-3-<BR>
	Neon's weight has been pared down to 2,340 pounds for the base model, further improving performance.  &quot;Horsepower alone makes you faster in a straight line,&quot; says Johnson.  &quot;But less weight gives you speed in the corners as well as the straights.  And that applies equally to production cars and race cars.&quot;<BR>
	The Neon is backed by the largest manufacturer's contingency program ever offered for a single vehicle model, totalling $220,000, administered and paid directly by the SCCA.  Neon competes in Club Racing class Showroom Stock C, ProSolo&reg; class Stock 5, and Solo II&reg; class E Stock.<BR>
	For Club Racing, there are 75 National Events with $500 awards for 1st Place, $350 for 2nd Place, and $250 for 3rd Place.  Qualifying and starting a Neon at the National Runoffs earns $1,000, and prizes for taking 1st, 2nd, or 3rd are $5,000, $4,000, and $3,000, respectively.<BR>
	The 15 Solo II&reg;  Regionals pay $200 to win and $100 to place.  Winning the National Solo II Championships in a Neon will net $1,500 for the driver.  Finally, each of the six SCCA National Valvoline ProSolo&reg; events offers $500-to-win, and $1,000 for winning the ProSolo Championship.  In addition, Chrysler will award $3,500 for a Neon winning its class and $5,000 if a Neon takes the overall ProSolo title.<BR>

<B> </B> </center><BR>
  <B> </B><P align ="left"><B><BR>
       Paris, France -- </B>Chrysler Corporation today announced the sale of its 300,000th vehicle in Europe since the corporation's re-entry into the market in 1987.  The milestone vehicle was the first Chrysler Neon delivered to a European customer, Anne Grethe Kohler Andresen from Malvik, Norway.<BR>
	After only seven years, customers can go to nearly 1,000 Chrysler and Jeep&reg; dealers in 26 European countries to find a full array of Chrysler minivans, passenger cars and Jeep&reg; four-by-four vehicles.<BR>
	Cumulative sales of 125,410 units make Chrysler Voyager -- the worldwide minivan market leader -- the most successful Chrysler vehicle in Europe followed by the Jeep Cherokee with 92,387 units sold and the Jeep Wrangler, 23,889 units.<BR>
	Darrell L. Davis, Chrysler's General Manager for Europe said:  &quot;To me, this milestone is only the beginning of a prosperous future for Chrysler in Europe.  The Jeep Grand Cherokee, which we launched in early 1993 is selling at a very fast pace with sales already reaching 17,894 units.  We just started European assembly of the Grand Cherokee, in Graz, Austria to meet that growing demand.  And we'll add an all-new Voyager late next year that clearly maintains Chrysler as the benchmark for minivans.<BR>
(50794)	(more)<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>-2-<BR>

<P>	&quot;We are also in the process of introducing a whole new line of passenger cars to the European market.  The Chrysler Vision, an elegant luxury limousine launched earlier this year, marked the direction Chrysler is taking with its cars.  And the Chrysler Neon, a compact sedan, was elected '1994 World Car' even before it was introduced,&quot; Davis continued.  &quot;Next spring the Chrysler Stratus, a dramatically styled mid-sized family sedan, and the Chrysler New Yorker, our image flagship, will be added to our European passenger car program.&quot;<BR>
	The 1987 Frankfurt Motor Show marked Chrysler Corporation's re-entry into the European market.  Chrysler started with five models in five countries, with five distributors and two dealers.  <BR>

<P><center><PRTitle><B>DODGE DAKOTA NAMED FOUR WHEELER MAGAZINE'S &quot;1997 PICKUP TRUCK OF THE YEAR&quot;</B></PRTitle><BR>
<B> </B>  <BR>
<B> </B> </center><BR>
<B>   </B><P align ="left"><B><BR>
       Auburn Hills, Mich. -- </B>Four Wheeler magazine has named the all-new Dodge Dakota &quot;1997 Pickup Truck of the Year.&quot;  <BR>
	<P>Four Wheeler evaluates four-wheel-drive pickups in five performance categories and in nine empirical tests.  Subjective performance judging includes mechanical operation, on-road ride and handling, off-highway performance, interior design and function, and exterior appearance.  Empirical ratings include fuel economy, interior noise, braking acceleration, cargo capacity, ground clearance, and suspension travel.<BR>
		<P>A four-wheel drive pickup truck must be new or significantly revised for the model year to be eligible for the annual competition.  The compact Dodge Dakota pickup is all-new for 1997, boasting a number of best-in-class features including: the biggest regular and club cabs; the only available V-8 engine and most powerful overall engine line; and the highest payload and tow ratings.  <BR>
		<P>Dakota also offers a refined interior with standard dual air bags and bold exterior styling cues pioneered by its big brother, the Dodge Ram full-size pickup.<BR>
		<P>According to Four Wheeler editor, John Stewart, &quot;Dakota is a tremendously well-balanced pickup.  It offers impressive on- and off-road performance and capability with a great measure of style.  It does everything you want and expect a truck to do.  And that's why Dakota came out on top.&quot; <BR>
		<P>&quot;We couldn't be happier that Four Wheeler's rigorous testing ultimately selected Dakota over a tough field of competitors,&quot; said Rich Schaum, General Manager , Truck Engineering, &quot;it's another important indication that we met our development objectives of providing our customers with the most truck for the money.&quot;<BR>
		<P>Dakota's competition included the Chevrolet ZR2 Extended Cab and the Ford F-250 SuperCab Lariat pickups.  The previous-generation Dakota also won this award in 1992.<BR>

1994 and 1995 year Dodge Ram and Dodge Dakota pickup trucks to install rubber plugs in the air bag screw access holes in the rear cover of the steering wheel.  Extra keys on the vehicle operator's key ring may become temporarily lodged in the access holes while turning, thus hampering steering wheel return.<BR>
	The rubber plugs are being mailed directly to owners who may choose to personally install the plugs or to bring the plugs to their local Dodge dealer for installation.  <BR>
	The steering wheel back cover on Ram and Dakota trucks has been redesigned for 1995 to eliminate the potential for this occurrence.<BR>
	There have been no reported accidents or injuries due to this condition.<BR>

<P>
<P>(41694-S)	###<BR>

<P><B>STEERING WHEEL PLUG RECALL</B><BR>

<P>Q: How many trucks are affected?<BR>
A: About 295,000, including a handful of 1995 Dodge Ram Club Cab pickups. <BR>

<P>Q: Do other Chrysler vehicles have the same problem?<BR>
A: No.  <BR>

<P>Q: How did you discover this problem?<BR>
A: A total of eight confirmed reports of hampered steering return due to this condition were received by NHSTA and Chrysler.<BR>

<P>Q: What's the fix?<BR>
A: The rubber plugs are inserted into the screw access holes.<BR>

<P>Q: Have owners been notified?<BR>
A: Notifications are being mailed to owners along with the plugs and instructions for installation.<BR>

<P>Q: Are any Canadian vehicles involved?<BR>
A: Yes, about 23,000.<BR>

       Highland Park, Mich. -- </B> It may even be the first time that Robert Pond has seen 85 pieces of his private automobile collection under one roof.  But, for sure, its the first time the public will lay eyes on this eclectic array of machines.<BR>
	From the eight Aston Martins to the lone 1941 Willys Jeep, and the 15 Ferraris and seven Rolls Royces in between, the exhibit scheduled for the Palm Springs, California Convention Center, November 17-19, promises some eye-popping surprises.  Like the 1930 Isotta Fraschini and the 1954 Chianfjiang motorcycle,  the 1925 Packard limousine and the 1955 Dodge Lancer, the 1950 Aston Martin DB-2 and the 1992 Vector.<BR>
	The exhibition is part of the Chrysler Grand Prix weekend, which also includes three-days of Vintage Auto Racing Association events and displays of Chrysler concept and production cars, including the new Chrysler Sebring convertible.<BR>
	Who is Robert Pond, and how did he come by so many fine vehicles?  The collection began as a hobby more than 40 years ago while Pond, a Minnesota native, ran the family-owned Advanced Machining Company. <BR>
(39895)	- more -<BR>

<P>- 2 -<BR>
	 He expanded both the hobby and the business, and his company became a world leader in the design and manufacture of commercial and industrial cleaning equipment.<BR>
	Pond was also a WWII naval aviator, and has maintained his fascination with aircraft.  In fact, he currently owns 28 World War II era planes, including a fully restored B-17 Flying Fortress.<BR>

       Highland Park, Mich. -- </B> Chrysler Corporation's Dodge Intrepid today was honored as &quot;Most Washable Car of 1993&quot; by members of the Michigan Carwash Assocation (MCA) during its annual trade show in Novi, Mich.<BR>
  	More than 500 Michigan carwash operators received ballots for the annual competition honoring the car that &quot;looks the best after a good wash.&quot;<BR>
	&quot;The Intrepid was a near unanimous choice of our members,&quot; said MCA Executive Director William Gill.  &quot;It was far out in front.&quot;<BR>
	MCA Carwash President Bill Osterink, Jr., who owns two washes in the Grand Rapids area, said, &quot;Admittedly, it's a subjective judgement, but wash operators see them all... from the hottest sport models to the family sedan and the Intrepid is one beautiful car coming out of a wash tunnel.&quot;<BR>
	Michigan Carwash Association was founded 40 years ago.  Its annual trade show features 70 exhibitors from North America.<BR>

       Mt. Clemens, Mi -- </B> The Selfridge Air National Guard Base Air Show, one of the largest air shows in the United States, is celebrating the 50th Anniversary Commemoration of World War II this weekend with aerial acrobatics including the &quot;ballerina in the sky,&quot; Julie Clark, flying her Mopar T34 plane through her 15-minute  routine choreographed  to patriotic music. <BR>
	Back on Earth, Chrysler-Plymouth is sponsoring a contest with the winner receiving a 1995 Plymouth Neon.  Contestants submit their entry form at participating Chrysler-Plymouth dealerships, with one finalist to be selected at each dealership.  Finalists will then receive a Chrysler key and the opportunity to see if their key fits the 1995 Neon at a special event later in the summer.  <BR>
	Chrysler-Plymouth General Manager Steve Torok said this is a great event for friends and family to attend because there is no admission or parking fee and &quot;every seat in the house is the best one.&quot;<BR>

<P>	 Soaring in the skies at the 1994 Selfridge Air National Guard Base Air Show will be the world renowned U. S. Navy Blue Angels,  Julie Clark's Mopar T34, Wayne Hadley's &quot;Raven,&quot; Pepsi Skywriter with Susan Asbury and Gene Littlefield with Wingwalker Cheryl Rae.<BR>
 	While Julie Clark, a 27 year veteran pilot, is gracefully carving through the sky in her Mopar T34, Chrysler-Plymouth will have 17 vehicles: two with Mopar accessories, and three concept cars on display. Included will be Chrysler-Plymouth's industry-leading minivans and the Plymouth Prowler on Saturday, and the Chrysler Cirrus and Plymouth Neon coupe Saturday and Sunday. <BR>
	Clark will display her 40-foot custom triple axle, 5th wheel Classic trailer.<BR>
	&quot;I am proud to be carrying the Mopar quality story into the skies,&quot; Clark said. &quot;And now we can provide even greater exposure for Mopar on the highways and on the flightline.&quot;<BR>
	The Air National Guard forecasts an attendance of hundreds of thousands over the two days  to watch the skillful twists, turns and dives by expert aviators. <BR>

<P><center><PRTitle><B>CHRYSLER SPONSORS BROADWAY PLAY, HAVING OUR SAY,<BR>
TIES EDUCATIONAL OUTREACH TO 'WISDOM FOR THE AGES'</B></PRTitle><BR>
<B> </B> </center><BR>
  <B> </B><P align ="left"><B><BR>
       Highland Park, Mich. -- </B> Chrysler Corporation has announced it will<BR>
sponsor the Broadway play <U>Having Our Say</U>, adapted from the bestseller &quot;Having Our Say: The Delany Sisters' First 100 Years,&quot; by Sarah &quot;Sadie&quot; and A. Elizabeth &quot;Bessie&quot; Delany with Amy Hill Hearth.  &quot;Having Our Say&quot; is a narrative of the two African American sisters' lives, lessons and recollections of more than 100 years of American history.  The play opens April 6, 1995, at the Booth Theatre in New York. <BR>
		&quot;Listening to the Delany sisters takes us all back to the fundamental teachings of our childhood -- the importance of education, integrity, respect for elders and caring for one another.  These lessons are all the more valuable today as we struggle to rediscover the American ideal,&quot; said A. C. (Bud) Liebler, Chrysler's Vice President - Marketing and Communications.  &quot;This is truly wisdom for the ages, and Chrysler is proud to help spread the lessons these two amazing women impart and to help further the education of the next generation of Americans.&quot;<BR>
	Chrysler has also underwritten an Educational and Youth Community Outreach Program in conjunction with the play.  In the first phase, set for this spring, 200 books will be donated to New York City high school libraries as well as 200 study guides for use in history and English classes.  In addition, Chrysler will  donate theater seats to 2,500 New York City high school students. <BR>
(13695)	(more)<BR>
	- 2 -<BR>
	By the spring of 1996, the program is expected to include students from New Jersey and Connecticut, providing a total of 10,000 tickets to students, as well as books and study guides to every high school and middle school (approximately 13,000) in the tri-state area.<BR>
	&quot;This is a story for America...really a celebration of America's people, told from the perspective of these two outstanding women who continue to contribute everyday to the history of our country,&quot; said Dr. Camille O. Cosby, co-producer.<BR>
	Sadie and Bessie Delany, ages 105 and 103, have witnessed enormous changes in every aspect of American life from race relations and human rights to technology.  Born before the turn of the century, entries in their mental archives precede the Jim Crow laws and include memories of Martin Luther King Jr. and the civil rights movement.  They lived through both World War I and II, as well as the Korean and Vietnam War eras.  Sadie and Bessie remember life before telephones, televisions, computers and fax machines.  They saw the introduction of the automobile and airplane as modes of transportation, and the first moon walk.  <BR>
	Not only have the Delanys witnessed history, but they are part of it.   At a time when college educations were rare for many white Americans and almost nonexistent for African Americans, all ten of the Delany children were college-educated professionals.  Bessie graduated from Columbia Dental School and became the second African American woman to practice dentistry in the state of New York.  Sadie, a graduate of Pratt Institute and Columbia Teachers College, obtained a master's degree and became the first African American woman to teach domestic science in a New York City high school.<BR>

<P>(more)<BR>
	- 3 -<BR>
	Their parents, Henry Beard Delany and Nanny Logan Delany, instilled in all of their children the philosophy of self-improvement through education, helping others, ethical living and a strong belief in God.  Henry Delany, the first elected African American Episcopal bishop and vice principal of St. Augustine's College in Raleigh, N.C., was born a slave and freed because of the Emancipation Proclamation.  Nanny Delany, a woman of mixed race, served as St. Augustine's matron.    <BR>
	<U>	Having Our Say</U> was adapted and directed by Emily Mann, Artistic Director of the McCarter Theatre.  The play is produced by C &amp; J Theatre Productions, Inc., a partnership between Cosby and Judith Rutherford James.  Famed actresses Mary Alice and Gloria Foster play the two centenarians, Bessie and Sadie.<BR>
<U>	</U>The play just completed a record-breaking engagement at the McCarter Theatre in Princeton, N.J/., where it became the biggest selling show in the theatre's 65 year history.  Previews for the Broadway production began March 16, 1995.<BR>
	&quot;Having Our Say: The Delany Sisters' First 100 Years,&quot; published by Kodansha America, Inc. in September 1993, was on the <I>New York</I> <I>Times</I> bestseller list for more than six months.  The paperback, published by Dell Publishers, remains on the <I>New York Times</I> bestseller list after more than five months.  The Delany sisters share their secrets of living in the follow-up book &quot;The Delany Sisters' Book of Everyday Wisdom,&quot; published in November 1994.	<BR>

<P><center><PRTitle><B>CALIFORNIA CERTIFIES CHRYSLER MINIVANS <BR>
AS ULTRA LOW EMISSION VEHICLES<BR>
</B></PRTitle><BR>
<B> </B> </center><BR>
  <B> </B><P align ="left"><B><BR>
       Los Angeles -- </B> Chrysler Corporation's compressed natural gas (CNG) minivan has been certified as one of the &quot;world's cleanest internal combustion vehicles&quot; by the <BR>
state of California, it was announced today.<BR>
	The California Air Resources Board certified the CNG minivans as Ultra-Low Emission Vehicles (ULEV).  The ULEV announcement makes Chrysler the only company to be certified in all three of the major low emission categories as mandated by California law.  Last year, the Chrysler TEVan received certification as a Zero Emissions Vehicle (ZEV) and the full-size Dodge Ram Van CNG received certification as the first Low Emission Vehicle (LEV).<BR>
	The minivans will be marketed as the Dodge Caravan, Caravan C/V and the Plymouth Voyager.<BR>
	&quot;This gives Chrysler a vehicle that meets the ULEV standards in California almost five years ahead of schedule,&quot; said Richard O. Schaum, executive engineer for the minivan platform team.  &quot;But perhaps just as importantly, the CNG minivan has the unique ability to serve both common fleet applications and actual retail consumers.  While fleets will be the immediate target, we're hopeful that the additional availability of certified vehicles will help to rapidly fuel the infrastructure development.&quot;<BR>

<P>(more)<BR>
(01194-S)<BR>
	-2-<BR>
	Gas Research Institute (GRI), the natural gas industry's research and development management organization, provided a portion of the funding for the CNG minivan program.  Advanced injector technology, previously developed with GRI for the full size NGV Ram Van program, was coupled with advanced electronics and catalyst technology, enabling the minivan to achieve the ULEV status.<BR>
	&quot;The Chrysler/GRI partnership is a textbook model of an effective strategic alliance in product development to meet market needs,&quot; said Stephen D. Ban, GRI president and chief executive officer.  &quot;This cooperative effort enabled the auto and natural gas industries to move forward rapidly to meet the growing demand for ultra-clean vehicles that are both practical and cost-effective.&quot;<BR>
	Including the full-size Ram Van CNG, Chrysler has the capacity to build as many as 2,000 LEV and ULEV certified vehicles in 1994.  According to Schaum, the reasons for pursuing natural gas vehicle development are compelling.<BR>
	&quot;While natural gas vehicles are somewhat restricted by range due to fuel storage constraints, they are able to achieve extremely low emission levels without diminishing the basic performance and serviceability characteristics of the vehicle,&quot; Schaum said.  &quot;These are essential in making them attractive to fleet and retail consumers.   It is also essential that utility companies continue to develop infrastructure in places like Los Angeles.  Utilities like SoCal Gas have established plans to work to develop the infrastructure further and have worked closely with Chrysler to move the market along.&quot;<BR>

<P>
<P>(more)<BR>
	-3-<BR>
	But while CNGs are promising, Schaum emphasized they are simply one piece of a complex puzzle in meeting Clean Air Act mandates.<BR>
	&quot;We know that as technology begins to catch up with the regulations, gasoline engines will be able to deliver LEV performance without some of the constraints posed by other alternative fuels,&quot; Schaum said.  &quot;Alternative fuel vehicles like CNG are one piece of a very complex puzzle.&quot;<BR>
 	The CNG minivan is powered by a 3.3-liter V-6 engine and stores the CNG in four main tanks attached to the underside of the minivan.  Because these tanks are not located inside the vehicle, load space is not compromised.  The fuel is stored at about 3,000 pounds per square inch (psi), which is about the equivalent of 8.2 gallons of gasoline.  With refueling equipment that has the ability to achieve 3,600 psi, fuel capacity can go to 9.4 gallons.  Range will typically be between 160-180 miles. <BR>
	The CNG option will cost about $4,000 over the regular vehicle price.  However, A. Michael Clement, Chrysler's manager of alternative fuel vehicle marketing, said incentives from different state and federal sources can nearly eliminate the additional cost.<BR>
	&quot;These are great first steps,&quot; Clement explained.  &quot;But the market for alternative fuel vehicles still remains tentative to say the least.  With all of the awareness surrounding the Ram Van LEV status and thousands of dollars of incentives per vehicle, we sold only 25 percent of our production capacity.  With a capacity to build about 2,000 CNG vehicles, we're hopeful our strengthened marketing efforts and the popularity of minivans in general will help push the market along.&quot;<BR>
(more)<BR>

<P>-4-<BR>
	Schaum added that there has been reluctant market acceptance of other alternative fuel vehicles.<BR>
	&quot;In California where we have all the EV mandates,&quot; he said, &quot;we figured to sell more than half of the 50 planned electric vehicles we built for 1993.  We only sold four here.  The others went to places in the east and southwest.  With the cost and infrastructure advantages of CNG, we hope to make more progress.&quot;<BR>
	To help address the issue, Chrysler announced it will offer the first dealer marketing, sales and service program dedicated to alternative fuel vehicles.  Los Angeles dealers will stock CNG vehicles for fleet and retail markets, and Chrysler will provide a full-line of sales, marketing and service training support.  <BR>
	Southern California Gas will supply the participating dealerships with needed refueling capabilities and will continue its efforts to develop the customer base and refueling infrastructure.<BR>

  <B> </B><P align ="left"><B><BR>
       Auburn Hills, Mich. -- </B>- One dozen hybrid electric Dodge and Plymouth Neon sedans will be among the vehicles college students from 38 universities around North America will compete with at the Chrysler Technology Center this week for the 1995 Hybrid Electric Vehicle (HEV) Challenge.<BR>
	Chrysler Corporation's billion dollar Technology Center has been transformed into a 21st Century race course where top engineering students will compete with their HEV conversions that are based on 1995 Neons, 1994 Saturns and 1993 Escorts.  The intercollegiate competition is sponsored by the U.S. Department of Energy, Chrysler Corporation, the Society of Automotive Engineers, and Natural Resources Canada.<BR>
	The Chrysler teams are competing with Neons that run on a combination of electricity and compressed natural gas (CNG).<BR>
	&quot;With the considerable challenges facing the auto industry in terms of vehicle engineering and development, this program provides Chrysler with an excellent opportunity to develop the quality of engineering students coming into the industry,&quot; said Bernard I. Robertson, vice president of technology programs and general manager of Jeep and Truck engineering.  &quot;It also will provide a platform for displaying unique and important ideas in meeting today's clean air challenges.&quot;<BR>
(24195)	-more-<BR>
	-2-<BR>
	The 12 Neon schools were selected by the HEV Challenge sponsors.  Representatives from the sponsor organizations will conduct the judging at the event.  More than 19 proposals were received from universities.  Other universities will work on evolutionary designs of Ford and Saturn HEVs used in previous HEV Challenge events.  All will compete for prizes of up to $5,000.<BR>
	Vehicles will be scored on a point system in three categories:<BR>
 Fuel economy and emissions<BR>
 Driving, range, handling and performance<BR>
 Engineering and drivability<BR>
	&quot;Chrysler has made a significant investment in natural gas vehicle technology over the last several years, so it seemed a 'natural' for us to select it as the fuel for this year's Challenge,&quot; explained Ken Mack, Chrysler's executive engineer for advanced research programs.  Working at Chrysler's Liberty and Technical Affairs in a suburb of Detroit, Mack is involved in advanced vehicle programs, including hybrid power. <BR>
	&quot;Not only is natural gas the cleanest fossil fuel, it is also the most plentiful,&quot; Mack continued.  &quot;In fact, we are using liquified natural gas in our Patriot hybrid electric race car that we hope to race at Le Mans at about the same time these students will be competing at the Chrysler Technology Center in June of next year.&quot;<BR>

<P><center><PRTitle><B>CHRYSLER INCREASES PRESENCE IN JAPAN;<BR>
OPENS REGIONAL SALES HEADQUARTERS IN TOKYO</B></PRTitle><BR>
<B> </B> </center><BR>
  <B> </B><P align ="left"><B><BR>
       Tokyo -- </B><B>  </B>Chrysler opened a new Asia Pacific regional office in Tokyo and announced the expansion of its current Tokyo corporate office, today.  <BR>
		&quot;This is yet another step Chrysler is taking to show our commitment to succeed in Japan.&quot; said Jerry K. Hsu, Chrysler's newly appointed Director of Asia Pacific Sales and the Tokyo Business Office who will move from Detroit to Tokyo to head the office. <BR>
		&quot;We showed we were serious about the Japanese market when we developed the right-hand drive Jeep&reg; Cherokee at an investment of more than $30 million,&quot; said Hsu.  &quot;We saw a great increase in sales as a result.<BR>
		&quot;We're pleased with our growth, but we need to keep it in perspective.  Our market penetration still does not indicate that we have full access to the Japanese market.  Full access is needed before we will see substantial future growth.  We're expanding the Tokyo office to be in a position to manage that growth.&quot;<BR>
		Chrysler's Japan sales have increased significantly since the launch of the right-hand drive Cherokee, jumping from 972 units in 1992, to total sales of 5,078 vehicles in 1993.  Of the total 1993 sales, over 4,000 vehicles were Cherokees.  As of first quarter, Cherokee sales in 1994 totalled 2,844.   <BR>
(14994)	(more)<BR>

<P>	<BR>
	The larger office will allow Chrysler to work more closely with its distributor and local dealers on distribution issues.  As a regional office, it will oversee sales, marketing and service in Japan, Taiwan and Australia. <BR>
		The Tokyo office will also coordinate the Japan sales launch of the Chrysler Vision, a family sedan this month.<BR>
		&quot;The Vision launch is further evidence of our commitment in Japan.  The Vision will introduce Japanese customers to Chrysler's new generation of passenger cars and our attention to detail, design and performance,&quot; said Hsu.  &quot;It will change their perceptions and expectations of Chrysler.&quot;<BR>
		A right-hand drive Neon is under consideration for Japan.  The recent Neon introduction in the U.S. stirred great interest in Japan, with Japanese media hailing Neon as an impressive competitor in the sub-compact segment.<BR>
		&quot;We know Japanese customers are interested in the Neon.  In a right-hand drive version, it would be an appropriate and potentially popular car in the market,&quot; said Hsu.  &quot;Before we invest in developing the Neon or other right-hand drive vehicles for Japan, we need assurance that we will be afforded a fair opportunity.   We need to know that limited market access and other barriers won't prevent us from being competitive.&quot; <BR>

<B>   </B><P align ="left"><B><BR>
       Auburn Hills, Mich. -- </B>Chrysler Corporation announced today that North American sales of its LH family of sedans passed the 1 million mark in May.<BR>
	Introduced for the 1993 model year, the Chrysler Concorde, Dodge Intrepid and Eagle Vision  were the company's first cars to feature cab-forward design, an architecture that maximizes interior and trunk room and  provides outstanding stability, safety and performance characteristics. They also were Chrysler's first cars with standard dual air bags.<BR>
	Chrysler LHS and New Yorker, luxury cars for buyers who demand engineering sophistication and contemporary design, joined the lineup a year later.<BR>
	North American sales of the five models totaled 1,024,534 through May 31, 1996. U.S. sales were 910,899, while the total for Canada was 113,635.<BR>
	Dodge Intrepid has been the volume leader, with sales of 523,377 through May.<BR>

<P><center><PRTitle><B>CHRYSLER ACHIEVES HIGHEST MARKET PENETRATION IN 23 YEARS</B></PRTitle><BR>
<B> </B> </center><BR>
  <B> </B><P align ="left"><B><BR>
       Highland Park, Mich. -- </B> Chrysler  Chairman Robert J. Eaton announced that the company had achieved in 1993 the highest market penetration in 23 years and increased to $19.9 billion the five-year product spending plan. <BR>
	Eaton made the announcements during a state-of-the-company address at Chrysler's Auto Show dinner last night.<BR>
	Looking back over his first year as Chrysler's chairman, Eaton also disclosed that the company had increased production more than 1,000 units per day...more than the equivalent of a new assembly plant...without adding brick and mortar. In addition, he said the Chrysler Board approved nearly a billion dollars in new funding for capacity improvements in the powertrain and component areas.<BR>
	Eaton said 1993 sales were up about 21 percent from 1992, giving the company a 14.5 percent market share penetration...the highest in 23 years. Overseas, Chrysler sold more than 100,000 retail units for the first time since it re-entered the international market in 1987.<BR>
	The chairman highlighted the product, production and financial successes of 1993 and then turned to the company's future. <BR>
	&quot;No matter how good we might get, quality will always remain our top priority. You'll never hear me say that we're satisfied with our quality. If we don't hold our own feet to the fire on quality, our competition will,&quot; he said.<BR>
(00694)                       (more)<BR>
	-2-	<BR>
	Eaton said the company was lucky enough to have a customer waiting for just about every car and truck the company could build.<BR>
	In addition to increasing capacity, Chrysler has developed a new program to get the vehicles to customers faster.<BR>
	Changes to the company's order-to-delivery process have reduced to 38 days from 70 days the time between when the dealer orders and the vehicle is delivered.<BR>
	He said the company is constantly assessing and reassessing all the processes it uses to make Chrysler more responsive to the customer.<BR>
	&quot;...we're proud of what we have accomplished, but we're not satisfied. We're not at the top of our game yet. We see our weaknesses better than anybody else. And we know they'll hurt us badly if we don't eliminate them,&quot; he said.<BR>
	The company's biggest challenge, he said, is not believing all the good media reviews and relaxing because much more work still needs to be accomplished.<BR>

	Covering 424,000 sq. ft. and representing an investment of more than $140 million, the laboratories simulate hundreds of &quot;real world&quot; driving conditions in a controlled test environment to speed product cycle time while boosting product reliability and customer satisfaction.<BR>
	&quot;The true advantage of this new facility is not found in the individual test centers themselves,&quot; explained Bernard I. Robertson, vice president of Engineering Technologies and general manager Jeep/Truck Operations.  &quot;Rather, the advantage is having all these many capabilities under one roof, just minutes away from the engineers that are developing the product.  The Labs represent a common area for platform team engineers to tap core expertise and share information throughout the platform organization.  It really helps to maximize the effectiveness of the whole platform organization.&quot;<BR>
	The facility includes the  3/8 scale wind tunnel, Environmental Test Center, Electromagnetic Compatibility Center, Noise Vibration and Harshness Laboratory and Powertrain Test Facilities. <BR>

	While there are 36 test and development laboratories housed in the billion dollar Chrysler Technology Center, the five laboratories that make up the Scientific and Environmental Laboratories wing (or STF, for Scientific Test Facilities as it has become known internally) are called &quot;monuments.&quot;<BR>
	&quot;Why are they called monuments?&quot; asked Sue Cischke, general manager for Scientific Laboratories and Proving Grounds.  &quot;With more than 11 million pounds of steel, 121 million pounds of concrete and more than $140 million in investment, monument just seemed to fit.  That and the fact that there is no facility quite like the STF in the entire world.&quot;<BR>
	Technicians take vehicles through 55,000 watts of solar energy, 600 tons of refrigeration capacity, up to 120 decibels of sound and more than 6,000 horsepower of dynamometers.<BR>
	&quot;The real beauty in all of this is that engineers two floors above can monitor  tests right at a workstation,&quot; Cischke said.  &quot;If there's a problem, or if the engineer wants to participate in the preparation and testing, he or she in only a few minute's walk away.<BR>
	&quot;Before we had the facility, some of these test that are now only a few minutes away would have been conducted on an evaluation drive in the northern most regions of Canada, for say, a cold weather evaluation,&quot; she said.  &quot;When you consider that those trips can cost tens of thousands of dollars and take weeks to complete, you can begin to appreciate just what we have here.&quot;<BR>

<P><U><B>Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMC) Facility</U></B><BR>

<P>	EMC testing focuses on a car's electronic systems and how they operate when exposed to radio frequencies (RF).  In this day and age of communication, RF interference is emanated from many sources that cars encounter on the road every day.  With the increased use of complex electronics to control most vehicle functions, it is necessary to thoroughly test vehicles during development for their resistance to RF sources.<BR>
	&quot;One car can use 10 to 20 microprocessors throughout its systems to control components such as air-bags, anti-lock brakes, engine controls, and many other vehicle systems,&quot; said Richard Bradshaw, EMC engineer.  <BR>
	RF noise can come from radio and television towers, HAM radios, cellular phone, burglar alarms and the like.  The EMC facility can replicate this interference in test cells, which are dedicated to different frequency ranges.  <BR>
	The largest is the vehicle anechoic test chamber, which tests in the 30 megahertz to 18 gigahertz range.  The walls of the cell are lined with an RF absorption material that is impregnated with carbon.  It's similar technology to that used on the Stealth Fighter jet.<BR>
	In the vehicle transverse electromagnetic cell, RF fields from radio transmitters in the 10 kilohertz to 30 megahertz range are simulated.  <BR>
	-more-<BR>
-4-<BR>
	The vehicle shielded test room is used to test for self-compatibility with on-board transmitters and to measure radiated emissions from the vehicle.  Finally, the vehicle electrical test cell has instrumentation which can measure voltage and current levels on 48 separate circuits to ensure proper operation of all electrical components.<BR>
	All the cells utilize dynamometers for full operational testing capability.<BR>
	<BR>
<U><B>Environmental Test Center: Climatic Test Center</U></B><BR>
	The mission of the climatic facility is to simulate the world's many different climates any time of the year, without leaving the building.<BR>
	This includes temperature ranges from -40 degrees to 125 degrees F, coupled with the ability to create blizzards and rain storms.  No other facility in the world can boast the total capabilities of the Climate Test Center at Chrysler.  <BR>
	The six dynamic test cells use wind tunnels and dynamometers to simulate driving conditions up to 90 mph.  Based on ambient temperature conditions in the cell, technicians are able to shower the vehicle with rain or snow to simulate the most grueling conditions.  <BR>
	Solar panels blast vehicles with radiated heat, simulating the sun, and the humidity can be controlled from 20 to 95 percent relativity.<BR>

<P>
<P>-more-<BR>
-5-<BR>
	&quot;This provides Chrysler with the ability to continually repeat tests year round, eliminating many of the expensive climate road trips to Canada and Arizona that are regulated by the seasons,&quot; said Jack Gillian, manager of Chrysler's  thermal testing and development.  &quot;Or as we like to say, 'our weather forecasts at Chrysler are 100 percent accurate!&quot;<BR>
	The facility also includes five soak cells for hot and cold soaking of vehicles for various tests.<BR>

<P><U><B>Environmental Test Center: Emissions</U></B><BR>
	With the draconian tail-pipe emission regulations on the books for compliance with the Clean Air Act, testing and certification for vehicle emissions is becoming an extremely costly and complex science.<BR>
	To meet the increasing demand, Chrysler has created a state-of-the-art emissions test center to help speed the test and compliance process.  Cutting cycle time in this complex area can equate to a competitive advantage in the marketplace.<BR>
	Ron Flor, program manager for Chrysler emission testing facilities, said the new facility will cut several weeks out of the emissions test and compliance cycle.<BR>
	&quot;With this facility, we can perform all our environmental and emissions testing in one area under a variety of conditions, without leaving the building,&quot; Flor said.  &quot;Another great advantage is that we have total control and <BR>
	-more-<BR>
-6-<BR>
repeatability, something that you don't have with open-road evaluations.  That's a significant accomplishment.&quot;<BR>
	For example, a one-of-a-kind altitude test chamber in Chrysler's STF allows engineers to recreate mountain driving tests by simulating altitude and vehicle loads.<BR>
	To accomplish this, the altitude chamber technician can program a chassis dynamometer to change loads to the vehicle's wheels, representing the grade changes the vehicle would experience in mountain driving.  The altitude is then increased or decreased by the technician.<BR>
	The chamber includes several airlocks, allowing engineers and vehicles to move in and out without breaking the ambient conditions in the cell.  This is a feature unmatched in the auto industry.<BR>
	In addition to simulating a variety of environmental conditions, the altitude chamber -- along with two other fully-equipped emission test cells -- will also be used to develop the extremely low emission vehicles of the late 90s, which require advanced analyzers to gauge the minuscule tailpipe emissions.<BR>

<P><U><B>Noise Vibration Harshness (NVH)</U></B><BR>
	One area of customer satisfaction that is driving the industry is NVH.  The Chrysler NVH Laboratory has extensive capabilities in isolating, tuning and refining the interior sound quality in Chrysler vehicles.<BR>
	-more-<BR>

<P>-7-<BR>
	&quot;What we're seeing these days is that cars are getting so quiet due to excellent engineering, that customers are hearing noises that were previously masked,&quot; said Walter Esser, manager of the NVH lab.  &quot;It's really like a hunt, attempting to find the source of undesirable sound.  The trick is not so much to eliminate sounds from the vehicle, but to tune and enhance the sounds to give the car pleasing acoustics.&quot;<BR>
	To accomplish this, the NVH lab houses several hemi-anechoic chambers dedicated to NVH engineering.  These include cells with both 10 ft. and 6 ft. chassis dynamometer rolls with road surfaces that were actually molded and replicated from Chrysler's Chelsea Proving Grounds.<BR>
	High-tech test dummies with specialized microphones for ears, ride in the vehicle as it travels on the special chassis rolls, monitoring sounds.  Technicians record, analyze and work with platform engineers to make vehicle changes.  <BR>
	The cells are also used for evaluation of competitive products in establishing benchmarks for current and future Chrysler products, Esser said.<BR>
	Other facilities include a vehicle powertrain chamber, a reverberation chamber, components room, three modal bays, two sound demonstration rooms and an acoustic test room.  All are fully temperature controlled and feature computer control rooms for monitoring tests.<BR>
	Support facilities for NVH include a balance lab, shaker room, fabrication shop and 12 vehicle prep stalls.<BR>
-more-<BR>
-8-<BR>
<U><B>Aerodynamics and Computational Fluid Dynamics Laboratory</U></B><BR>
	Chrysler's 3/8 scale wind tunnel is a pilot operation for a full-scale tunnel to be built at the Chrysler Technology Center in the future.  <BR>
	The first of the STF labs to open, aerodynamicists, platform engineers and designers work together as a team with clay models of future products to fine tune designs early in the design and development process.  <BR>
	Test equipment includes a six component balance for measuring lift, drag, side force, yaw, pitch and rolling moments.  These combine to evaluate fuel economy implications, provide input for handling characteristics; cross wind stability analysis; cooling and airflow development; wind noise; windshield wiper lift and many others.  <BR>
	The facility also provides computational fluid dynamics analysis, utilizing a variety of commercial and customized software programs to perform computer simulations for external aerodynamics and internal component fluid dynamics.<BR>
	These would include analysis on components such as: intake manifolds, engine cooling systems; catalytic converters; defroster ducts and many other components.<BR>
<U><B>Powertrain</U></B><BR>
	Chrysler's Powertrain facilities are presently comprised of seven specialized test cells.  While the company's main dynamometer facility is still housed in the <BR>
	-more-<BR>
-9-<BR>
Chrysler Center in Highland Park, the CTC powertrain facility focuses on specialized areas not found in the other facility.	<BR>
	The cells include: a transmission shift quality cell; a quad cell for all-wheel-drive powertrains; a hot temperature test cell; a cold temperature test cell; a dynamic test cell with computer simulation; a hemi-anechoic cell for NVH development; and an altitude engine test cell.<BR>
	&quot;They're all unique,&quot; said Hank Sorenson, a test engineer in the Powertrain facility.  &quot;What gives us a real advantage is having all of these advanced cells right next to each other.  For powertrain engineers, it's like the biggest toy store in the world.&quot;<BR>
	The Powertrain facility will expand in time with numerous new cells as operations are moved from Highland Park to CTC.<BR>

<B> </B> </center><BR>
  <B> </B><P align ="left"><B><BR>
       Dayton, Oh -- </B>Buoyed by hot-selling new products and the need to increase capacity, Chrysler Corporation today announced that it will pump more than $100 million into its Dayton (Ohio) Thermal Products Plant over the next three years, a move that will continue the growth that started earlier this decade.<BR>
	Ohio Governor George Voinovich celebrated the news during a tour of the plant today, and agreed to provide $900,000 of state support for specialized training programs for employees.<BR>
	Dayton Thermal produces heating and air conditioning systems for Chrysler products.  The plant recently won work for Chrysler's all-new minivans due in Spring of 1995, as well as various right-hand drive models that Chrysler will export to Europe and Asia.<BR>
	&quot;We've been enjoying the fruits of some very popular products,&quot; said Larry Williams, Director of Component Operations for Chrysler.  &quot;In the past year, we've hired 500 employees -- about 300 of those were new positions -- because of new hot sellers like the Dodge and Plymouth Neon, and the upcoming 1995 Chrysler Cirrus and Dodge Stratus.<BR>
(more)<BR>
(43894-S)<BR>
	- 2 -<BR>
	&quot;With minivan and additional right-hand drive business,  we expect to be able to add more than 120 more new employees by 1996, based on the current estimates of market demand.&quot;<BR>
	Investment at Dayton will go toward the purchase of three vacuum brazing furnaces (each costing $6 million),  eight injection molding machines, assorted specialty tube bending equipment, and a variety of assembly line machinery, dies and presses.   The new equipment will go on line between 1994 and 1996.<BR>
	No new brick and mortar is anticipated.  <BR>
	The investment represents Dayton's portion of the more than $1.8 billion in capacity increases that Chrysler previously announced it will invest in North American facilitites.<BR>
	Dayton Thermal is one of Chrysler's original eight facilities, dating back to the organization of the company in 1925.  With more than 1,600 employees on roll, Dayton Thermal as recently at 1992 constructed a 135,000 square foot addition to facilitate new business.<BR>

<B> </B> </center><BR>
  <B> </B><P align ="left"><B><BR>
       Chelsea, Mi -- </B>  Dodge extends its successful Ram truck line for the 1995 model year with the introduction of the Dodge Ram Club Cab, which debuts with a base manufacturer's suggested retail price (MSRP) of $17,716 on the 135&quot; wheelbase 1500 4x2 model.<BR>
	The Ram Club Cab's interior adds 20 inches in length to the standard Ram's best-in-class cab, accommodating six passengers with a standard 40/20/40 front seat and full rear bench seat.  Club Cabs will be offered in both two- and four-wheel drive; in long- and short-bed configurations; and in 1500, 2500, and 3500 models.  Available engines include the Dodge Magnum 5.2 and 5.9 liter V-8s, 8.0 liter V-10, and 5.9 liter I-6 Cummins turbo-diesel.<BR>
	&quot;With the Club Cab, Dodge has another strong entry in the full-size truck market,&quot; said Bernard Robertson, Vice President - Engineering Technologies and General Manager - Jeep/Truck Operations.  &quot;The Ram Club Cab rounds out what we like to think is the best line of full-size pickups on the market.  It will satisfy the needs of full-size pickup truck buyers who carry passengers or simply need some additional in-cab storage space.   Judging by the number of phone calls and letters we've been receiving from customers, we think the interest in the Club Cab will be very strong.&quot;<BR>
(22194-S)	(more)<BR>

       Highland Park, Mich. -- </B>Stillness is broken as the sun rises over the Florida Everglades. <BR>
	A drowsy alligator crawls from his wet marsh bed. A flock of snow white egrets take to the air looking for breakfast. The beauty of a single sunrise over this magnificent, primitive wilderness is something impossible to express, never to be forgotten.<BR>
	Located at the tip of Florida, just a one hour drive from the city of Fort Lauderdale, the Florida Everglades have fascinated writers, poets and archaeologists since the Indians first went to the marshy wilderness centuries ago.<BR>
	Big Cypress Seminole Indian Reservation will play host to Jeep&reg; enthusiasts Feb. 25 - 27 when Chrysler Corporation holds its first Seminole Jeep Jamboree. <BR>
	&quot;This Everglades adventure will allow off-road enthusiasts to explore real Florida jungles and deep swamp wetlands in a variety of Jeep vehicles including Grand Cherokee, Cherokee and Wrangler,&quot; said Lou Bitonti, Jeep merchandising executive. &quot;It's a part of that Jeep mystique to be able to go to some seldom seen, hard-to-reach place.&quot;<BR>
	Participants can try the native wild game, Michigan gator, and stay in a &quot;Chickee&quot;, a traditional style Seminole cypress wood and palmetto thatch hut.  <BR>

<P>	Jeep enthusiasts will have an opportunity to encounter soft, sandy areas during the driving challenge of the first Seminole Jeep Jamboree. When driving in sand, Mark Smith, a technical consultant for Chrysler Corporation's Jeep and Eagle Division offers several tips.<BR>
	&quot;In a large sandy area it's smart to get out and walk the sand first. &quot;Hard packed sand is no problem to the four-wheeler,&quot; said Smith. <BR>
	&quot;If the sand is loose and more than a few inches deep, you will have a few decisions to make,&quot; he explains. &quot;If it's just a short patch of soft sand until the surface is hard again, the best bet is to go at a reasonably good speed and try to stay on top of it to get to the other side.&quot;<BR>
	Smith suggests that on a longer stretch of soft sand deflate tires to about 20 pounds, 10 pounds for really soft areas, and check them with a gauge. He says this will spread the load over a bigger area, allowing the tire to float or stay on top instead of digging in like a fully-inflated tire would. Regular tires will work fine in this situation.<BR>
	&quot;Buckle up your seat belt and go at a steady pace,&quot; says Smith. &quot;Once committed, don't change your mind, go straight and steady.&quot;<BR>
	Momentum and smooth handling are the key, he explains and adds that the vehicle's wheels should be kept straight and if turning, do it smoothly.<BR>
	&quot;If your vehicle does get stuck, remember it happens to other off-roaders, even pros,&quot; he says. &quot;Dig out around your wheels, use your floor mats for traction if you have to. If water is available, wet the sand in front of the wheels, this will provide a firmer base.&quot;<BR>
- more - <BR>

<P>- 3 -<BR>

<P>	If necessary, Smith recommends deflating tires to eight or ten pounds. He says rock back and forth and once moving forward, keep a good steady forward motion -- don't spin wheels, as it will only make it worse.<BR>
	When driving in sand dunes, Smith encourages four-wheelers to be sure their vehicle has a flag on their antenna or a mast.<BR>
	With this knowledge and some practice, Smith said participants in the first Seminole and all other Jeep Jamborees will be able to get where they want to go with ease and safety, even through the grassy waters known as the Everglades.<BR>

. . . ON BROADWAY!</B></PRTitle><BR>
<B> </B> </center><BR>
  <B> </B><P align ="left"><B><BR>
       Highland Park, Mich. -- </B>  It looks like Chrysler has another hit on its hands.  But this one's not a car, minivan, sport utility or truck.  It's a Broadway play that's getting rave reviews -- a play sponsored by Chrysler Corporation.<BR>
	<U>Having Our Say</U>, adapted from the bestseller &quot;Having Our Say: The Delany Sisters' First 100 Years,&quot; by Sarah &quot;Sadie&quot; and Elizabeth &quot;Bessie&quot; Delany with Amy Hill Hearth, has been nominated for three Tony Awards -- Best Play, Best Actress and Best Director.  <U>New York Times</U> theatre critic Vincent Canby calls it &quot;the most provocative and entertaining family play to reach Broadway in a long time.&quot;<BR>
	The play, which opened at Broadway's Booth Theatre on April 6, is a narrative of the two African-American sisters' lives, lessons and recollections of more than 100 years of American history.  <BR>
	In addition to supporting the play, Chrysler is sponsoring an Educational and Youth Community Outreach Program.  In the program's first phase, copies of &quot;Having Our Say&quot; will be donated to New York City high school libraries, along with study guides for use in history and English classes.  Chrysler is also donating 2,500 theatre tickets to New York City high school students.  <BR>

<P>(22095)	- more - <BR>
- 2 -<BR>

<P>	By the spring of 1996, the outreach program will extend to students in every high school and middle school in New Jersey and Connecticut, with books, study guides, and a total of 10,000 tickets.  There are 13,000 public schools in the tri-state area.<BR>
	<U>Having Our Say</U> was adapted and directed by Emily Mann, Artistic Director of the McCarter Theatre.  The play is produced by C&amp;J Theatre Productions, Inc., a partnership between Dr. Camille O. Cosby and Judith Rutherford James.  Famed actresses Mary Alice and Gloria Foster play the two centenarians, Bessie and Sadie.<BR>

       Highland Park, Mich. -- </B>  &quot;Our all-time records of last year have come back as very high hurdles, indeed,&quot;  Theodor R. Cunningham, Executive Vice President -- Sales and Marketing, said in citing Chrysler's 166,396 total vehicle sales for April -- off 18 percent from last year's best-April-ever performance.<BR>
	&quot;But we're delighted to see total Dodge and Plymouth Neon sales continue to rise, setting a new April record of 17,941 units.  And Dodge Intrepid racked up an amazing 21st consecutive monthly record with 14,330 sold in April.  And then there's Dodge Ram, changing not just the rules but the history books, with 20,299 units sold and a new April record against even last year's record pace.  These are star performances, even in a somewhat softer market,&quot; Cunningham said.<BR>
	Total car sales were 64,157, including best-month-yet performances by Dodge Stratus and Chrysler Sebring, both introduced in January.<BR>
	Truck sales totaled 102,239 -- the 13th 100,000-plus sales month in 15 months.  The selling rates of both the Jeep&reg; Grand Cherokee and Jeep Cherokee improved over March, which had two additional selling days.<BR>
	There were 25 selling days in April vs. 26 last year.<BR>

       Newark, Delaware -- </B>Chrysler Corporation's first 1994 Dodge Intrepid bound for Mexico from the Newark (Delaware) Assembly Plant was driven off the assembly line this afternoon by James Wolfe, plant manager.  The company expects to ship some 2,500 Intrepids to Mexico in 1994 from that plant.  Only eight Newark built vehicles -- all LeBaron Convertibles -- were sent to Mexico from Newark in 1993.<BR>
	&quot;This is one more sign of what NAFTA (the North American Free Trade Agreement) has done for North America,&quot; Chrysler Chairman Bob Eaton told Newark employees earlier this week.  &quot;When NAFTA passed, we said Chrysler would ship more vehicles to Mexico that ever before ... and we're doing just that.<BR>
	&quot;In 1993, Chrysler shipped 5,800 vehicles to Mexico.  By the end of March this year, we will already have surpassed that total.&quot;<BR>
	Chrysler vehicles produced in North America that are sold in the Mexican market include the Dodge Intrepid, Viper and Ram Wagon; Chrysler Concorde, New Yorker and Town &amp; Country minivan; Plymouth Voyager and Grand Voyager; and Jeep Grand Cherokee, Cherokee and Wrangler.<BR>

CHRYSLER CNG SALES DIP FOR '95,<BR>
 NEW MODELS EXPECTED TO BOOST '96 SALES</B></PRTitle><BR>
<B> </B> </center><BR>
  <B> </B><P align ="left"><B><BR>
       Highland Park, Mich. -- </B>While model change over and tank availability issues pushed down 1995 sales of Chrysler Corporation Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) vehicles, 1996 sales are expected to increase dramatically, said Mike Clement, manager of alternative fuel vehicle fleet sales and marketing.  <BR>
	Chrysler sold 965 CNG vehicles in the 1995 model year, a decrease from  1,620 in 1994 because of a model change on the minivan line and a reduced availability of tanks for the full-size Dodge Ram Van and Wagon.<BR>
	The 1995 sales mix included  527 Ram Vans; 313 minivans; 70 Ram pickup trucks; and  55 Dakota pickups.  Chrysler sold 467 CNG vehicles in 1993.  <BR>
	&quot;Model change-over and tank production issues meant we had to pass on some government fleet opportunities,&quot; explained Mike Clement, manager of alternative fuel vehicles sales and marketing.  &quot;With those issues now behind us, we expect 1996 sales to approach 3,000 - 4,000 with our marketing efforts.<BR>
	&quot;The addition of the pickups in 1995 gave us a more comprehensive fleet offering in addition to our full-size Dodge Ram van and minivan CNG models,&quot; Clement continued.  &quot;We're confident that increased awareness of CNG, coupled with our marketing efforts, will help us push sales up and maintain our industry-leading position.&quot;	-more-<BR>
(30995)<BR>

<P> 	-2-<BR>
	Chrysler Corporation will continue to lead the industry with CNG vehicle offerings in 1996 with a total of four vehicle offerings.<BR>
	The Dodge Ram 1500/2500 and Dodge Dakota pickup trucks, the Dodge Ram Van/Wagon and the all-new 1996 Chrysler minivans will feature CNG options.<BR>
	All of Chrysler's CNG vehicles will be certified as Inherently Low Emission Vehicles under Federal schedules. <BR>
	Chrysler was also the first company to be certified in all of the major low emission categories as mandated by California law.  In 1994 Chrysler's CNG minivan was certified as the first ULEV; in 1993 the Chrysler TEVan was certified as a Zero Emission Vehicle (ZEV) and in 1992, the full-size Dodge Ram Van/Wagon CNG was certified as a Low Emission Vehicle (LEV).<BR>
	Chrysler was the first manufacturer to receive a ULEV certificate in January 1994 with its current generation minivan running on CNG.  Chrysler's Dodge Ram Van CNG, Dakota CNG, and Ram Pickup CNG are also expected to be certified at the ULEV level for 1996.<BR>
	The ULEV standard is the most stringent and difficult to achieve beyond the Zero Emission Vehicle (ZEV) -- or electric vehicle -- mandate.  Chrysler's 3.3-liter  V-6 engine will power the minivan and the 5.2-liter V-8 will power the full-size van and the pickup trucks.<BR>

       Highland Park, Mich. -- </B>While the name Cirrus is derived from the heavens,  the new name for Plymouth's JA compact sedan is derived from someplace more down-to-earth: Centerline, Mich.  Through a contest held for all Chrysler employees, the name Breeze was selected for the 1996 <BR>
Plymouth JA.  Dan Meyers, an employee in Chrysler's Management Information Systems office in Centerline submitted the name.  <BR>
	  The name was selected from over 2,000 entries from Chrysler offices and plants across the country.  Meyers will receive one-year's use of a Breeze, courtesy of Plymouth.  Breeze will make its debut later in 1995 as the third of the already-heralded Chrysler JA sedans.<BR>
	&quot;We applaud the creativity of our employees for the entries they submitted,&quot; said Chrysler-Plymouth General Manager Steve Torok.  &quot;Most every entry exemplified the young, free-spirited image of the new Plymouth.  But in the end, Breeze stood head-and-shoulders above the others.<BR>
	&quot;We are very pleased with the image Breeze paints.  It signifies cheerfulness, openness and independence. It's very Plymouth!&quot;<BR>

<P>(00695)	-more-	<BR>

<P>-2-<BR>
	The Breeze name will be carried out further in the new Plymouth logo, to debut on all Plymouth models later in 1995.  The logo features a post-modern sailing ship navigating the windy seas.<BR>

       Detroit, Mi -- </B> Sean Patrick Flanery, star of the ABC television series &quot;The Chronicles of Young Indiana Jones,&quot; led the field in the inaugural <U>Dodge Neon Challenge</U> race, sponsored by Chrysler and the Southeast Michigan Dodge Dealers today as part of the ITT Automotive Detroit Grand Prix.  Flanery took the lead early in the 12 lap race and finished two seconds ahead of <U>Detroit Free Press</U> auto critic Tony Swan.<BR>
	Seventeen drivers from a wide range of professions, including national television celebrities, a rock star, international broadcasters, local radio and television personalities and automotive journalists challenged each other in the SCCA-sanctioned event in race-prepared Dodge Neons.<BR>
	&quot;I got a run on him (Swan) coming out of the corner and had just enough juice to try to squeeze through without hitting the wall,&quot; said Flanery of his race-winning maneuver.  &quot;Between this and the Skip Barber racing school, this has been the greatest six days of my life.&quot;<BR>
	Flanery started the race in third place behind Swan and Tiff Needell of the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) &quot;Top Gear&quot; program.  Needell, a veteran of the British Touring Car championship series, left after five laps due to mechanical problems.<BR>
	Third place went to Automobile magazine's Doug Weisz, who finished just five seconds behind Swan.  &quot;I had the best seat in the house,&quot; said Weisz.  &quot;I was just sitting back and watching.  I was amazed at what Sean was doing.  He was flying.&quot;<BR>
	&quot;Sean did a fabulous job,&quot; added Swan.  &quot;I made one little mistake and Sean was flawless.&quot;<BR>

<P><center><PRTitle><B>CHRYSLER CORPORATION RECALLS NEW NEONS,<BR>
 	HALTS PRODUCTION TO ALLOW FOR FIX</B></PRTitle><BR>
<B> </B> </center><BR>
  <B> </B><P align ="left"><B><BR>
       Highland Park, Mich. -- </B>Chrysler Corporation today said it was recalling 1,300 Dodge and Plymouth Neons because of the potential for water to leak into the engine controller.  The Belvidere (Ill.) Assembly Plant will stop production for at least one week to allow new parts to fill the pipeline.<BR>
	Chrysler said moisture has been found where a connector interfaces with the controller's circuit board.  Moisture in this area can potentially cause the engine check light to illuminate, or the engine to die out or not start.<BR>
	In addition to closing the plant, dealers were instructed today to notify Neon owners and to cease delivering new units.<BR>
	Of the 15,000 Neons built, approximately 9,000 have been shipped to dealers, including the 1,300 currently in owners' hands.  Company officials said the priority would be to fix the retailed units, then units in dealer inventory, followed by vehicles at the assembly plant.<BR>
	Chrysler has asked dealers to pick up the 1,300 retail units, provide alternative transportation, and clean and gas the Neons before delivering back to the owners.<BR>

<P><B>NEON ENGINE CONTROLLER PROBLEM</B><BR>

<P>
<P>Q. What happened?<BR>
A. We have reported incidents of engine controller malfunction.<BR>
Q. How was the problem discovered?<BR>
A. Analysis and engineering study of 25 field reports of conditions resulting from engine controller malfunction were traced to moisture in the engine controller.<BR>
 Q. What were the conditions?<BR>
A. Engine check light coming on; engine no start or die out; erractic cruise control operation.<BR>
Q. Any accidents or injuries?<BR>
A. No.<BR>
Q. What caused the moisture in the engine controller?<BR>
A. In those few cases, the sealing compound used to protect the controller from moisture is separating and allowing moisture to penetrate.<BR>
Q. Why wasn't this discovered in the durability testing?<BR>
A. There were no failures in any of durability vehicles.  As a result, while we believe the majority will not fail, we are going to replace every controller.  <BR>
Possible addition:<BR>
Every customer will be contacted, the vehicle will be picked up, alternative transportation provided, and upon completion of the replacement, the Neon will be delivered, cleaned and gassed.<BR>

<P>
<P>-2-<BR>
Q. Is this a new engine controller, exclusive to Neon, or this this engine controller used in other Chrysler Corporation vehicles?<BR>
A. Yes, this is a new engine controller, exclusive to Neon.	<BR>
Q. How many Neons are in customer hands?<BR>
A. An estimated 1,200 units, of the approximately 14,215 built, are in the hands of customers.  An estimated 5,611 Neons are contained at Belvidere Assembly, the balance have been shipped but will not be delivered until the engine controller is replaced.<BR>
Q. Who is the supplier of the engine controller?<BR>
A. The Huntsville Division of Acustar.<BR>
Q. Are new controllers available now?<BR>
A. We expect to have the new controllers for customer vehicles within the next several days. <BR>
Q. 	Are you continuing to build Neons?<BR>
A. 1)	We are monitoring the production of new controllers.  If necessary, we will temporarily halt Neon production at Belvidere Assembly Plant.<BR>
 <BR>
A.2) 	We have halted production temporarily to assure all new controllers are used for customer and dealer vehicles prior to new production units.<BR>

&quot;DRIVERS' CHOICE AWARDS&quot;</B></PRTitle><BR>
<B> </B> </center><BR>
  <B> </B><P align ="left"><B><BR>
       Chicago, Il -- </B>  Chrysler Corporation earned more product awards than any other domestic or foreign automotive manufacturer during today's 12th annual MotorWeek &quot;Drivers' Choice Awards&quot; ceremony at the Chicago Auto Show.  MotorWeek executive producer/host John Davis presented Chrysler awards in five categories: <BR>
	Best Small Car - Dodge/Plymouth Neon; <BR>
	Best Minivan - Chrysler Town &amp; Country, Dodge Caravan, Plymouth Voyager; 	Best Domestic Sedan - Chrysler Concorde, Dodge Intrepid and Eagle Vision; 	Best Sport-Utility - Jeep Grand Cherokee <BR>
	Best Pickup Truck - Dodge Ram    <BR>
	&quot;Chrysler's unprecedented wins in five MotorWeek Drivers' Choice categories is the result of dedicated men and women who in less than five years have transformed the company from being a builder of just competent cars and trucks to the architect of industry benchmarks in every major vehicle class,&quot; said Davis.  &quot;No other car company in the world can match that achievement.  It is clear that Chrysler will be a leader in the global auto industry in the 21st century.&quot;<BR>
	The products are chosen by MotorWeek staff based on design, comfort, road handling and overall excellence within their category.  This is the second consecutive year the Chrysler Concorde, Dodge Intrepid, Eagle Vision and Jeep Grand Cherokee have earned MotorWeek awards. <BR>
	MotorWeek is a national production of Maryland Public Television airing on both public and commercial television.<BR>

       Highland Park, Mich. -- </B>   Chrysler Corporation's Mopar Parts Division announced today the renewal of its sponsorship of Detroit Lions football broadcasts on WWJ-Radio for the 1995 season.<BR>
	The sponsorship -- in its fourth consecutive year -- will feature radio spots that will air during Lions pre- and post-game shows, and also provide opportunities for local youths and volunteers of metropolitan Detroit's Big Brothers/Big Sisters chapter to attend a Lions game, and for a local high school football team to attend a training camp session.<BR>
	&quot;We've been extemely pleased with the results of our sponsorship with the Detroit Lions and WWJ-Radio over the last several years,&quot; said Larry Baker, General Manager, Mopar Parts Division.  &quot;This year, we're growing our relationship to include Big Brothers and Big Sisters volunteers and Detroit-area youths who may not otherwise have the opportunity to attend a Lions game or visit a professional football team's training camp.  We feel it's a winning program for all those involved.&quot;<BR>
	Mopar has donated over 200 tickets to the Big Brothers and Big Sisters organization for this Thursday's August 10 home opening pre-season game between the Lions and Jacksonville Jaguars at the Silverdome.  <BR>

<P><center><PRTitle><B>CHRYSLER ANNOUNCES NAMES OF NEW SEDANS:<BR>
CHRYSLER CIRRUS AND DODGE STRATUS</B></PRTitle><BR>
<B> </B> </center><BR>
  <B> </B><P align ="left"><B><BR>
       Highland Park, Mich. -- </B>Chrysler Corporation today announced the names of its new import fighting compact sedan entries -- the Chrysler Cirrus and Dodge Stratus -- during the vehicles' world introduction at the North American Auto Show in Detroit. <BR>
	The challenge implicit in selling Cirrus and Stratus is that the majority of target buyers have not been shopping in domestic showrooms -- some have never stepped foot in one.  Cirrus and Stratus represent Chrysler Corporation's opportunity to regain a foothold in a high-volume, import-dominated market where primary competitors range from the top end of the subcompact segment to the heart of the compact segment down to the low end of the midsize segment.<BR>

<P><U><B>Chrysler Cirrus</U></B><BR>
	The Cirrus will provide a  new, entry level vehicle for the Chrysler brand, providing Chrysler a lineup of contemporary cab-forward sedans that extend from the upper end of compact cars through full-size luxury cars and minivans, said Chrysler/Plymouth General Manager Steve Torok.  <BR>

<P>(more)<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>	&quot;Cirrus, like Concorde, New Yorker and LHS, will be positioned as a domestic alternative to upscale imports,&quot; Torok added. &quot;The primary source of sales will come from Camry and Accord owners, as well as domestic owners looking for a more contemporary vehicle.&quot;  Cirrus plays an essential role in directly addressing the younger buyer with a product that provides a new level of sportiness and excitement not previously associated with the Chrysler brand.&quot;<BR>

<P><U><B>Dodge Stratus</U></B><BR>
	 The Stratus fills out the Dodge sedan lineup by providing a product that fits squarely between the Neon and the Intrepid, said Dodge General Manager Marty Levine.   <BR>
	&quot;It will be targeted directly at younger boomers,&quot; he added.  &quot;Target buyers have told us they want contemporary technology in a car that's built to last, a design that's thoughtful and expressive, performance that's responsive and reliable and convenience items that bring a sporty flavor to the family sedan.&quot;	 	<BR>

CHRYSLER TO INVEST $80 MILLION<BR>
IN TWINSBURG STAMPING PLANT</B></PRTitle><BR>

       Twinsburg, Oh -- </B> Chrysler Corporation's most successful vehicles of the last 10 years will help bring more business to the Twinsburg (Ohio) Stamping Plant for the balance of this decade.<BR>
	Many of the steel parts and assemblies for the all-new Chrysler minivans (code-named NS) set to be introduced next year will be stamped at Twinsburg, announced <BR>
Theodor R. (Ted) Cunningham, Executive Vice President -- Sales and Marketing, and General Manager of Minivan Operations for Chrysler.  Cunningham and Ohio Governor George Voinovich told Twinsburg employees and community leaders today that Chrysler will invest $80 million in the 36-year-old plant. <BR>
	Voinovich hailed the announcement as another banner day for Ohio.  &quot;Chrysler's continued investment in Ohio's business climate gives testimony to the strength of our auto industry.&quot;<BR>
	&quot;This plant was very aggressive in seeking this business,&quot; added Cunningham, &quot;just like they wanted to build many of the parts for the Dodge and Plymouth Neon small car that just recently went into production.  To get the Neon business, Twinsburg devoted a major part of its floor space -- dubbed 'Neon City' -- to three major press lines that do nothing but stamp Neon parts.<BR>
(04194-S)	 (more)<BR>
	 - 2 -<BR>
	&quot;This same kind of entrepreneurial spirit to go after new business was what brought Twinsburg the new minivan.&quot;<BR>
	Cunningham also credited the partnership displayed by the State of Ohio, Summit County and the city of Twinsburg.  Voinovich presented a $600,000 training grant to Chrysler, and the county and city cleared the way for the new business just last month by approving a tax abatement.<BR>
	Chrysler's all-new versions of the popular Dodge Caravan, Plymouth Voyager and Chrysler Town &amp; Country go into production in fall 1995.  Long the leader in this fast-growing market segment, Chrysler has defended its position with evolutionary changes since the minivan burst on the automotive scene in 1983.<BR>
	Chrysler was the first to offer a choice of two wheelbases, a selection of four- and six-cylinder engines, a driver's side airbag (in 1991), an integrated child safety seat and finally in 1994, the crowning safety achievement -- meet all passenger car safety standards four years before they were required.<BR>
	Throughout the 1980s and into this decade, Chrysler minivans have been sales and image leaders, often capturing up to 50 percent of all North American minivan sales despite a rash of new competitors.<BR>
	After building more than 4 million of the &quot;original&quot;, Cunningham promises the new minivan will be revolutionary.<BR>
	&quot;We are taking all that we have learned after 4 million owners and 10 years of leadership, and injecting that knowledge into the new NS.  Twinsburg will play a vital role in the delivery of that revolutionary product.&quot;<BR>
(more)<BR>
	- 3 -<BR>
	The 2.4-million square foot plant builds a wide range of car and truck stampings and assemblies for an assortment of Chrysler vehicles, including suspension and underbody components for Neon, fenders for Dodge Dakota and Ram Van, roofs for Dodge Spirit/Plymouth Acclaim, and rail assemblies for Dodge Intrepid/Chrysler Concorde/Eagle Vision.  <BR>
	The 2,600 employees at Twinsburg use 1,250 tons of steel daily to form the parts on 32 major press lines.<BR>
	Cunningham added that the new minivan business alone will assure jobs for 1,400 employees, some of whom may have been vulnerable with the planned phase-out of some older Chrysler car lines.  <BR>
	&quot;With this business, this plant's pulse won't miss a beat,&quot; he said.<BR>

       Highland Park, Mich. -- </B> Whether you will be traveling over the river or through the woods (or just down the street to grandmother's house), the trip will be more enjoyable thanks to a partnership formed by two of the oldest and most respected names in the great outdoors.  <BR>
	The Jeep&reg; and Eagle Division of Chrysler Corporation and the Orvis&reg; Company -- the oldest continuously operating American supplier of upscale fly fishing tackle and outdoor sporting equipment -- have announced the introduction of a special Orvis edition of the successful Grand Cherokee sport utility vehicle.<BR>
	The limited edition Grand Cherokee -- which debuts in dealer showrooms this fall as a 1995 model -- carries the Orvis logo and features special exterior paint schemes and interior appointments, such as leather seating surfaces, split fold down rear seats to carry longer items, retractable cargo cover and Orvis floor mats and spare tire cover with storage pockets and net.  It also comes standard with the up country suspension and the ultimate in Jeep four-wheel drive systems, the all-the-time Quadra-Trac system.<BR>

<P>(40694)	(more)<BR>

<P>- 2 -<BR>

<P>	&quot;There is a natural bond between Jeep Grand Cherokee and Orvis,&quot; said Ed Brust, General Manager of Jeep and Eagle Division.  &quot;Orvis supplies a wide variety of outdoor equipment and apparel to upscale consumers, who match the demographic make-up of Grand Cherokee owners.  We see this as an excellent partnership for Jeep and Orvis.&quot;<BR>
	The Orvis Company dates to 1856 when it began selling its quality trout flies and bamboo fly rods by catalog from its headquarters in rural Vermont.  The company now has retail outlets across the United States and mails millions of catalogs each year.<BR>
	&quot;Many of us at Orvis have for years relied on Jeep vehicles,&quot; said Perk Perkins, President of Orvis.  &quot;Whether we are scouting for spring turkeys or blasting through drifts when plowed-in after a Vermont snowstorm, my brother, my father and I all have used Cherokees for a number of years.  We've depended on Jeep and enjoyed its performance in an incredible number of driving situations in backcountry all over America, so the association is both logical and authentic.  We're happy to be partners in this special Jeep edition.&quot; <BR>
	The marketing relationship makes Jeep Grand Cherokee the official vehicle of Orvis, giving Jeep exposure to the outfitter's unique customer base.  In addition, the Orvis catalog, retail stores, endorsed lodges, fly fishing schools and other Orvis-related events present Jeep with additional marketing opportunities.<BR>

<P>(more)<BR>

<P>- 3 -<BR>
	&quot;The 1995 Jeep Grand Cherokee Orvis Edition combines the vehicle's impressive four-wheel drive capabilities and luxury attributes with the renowned outdoor heritage of Orvis,&quot; said Brust.  &quot;We are pleased with the partnership and look forward to the opportunities the relationship will offer.&quot;<BR>
	Production of the Orvis Edition began this summer at Chrysler's Jefferson Avenue North Assembly Plant in Detroit.<BR>
	The Grand Cherokee is the only vehicle in its segment with a standard driver-side air bag and four wheel anti-lock disc brakes.  When equipped with the optional 5.2 liter engine, it has a best-in-class tow capacity of 6,500 pounds.<BR>
	Since its introduction in 1992, the Grand Cherokee has set new standards for sport utility vehicles by combining the performance, handling, luxury, safety and comfort of sophisticated sedans with the Jeep brand's legendary off-road capabilities.<BR>

       Auburn Hills, Mich. -- </B>Chrysler Corporation today posted its 10th consecutive monthly sales increase, setting an August volume record and surpassing last year's sales rate by 9 percent.<BR>
	<P>Chrysler's dealers in the United States sold 186,306 cars, trucks, minivans and Jeep&reg; vehicles during August. The previous August record was 176,184 in 1989.<BR>
	<P>&quot;We've maintained solid sales momentum since spring, and it's giving us a good base to launch our 1997 products, including the all-new Dodge Dakota pickup,&quot; said James P. Holden, Executive Vice President - Sales and Marketing.<BR>
	<P>&quot;Shipments of Dakotas and other 1997 models began during August, and in the coming weeks they should ease tight inventory conditions we've had for some products,&quot; Holden said.<BR>
	<P>Among Chrysler's August records:<BR>
	<P>-- Sales of Jeep&reg; vehicles were best ever for an August and second-best for any month in company history. Jeep&reg; Grand Cherokee was up 42 percent from a year ago. Cherokee was up 52 percent and the 1997 Wrangler sales rate was 59 percent ahead of last year.<BR>
	<P>-- Chrysler's total truck sales of 127,870 broke an August record set a year ago, increasing 17 percent from August 1995. It was the 11th consecutive monthly increase for Chrysler truck sales.<BR>
	<P>-- Dodge Truck sales set a 16th consecutive monthly record. Dodge Ram Pickup set its 33rd consecutive monthly record on August sales  26,337.<BR>
	<P>-- Plymouth Breeze, Dodge Stratus and Chrysler Cirrus combined for an August record. Dodge Avenger and Chrysler Sebring also combined for their best ever August. <BR>
	<P>-- Dodge Caravan sales of 22,977 contributed a record August for Chrysler's minivans. The luxury Chrysler Town &amp; Country set a 16th consecutive monthly record. Sales of Chrysler Corporation minivans for the 1996 model year passed the 500,000 mark during August, the earliest that point has been reached in a model year.<BR>
	<P>For the calendar year to date, Chrysler's sales are running 13 percent ahead of last year -- the sales rate for trucks is 19 percent higher while passenger cars are up 5 percent.<BR>
	<P>With a month remaining in the 1996 model year, Chrysler already has established model-year records for total vehicles, trucks, Dodge Division, Dodge Truck, Dodge Ram Pickup and Jeep&reg; vehicles.<BR>

AFTER 1995 - MODEL YEAR</B></PRTitle><BR>
<B> </B> </center><BR>
  <B> </B><P align ="left"><B><BR>
       Highland Park, Mich. -- </B> Chrysler Corporation will discontinue the New Yorker nameplate after the 1995-model year in the U.S. and Canadian markets as the company simplifies its lineup, said Steve Torok, General Manager, Chrysler-Plymouth Division.<BR>
	The LHS, which shares the same platform as the New Yorker, continues as Chrysler's flagship luxury sedan for 1996 and beyond. <BR>
 	&quot;Besides simplifying our lineup, this action reflects the success of our new products and brand strategy which have positioned Chrysler as a more contemporary brand,&quot; said Torok. <BR>
	The need for the New Yorker was eliminated by the success of Concorde and LHS, said Torok. &quot;Since the introduction of Concorde, it has shown itself to be an attractive product, not only to the younger family market it was designed for, but also for many of our older buyers who previously purchased New Yorkers.&quot;<BR>
	At the top of the range, LHS has been outselling the New Yorker by three to one since introduction. &quot;Now that the LHS has been building a strong nameplate recognition on its own, dealers have told us they no longer need New Yorker.&quot; <BR>

       Auburn Hills, Mich. -- </B>Chrysler Corporation sold more vehicles in May than in any month in its history, breaking a record set last June and setting several records in individual categories.<BR>
	Sales for the month totaled 245,289 vehicles, breaking the any-month <BR>

<P>record of 236,404 set in June 1995. The May performance was an increase of 17 <BR>

<P>percent from the daily sales rate in May 1995.<BR>

<P>     Chrysler passed the million-vehicle mark on May 28 -- the earliest point ever<BR>

<P>in a calendar year -- and through May 31, year-to-date sales totaled 1,067,064,<BR>

<P>compared with 900,463 a year ago. <BR>

<P>     &quot;We've posted a record first quarter, a record April and now, in May, a<BR>

<P>record for any month,&quot; said James P. Holden, Executive Vice President, Sales and<BR>

<P>Marketing. &quot;The strength is balanced. It spreads across our product lineup, from<BR>

<P>cars and minivans to pickup trucks and Jeep&reg; vehicles. Our dealers are seeing <BR>

<P>stable, solid demand, and it looks as if June will be another strong month.&quot;<BR>

<P>     Chrysler's May truck sales of 155,945 were best for any month, surpassing<BR>

<P>the April 1996 mark of 148,768. The daily selling rate for trucks in May was 16<BR>

<P>percent higher than in the year-ago period.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>(more)<BR>

<P>-2-<BR>

<P>     Chrysler Corporation car sales for the month were up 20 percent from a year<BR>

<P>ago. The Dodge Division set May records for Neon, Stratus, Intrepid and<BR>

<P>Avenger and posted its best month ever, breaking an overall record set in April.<BR>

<P>Sales of Plymouth cars were 61 percent ahead of a year ago.<BR>

<P>     Dodge Truck set an any-month record, with Ram Pickup recording its 30th<BR>

<P>consecutive monthly sales record. Dodge Caravan, America's best-selling minivan,<BR>

<P>set its second monthly record in four months.<BR>

<P>     Customer demand for the new 1997 Jeep Wrangler helped lift Wrangler to a<BR>

<P>record for any month. At 9,865, Wrangler sales passed 9,000 for the first time and<BR>

<P>topped the previous monthly high of 8,078 set in May 1994.<BR>

<P>     Chrysler Town &amp; Country, the standard for luxury in minivans, topped 8,000<BR>

<P>sales in a month for the first time, posting a 124 percent increase from its year-ago<BR>

<P>sales rate and setting its 13th consecutive record.<BR>

<P>     Any-month sales records also were posted in May for the Chrysler Sebring <BR>

<P>Coupe and Chrysler Sebring Convertible.<BR>

<P><center><PRTitle><B>CHRYSLER AND FREIGHTLINER ANNOUNCE ENGINE SALE AGREEMENT</B></PRTitle><BR>
<B> </B> </center><BR>
  <B> </B><P align ="left"><B><BR>
       Cleveland, Nc -- </B>- In a press conference held here at Freightliner's truck assembly plant, Chrysler Corporation and Freightliner Corporation announced that Chrysler has agreed to sell Freightliner up to 3,000 Dodge Magnum truck engines and a matching number of heavy-duty 46RH 4-speed automatic transmissions per year over the next three years. <BR>
	According to Bernard I. Robertson, Vice President - Engineering Technologies and General Manager - Jeep &amp; Truck Operations,  &quot;In the 1995 model year, we'll provide Freightliner with up to 2,000 5.9-liter V-8s and a matching number of 46RH 4-speed automatic transmissions.  In the 1996 model year, when we will increase our V-10 engine production capacity from 20,000 to 30,000 units per year, we'll add up to 1,000 8.0-liter Magnum <BR>
V-10s and transmissions.&quot;  Freightliner will offer the engines as an option in its medium-duty FL 50, FL 60 and FL 70 Business Class Trucks.<BR>
	&quot;We view this arrangement as both a natural extension and as a long-term strategic growth opportunity for Dodge Truck.  You might say that, with this deal, we're dipping our toe in the water of the medium-duty truck business in the U.S. and Canada,&quot; stated Robertson.<BR>

<P>(45694-S)	(more)<BR>

<P>-2-<BR>

<P>	&quot;This arrangement is a superb fit for both Chrysler and Freightliner,&quot; Robertson added.  &quot;On the one hand, we're reestablishing Dodge Truck as a major player in the light-duty truck market, which is made up of Class 1, 2 and 3 trucks.  We'd been exploring opportunities to expand our truck business, and to leverage our recent success as the fastest-growing truck company in the light-duty truck market.  <BR>
	&quot;Freightliner, on the other hand, is an acknowledged and respected leader in the medium- and heavy-duty truck business in Classes 6, 7 and 8.  They were looking to extend their truck line into Class 5, and into the gas engine segments of the Class 6 and 7 truck markets.  Plus, Freightliner is the fastest-growing company in the medium- and heavy-duty truck markets.  So, this engine-sale agreement is well in synch with both the business needs and dynamics of our two companies.&quot;<BR>
	This will be the first time Freightliner has offered a gas engine option in their medium-duty trucks.  Freightliner President and Chief Executive Officer, Jim Hebe, said, &quot;Putting a Dodge Magnum V-8 in Freightliner's Business Class trucks is a marriage of two great products, and it expands the possibilities available to better serve our customers.  A Business Class truck with the Magnum V-8 is an ideal option for many low-mileage and traditionally gasoline-powered applications.&quot;<BR>

  <B> </B><P align ="left"><B><BR>
       Auburn Hills, Mich. -- </B>Chrysler Corporation will notify approximately 230,000 owners of plastic fuel tank-equipped 1987-1994 Jeep Wranglers regarding fuel tank sending unit gasket leakage as soon as repair requirements and instructions are finalized.  In the meantime, if an owner notices fuel odor, the vehicle should be returned to a Jeep dealer for replacement of the fuel tank sending unit gasket.<BR>
	Damage to the fuel tank sending unit gasket, located between the top of the tank and the sending unit, occurred due to an over-torque condition on some units during the assembly process, which created excessive gasket compression.<BR>
	Fuel tank sending unit gaskets on affected Wranglers may crack, resulting in fuel vapor levels in excess of applicable emission standards and the possibility of fuel leakage.<BR>
	Chrysler is not aware of any accidents or injuries related to this condition.<BR>

       Highland Park, Mich. -- </B>With a month and a half yet to go, Chrysler Corporation today reported a calendar year record for truck sales in the U.S. of 1,215,145 pickups, vans, minivans and sport utility vehicles.  The previous mark, set just last year, was 1,213,690. This is the third consecutive year that Chrysler truck sales have topped one million units, and with sales running 16 percent ahead of 1993, the year-end total could surpass 1.4 million.<BR>
	Through October, Chrysler trucks had posted nine consecutive monthly records and nine consecutive 100,000-plus sales months -- in addition to 39 consecutive monthly increases, measured year to year.<BR>
	Separately, both Dodge truck and Dodge Ram set new calendar year records within the first 10 months of 1994.  Through October, Dodge reported 602,628 total truck sales, surpassing the previous record of 571,036, set in 1988.  Dodge Ram sales reached 191,841 at the end of October, beating a 17-year-old record of 188,338 set in 1977.  October was also the best month ever for Dodge Ram, with sales of 22,336, and for Jeep&reg; Grand Cherokee, with sales of 22,946.<BR>

<P><center><PRTitle><B>CHRYSLER TO REPLACE LIFTGATE LATCHES<BR>
ON 1984 THROUGH 1994 MODEL YEAR MINIVANS</B></PRTitle><BR>
<B> </B> </center><BR>
  <B> </B><P align ="left"><B><BR>
       Auburn Hills, Mich. -- </B> Chrysler Corporation today announced it will conduct an owner service action to replace rear liftgate latches on all 1984 - 1994 Dodge Caravan, Plymouth Voyager and Chrysler Town &amp; Country minivans.  <BR>
	This action is expected to bring a satisfactory conclusion to an 18-month investigation into alleged openings of rear liftgate latches by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. NHTSA has not concluded there is a defect, and implementation of Chrysler's actions should resolve any concerns NHTSA has about these minivan latches.  NHTSA is expected to formally close the investigation following a period of monitoring the implementation of this action.<BR>
	&quot;Because the growing awareness surrounding this issue is causing concern among our owners, we are doing what is right.  This is, taking an action that we believe will give them peace of mind and will continue to maintain the trust and confidence in our products that we have worked so long to provide,&quot; said <BR>
Arthur C. Liebler, Vice President - Marketing and Communications.<BR>
	In a statement from NHTSA, Administrator Dr. Ricardo Martinez said, &quot;This action will improve the safety of these vehicles at no cost to owners, and alleviate the concerns that have been raised regarding the performance of the latches in crashes.<BR>
	&quot;Your willingness to take this action demonstrates safety leadership and a recognition of the importance of safety to your customers,&quot; he said.<BR>

<P>(13995-S)	(more)<BR>
	-2-<BR>

<P>	In an announcement briefing, Chrysler also provided its analysis of government data which has been part of the NHTSA investigation citing the risk of death in different types of vehicles, and minivans in particular; liftgate and hatch openings; and fatal ejections in crashes.  <BR>
	The government's data clearly showed minivans, as a category, are among the safest vehicles on the road today, and Chrysler minivans are among the safest of all minivans.  This analysis also showed Chrysler minivans performed among the best in the areas of liftgate openings and fatal ejections.<BR>
	The government's data also revealed that ejection rates could be reduced dramatically by ensuring that occupants are in seats and properly belted.<BR>
	&quot;Despite all this supporting data, consumer concerns have been elevated by coverage of some very tragic accidents over the past five months,&quot; said Liebler at the briefing.  &quot;From the view point of our owners it does us no good to complain about unfairness, questionable sources, accuracy or data.  The simple fact of the matter is when our owners raise concerns about the well-being of their families, we have an obligation to act.&quot;<BR>
	By the end of the week, Chrysler will begin contacting owners with a notice offering  to replace liftgate latches on their minivans at no charge.  This action covers all 1984 through 1994 Dodge Caravan, Plymouth Voyager and Chrysler Town &amp; Country minivans.  The 1995 Chrysler minivans are not included in this action because they have a different latch mechanism.<BR>
	It will take several months to produce a sufficient quantity of latches and provide them to dealerships.  Owners of 1990 through 1994 Chrysler minivans will receive the same type of latch as used on 1995 minivans.  A modified latch system is required for 1984 through 1989 minivans.  Further, any minivan that is serviced at a Chrysler, Plymouth or Dodge dealership for any reason over the next few years will also be offered a new latch if the vehicle does not already have one.<BR>

<P>(more)<BR>

<P>-3-<BR>

<P>	Owners will be sent a second notice as soon as new latches arrive in the dealerships.  Chrysler cannot be specific as to the time period, but estimates the action will take several months.<BR>
	&quot;We are heartened by NHTSA's support, because Chrysler, perhaps more than any other company, has established a clear image of minivan safety leadership,&quot; said Ronald R. Boltz, Vice President - Product Strategy and Regulatory Affairs.  &quot;We were the first to provide standard driver and passenger air bags, integrated child safety seats, dynamic side impact protection, and to meet all 1998 passenger car safety standards.&quot;<BR>
	Owners should feel confident during the latch production period about continuing to drive their Chrysler minivans until, and beyond, the time replacement latches arrive in dealerships.  Both NHTSA and Chrysler emphasize owners can best protect themselves and their passengers in any vehicle by being properly seated and using seat belts at all times.<BR>

CHRYSLER EMPLOYEES TO RECEIVE RECORD PROFIT-SHARING CHECKS</B></PRTitle><BR>
<B> </B> </center><BR>
  <B> </B><P align ="left"><B><BR>
       Highland Park, Mich. -- </B>Chrysler Corporation today announced that profit-sharing checks averaging $4,300 -- the largest ever paid by any U. S. auto company -- will be distributed February 11 to the company's United Auto Workers union (UAW) represented hourly and salary employees.<BR>
 	More than 65,000 UAW represented Chrysler employees will receive the profit-sharing payments.  The first profit-sharing payments to Chrysler's represented hourly and salary employees of $720 was made in 1989, under provisions of the Profit Sharing Plan negotiated in 1988.  Last year's profit-sharing payments averaged $421.<BR>
	Chrysler's 16,000 non-represented Professional/Administrative/Management salary employees will also receive payments under a separate plan.<BR>
	&quot;We count on our employees to build consistently outstanding products every single day and we're proud of what they've accomplished in the past year,&quot; said Robert J. Eaton, Chrysler Chairman.  &quot;Profit-sharing payments are a meaningful way to acknowledge their contributions to Chrysler in 1993, and their efforts to help move Chrysler forward in the future.&quot;<BR>

       Los Angeles -- </B> Graphic designers who have learned how to navigate the information superhighway, a landscape architect who helped to design Israel's first national parks, and a team of environmentally minded engineers who have developed an ecosystem that makes polluted water drinkable were among the six winners of the second annual Chrysler-Plymouth &quot;Innovation in Design&quot; award, presented this evening at the Pacific Design Center in Los Angeles.  The award was developed by Chrysler-Plymouth Division of Chrysler Corporation, in conjunction with Bozell Worldwide Advertising, to recognize socially responsible, consistently cutting-edge designs and designers.<BR>
	The awards were presented to John and Nancy Todd, an environmental design team from Massachusetts; Achva Stein, a landscape architect and professor at USC; Zusanna Licko and Rudy VanderLans, founders of Emigre Design in Sacramento; Muriel Cooper, former MIT media lab director; Kathy and Michael McCoy, co-chairs of the design department at Cranbrook Academy of Art; and Lebbeus Woods, New York architect.<BR>

	The six winners each received the Chrysler-Plymouth &quot;Innovation in Design&quot; award, a modern, multicolored sculpture created by one of last year's winners, Gaetano Pesce, along with $10,000.<BR>
	&quot;Design is a cornerstone of our success at Chrysler-Plymouth,&quot; said Chrysler-Plymouth General Manager Steve Torok.  &quot;Our unique cab-forward design -- in our new Chrysler brand Cirrus compact sedan, our LHS, New Yorker and Concorde, as well as our Plymouth Neon -- has been a breakthrough in the automotive industry, much like our great list of winners continue to be.&quot;<BR>
	&quot;This is the second year of the program and we're happy to see the interest and enthusiasm from the design community, through more entries and support,&quot; said Arthur C. &quot;Bud&quot; Liebler, Vice President of Marketing and Communications for Chrysler Corporation.<BR>
    	More than 100 designers and design companies in the fields of architecture, industrial/product design and graphic design were nominated for the award by some of the top members in the design community.<BR>
	A panel of judges, representing design companies, publications and schools of design, graded the entries on such criteria as technological benefit, beauty and accessibility to a diverse range of people.  The selection panel is co-chaired by Chee Perlman, editor of I.D., and Michael Sorkin, principal of the Michael Sorkin Studio.	<BR>

<P>-3-	The winners:<BR>
<B>John and Nancy Todd</B><BR>
	John Todd, Ph.D., a biologist, and Nancy Jack Todd, a writer, have spent their careers designing sustainable systems that use renewable ecological technologies to grow food, generate energy and heat, and purify water.  In 1969 they founded the New Alchemy Institute on Cape Cod, Massachusetts, where scientists and designers could develop and design futuristic systems to work within the changing environment.  With their company, Living Technologies, Inc., the Todds have recently designed and built a series of Living Machines, which are household and community-scale sewage treatment and wastewater purification systems.<BR>
<B>Achva Stein</B><BR>
	Achva Stein is a USC professor and landscape architect who sees her work as more than an effort to add aesthetic order to landscape; she sees her work as a primary form of address to the very future of the planet.  Her work is noted for the clarity of its formal, social and ecological components, as well as for the way in which these elements find synthesis in a single location.<BR>
<B>Emigre</B><BR>
	Rudy VanderLans and Zuzana Licko have been at the leading and influential edge of the revolutionary transformation of both the methods and content of graphic design as it moves into the digital era.  Their designs, which are expressive, refined and quirky have remade the look of contemporary <BR>
graphics.  Their pioneering work in digital typography has had a crucial impact <BR>

	- 4 -<BR>
on that ancient discipline.  Through their seminal magazine, <I>Emigre</I>, and other writings, they have collaborated on the invention and dissemination of a new language of experimental graphic design that has begun to reshape our visual environment.<BR>
<B>Lebbeus Woods</B><BR>
	Lebbeus Woods is an architectural visionary.  For more than 20 years he has delineated a series of mesmerizing images of the future of architecture and urbanism.  Through a series of books and exhibitions of his drawings and insightful texts, Woods has reimagined the global landscape as the register of both the hopes and anxieties of the present.  His most recent project, devoted to the city of Sarajevo, captures the anguish of that city while offering hope for its rebirth.<BR>
<B>Katherine and Michael McCoy</B><BR>
	Katherine and Michael McCoy are co-chairs of the Design Department at Cranbrook Academy of Art, where they teach graphic and product design, respectively.  Their teachings, research and ideas became enormously influential during the 1980's, when they began to lecture and publish on the symbolic and semantic meaning of design in an era of new technology and miniaturization.  They are partners in McCoy &amp; McCoy, their own design studio.  They recently co-authored the book, <I>Cranbrook Design: The New Design Discourse.</I><BR>

<B>Muriel R. Cooper</B><BR>
	<B>Special note:</B>  Muriel Cooper died suddenly of a heart attack last May after her nomination had been received by the Chrysler Awards.  Cooper's prize will be contributed to an endowed chair at MIT created in her memory by her colleagues and students.<BR>
	Muriel R. Cooper began her career as a traditional graphic designer at the MIT Press, where she was responsible for more than 500 books.  At the peak of her career, she decided to change course, shifting to the design and exploration of information in the electronic, digital realm.  As co-founder of the Visible Language Workshop (VLW) at MIT's media lab, Cooper and her students began to break through the conventions of design on the computer screen, departing from the traditional two-dimensional view to explore new ways to deliver information in a dynamic, three-dimensional domain.  As a designer and educator, Cooper will be remembered as a pioneer of the changing landscape of the electronic frontier.<BR>

<P><center><PRTitle><B>EPIC ELECTRIC MINIVAN AIMS FOR FLEET MARKETS</B></PRTitle><BR>
<B> </B> </center><BR>
  <B> </B><P align ="left"><B><BR>
       Atlanta -- </B> Bringing a new wave of interurban transportation, Chrysler today introduced the EPIC electric minivan at the Electric Vehicle Association of the Americas EV and Infrastructure Conference in Atlanta.<BR>
	We see the EPIC as the next logical step in the development of electric vehicles, said Robert Feldmaier, executive engineer for Chryslers electric minivan program.  The EPIC is the result of an extensive product development program that began in 1986 with the TEVan project with the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI).  Its aimed at the fleet market, which we believe has the greatest potential to utilize this type of vehicle and further develop the technology toward a consumer market.<BR>
	The EPIC, acronym for Electric Powered Interurban Commuter, was developed with Westinghouse and will initially offer the Electrosource Horizon advanced lead-acid battery.  Chrysler has the ability to build the vehicle on-line at its Windsor, Ont. Assembly Plant as part of regular production.  No conversion is necessary.<BR>
	The EPIC model designation will be applied to both Dodge Caravan and Plymouth Voyager models that are optioned with electric power.  Due to development and competitive reasons, the launch date for the vehicle will not be released at this time, Feldmaier said.<BR>
(43195)	-more-<BR>
	-2-<BR>

<P>	There are several final supplier issues that need to be worked through, so were not ready to give an exact launch date, Feldmaier explained.  However, weve made it clear that this vehicle would be available by the 1998 model year, and that has not changed.<BR>
	Feldmaier said demand for the vehicle will also be a factor in establishing a launch target date.  Cost and range are the two critical market issues that will shape fleet customer demand.<BR>
	Because the minivan is by far our most successful vehicle, and because it has the unique ability to work as either a commuter vehicle or a utility vehicle, this platform made the most sense to us for electric power, he said.  The large flat floor also gives us plenty of room to store batteries, and more importantly, to change battery types as new technologies are developed.  Right now were able to get 27 modules at about 1,600 pounds on board of the advanced lead-acid battery.  We anticipate a range of about 60 miles under ideal conditions with that amount and type of battery.<BR>
	The cost and price of the vehicle have also not been finalized.  Feldmaier said the low-volume componentry and the cost of batteries will make the vehicle significantly more costly than a comparable gasoline minivan.  However, as is the case with all Chrysler production vehicle launches, pricing will not be announced until the release date of the vehicle has been established.<BR>

<P>-more-<BR>
	-3-<BR>
	The EPIC will incorporate several unique customer features, including a powermeter that gives the amount of power being drawn by the driver to help optimize driving style to extend range.  <BR>
	The vehicle will also feature anti-lock regenerative brakes and dual airbags, and will meet all federal safety regulations.<BR>
	As a leading seller of alternative fuel vehicles, Chrysler will target many of the fleet and utility customers that have previously purchased its electric and compressed natural gas (CNG) vehicles. <BR>
	At this stage of development, electric vehicles will obviously have a very limited customer base, said Mike Clement, manager of alternative fuel vehicle sales and marketing.  Well first target those fuel providers that are required to buy alternative fuel vehicles under the Energy Policy Act.  We have about 60 of our last generation vehicles working in various utility fleets and were hopeful well be able to continue some of those relationships.  Weve also established an extensive base of alternative fuel vehicle sales with government fleets, so those will also be a target.<BR>
	Because cold and inclement weather tend to diminish EV performance, California will be a prime marketing target for the vehicle, Clement added.<BR>

  <B> </B><P align ="left"><B><BR>
       Highland Park, Mich. -- </B>Coping with pressures. Accepting personal responsibility. Confronting lifes challenges.<BR>
	Those issues and more are evident in the critically acclaimed documentary film - Hoop Dreams, a true story about two teenage boys and their families who pursue their dreams of playing professional basketball in the NBA.<BR>
	Thats why we created the Chrysler Hoop Dreams Challenge, said A.C. Bud Liebler, Chryslers Vice President-Marketing and Communications. Were challenging youth and families all across America to use this film to examine and discuss tough issues, to break down stereotypes, and to explore the real meaning of personal success.<BR>
	The Chrysler Hoop Dreams Challenge, a community-educational outreach program for young adults in 23 major metropolitan areas, will be launched in conjunction with the PBS premiere television broadcast on Wednesday, Nov. 15 at 8:00 p.m. Eastern Standard Time. Hoop Dreams will air in New York on WNET Channel 13.<BR>

<P>(40795-B)					-more-<BR>

<P>	The outreach program includes publication and distribution of student workbooks and teacher-facilitator discussion guides to middle and high schools, a centralized coordination of the program elements by the Center for the Study of Sports in Society (CSSS), the National Consortium for Academics and Sports (NCAS) and KTCA-TV. PBS outreach coordinators will also be utilized along with NCAS and local community leaders for combined school and community outreach efforts, which will benefit young athletes seeking professional careers in sports.<BR>
	According to the National Collegiate Athletic Association, of the 433,000 young people playing high school basketball or football in their senior year, only 23,625 are selected for college teams. And of that number, only 279 will be selected as professional rookies in any given year.<BR>
	The essence of the film goes far beyond the basketball court, said Liebler. We believe its important for young people and their parents to discuss the issues raised in the film. Its one small way we can all help to create a world of greater understanding.<BR>
	Liebler, who found the film compelling, said that a balanced education must include a strong academic foundation with the kind of cultural acceptance that fosters independent thinking.<BR>

<P>	Thousands of gifted athletes who have functioned as superstars throughout their high school and college years face considerable trauma if they are insufficiently prepared to compete in the non-athletic area, according to Earle B. Higgins, a former NBA player and Chryslers Special Supplier Relations Specialist. <BR>
	Higgins, who also heads Athletes Learning Educational Resources Training (A.L.E.R.T.) Organization, said that those 279 young people fortunate enough to become professional rookies frequently discover that their sports career ends in one or two years.<BR>
	A.L.E.R.T. provides free tutorial assistance, guidance and counseling that allows young people to develop realistic goal setting skills.<BR>
	Our young people should have a chance to be the best they can be academically and athletically, said Higgins.<BR>

       Highland Park, Mich. -- </B>When you think of products that sell in the millions, your mind automatically springs to McDonalds hamburgers.  Think of durable goods and the mental picture might turn to television sets or washing machines.  Then, think of a car that has sold by the millions and most folks immediately conjure up the unforgettable profile of the Volkswagen Beetle -- the bug-shaped car that dotted the North American landscape in ever-growing numbers from 1949 to 1979.<BR>
	But did you think of Chrysler Corporation minivans? <BR>
	Chrysler has now sold more than five million Dodge Caravan, Plymouth Voyager and Chrysler Town &amp; Country minivans since its introduction twelve years ago.  By comparison, during the Volkswagen Beetles amazing 30-year run, total United States sales reached 4,988,350.<BR>
	In less than 12 years, Chrysler minivans have out-paced not only the ubiquitous Beetle, but even that other best-selling vehicle in America -- the Little Tikes Cozy Coupe &reg; , Chrysler Corporation Chairman Bob Eaton said, referring, tongue-in-cheek, to the little red and yellow car for toddlers that crowds every sidewalk and driveway in America.  Little Tikes has sold close to 4 million Cozy Coupe vehicles.<BR>
(34895)	(more) <BR>

<P>	We havent just dotted the landscape, our minivans have dramatically changed the automotive industry in North America and the rest of the world, Eaton added.  Chrysler invented the minivan, and now, with our all-new 1996 models, weve re-invented it.  The minivan has become a necessity for many people because its a vehicle that cuts across nearly every life stage and every active lifestyle.<BR>
	When Chrysler introduced the minivan, there was no known segment or customer base to build from, and there was no road map to follow.  But the magic wagon ended up establishing a whole new segment.<BR>
	There are now more than 20 competitive minivan models in the U.S. market.  The minivan segment has grown from a mere 100,000 in 1984 to well over one million units per year.  During the past three years, Chrysler has consecutively sold over a half-million minivans per year.  The one constant is that Chrysler remains at the top of the segment, with 40.4% of the market. <BR>
	Were already hard at work on selling five million more minivans and creating five million more happy customers, Eaton said.  In the meantime, were pleased to be in a league with so many big-sellers, and proud to be such a big part of Americana.<BR>

<P><center><PRTitle><B>1996 DODGE, PLYMOUTH AND CHRYSLER MINIVANS<BR>
USE &quot;REPLACEMENT&quot; PRICING STRATEGY</B></PRTitle><BR>
<B> </B> </center><BR>
  <B> </B><P align ="left"><B><BR>
       Auburn Hills, Mich. -- </B>Chrysler Corporation today announced a two-stage, &quot;replacement&quot; pricing strategy for its all-new 1996 minivans.  Now arriving at Dodge, Plymouth and Chrysler dealerships throughout the United States, the mid-level, premium and luxury versions of the long-wheelbase Dodge Grand Caravan, Plymouth Grand Voyager, and Chrysler Town &amp; Country will be base-priced the same or less than the vehicles they replace. <BR>
	Models in this price range are responsible for the majority of minivan sales in North America.<BR>
	Pricing for entry level, short- and long-wheelbase Plymouth and Dodge models will be announced in the next few months when shipments begin to dealerships.<BR>
	&quot;As our pricing demonstrates, we designed our new minivans with affordability high on our list of priorities,&quot; said Theodor R. Cunningham, Chrysler Corporation Executive Vice President of Sales and Marketing, and General Manager of Minivan Operations.  &quot;Consumers can expect the same high value strategy when our entry-level short- and long-wheelbase models become available later this year.<BR>

<P>
<P>(11595-S)	-more-<BR>

<P>-2-<BR>

<P>	&quot;With this 'replacement' pricing strategy, our new minivans will again set the standard in the minivan market.  They have been completely redesigned from top to bottom with new features our four-million-plus current Chrysler minivan owners requested, combined with others that will surprise and delight them,&quot; Cunningham said. <BR>
	The 1996 Chrysler, Plymouth and Dodge minivans were developed by a 800-person Minivan Platform Team to leapfrog the competition in terms of styling, package efficiency, ride and handling, refinement and quietness.<BR>
	&quot;These vehicles deliver on all counts, offering a package that is stylish and aerodynamic on the outside and larger and more usable on the inside than anything the industry has to offer,&quot; said Cunningham.  &quot;They handle like no other minivan, and feature powertrains and refinement levels which truly set a new standard for quietness.<BR>
	&quot;No other manufacturer in the world can approach Chrysler in the breadth of minivan market coverage, with entry level to luxury models, two bodystyles, eight powertrains, right-and left-side sliding doors, and new Easy Out Roller Seats &reg;.  And once all models go into production, we'll have all-wheel drive, in addition to front-wheel drive,&quot; Cunningham said.  <BR>

<P>
<P>-more-<BR>

<P>-3-<BR>

<P>	Dodge Grand Caravan and Plymouth Grand Voyager SE, Dodge Grand Caravan LE and all Chrysler brand vehicles available at launch time will have four-wheel anti-lock brakes, as well as five mile-per-hour bumpers, dual air bags, dynamic side-impact protection, and 1998 passenger car safety regulations compliance, as standard equipment.<BR>
<B>Dodge Grand Caravan SE</B><BR>
	As an example of the replacement pricing strategy, an all-new 1996 Dodge Grand Caravan SE will begin at $20,155 including destination, and include an all-new 2.4 liter, 16-valve four-cylinder engine developing 150 horsepower, Easy Out Roller Seats &reg;, cruise control, tilt steering wheel, 15-inch wheels and tires, power mirrors; and AM/FM stereo with cassette.<BR>
	The 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine will not be available, however, until Chrysler's Windsor, Ontario assembly plant changes over to the new models this June.  Until then, consumers can order a package that includes a 3.3-liter, V-6 developing 158 horsepower, with a fully adaptive four-speed electronic automatic transmission.  There is no scheduled tune-up for the first 100,000 miles.<BR>
	At $21,440 including destination, this package also comes with rear window defrost and an industry-first windshield wiper de-icer, which melts ice and snow from the vehicle's windshield wipers; air conditioning; and seven-passenger deluxe seating, including headrests, full recline and fold-forward features.<BR>

<P>

	The Dodge Grand Caravan LE starts at $24,240 including destination, and in addition to those features offered as standard equipment on the previous package, includes power door locks, windows and quarter vents, an overhead console with electronic functions, and luxury wheel covers.  <BR>

<P><B>Plymouth Grand Voyager SE</B><BR>
	The Plymouth Grand Voyager SE will begin at $20,155 including destination, and features a 2.4-liter, 24-valve four-cylinder engine; Easy Out Roller Seats&reg;; cruise control; tilt steering wheel; 15-inch wheels and tires; power mirrors; and AM/FM stereo with cassette.<BR>
	While the 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine is not available until June, consumers can order a package with a 3.3-liter, V-6 engine with a fully adaptive four-speed electronic automatic transmission.  At $21,440 including destination, the package also comes with rear window defrost and windshield wiper de-icer, air conditioning, and seven-passenger deluxe seating.  <BR>

<P>-5-<BR>

<P><B>Chrysler Town &amp; Country</B><BR>
	The Chrysler line-up will offer a broader range of vehicles than ever before, including a new short-wheelbase configuration available later in the spring.  The Chrysler Town &amp; Country long-wheelbase model will be priced starting at $24,520 including destination, and features seven-passenger deluxe seating with Easy Out Roller Seats&reg;,  cruise control, tilt leather-wrapped steering wheel, illuminated visor mirrors, power vent windows, and rear window defrost with windshield wiper de-icer.<BR>
<B>Chrysler Town &amp; Country LXi</B><BR>
	The top-of-the-line Chrysler Town &amp; Country LXi long-wheelbase model will be priced at $29,980 including destination, and features luxury amenities not generally associated with minivans, such as: memory seats and mirrors; eight-way power seats for driver and front passenger; 16-inch cast aluminum wheels and tires; and Dual Zone Temperature Control and rear heater/air.  Also standard is a 3.8-liter V-6 -- developing 166 horsepower -- with a fully adaptive four-speed electronic automatic transmission; and left-side sliding door; Infinity Acoustic 10&reg; combination CD and cassette player; overhead console with electronic functions; windshield wiper de-icer and rear defrost; luggage rack; and fog lights.

  <B> </B><P align ="left"><B><BR>
       Highland Park, Mich. -- </B>- Led by an 18 percent increase in truck sales over 1993, Chrysler posted its best overall January sales since 1990.  Total vehicle sales for the month were 158,279, besting last year's total by 11 percent.  Chrysler has now posted 24 consecutive monthly increases in total vehicle sales.  Retail sales of 119,288 were up 6 percent from 1993 and represented the 26th consecutive monthly increase.<BR>
 	&quot;Credit the public's acceptance of Chrysler products and the continued strength of the economy for the strong month,&quot; said Theodor R. Cunningham, Executive Vice President -- Sales and Marketing and General Manager -- Minivan Operations.  &quot;You just have to look at 13 individual car and truck January sales records to see that consumers are seeking out our full range of products.&quot;    <BR>
	Car sales of 60,667 were up one percent from last year, representing the best January sales since 1991.  Chrysler has now posted 15 consecutive month to month increases in total car sales.  Nine Chrysler cars posted their best ever January sales, paced by the LH models Dodge Intrepid (9,282 units) and Chrysler Concorde (4,134).  Sales of the Dodge/Plymouth Neon were 2,958 in its first month.<BR>

<P>(05894)	-more-<BR>

<P>-2-<BR>

<P>	Led by Dodge Ram and Jeep&reg; Grand Cherokee, truck sales of 97,612 represented the 30th consecutive monthly increase.  This also represents an 18 percent increase over 1993 sales of 82,808.  Dodge Ram broke a 17 year-old January sales record with 14,776 units sold, 954 units ahead of the 1977 record of 13,822.  Ram sales also marked a 158 percent increase over prior year sales.   Jeep&reg; Grand Cherokee sales topped 20,000 units for the sixth consecutive month (20,619) and recorded their best January ever.   <BR>
	Jeep&reg;/Eagle Division has now posted 17 consecutive monthly sales records, based on January sales of 38,866 units.  Jeep&reg; Wrangler sales of 5,423 for the month represents a 65 percent increase over prior year sales.<BR>
	Chrysler Town &amp; County had its best January ever on sales of 1,905.  Chrysler's luxury minivan has now had 29 consecutive monthly sales records.<BR>
	&quot;We're very encouraged by the continued success of the Town &amp; Country in the luxury van segment,&quot; Cunningham said.  &quot;And with our Minivan Sale having started at the beginning of this month, the future looks very bright for our entire minivan line.&quot;<BR>

       Highland Park, Mich. -- </B>- Led by monthly records across several vehicle lines -- including minivans, Jeep&reg; Grand Cherokee and an all-time record for Dodge Ram pickup -- Chrysler Corporation posted a November sales record of 177,073 units, up five percent versus year-ago totals.  Chrysler also set a new November record for retail sales.<BR>
	The momentum established by Chryslers all-new minivans in the marketplace has been overwhelming, said Theodor R. Cunningham, Executive Vice President, Sales and Marketing.  The new models have established four consecutive monthly records, and just last week, the 1996 Dodge Caravan became the first minivan to win <I>Motor Trends</I> Car of the Year award.  That, coupled with the continued sales success of the Dodge Ram pickup and Jeep Grand Cherokee, provided us with an excellent start to the holiday season.<BR>
	Corporate truck sales established a November record with 118,821 units sold, 11 percent ahead of last year and the ninth month that number has topped 100,000 units.  Dodge Truck also set a November record with sales of 62,075, with Dodge Ram posting a 32 percent gain over last year to 27,089 units, its 24th consecutive monthly record.<BR>

	In addition, Jeep Grand Cherokee sales increased eight percent to 23,327 units, also a record for the month of November.<BR>
	Sales of Chryslers popular Dodge Caravan, Plymouth Voyager and Chrysler Town &amp; Country minivans totaled a November record 40,800 units.  A monthly record was also established by Town &amp; Country with sales of 6,216 units, its seventh consecutive monthly record.  Dodge Caravan also set a November record on sales of 21,908 units -- its fourth consecutive monthly record.<BR>
	Total car sales were 58,252, down five percent versus last year but a 14 percent gain over last month.  Car sales were led by Dodge Intrepid, which posted a November sales record of 13,196 units, helping Dodge Division pass the one million sales milestone for the calendar year, the earliest ever in its history.<BR>

THE NASCAR SUPERTRUCK SERIES</B></PRTitle><BR>
<B> </B> </center><BR>
  <B> </B><P align ="left"><B><BR>
       Auburn Hills, Mich. -- </B> Chrysler Corporation announced today that it will provide factory support to teams which run the Dodge Ram 1500 in the NASCAR SuperTruck series effective immediately.  This marks the first time that the corporation has been involved in NASCAR since it left the stock car scene in 1971.<BR>
	Support begins with the Dodge and Mopar divisions making contingency payments for podium finishes.  It is followed by Dodge Truck and Mopar Performance engineering development of engines and body aerodynamics in preparation for expanded involvement in the 1996 season.<BR>
  	&quot;We are getting back into NASCAR racing with our Dodge Ram because it makes sense from the technology and marketing perspective,&quot; said Bernard Robertson, Vice President - Engineering Technologies and General Manager - Jeep&reg;/Truck Operations.  &quot;The trucks in the series run with production sheet metal, are rear-wheel drive, and are powered by our Magnum V-8 engine  like the street truck but specially prepared for racing.&quot;<BR>
	The engineering effort is a combination of in-house engineers working with experienced race engine builders and race teams.  The goal is to provide a fully competitive package of Dodge Ram components for the 1996 season.<BR>
(29895-S)					- 1 -<BR>

<P>
<P>	&quot;All you have to do is look in the parking lot of a NASCAR SuperTruck race to see that this is a natural truck market,&quot; said Dodge General Manager Marty Levine.  &quot;Race fans like to see the truck they own race on the track.  This also gives us the opportunity to enjoy the same rivalry with our competitors on the track that we do in the marketplace.&quot;<BR>
	The contingency program is open to any team running Dodge Rams.   Payments for the top three positions are $10,000, $5,000, and $2,500, respectively.  This matches the contingency funds offered by the other truck manufacturers.<BR>

<P><center><PRTitle><B>CALIFORNIA CERTIFIES CHRYSLER MINIVANS <BR>
AS ULTRA LOW EMISION VEHICLES</B></PRTitle><BR>
<B> </B> </center><BR>
  <B> </B><P align ="left"><B><BR>
       Los Angeles, Ca -- </B>Chrysler Corporation's compressed natural gas (CNG) minivan has been certified as one of the &quot;world's cleanest internal combustion vehicles&quot; by the state of California, it was announced today.<BR>
	The California Air Resources Board certified the CNG minivans as Ultra-Low Emission Vehicles (ULEV).  The ULEV announcement makes Chrysler the only company to be certified in all three of the major low emission categories as mandated by California law.  Last year, the Chrysler TEVan received certification as a Zero Emissions Vehicle (ZEV) and the full-size Dodge Ram Van CNG received certification as the first Low Emission Vehicle (LEV).<BR>
	The minivans will be marketed as the Dodge Caravan, Caravan C/V and the Plymouth Voyager.<BR>
	&quot;This gives Chrysler a vehicle that meets the ULEV standards in California almost five years ahead of schedule,&quot; said Richard O. Schaum, executive engineer for the minivan platform team.  &quot;But perhaps just as importantly, the CNG minivan has the unique ability to serve both common fleet applications and actual retail consumers.  While fleets will be the immediate target, we're hopeful that the additional availability of certified vehicles will help to rapidly fuel the infrastructure development.&quot;<BR>
-more-<BR>
(07894-S)<BR>
-2-<BR>
	Gas Research Institute (GRI), the natural gas industry's research and development management organization, provided a portion of the funding for the CNG minivan program.  Advanced injector technology, previously developed with GRI for the full size NGV Ram Van program, was coupled with advanced electronics and catalyst technology, enabling the minivan to achieve the ULEV status.<BR>
	&quot;The Chrysler/GRI partnership is a textbook model of an effective strategic alliance in product development to meet market needs,&quot; said Stephen D. Ban, GRI president and chief executive officer.  &quot;This cooperative effort enabled the auto and natural gas industries to move forward rapidly to meet the growing demand for ultra-clean vehicles that are both practical and cost-effective.&quot;<BR>
	Including the full-size Ram Van CNG, Chrysler has the capacity to build as many as 2,000 LEV and ULEV certified vehicles in 1994.  According to Schaum, the reasons for pursuing natural gas vehicle development are compelling.<BR>
	&quot;While natural gas vehicles are somewhat restricted by range due to fuel storage constraints, they are able to achieve extremely low emission levels without diminishing the basic performance and serviceability characteristics of the vehicle,&quot; Schaum said.  &quot;These are essential in making them attractive to fleet and retail consumers.   It is also essential that utility companies continue to develop infrastructure in places like Los Angeles.  Utilities like SoCal Gas have established plans to work to develop the infrastructure further and have worked closely with Chrysler to move the market along.&quot;<BR>
-more-<BR>
	-3-<BR>
	But while CNGs are promising, Schaum emphasized they are simply one piece of a complex puzzle in meeting Clean Air Act mandates.<BR>
	&quot;We know that as technology begins to catch up with the regulations, gasoline engines will be able to deliver LEV performance without some of the constraints posed by other alternative fuels,&quot; Schaum said.  &quot;Alternative fuel vehicles like CNG are one piece of a very complex puzzle.&quot;<BR>
 	The CNG minivan is powered by a 3.3-liter V-6 engine and stores the CNG in four main tanks attached to the underside of the minivan.  Because these tanks are not located inside the vehicle, load space is not compromised.  The fuel is stored at about 3,000 pounds per square inch (psi), which is about the equivalent of 8.2 gallons of gasoline.  With refueling equipment that has the ability to achieve 3,600 psi, fuel capacity can go to 9.4 gallons.  Range will typically be between 160-180 miles. <BR>
	The CNG option will cost about $4,000 over the regular vehicle price.  However, A. Michael Clement, Chrysler's manager of alternative fuel vehicle marketing, said incentives from different state and federal sources can nearly eliminate the additional cost.<BR>
	&quot;These are great first steps,&quot; Clement explained.  &quot;But the market for alternative fuel vehicles still remains tentative to say the least.  With all of the awareness surrounding the Ram Van LEV status and thousands of dollars of incentives per vehicle, we sold only 25 percent of our production capacity.  With a capacity to build about 2,000 CNG vehicles, we're hopeful our strengthened marketing efforts and the popularity of minivans in general will help push the market along.&quot;<BR>
-more-<BR>
	-4-<BR>
	Schaum added that there has been reluctant market acceptance of other alternative fuel vehicles.<BR>
	&quot;In California where we have all the EV mandates,&quot; he said, &quot;we figured to sell more than half of the 50 planned electric vehicles we built for 1993.  We only sold four here.  The others went to places in the east and southwest.  With the cost and infrastructure advantages of CNG, we hope to make more progress.&quot;<BR>
	To help address the issue, Chrysler announced it will offer the first dealer marketing, sales and service program dedicated to alternative fuel vehicles.  Los Angeles dealers will stock CNG vehicles for  fleet and retail markets, and Chrysler will provide a full-line of sales, marketing and service training support.  <BR>

       Highland Park, Mich. -- </B>Following a year in which it posted all-time sales and market share records, the Dodge Division of Chrysler Corporation is poised to solidify its position in 1996 as one of the highest-selling and most recognizable brands in the automotive industry.<BR>
	Total Dodge sales in 1995 were 1,126,314 units -- the third best-selling brand in the automotive industry -- while its share of the car and truck marketplace rose to 7.4 percent, up from 6.9 percent in 1994.  In addition, all three Chrysler brands -- Dodge, Jeep&reg;-Eagle and Chrysler-Plymouth -- finished in the top ten in U.S. sales in 1995 for the first time in history. <BR>
	Last year, at this time, we were happy to report sales of over one million units, said Martin R. Levine, General Manager, Dodge Division.  This year, were happy to report we topped that with best-ever sales in the 82-year history of Dodge.  It reflects the acceptance our new cars, trucks and award-winning minivans have achieved in the marketplace over the last four years -- bold, expressive and innovative vehicles that have redefined the Dodge brand.<BR>
- more -<BR>
- 2 -<BR>
	Dodge Ram continued its success in the marketplace with record sales of 271,501 units and a 16.2 percent segment share.  Due to the Rams popularity among pickup truck buyers, truck production was added at the St. Louis North Assembly Plant beginning early in the fourth quarter.<BR>
	<I>Motor Trends </I>1996 Car of the Year -- the all-new Dodge Caravan -- helped spur total Chrysler minivan sales to over 500,000 in North America for the fourth consecutive year. Caravan remained the best-selling minivan in the U.S. with over 260,000 units sold.  Chryslers share of the minivan market in the U.S. last year was 42.1 percent.<BR>
	In addition, Dodge Intrepid, Neon, Stratus and Avenger all set calendar year sales records.<BR>
	A major objective this year is to add even more depth to the brand, more product actions, and more image building activities, Levine added.  Were set to do that with new products such as the recently introduced Dodge Viper GTS Coupe and Dodge Ram Indy 500 Special Edition (the official car and truck of the Indianapolis 500), and an increased technical and marketing emphasis in our motorsports activities.<BR>

<B> </B> </center><BR>
  <B> </B><P align ="left"><B><BR>
       Chicago, Il -- </B> Chrysler unveiled its fifth exciting concept vehicle for 1994 today at the Chicago Auto Show -- the Dodge Ram VTS.  Sporting an aggressive appearance featuring a banzai blue paint job with a white &quot;skunk stripe&quot; reminiscent of the Dodge Viper GTS Coupe, a lowered suspension, a Mopar heavy-duty 3.90 ring and pinion rear axle, and 17-inch aluminum wheels and performance tires, the Ram VTS is a stunning melding of Dodge car <U>and</U> truck performance.  <BR>
	Powering the Ram VTS concept truck is a 488 cubic inch aluminum Viper <BR>
V-10 engine which generates a neck-snapping 400-plus horsepower.  The Ram VTS's awesome power is transmitted to the rear wheels via a 6-speed manual transmission.  	&quot;We knew that it would only be a matter of time until someone would try to pack a Viper V-10 engine into a Ram truck,&quot; said Chrysler designer <BR>
Mike Castiglione at the Ram VTS unveiling.  &quot;We thought Dodge ought to beat them to the punch.&quot;<BR>
	Although Chrysler has no plans to put the Ram VTS into production it is not a frivolous exercise, explained Castiglione.  &quot;Our new Dodge Ram is a very expressive truck.  We know that there are a lot of car and truck enthusiasts who will want to personalize that expression while enhancing the Ram's performance.  The Ram VTS is just one way -- our way -- of doing just that.&quot;<BR>

And we're only beginning to enter the international markets with strong passenger cars,&quot; said Thomas C. Gale, Vice President of Design and International Operations. <BR>

<P><center><PRTitle><B>CHRYSLER MINIVAN SUCCESS KEEPS ROLLING INTO 10TH YEAR<BR>
</B></PRTitle><BR>
<B> </B> </center><BR>
  <B> </B><P align ="left"><B><BR>
       Auburn Hills, Mich. -- </B> In the springtime of its 10th year, heading into its 10th summer vacation season and facing its most diverse competition in the last decade, Chrysler Corporation's value-packed Dodge Caravan and Grand Caravan, Chrysler Town and Country, and Plymouth Voyager and Grand Voyager minivans just recorded their most successful first quarter of sales ever.<BR>
	Setting an all-time record of 140,773 units, the company's minivans have demonstrated an unprecedented ability to define, meet and predict the needs and desires of American consumers. And 10 years after beginning a new chapter of automobile history, Chrysler minivans are still the trendsetters in a North American minivan market of close to 1.5 million units. They are pacing the development of minivans in the largest international markets as well.<BR>
	In large part, this is due to being on the leading edge 10 years ago in reading the desires of a small market of consumers asking for a garageable vehicle that combined all the utility of a small van with the features of a car. Chrysler minivans delivered it all with unprecedented value. <BR>
	Customers change, tastes change, trends change, but this equation of what made the world's leading minivan still drives the world's leading minivan. Owners and Dodge, Chrysler and Plymouth minivans grew up together. <BR>

<P>
<P>(more)<BR>

<P>
<P>(16594-S)<BR>

<P>-2-<BR>
	Today, they are over four million strong, and as a result, in its 10th record-setting year, Chrysler minivans continue to set the pace for the rest of the market to follow. As just a few examples:<BR>
-	Dodge Caravan and Plymouth Voyager were the first to debut with a &quot;family wagon&quot; in October 1993.<BR>
-	Caravan and Voyager added V6 power in 1987 to satisfy the demand for increased performance and towing capability.<BR>
-	Caravan and Voyager were the first to add an extended wheelbase version in 1987.<BR>
-	Chrysler Town and Country was the first &quot;luxury&quot; minivan introduced in 1990.<BR>
-	Caravan, Grand Caravan, Voyager and Grand Voyager were the first to offer drivers side airbags in 1991.<BR>
-	Caravan, Grand Caravan, Voyager and Grand Voyager added the increased security of four-wheel anti-lock brakes and all-wheel drive in 1991.<BR>
-	Caravan, Grand Caravan, Voyager and Grand Voyager were the first with integrated child seats in 1992.<BR>
-	Caravan, Grand Caravan, Voyager, Grand Voyager, and Town and Country were the first to achieve over three million units sold in 1992.<BR>
-	Caravan, Grand Caravan, Voyager, Grand Voyager and Town and Country were the first to add standard passenger airbags in 1994.<BR>
-	In 1994, Caravan, Grand Caravan, Voyager and Grand Voyager and Town and Country were the first to meet all 1998 passenger car safety standards. <BR>
-	A Dodge Grand Caravan becomes the four millionth Chrysler minivan sold in December 1993.<BR>
-	In the first quarter of 1994 Chrysler minivans achieved a 48.9% share of the U.S. minivan market. The Chrysler Voyager achieved a 21% share of the European market.<BR>

<P>(more)<BR>

<P>-3-<BR>
	-	Owner loyalty is at an all-time high with 71% of all Chrysler minivan owners saying they will buy another and that's higher than Mercedes, Honda and Toyota.<BR>
-	In 1994, Chrysler minivans won the following awards:<BR>
	 American Automobile Association &quot;Best Buy Auto Picks&quot;<BR>
		 	The Car Book &quot;Best Bets&quot;<BR>
 Consumer Digest &quot;Best Buys&quot;<BR>
 Family Circle Magazine &quot;Family Car of the Year&quot; Finalist<BR>
 Kiplinger's Personal Finance &quot;Best New Cars&quot; Minivan Class<BR>
 Motorweek &quot;Driver's Choice Awards&quot;<BR>
		 National Head Injury Foundation &quot;1994 Safe Family Vehicle of the Year&quot;<BR>
 Prevention Magazine &quot;Safe Car Achievement Award&quot;<BR>

<P> 	&quot;In the last 10 years, we worked very hard to foster a mutual love affair between our customers and their minivans,&quot; said Theodor R. Cunningham, Chrysler Executive Vice President Sales and Marketing and General Manager Minivan Operations. &quot;As a result, we now have an owner base of over four million to tap into to find out what the minivan customer wants next. These people are a continual source of information to us that no one else has. They tell us what they like. They tell us what they don't like. They tell us where to go next. And because we have so much data, every once in a while we can return the favor by introducing something we know they want next but haven't yet asked for.&quot;<BR>
	This happened with the launch of the 1994 Chrysler Plymouth and Dodge minivans when driver and passenger airbags were made standard with dynamic side impact protection that combined to meet all 1998 passenger car safety standards.<BR>

<P>(more)<BR>

<P>-4-<BR>
	 &quot;In the past 10 years we have been watching a growing interest in safety among our owners,&quot; said Cunningham. &quot;While they never actually asked us to meet passenger car safety standards, we knew if we did they would be delighted and it would once again set a trend for others to follow. Ditto for the other things our competitors are now adding such as larger V-6 engines and integrated child seats.&quot;<BR>
	In the coming years, Chrysler expects to continue to pace the minivan market both in North America and in key international markets such as Europe. Others admittedly base their new designs on Chrysler's. As this happens, the challenge for Chrysler will be to continually &quot;leapfrog&quot; its competition in value, quality, features, style and utility. <BR>
	Over the last 10 years, this challenge has been successfully met. In less than one year, an all-new family of Dodge, Chrysler and Plymouth minivans will debut. And once more, the game of &quot;follow the leader&quot; should begin.           <BR>

  <B> </B><P align ="left"><B><BR>
       Highland Park, Mich. -- </B>Just one look at the new Plymouth Breeze and Plymouth Neon Wave show cars and you'll notice there's something different about the new Plymouth.  With their retractable roofs, sporty looks and youth-oriented features, these cars make a bold statement that Plymouth is fresh, lively and ready to welcome a new generation of smart buyers.<BR>
	The Wave and the Breeze - which, incidentally, will be the new name for the Plymouth version of Chrysler Corporation's JA sedans - are making their debut here at the 1995 North American International Auto Show.<BR>
	&quot;Make no bones about it, The Breeze and Wave personify the 'New Plymouth,' &quot; said Chrysler-Plymouth General Manager Steve Torok.  &quot;Plymouth is geared to appeal to an active youth market, one that's seeking value and fun.  And the Breeze and Wave deliver!<BR>
	&quot;We don't expect everyone to fall in love with these cars, but then again, I'm not sure we want these cars to appeal to everyone.&quot; <BR>
	The Plymouth Breeze takes the class-leading room and aerodynamic cab-forward design popularized in the Chrysler Cirrus and moves it into the great outdoors.  With a full-length, fully-retractable, power-operated roof, driving the Breeze on a beautiful day is just that: a breeze!<BR>
(00395)	-more-<BR>

<P>-2-<BR>
	The Plymouth Wave Sedan and Coupe take the fun and sportiness of the Neon to new levels.  In addition to the &quot;Vista Top&quot; roof concept it shares with the Breeze are hot interior trim accents and exterior paint colors. <BR>
	These vehicles also will &quot;sport&quot; trunk- and roof-mounted bike racks with Garvin&reg; bicycles.  The Breeze will show a unique rack system which allows you to open the trunk without removing the bikes.<BR>
	The Breeze and Wave will join several other Plymouth theme cars, including the new Plymouth Backpack, on a nationwide &quot;Plymouth Vitality Tour,&quot; travelling to auto shows and other special events throughout the year.  <BR>
	&quot;The Breeze, Wave and Backpack are motorized billboards for the new Plymouth,&quot; Torok said. &quot;From their aggressive looks to the spirited youthful image they convey, the future of Plymouth is in these cars.&quot;<BR>

 NEW INTERNATIONAL PARTS DISTRIBUTION CENTER<BR>
TO MEET EXPANDING NEEDS OF CUSTOMERS GLOBALLY</B></PRTitle><BR>
<B> </B> </center><BR>
  <B> </B><P align ="left"><B><BR>
       Highland Park, Mich. -- </B>Chrysler Corporation today announced plans for a new, 375,000-square-foot (35,000 square meter) parts distribution center in Puurs, Belgium to meet the expanding needs of its vehicle distributors in more than 35 countries.<BR>
	The facility, which will open in mid-1995 and service distributors in Europe, Africa and the Middle East, replaces a 236,000 square-foot (22 square meter) warehouse and office in Aartselaar, Belgium that was dedicated only three years ago.  It will be built and managed by Caterpillar Logistics Services (CLS), Inc., which also manages the Aartselaar facility.<BR>
	&quot;Our international sales increased by 45 percent in 1993 despite a depressed world economy, so we recognized we would soon outgrow our current facility,&quot; said Lawrence W. Baker, General Manager of Chrysler's Mopar Parts Division.  &quot;The situation is further compounded because we will introduce six all-new vehicles worldwide in the next 20 months.  And, given the reaction in the United States to those vehicles, it stands to reason our international sales will continue to grow.&quot;<BR>
(10594)	(more)<BR>

<P>- 2 -<BR>
	The new facility will maintain the current staff and will supply 75 Chrysler distributors and more than 2,000 sales outlets.<BR>
	&quot;We chose Puurs because it's strategically located between the port of Antwerp and the major international airport in Brussels,&quot; said David Ecklund, CLS European Commercial Manager.  &quot;Belgium has proven to be an excellent location for Chrysler's replacement parts business, and we are confident it will continue to meet the business needs of Chrysler and CLS in the future.&quot;<BR>
	Caterpillar Logistics Services, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Caterpillar, Inc., provides warehousing, logistics information systems, transportation and consulting services to Chrysler and other leading manufacturers for the distribution of their products.  CLS currently operates 36 warehouse facilities worldwide.  <BR>

<P><center><PRTitle><B>CHRYSLER TO TACKLE SCRAP TIRE PROBLEM<BR>
WITH RECYCLING PROGRAM</B></PRTitle><BR>
<B> </B> </center><BR>
  <B> </B><P align ="left"><B><BR>
       Auburn Hills, Mich. -- </B> The problem of automotive tire disposal is one of the toughest landfill issues facing the nation.  In an attempt to deal with the issue, Chrysler Corporation and National Rubber Company, Inc. have announced plans to make vehicle parts out of recycled tire rubber.<BR>
	Parts initially targeted for production from the partnership will include steering shaft seals and fender liners.  Chrysler is already using recycled rubber splash guards on its mid-size sedans.  <BR>
	National Rubber Company, of Canada, manufactured and sold about $6 million worth of rubber car parts to Chrysler in 1993.  The companies also are researching the development of a high quality polymer-grade recycled rubber for widespread use in auto-parts.    <BR>
	Because the recycled rubber is highly durable, company officials say use of recycled rubber in selected parts will not sacrifice quality.  The long term environmental implications could be significant.  &quot;Performance from these products in our tests showed them to be extremely competitive, and in some cases, better than similar parts made from virgin materials,&quot; said Mark Russell, Chrysler large car platform engineer.  <BR>
(07994-S)	(more)<BR>
-2-<BR>
	While today's automobile is the most highly recycled post-consumer product, with about 75 percent of its volume by weight recycled, most of the recycled content is metal.  Rubber, glass, fluids, plastics and other non-metal content are problematic for the scrap industry to deal with.  <BR>
	According to Susan Yester, Chrysler recycling programs executive, scrap tires are posing a significant environmental problem.<BR>
	&quot;The increasing cost of tire disposal has led to a disturbing trend of tire dumping,&quot; Yester said.  &quot;In Detroit, for example, tire piles are showing up in neighborhoods that are already struggling for their very existence.  <BR>
	&quot;The cost for properly disposing of tires is leading some disreputable business owners to simply dump scrap tires wherever they can,&quot; Yester continued.  &quot;Our hope is that programs like this one will reduce the cost of disposal in favor of the profit potential in recycling the tires.&quot; <BR>
	&quot;We expect to use more recycled-rubber parts on next-generation Chrysler vehicles,&quot;  Russell said.  &quot;Not only will this decrease the number of products currently made from virgin materials, but it will help reduce the increasing number of used tires from appearing on the landscape or in solid waste landfills.&quot;  <BR>
	Tires are made of approximately 65 percent rubber, 10 percent fibre and 25 percent steel by weight.  Tires are recycled through a grinding, shredding, magnetic separating, screening and sorting process.  The material is then molded into such things as car parts.  	Chrysler has embraced a comprehensive approach to vehicle recycling with up-front recycle-sensitive vehicle design processes, on-going recycling research initiatives with its suppliers, and a special plastic parts coding practice aimed at easing material identification and sorting for recycling.  <BR>

       Highland Park, Mich. -- </B> The Dodge Division of Chrysler Corporation will mark its sixth year of sponsoring the Dodge International Race of Champions (IROC) on February 17, 1995 at Daytona International Speedway, in Daytona Beach, Fla.<BR>
	&quot;Dodge is proud to be back with IROC for the sixth year,&quot; said Martin R. Levine, General Manager, Dodge Division.<BR>
	&quot;Last year, race fans saw the public debut of our Avengers months before you could buy one.  And now, after a year of some of the fastest and most exciting racing in IROC history, the Avenger returns with the promise of even more excitement.&quot;<BR>
	Dodge will again provide identically prepared Dodge Avenger to 12 of the world's top drivers representing different types of motorsports.  Three vehicles will carry cameras that will put home viewers of ABC Sports in the driver's seat and help make the IROC series one of the most popular forms of motorsports on television.<BR>

<P>	Historic Darlington Raceway, in Darlington, S.C., will be the site of the second race on March 25; followed by Talladega Superspeedway, in Talladega, Ala. on April 29; and Michigan International Speedway, in Brooklyn, Mich. on July 29.<BR>
	&quot;Buckle your seat belts and get ready for another great season of Dodge IROC,&quot; Levine said.  &quot;With a year of testing and racing the Avenger, this could be the best year yet!&quot;<BR>

	&quot;The Stratus will successfully bring to compact and lower-midsize buyers a car with all the attributes of the segment-leading Japanese imports for many thousands less,&quot; said Marty Levine, Dodge Division General Manager. &quot;It combines the interior room of a larger sedan with the ride and handling of a sports coupe, at a price that represents unprecedented value.&quot;<BR>

       Highland Park, Mich. -- </B> &quot;It's been a great year and we want to share it with the community.&quot;  <BR>
	With those words, Chrysler Chairman Bob Eaton and other senior officers today notified 19 cultural and artistic organizations in southeast Michigan that they will be sharing more than $4.3 million as part of an extraordinary grant program in recognition of Chrysler's most profitable quarter in the corporation's 69-year history.  <BR>
	&quot;We owe our success to the hard work of our employees, dealers and suppliers, and to the confidence of our shareholders and the buying public in our new products,&quot; Eaton said.  &quot;We know the important role cultural organizations play in making an area a better place to live.  Our employees -- and Detroit area residents in general -- benefit greatly when quality, accessible and diverse cultural attractions are well funded and plentiful.&quot;<BR>
	Individual grants ranging from $1.1 million to $10,000 have been designated by the Chrysler Corporation Fund to a cross-section of the region's arts organizations, <BR>
including the Detroit Institute of Arts - Founders Society, Museum of African-American History, Highland Park Public Library, Pontiac-Oakland Symphony Orchestra and the Macomb Center for the Performing Arts.  Recipients were notified today of their grant, <BR>

	&quot;More and more we are convinced that funding for the arts must be done on a regional basis, since these organizations as available to all Metro Detroiters and are important to the quality of life for all of us who live and work in southeast Michigan,&quot; Eaton said. <BR>

NEW TRUCK ADS TO HIGHLIGHT TOP RESALE STATUS</B></PRTitle><BR>
<B> </B> </center><BR>
  <B> </B><P align ="left"><B><BR>
       Highland Park, Mich. -- </B> American truck buyers want value.  Not just when they buy a truck, but when they sell it, as well.  According to the National Automobile Dealers Association (N.A.D.A.) Official Used Car Guide, the best resale values in compact and full-size pickups are Dodge trucks.  Chrysler Corporation's Dodge Division is communicating this message through a series of television and print ads running this spring.  <BR>
	Dodge will boast it's category-leading resale value for compact (1991-94 models) and full-size (1994 model) pickups in ads set to run on prime time and late-night network and cable television shows and in major general and special interest publications.<BR>
	The N.A.D.A. Official Used Car Guide (January-March, 1995 issue) indicates the 1994 Dodge Ram offers a residual value of 91 percent, compared to 85 percent for its closest competitor.  The average residual value for 1991-94 Dodge Dakotas is 70 percent, versus 62 percent for the nearest compact pickup.<BR>
	&quot;Resale value is one of the top purchase considerations for truck buyers,&quot; said Dodge General Manager Martin R. Levine.  &quot;And when Dodge was recognized for resale value by N.A.D.A. - the resale authority - we saw a great message to bring to truck buyers.&quot;<BR>

<P><center><PRTitle><B>STRATUS ADDS ONE MORE SUPERSTAR<BR>
TO PACKED DODGE LINE-UP</B></PRTitle><BR>
<B> </B> </center><BR>
  <B> </B><P align ="left"><B><BR>
       Highland Park, Mich. -- </B>- While Dodge Stratus is the answer to many consumers' needs in a four-door compact sedan, it does beg one question: &quot;Is there a hotter brand in the industry than Dodge?&quot;  The new Dodge Stratus is the latest in a long line of sporty, fun-to-drive, value-priced performance cars, trucks and minivans from the industry's image leader: Dodge.<BR>
	What began a few years ago, when Dodge went back to the drawing board - and back in time - to develop the Viper, was a plan to build upon the success of Caravan and Dakota.  The idea was to develop a full line of cars, trucks and minivans that delivered uncompromised driving pleasure, styling and cutting-edge design at an affordable price for its place in the market segment.  Now, in 1995, Dodge has a complete line-up to meet this stringent set of criteria.<BR>
	&quot;While Viper serves as a road marker of where we started, Stratus signifies where we are today,&quot; said Dodge General Manager Marty Levine.  &quot;And along the way, from Intrepid to Ram to Neon to Avenger, we've never lost sight of our goal of offering a vehicle that is exciting when you want it to be, yet functional when you need it to be.&quot; <BR>
(53094)	-more-<BR>

<P>-2-<BR>

<P>	Stratus fills out the Dodge line-up by offering consumers shopping in the compact and lower-midsize segments an aggressively styled sedan that boasts class-leading room and many standard comfort and safety features in a package that provides outstanding value.<BR>
		&quot;The Stratus will successfully bring to compact and lower-midsize buyers a car with all the attributes of the segment-leading Japanese imports, but for thousands of dollars less,&quot; Levine said.<BR>
	With a broad selection of packages available in two trim levels, Stratus also offers a choice of three powertrains; a 2.0-liter, 16-valve SOHC four-cylinder engine mated to a five-speed manual transaxle; a 2.4-liter, 16-valve DOHC four-cylinder engine mated to a fully-adaptive, four-speed electronic transaxle; and a 2.5-liter, 24-valve V-6 SOHC engine also mated to a fully-adaptive four-speed electronic transaxel.<BR>
	&quot;While Stratus is significant in that Dodge dealers now have a four-door compact to compete with the best in its class, it's equally important because it completes our product line-up,&quot; Levine said.  &quot;We now can proudly say that Dodge offers a stylish, sporty and value-priced car, truck or minivan for everyone.&quot;<BR>

<P><center><PRTitle><B>CIRRUS ADS TOUT PRODUCT ADVANTAGES TO YOUNGER AUDIENCE</B></PRTitle><BR>
<B> </B> </center><BR>
  <B> </B><P align ="left"><B><BR>
       Highland Park, Mich. -- </B>Advertisements for the 1995 Chrysler Cirrus compact sedan -- targeted at a younger audience than traditional Chrysler buyers -- are highlighted by tangible, credible advantages the car has over the competition.   <BR>
	 &quot;We strongly feel that the advertising is fresh, contemporary and geared toward an audience that is younger than our traditional Chrysler buyers,&quot; said Steve Torok, Chrysler-Plymouth General Manager.  &quot;And it needs to be.  The buyers we're targeting are in many ways the toughest market we've tried to sell to.  They are young and demanding.  And they've been buying imports that have been satisfying them day in and day out for years.&quot;  <BR>
	The first launch commercial, &quot;Clouds,&quot; is designed to get the Cirrus name in front of target buyers and register its fundamental character.<BR>
	The spot opens with a man lying on the grass, gazing up at the clouds overhead and addresses the product attributes of Cirrus versus the import competition.  <BR>
	&quot;New Plateau&quot; reinforces the same messages, extolling the virtues of the industry's first cab-forward designed compact and demonstrating that Cirrus is in a class all by itself.<BR>
(35094)	- more -<BR>

<P>- 2 -<BR>
	&quot;While its name is derived from the heavens, one of the best reasons to own one is very down to earth,&quot; viewers hear the voiceover say, followed immediately by a super listing the Cirrus' price.<BR>
	The spot is supported by a print ad that reads: &quot;Introducing the Chrysler Cirrus.  It's not just a step above, it's the new plateau,&quot; which is also the Cirrus tagline.<BR>
	Along with its dealer advertising associations (DAAs), Chrysler will form &quot;truncated&quot; roadblocks in the weeks to come, whereby the corporation buys time concurrently on two of the network affiliates and the local DAAs have the opportunity to place media on the remaining network.  DAAs will have that opportunity during prime time, to add to the corporation's late night media buys on Letterman and Nightline.    <BR>
	Key editorial categories where ads will run include newsweeklies and enthusiast, upscale general interest and men's and women's lifestyle publications such as<I> Time</I>, <I>Newsweek</I>,<I> Life</I>, <I>National Geographic</I>,<I> GQ</I> and <I>Working Woman</I>.<BR>
	Cirrus print ads will include eight- and four-page inserts, as well as a four-page <I>USA Today</I> &quot;printacular&quot; placement.  <BR>
	Chrysler, in partnership with Time-Warner, has effectively determined the proper dosage of Cirrus information to include in its print ads.  The two accomplished this by using registration information from R.L. Polk and matching it with demographics of Time-Warner publications.<BR>
-more-<BR>

<P>
<P>-3-<BR>
	For example, owners of three- and four-year-old Honda Accords and Toyota Camrys will receive the eight-page insert, which has more detailed product information.  Other subscribers will see the four-page insert; spreads will run in general newsstand issues.       <BR>
	Ads will also feature many of the &quot;proof points&quot; or key product advantages that make Cirrus stand out from its peers -- like the spacious interior gained through cab-forward design illustrated in the commercial &quot;Room For Thought.&quot;<BR>
	Through a production process called &quot;morphing,&quot; the industry's first cab-forward designed compact vehicle builds itself from the inside out.<BR>
	The voiceover adds: &quot;Perhaps the only thing its design doesn't leave room for ... is improvement.&quot;<BR>
	All of the spots are monochromatic, with a green hue that draws attention to Cirrus' feature color, medium charcoal fern.    <BR>
	&quot;It's advertising that will break through and get noticed by using a myriad of unique visual effects and filming techniques.  It's impactful and will establish the Cirrus name,&quot; said Ken Laurence, Chrysler-Plymouth National Advertising Manager.  &quot;And it's advertising that will feature tangible, credible advantages that we feel will move our prospects to action.&quot;  <BR>
	In addition, the print ad &quot;Claustrophobia&quot; exemplifies the roominess message.  The copy reads, &quot;The Chrysler Cirrus and cab-forward design.  Our latest, most advanced cure for claustrophobia.&quot;<BR>
-more-<BR>

<P>
<P>-4-<BR>
	&quot;Rails&quot; features the Cirrus' unique rail-through construction -- where the underbody structural rails are continuous, front to back -- which makes the car extremely stiff for responsive handling.<BR>
	The morphing process is again used, this time to build the suspension of the car beginning with the rail-through construction.<BR>
	A companion print ad reinforces the story: &quot;Like people, some cars have more backbone than others.&quot;<BR>
	Two-time Indy winner Emerson Fittipaldi, who originally served as a consultant to assist Chrysler with refining the Cirrus' suspension system, stars in &quot;Fittipaldi,&quot; helping to reinforce the degree of technical expertise behind every aspect of the car.<BR>
	Fittipaldi is seen scaling an escalator at the Chrysler Technology Center in Auburn Hills, Mich., working with Chrysler engineers and putting the car through its paces on the test track.<BR>
	A companion print ad introduces Fittipaldi's involvement this way: &quot;Consumer feedback helped us make the suspension on the Chrysler Cirrus one of the safest and most sophisticated on the road.  Meet one of the consumers.&quot;<BR>

<P><center><PRTitle><B>JULY SALES TOPPLE RECORDS AT CHRYSLER</B></PRTitle><BR>
<B> </B>  <BR>
<B> </B> </center><BR>
<B>   </B><P align ="left"><B><BR>
       Auburn Hills, Mich. -- </B>Chrysler Corporation announced today that its July sales rate was 19 percent higher than last year's and that its U.S. sales of 220,139 vehicles broke a July record set in 1988, when sales totaled 180,289.<BR>
	<P>&quot;The July numbers show that Chrysler is maintaining the momentum that pushed us to sales records in the year's first and second quarters,&quot; said <BR>
James P. Holden, Executive Vice President - Sales and Marketing.  &quot;And we did it at retail, recording our second best month ever for retail sales.<BR>
	<P>&quot;Most encouraging is the continuing strength across our product lineup,&quot; Holden said. &quot;We set July records for truck sales and for most of our car lines.  Jeep&reg; had a record month and so did our minivans.<BR>
	<P>&quot;Many of our 1997 models will be arriving soon at dealers, including the all-new 1997 Dodge Dakota pickup, which started volume production today at our Dodge City/Warren Truck assembly plant,&quot; Holden said. &quot;We're optimistic that they will help us build on this momentum.&quot;<BR>
	<P>Chrysler's July truck sales, including minivans and Jeep&reg; vehicles, totaled 145,997, compared with last year's 113,839, for a 23 percent increase in the daily selling rate. Car sales were 74,142, compared with 64,377 in July 1995 -- an 11 percent increase.<BR>
	<P>Other July highlights:<BR>
	-- Dodge Ram Pickup, with sales up 39 percent from a year ago, set its 32nd consecutive monthly record.<BR>
	-- Jeep&reg; Grand Cherokee had its best July ever, with sales of 26,816. The previous July record was 17,841 in 1993.<BR>
	-- The new 1997 Jeep&reg; Wrangler had its third month in a row with sales over 8,000 and set a July record.  Combined sales of Jeep&reg; vehicles were a record for any month.<BR>
	-- July records for Dodge Caravan and Chrysler Town &amp; Country pushed Chrysler's minivan total to 50,156, surpassing the July 1994 record of 46,941.<BR>
	-- Dodge Neon and Plymouth Neon both set July records. Combined, Neon sales have set records in five of the past six months.<BR>
	-- Plymouth Breeze had its fifth consecutive month with sales over 6,200. It combined with Dodge Stratus and Chrysler Cirrus to set a record for Chrysler's midsize sedans.<BR>
	<P>Also setting July records were Chrysler Sebring Coupe, Dodge Avenger, Dodge Intrepid and Chrysler Concorde.<BR>
	<P>For the year to date, Chrysler sales are running 14 percent ahead of the comparable period in 1995. Car sales are up 6 percent. Truck sales, including minivans and Jeep&reg; vehicles, are 19 percent ahead of year-ago rates.<BR>

       Highland Park, Mich. -- </B>  <I>Involved To SolveTM</I>, a pilot community outreach program which partners Chrysler-Plymouth, Dodge and Jeep&reg;/Eagle dealerships with city officials and community leaders to help make a difference in their communities, has expanded to include Chrysler's corporate headquarters.  This Saturday, August 19, some 125 Chrysler volunteers will join forces with employees from Snethkamp Chrysler-Plymouth in Highland Park to paint and refurbish four homes in the Medbury/Grove Lawn Historic District as part of Detroit's annual &quot;Paint The Town&quot; event.<BR>
	The district, nominated to the National Register of Historic Places in 1987, stands as a reminder of Highland Park's unique and exciting history.<BR>
	&quot;For more than 70 years, Chrysler Corporation and its employees have called Highland Park home,&quot; said Chrysler's Vice Chairman and Chief Administrative Officer Tom Denomme.  &quot;We have always gone out of our way to be a responsible resident and a good neighbor.  Highland Park will always represent our roots and our beginning.&quot;<BR>
<B>(33195)(more)	- 2 -</B><BR>
	<I>Involved To Solve</I> is a cooperative effort between Chrysler-Plymouth, Dodge and Jeep&reg;/Eagle dealerships and City Cares of America, a nationwide non-profit volunteer network based in Washington, D.C.  The organization specializes in organizing community service projects by identifying needs in the  community that can be addressed with hands-on volunteers.  Chrysler Corporation assists in the <I>Involved to Solve</I> effort by coordinating volunteer training and providing project funding.<BR>
	Last year, Chrysler dealers in Phoenix, Los Angeles, Chicago and Charlotte, N.C., were the first to provide people power and tackle community projects under the <I>Involved To Solve</I> banner.  This year, Chrysler dealerships in 12 major markets have formed volunteer groups to &quot;solve&quot; community problems ranging from reclaiming city parks in Chicago, Ill., to providing much needed work at a battered women's shelter in Phoenix, Ariz.  <BR>
        On the same day, while Chrysler Headquarter volunteers &quot;Paint The Town&quot; in Highland Park, employees from 26 Chrysler Corporation dealerships in Los Angeles will roll up their own sleeves to tackle <I>Involved to Solve</I> volunteer projects throughout the Los Angeles area.<BR>
	In October of this year, Chrysler's <I>Involved to Solve </I>program will return again to Detroit as employees from local Chrysler-Plymouth, Dodge and Jeep&reg;/Eagle dealerships identify and &quot;solve&quot; individual community service projects.  The dealerships are working with Volunteer Impact, Detroit's local affiliate of City Cares of America, to identify and solve community needs and projects.<BR>

Editor's note: From 8 a.m. to 5 p.m., volunteers from Chrysler Corporation will be working at the following locations in Highland Park: <BR>

       Highland Park, Mich. -- </B>The leader in the mid-size pickup truck market since it created the segment nine years ago, Chrysler Corporation announced today that sales of its Dodge Dakota pickup truck line has reached the one-million sales mark in North America.<BR>
	Dakota has averaged over 100,000 sales per year since its introduction in the 1987 model year.  Current sales for 1995 stand at 87,372 units through September, and are projected to top the 100,000 mark for the fourth consecutive year. <BR>
	Introduced as a regular cab model in June of 1986, an extended Club Cab 4x2 was added in 1989 and Club Cab 4x4 in 1990.  In 1991 Dakota offered the first V-8 engine in a down-size pickup truck.  Recently, the National Automobile Dealers Association (N.A.D.A.) recognized Dakota as having the best resale value of all domestic down-size trucks from 1991 to 1994.  <BR>
	In addition, Dakota is building on its leadership position in 1996 with an available new 2.5-liter, 120 horsepower Magnum 4-cylinder engine.<BR>

	&quot;The spring selling season came just a bit early this year,&quot; said James P. Holden, Executive Vice President, Sales and Marketing, Chrysler Corporation.  &quot;There was outstanding performance across our entire product line.  In addition to being our best February in history overall, it was also our best February for passenger car sales in eight years, with car sales rising 51 percent over last month.  Eight car lines established February records, including an all-time record for Chrysler LHS.<BR>
	&quot;The Dodge Ram pickup and Chrysler Town &amp; Country minivan both set all-time records, while our Jeep sport utility vehicles established three monthly records, as well.  Credit our hard-working Chrysler-Plymouth, Dodge, and Jeep-Eagle dealers for much of the success.&quot;<BR>

<P><center><PRTitle><B>MORE OF A GOOD THING: DODGE UNVEILS AVENGER R/T SHOW CAR--<BR>
A LARGER DOSE OF EXCITEMENT FOR THIS YEAR'S NEWEST SPORT COUPE</B></PRTitle><BR>
<B> </B> </center><BR>
  <B> </B><P align ="left"><B><BR>
       Detroit -- </B>The Dodge Division of Chrysler Corporation revealed today at the North American International Auto Show a car based on the popular new Dodge Avenger sport coupe.   Named Avenger R/T,  this show car won't be found at your local Dodge dealer,  but serves as an example of what happens when you continue to develop the Avenger concept -- a balance of expressive design, roominess, comfort, safety and affordability combined with fun-to-drive performance.<BR>
	The Avenger R/T show car features a 3.0 liter, 24-valve, SOHC V-6 engine that generates in excess of 200 horsepower and will rocket the R/T from zero to 60 mph in an estimated 7.0 seconds.  Stopping power is enhanced by performance-bred, drilled front and rear disc brakes, utilizing a four-caliper per disc system seen on the Dodge Stealth R/T Turbo and the Dodge Viper RT/10.<BR>
	The Avenger R/T also sports new bodywork, including a modified hood, new front and rear fascias and an aggressive rear spoiler.  Large, 18-inch wheels and extremely low-profile, speed-rated tires also set the R/T apart from its showroom cousin.  But aside from these obvious visual cues and the higher performance powertrain, the Avenger R/T and the production-version Avenger are essentially the same vehicle.<BR>

<P>-2-<BR>

<P>	&quot;This is not merely a beefed-up Dodge Avenger,&quot; said Martin R. Levine, Dodge general manager.  &quot;The street version of the Avenger is winning over customers faster than we could have imagined.  And even though Avenger is just out of the chute, already we are beginning to wonder how far we can develop the Avenger concept of the affordable, balanced sport coupe.&quot;<BR>
	Other unique features of the Avenger R/T show car include cockpit-controlled shock absorbers and a state-of-the-art Infinity 400 sound system --  a 3-in-1 (AM/FM, cassette, compact disc) 400 watt, eleven-speaker tour de force that revolutionizes automotive audio.  <BR>
	&quot;You won't see the Avenger R/T show car on the streets,&quot;  added Levine, &quot;but you can believe we'll be using it to gauge public reaction.  Some of the things on this car just might find their way into a real production Avenger.&quot;<BR>

<P><center><PRTitle><B>CHRYSLER RECOGNIZES 16 SUPPLIERS<BR>
FOR WORLD-CLASS PERFORMANCE</B></PRTitle><BR>
<B> </B> </center><BR>
  <B> </B><P align ="left"><B><BR>
       Highland Park, Mich. -- </B>  Chrysler Corporation today announced that 16 suppliers have been recognized for their overall achievements in the 1994 model year as recipients of Chrysler's prestigious Platinum Pentastar Award.  <BR>
	At its tenth annual supplier awards luncheon yesterday, Chrysler presented its Platinum Pentastar Award for world-class performance throughout the supplier's entire corporate organization.  Twelve of the 16 companies honored also received the award last year, the first year the award was given.  <BR>
	The awards are the culmination of Chrysler Procurement and Supply's annual rating process and were presented by Chrysler President Robert A. Lutz at the Townsend Hotel in Birmingham, Mich.  <BR>
	&quot;The Platinum Pentastar Award confirms that you are among the best at institutionalizing continuous improvement,&quot; said Thomas T. Stallkamp, Chrysler Vice President - Procurement &amp; Supply and General Manager - Large Car Operations.  &quot;You are a valued part of our extended enterprise and we applaud your performance.  And I know that we can continue to count on you to support us in our commitment to continually create innovative new products.&quot; <BR>
(more)<BR>
(51694)<BR>
	- 2 -<BR>

<P>	In presenting the awards, Lutz said: &quot;Chrysler's current sales successes come at a time when Americans have been expressing greater confidence in domestic vehicles than they have in years.  We earned that confidence by building exciting, high-quality products that people want to buy.  <BR>
	&quot;Today, Chrysler and its suppliers are both profiting -- because, working together, we were able to let go of the old and embrace the new.<BR>
	&quot;Now it's up to us to maintain that momentum  -- because our customers won't let us forget the promises we've made,&quot; Lutz said.  &quot;We can't afford to lose their trust.  The way to maintain that trust and the prosperity that goes with that mandate is by continually raising the bar on quality and lowering costs.  And the way to expand that prosperity is through continuous improvement in every thing we do, every day of the year,&quot; he said.  <BR>
	&quot;In the eyes of the customer, our reputation and your reputation are one and the same.&quot;<BR>
	Also for the 1994 model year, Chrysler will be recognizing suppliers with its Gold Pentastar Awards for performance at the operational or activity level.   This award will be conferred upon 213 suppliers during upcoming visits by Chrysler purchasing executives to the supplier locations.  <BR>

       Highland Park, Mich. -- </B> Chrysler Corporation today said it is adding the Chrysler LeBaron convertible to its Gold Key Lease/Gold Key Plus programs and making two changes to its &quot;Leading Values&quot; incentive program. The actions take effect April 1.<BR>
	The Jeep&reg; Cherokee No-Charge Air Conditioning on 2WD and 4WD is extended through the 1994 model year build-out. The No-Charge Air Conditioning program for 1993 Cherokee 2WD models ends May 31.<BR>
	Additionally, the company said the 5.9 liter V-8 bonus discount program for 1994 Dodge Ram 1500 is extended to May 31, from March 31. The 5.9L V-8 bonus discount is a no-charge V-8 engine upgrade.<BR>
	The addition of the Chrysler LeBaron convertible to the Gold Key Lease/Gold Key Plus programs supports dealers' Spring leasing and retail efforts. The lease period is for 24 and 36 months and from 12,000 to 15,000 miles per year. A 24 month/12,000 mile lease features a monthly payment of $249. <BR>
	For customers who prefer to purchase rather than lease, the company said Chrysler Financial Corporation has established a low APR rate for the purchase of 1994 Chrysler New Yorker. The rates for New Yorker models are 1.9 percent for 1-36 months and 2.9 percent for 37-48 months. <BR>
	Other elements of the &quot;Leading Values&quot; program of national incentives remain as announced January 31. The program, covering specific 1993 and 1994 models, ends May 31. The &quot;1994 National Minivan Sale&quot; is scheduled to end April 30.<BR>

<P><center><PRTitle><B>1996 DODGE VIPER GTS COUPE: A STUDY IN REFINEMENT</B></PRTitle><BR>
<B> </B>  <BR>
<B> </B> </center><BR>
<B>   </B><P align ="left"><B><BR>
       Auburn Hills, Mich. -- </B>It has its roots in a visceral back-to-the-basics, uniquely American sports car, but the 1996 Dodge Viper GTS Coupe reaches into a new, more sophisticated arena, offering more in the way of comfort and amenities than its Roadster sibling.  <BR>
	&quot;From the beginning, developing the GTS Coupe was a more difficult task than the Roadster because the car evolved with a broader character,&quot; says Roy Sjoberg, Team Viper Executive Engineer.  <BR>
	For Team Viper, the challenge was to make the GTS Coupe more refined, yet remain true to its Viper character.<BR>
	&quot;The Roadster was designed for the aggressive, wind-in-the-hair driver.  The GTS Coupe has the same capacity to exhilarate the senses, but in a more refined manner,&quot; said Sjoberg. &quot;We were clearly looking to do more than just add a roof to the Viper.  Our goal was to create the GTS in the mold of the world's premier Grand Touring cars.&quot;<BR>
	While the GTS continues to retain the look of the original Viper Roadster, more than 90 percent of the car is new.  To start, there's a new body, new interior and a modified V-10 engine with less weight and increased horsepower.  But make no mistake -- while the Viper GTS Coupe &quot;character&quot; is more sophisticated, it can still make the heart race with its brute performance.  	<BR>
	Horsepower in the GTS increased to 450 from 415 in the current roadster, and the torque is boosted10 additional pound feet bringing it to 490 at 3700 rpm.  A NACA duct design on the hood of the car force-feeds oxygen into the V-10's intake and E-type louvers above each of the front wheels prevent air pressure from building under the hood.<BR>
	 As a Coupe, the GTS is all-season and more &quot;user-friendly&quot; in varied weather conditions -- in cold temperatures and during precipitation to name two.  Enclosing this Viper necessitated a new weatherstrip system for the doors and glass.  Cooling the closed body also required a more powerful air conditioning system.  Other engineering challenges included packaging dropped glass in the doors and designing an innovative electronic entry system.<BR>
  	For &quot;openers,&quot; the GTS Coupe, like the Viper Roadster, has no door handles.  &quot;Obviously, this was not a problem with the roadster because you could simply reach inside and open the door,&quot; explains Sandy Emerling, Manager of Body Development.  &quot;You can't do that with an enclosed Coupe.&quot;  To maintain the clean lines of the door-handle-free Viper, the team devised a system where pressing a switch on the door frame activates a solenoid that unlatches the door.  Door locks are controlled by a remote.  <BR>
	To improve the overall driving experience, the Viper team pioneered a unique adjustable pedal system that allows the driver to move the clutch, brake and accelerator pedals up to four inches closer by simply turning a knob mounted under the steering column.  This manual system, coupled with a tilt steering wheel and seat that allows generous fore-and-aft adjustment, provides for an optimal driving position for a wide range of people.<BR>
	The GTS' roof is made from resin transfer molding as are most of the body panels.  The hood is made of sheet molding compound.  The sweeping shape of the car resulted in improved aerodynamics, dropping the coefficient of drag to 0.39 from the Roadster's 0.50.  With the enclosed cockpit, the GTS has about 12 percent more torsional rigidity than the Roadster.<BR>
	Even with the addition of the roof, backlight and roll-up windows, the weight of the GTS is actually 60 pounds like than the Roadster.   Team Viper's reengineering of the framed, a lighter-weight aluminum suspension, new seats and new castings for the aluminum engine block and cylinder heads dropped the weight to 3385 pounds.<BR>
	Sjoberg noted that the weight reduction makes the GTS more nimble in both cornering and straight-line performance.   In terms of handling, the team felt the GTS had to be a little more neutral than the Roadster.  The GTS spring rates, shock valving and anti-roll bar sizes have been recalibrated.  &quot;The goal was a little more built-in understeer,&quot; Sjoberg noted.<BR>
	Other significant features that differentiate the GTS Coupe from the Roadster include: a rear storage compartment designed to stow the spare tire and increase cargo capacity; redesigned interior trim; dual airbags; a new instrument panel with revised gauge locations; and on the exterior: a racing-style fuel filler cover; a twin-bubble roof line that provides ample headroom; and one-piece glass bonded hatch with defroster.<BR>
	The Viper GTS will be in dealer showrooms starting in June 1996.<BR>

       Highland Park, Mich. -- </B>Eagle continues to build brand awareness this weekend when it officially rolls out its <B>Eagle Talon Social Club Driving Challenge Program</B>,  with the Sport and Social Clubs of the United States.<BR>
	The  event will be held this Sunday, March, 12 from 9 a.m. - 6 p.m. at the Astro Dome in Houston, Texas. The program's main event -- designed to capitalize on the &quot;Eagle Test Drive&quot; campaign -- is a co-ed team driving competition in 1995 Eagle Talons on a professionally designed race course.  	Developed in conjunction with the Houston chapter of the Sport and Social Clubs of the United States, hundreds of Social Club members have registered to compete in the driving challenge. In addition to the controlled performance and handling course administered by the Sports Car Club of America (S.C.C.A.),  Eagle Vision vehicles will be available on a road course. Other sport and life-style activities reflecting the Eagle image -- including fast-serve tennis, volleyball, in-line skating and Hot Shots hoops -- will also be available to members.  <BR>
	&quot;The Sport and Social Clubs of the United States provide Eagle with an excellent opportunity to convey our message to a great group of talented people who have active, productive lifestyles,&quot; said David Rooney, Eagle Marketing Manager. &quot;We're reaching young professionals on their terms.&quot;<BR>
(11795)	(more)<BR>

<P>- 2 -<BR>
	The 1995 Eagle vehicles -- part of the line-up offered by Chrysler Corporation's Jeep&reg; and Eagle Division -- includes the all-new Eagle Talon and refined versions of the Eagle Vision, Eagle Summit Wagon, Summit Coupe and Sedan.<BR>
	In order to be truly appreciated, Rooney believes Eagle products must be driven.  Thus, the brand's 1995 campaign, &quot;The Eagle Test Drive,&quot; aimed at getting customers unfamiliar with the brand turned on to Eagle.<BR>
	&quot;We are taking our products to the customer, making it easy and fun to be a part of the Eagle experience,&quot; said Rooney.  &quot;There has never been a better time for this brand, and the Sport and Social Clubs provide an excellent audience to establish these one-to-one consumer relationships.&quot; <BR>
	Local charities also benefit from the Eagle Talon Social Club Driving Challenges.  Each competing team has the chance to win a cash prize and Chrysler will match the award with a donation to <B>Take Action! </B>a nonprofit group that links charitable organizations with local community volunteers.<BR>
	The Houston Social Club is a chapter of the Sport and Social Clubs of the United States, which comprises 60,000 members in 18 cities.  The Chicago-based national organization is a sports-based and special events planning organization that brings together individuals on an informal basis through co-ed league sports participation and special events.   <BR>

SHOWS PLYMOUTH'S NEW WAY OF DOING BUSINESS</B></PRTitle><BR>
<B> </B> </center><BR>
  <B> </B><P align ="left"><B><BR>
       Milwaukee, Wi -- </B>In an effort to make car shopping easier, <BR>
Plymouth Division of Chrysler Corporation introduced today an interactive shopping experience known as &quot;Plymouth Place.&quot;  The in-mall shopping store will feature the full line of Plymouth vehicles, as well as interactive shopping computers and a staff of customer assistance advisors to answer product questions.  Plymouth Place began operation today at Northridge Mall and will be featured in several Milwuakee area malls in 1995.<BR>
	Plymouth Place was developed to raise awareness of the Plymouth brand with under-40 target buyers seeking an alternative to conventional automotive shopping.  Plymouth Place will be an ideal first step in the car buying experience - the &quot;just looking&quot; phase - when consumers are just beginning to shop.  There will be no salespeople on site, but rather product advisors who will be able to answer questions and, if the customer is interested, refer them to a Chrysler-Plymouth dealer in the area. <BR>
	&quot;Plymouth Place is targeted directly at the prospective Plymouth buyer, &quot; said Plymouth National Marketing Plans Manager Steve Bruyn. &quot;Our customers are value-minded individuals who are looking to gather as much information as possible before buying a car or minivan.&quot;<BR>
(03895)	-more-<BR>

<P>-2-<BR>

<P>	A main feature of Plymouth Place is the interactive kiosk known as the Tech Cart.  The futuristic looking computer cart is designed to give consumers the opportunity to shop for a Plymouth vehicle using interactive technology. The cart features two touch-activated computer terminals that allow the user to select vehicle options, check pricing and see running footage of the Plymouth Neon and Voyager.  In addition, the user can get a printout of their chosen car or minivan to take to a dealership when ordering the vehicle.  <BR>
	The Plymouth brand has been undergoing a complete revitalization over the past year, with the idea of building a brand that delivers expressively designed value-priced cars and minivans to the entry level market.  Plymouth already has two product hits in its stable, with the Voyager minivan and the Neon sub-compact car.  Over the next several months, Plymouth will introduce a completely re-designed Voyager, as well as Breeze, a four-door compact sedan, built off the same product platform as the Chrysler Cirrus and Dodge Stratus.<BR>
	&quot;What you see here at Plymouth Place is the future of car shopping, as well as a glimpse at the future of Plymouth,&quot; Bruyn said.  &quot;Many of our buyers have grown up with computers, shopped at home for products and relied on various forms of technology for information.  This provides them an environment free of distractions to get the information they need.&quot;<BR>

	&quot;Long before the term `sport-utility' was ever used to describe a class of vehicles, Jeep enthusiasts were navigating over huge boulders and narrow passes on the old Indian trail discovered by trappers in 1844,&quot; said Ed Brust, General Manager, Jeep Eagle Division.<BR>
	&quot;True Jeep enthusiasts know there is only one Jeep and like the vehicle it is named after, Jamboree is steeped in tradition that began more than 40 years ago,&quot; he added. &quot;We're very proud to be associated with this American tradition.&quot;<BR>
	The 1994 Jeep Jamboree events kicked-off in February with the first Seminole Jeep Jamboree and run through October.  Jamborees involve participants taking Jeep vehicles &quot;off-road&quot; for two- to three-day periods in various scenic locations around the country.  Levels of difficulty vary, depending on the location.<BR>
	Cost to participate is $160 per adult, $80 for children age 7 to 14, $50 for children age 2 through 7, and free for children under 2.<BR>

  <B> </B><P align ="left"><B><BR>
       Highland Park, Mich. -- </B>Long recognized as the leader in the sport-utility segment, Jeep&reg; Cherokee builds on its strengths for 1995 with enhancements and features that position it as one of the most well-equipped, affordable vehicles in its class.<BR>
	Along with ruggedness and utility, safety remains a top priority in 1995 Jeep Cherokee models.  A standard driver's-side air bag has been added to complement existing safety features such as a front and rear door beams for increased side-impact protection and a center, high-mounted stop lamp.<BR>
	In addition, Jeep Cherokee models offer new front seats, based on the Grand Cherokee seat design, for improved comfort.<BR>
	The model lineup for 1995 includes the Cherokee SE, Sport and Country models.  SE and Sport are available in either two- or four-door body styles, and Country is available as a four-door only.  All models are available with two- or four-wheel-drive.<BR>
	Cherokee Sport includes a distinctive appearance marked by a two-tone treatment of black lower body paint, black bodyside moldings with red accents, full-face wheels and P225/75R15 all-terrain tires.<BR>
	Jeep Cherokee Sport and Country models are equipped with the 4.0-liter, in-line six-cylinder fuel-injected high-output engine that produces a peak 190 horsepower and 225 pound-feet of torque.<BR>

<P>
<P>(09095)	(more)<BR>

<P>- 2 -<BR>
	SE models offer a standard 2.5-liter, four-cylinder engine providing peak power of 130 horsepower and 149 pound-feet of torque.  A five-speed manual transmission is standard with the 2.5-liter engine.  The 4.0-liter engine with standard five-speed manual or optional four-speed automatic transmission is also available.<BR>
	A hallmark of any Jeep vehicle is its powertrain versatility.  The choice of optional four-wheel-drive systems for Cherokee enhances this versatility.<BR>
	The Jeep &quot;Command-Trac&quot; part-time four-wheel-drive system allows the driver to shift-on-the-fly from two-wheel-drive to four-wheel-drive when situations demand outstanding traction.  The Jeep &quot;Selec-Trac&quot; system is designed to run in full-time four-wheel-drive on dry or slippery surfaces at any speed without adversely affecting fuel economy or causing excessive wear to the drivetrain or tires.<BR>
	All Cherokee models come with a wide array of standard equipment including power steering, full instrumentation, tinted glass, power front disc brakes, dual horns, a stainless steel exhaust system and a center, high-mounted stop lamp.<BR>
	Options include four-wheel anti-lock brakes (on vehicles with the 4.0-liter engine), power windows and door locks, a keyless entry system, speed control, air conditioning and leather seats.<BR>

       Auburn Hills, Mich. -- </B>If your idea of a good time is traversing scenic canyon trails, exploring landmarks of the Gold Rush era or navigating an original Native American footpath, you have to look no further than Jeep&reg; , the most recognized name in sport-utility vehicles, and its renowned Jeep Jamboree events.<BR>
	&quot;A Jeep Jamboree is really a passport to nature, said Mike Kane, Jeep Marketing Manager. Its a weekend adventure designed exclusively for Jeep owners who wish to visit seldom-seen, hard-to-reach places -- locations that our Jeep Grand Cherokee, Cherokee and all-new Wrangler were meant to go.<BR>
	Thirty-three Jeep Jamborees in the U.S. are planned for 1996, beginning February 23 and ending in late October. Added to the schedule for this year is the first-ever Jeep Jamboree in Alaska, where participants can explore the Knik Glacier.<BR>
	What is a Jeep Jamboree?  Simply put, it involves owners and enthusiasts taking their Jeep vehicles &quot;off-highway&quot; and exploring scenic trails for two-or three-day periods.  Levels of difficulty may vary depending on the trail and conditions, but both beginners and experts are welcome. Jamborees are not competitive events -- they are family-oriented outings with fun for everyone.<BR>

<P>	Promoting safe and environmentally responsible driving are key elements of the Jeep Jamboree program, said Kane. Every Jamboree has designated trails so we can help preserve the natural resources and beauty of the land for others to enjoy.<BR>
	Each Jeep Jamboree is limited to about 100 Jeep vehicles. Cost to<BR>

<P>participate is $185 per adult, $85 for children age 7 to 14, and $55 for<BR>

<P>children six and under. (The Alaska Jamboree is $200 for adults, $100 <BR>

<P>for ages 7 to 14, and $60 for those six and under.)  There is no charge for<BR>

<P>infants. Meals are included.<BR>

DODGE RAM, JEEP GRAND CHEROKEE STAR<BR>
IN RECORD OCTOBER SALES PERFORMANCE</B></PRTitle><BR>
<B> </B> </center><BR>
  <B> </B><P align ="left"><B><BR>
       Highland Park, Mich. -- </B>- Led by best-month-ever performances from Dodge Ram and Jeep&reg; Grand Cherokee, total Chrysler vehicle sales increased five percent to 171,680 -- the best October in six years.<BR>
	&quot;Our dealer retail sales in October were the highest they've been in more than 10 years, thanks in large part to the tremendous acceptance of our trucks,&quot; Theodor R. Cunningham, Executive Vice President -- Sales and Marketing and General Manager -- Minivan Operations, said.  &quot;But trucks weren't the whole story, Eagle Vision and Eagle Talon sales are showing the success of &quot;1-800 Test Eagle,&quot; and our family of mid-size sedans continues to set new records,&quot; he said.<BR>
	Total truck sales of 111,741 set a new mark for October, beating last year by 18 percent.  It was the 39th consecutive monthly increase and the ninth consecutive monthly record.  Dodge Ram turned in its 11th consecutive monthly record with a 128 percent increase over last year to 22,336.  Total Dodge Truck sales of 55,699 were the best ever for any month.  Jeep overcame the summer inventory shortages to post the best month ever for Grand Cherokee with 22,946 sales, and for total Jeep vehicles with sales of 41,311 -- breaking last year's records of 22,685 and 33,017, respectively.  Jeep Wrangler alone set a new October record on sales of 6,430.	<BR>
(47294)	(more)<BR>
	- 2 -<BR>
	Total car sales of 59,939, off 13 percent from last year, reflected the absence of compact sedans and other specialty vehicles from the lineup -- namely the Dodge Spirit and Plymouth Acclaim and Dodge Daytona.  Initial sales of Chrysler Cirrus and Dodge Avenger were reported in October, with Dodge Stratus and Chrysler Sebring coming soon.  In the meantime, the mid-size family of LH sedans, led by record performances by Dodge Intrepid and Eagle Vision, set a new October record with combined sales of 23,036.<BR>
	<BR>

<P>	<B>(Editors Note:  Thomas J. Osborn, Director - Sales and Marketing Operations Planning, is available this afternoon for phone interview concerning October sales.  Please call 313-252-8794 to schedule.)</B><BR>

<P><center><PRTitle><B>CHRYSLER INTERNATIONAL SALES INCREASE 19 PERCENT OVER 1993</B></PRTitle><BR>
<B> </B> </center><BR>
  <B> </B><P align ="left"><B><BR>
       Highland Park, Mich. -- </B> Chrysler Corporation's international retail sales increased in the first nine months of 1994 to 95,172 vehicles, up 19 percent over the comparable 1993 period. 	<BR>
	Chrysler Corporation's total international sales, from January through September, were 100,382 units, including shipments to U.S. military personnel outside of North America.  Total international sales were up 18 percent over the first nine months of 1993.	<BR>
	&quot;We passed the 100,000 vehicle sales milestone two months faster than last year because of  the worldwide appeal of our Jeep vehicles and the Chrysler Voyager minivan and Vision sedan.&quot; said Thomas C. Gale, Vice President of Design and International Operations.   <BR>
	Sales in the third quarter of 1994 were 31,655 units, a 3 percent decrease compared with 32,564 vehicles in 1993, primarily due to an overall downfall in the Latin American automotive markets.<BR>
	The Chrysler Voyager minivan remains Chrysler's international top-seller with sales of 32,105 units, compared to 25,515 sales during the nine month period in 1993, an increase of 26 percent.  <BR>
(45094)	(more)<BR>
	The Jeep Cherokee sales of 24,772 units rose 36 percent over 1993.  Sales of the Jeep Grand Cherokee reached 10,807 units for a 26 percent increase.<BR>
	Chrysler's most popular passenger cars were the Chrysler Vision and Concorde, selling 6,770 units in the first nine months of 1994, compared to 2,340 sales in the same period of 1993.  The new Chrysler Neon, recently introduced in Taiwan and the Latin American region, already reported retail sales of 5,775 units.  Sales begin in late autumn in Europe.  <BR>
	Europe continues as the largest retail market for Chrysler and Jeep vehicles outside of North America, reporting sales of 52,161 units calendar year to date, for an increase of 13 percent.  Germany was the volume leader in the region with sales of 11,300 units followed by France and Italy with sales of 7,631 and 5,592  units, respectively.  <BR>
	Sales in the Asia-Pacific region rose to 26,445 units, up 57 percent from 16,864 units at the same time last year.  Taiwan led the region with sales of 11,810 units.  Right-hand drive Cherokee sales in Japan continued to increase reaching 9,011 units for the first nine months of 1994.  Total sales in Japan were 10,409 units, up 190 percent from 1993.<BR>
	Latin American retail sales totalled 9,138 increasing 12 percent over 1993.  Sales in the Middle East totalled 7,118, down 5 percent compared to last year.<BR>
	Total shipments of complete knock down (CKD) kits were 18,944 units, up 10 percent compared to the three quarters of 1993.  CKD shipments to China rose 56 percent while shipments to Egypt and Venezuela decreased.<BR>

       Highland Park, Mich. -- </B> Puxatawney Phil has nothing on Jeep&reg;.<BR>
	A new Jeep brand commercial, making its debut Saturday during the opening ceremonies of the Winter Olympics on CBS, gives &quot;snowplowing&quot; new meaning.<BR>
	Actually, what is depicted in the 30-second &quot;Snow Covered&quot; spot, is neither a ground hog nor a V-8 beast, but cleverly executed computer generation.  What the viewer sees is &quot;something&quot; tunneling, like a woodchuck, under snowy fields.  Eventually, the glow of brake lights is seen as the burrowing object comes to a stop sign buried in the snow.  A flashing turn signal emanates from the snow as the object exits left and a closing title card, &quot;There's Only One Jeep...&quot; finally reveals what vehicle the spot is advertising.<BR>
	Viewers have become accustomed to seeing Jeep vehicles go virtually anywhere, so the tagline isn't such a surprise, according to Ed Brust, Jeep-Eagle General Manager.<BR>
	&quot;It works as a full-line ad because it enhances the Jeep legend and it allows viewers to complete the scene with whatever Jeep vehicle they think would be most fitting,&quot; Brust said.  &quot;Not too many brands can actually build brand image without showing their product.&quot;<BR>
(07194)	(more)<BR>

<P>- 2 -<BR>
	Digital Domain developed new computer software to create the animated, burrowing effect.  A scale model Jeep vehicle, called a &quot;sno-sub&quot;, was pulled under snow to create the &quot;live&quot; mounds and those images were composited into a glacier background with the computer generated snow.  Director Eric Saarinen shot the glacier landscapes by helicopter in Kluane National Park in the Yukon Territories.<BR>
	The earthquake that hit Los Angeles last month temporarily halted production, but advertising agency Bozell/North, formerly CME KHBB, Detroit, was still able to meet its Winter Olympics deadline.  The spot took three months to complete and will be used throughout the Olympics and during the rest of the calendar year.<BR>
	On Jan. 1, CME KHBB, Detroit became part of Bozell Worldwide, Inc. and took on the name of Bozell/North until both Detroit area offices are combined. <BR>

       Highland Park, Mich. -- </B>When nearly 300 vintage sports and race cars  gather November 17-19 in Palm Springs, California for the Chrysler Grand Prix, there will be a friendly and orderly atmosphere in the pit area.  When they stage to race, there will be a minimum of confusion and theyll proceed quickly onto the track.  The races themselves will place the utmost importance on safety and the rules of the Grand Prix.  <BR>
	Thats because a master of precision driving and race organization will be in charge.  His name is Ed Swart, a Dutchman who made a name for himself on the European rally scene in the early 1960's and later held the European Touring Car Championship, and the son of a well-known organizer of European rallies.  Today he lives in southern California, and is president of the Vintage Auto Racing Association -- a position which keeps him close to the sport he loves.<BR>
	The Dutch precision characterizes Swarts driving style -- quick and slick.  It also shows in his relentless attention to detail and to safety on the track, important ingredients to the growing ranks of vintage car owners and racers in the United States.<BR>

       Auburn Hills, Mich. -- </B>Chrysler Corporation has notified owners of 70,000<BR>
1995 model year Jeep Cherokees built between June 1994 and early-February 1995 to have the driver-side air bag module inspected.  A small number of air bag modules may have been assembled without an arming lever.  If the arming lever is missing, the air bag will not deploy.<BR>
	This condition was discovered during routine testing at the air bag supplier, Breed Technologies, Inc.  Improved controls were immediately instituted to prevent this condition from occurring in the future.<BR>
	Although fewer than 0.04 of one percent of the vehicles are estimated to have this condition, Chrysler will inspect all affected 1995 Jeep Cherokee air bag modules and replace any faulty units at no cost to owners.<BR>
	There have been no field reports of air bag non-deployment.<BR>
	In addition, Chrysler Corporation will notify owners of 175,000 late-1994 and early-1995 model-year Dodge Ram pickup trucks to have the secondary hood latch bracket replaced.<BR>

<P>(22195-S)	-more-  <BR>

<P>-2-<BR>

<P>	The secondary hood latch rod may bind on the guide bracket and prevent the secondary latch from properly engaging.  If this condition occurs when the primary latch is not engaged, the hood may not be restrained.<BR>
	Chrysler's investigation of field reports of improper hood closure determined that the secondary latch bracket, modified in late-January 1994, has the potential for a binding condition due to the reduced clearance between the rod and guide bracket.  <BR>
	All affected vehicles will have the secondary hood latch bracket replaced with a revised bracket at no cost to owners.<BR>
	There have been no field reports of accidents related to this condition.<BR>

       Rubicon Springs, Ca -- </B>  Homecomings have become a tradition in the United States. For years, individuals have travelled hundreds of miles to be reunited with those they share a common bond with -- Jeep&reg; owners are no exception.<BR>
	The birth place of the Jeep Jamboree, Rubicon Springs as the locals call it, is not shown on many maps. This weekend, however, hundreds of Jeep owners will venture to Rubicon Springs, California, for the annual Rubicon Trail Jeep Jamboree. <BR>
	&quot;It's basically in the middle of nowhere, somewhere between Cadillac Hill, Devil's Peak and Lost Corner Mountain,&quot; states Mark A. Smith, founding father of the Jeep Jamboree Program. &quot;That makes it especially attractive to Jeep owners -- they're different -- show them a mountain and they'll go over it.&quot;<BR>
	The Jamboree legend was born in 1952 when Smith and his colleagues in the El Dorado County foothills led a small group of Jeep enthusiasts over the treacherous Rubicon Trail from Georgetown to Lake Tahoe. The number of participants grew each year until the event had to be limited to 400 vehicles. <BR>
(34994)	- more -<BR>

<P>- 2 -<BR>
	In 1979, a separate Jamboree, limited to 150 Jeep vehicles, was started. Today Chrysler Corporation's Jeep Eagle Division sponsors 26 Jamborees across the United States for Jeep owners. Jamborees are viewed as a perfect fit for Jeep. <BR>
	Jeep is a founding member of &quot;Tread Lightly!&quot; a non-profit organization designed to promote off-highway use ethics and practices.  Every sport-utility driver also understands that maintaining quality of the land must be of the highest priority, according to Ed Brust, General Manager Jeep Eagle Division.<BR>
	&quot;When you venture beyond the paved road, its important to remember your responsibilities to the environment,&quot; said Brust.  &quot;At Jeep, our message is simple, use common sense and stay off unmarked trails.&quot;<BR>
	&quot;Jeep vehicles are legendary for doing things others cannot and the real power of a legend is where it takes you,&quot; said Brust.  &quot;It's a part of the Jeep mystique to be able to go to some seldom seen, hard-to-reach place. True Jeep enthusiasts, the people with us here this weekend, understand this.<BR>
	Smith adds that safe and responsible driving are only a part of it. &quot;The people you meet along this trail become your friends,&quot; he said. &quot;Mark my words, every year you are going to want to come back to the middle of nowhere to do this all over again.&quot; <BR>
	For information regarding this year's remaining Jamborees, contact Jeep Jamboree headquarters at (916) 333-4777.<BR>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Emma Nicholson defects to Lib Dems</b><br><br><br><b><h2>1 January 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Putting country before party</h2>
<h3>Mr Major should go to the  polls</h2><br><b>Leading article</b>  <br><br><br>      <p>Enough is enough. The Government should call an immediate general election to restore proper governance to a country that has suffered enough from  the death pangs of the Conservative Party. Emma Nicholson's decision to join the Liberal Democrats on Friday night - the second Tory defection in three  months - is likely to reduce the Government's majority to only one after two pending byelections. The shires were yesterday buzzing with rumours of yet  more resignations to come as the pro-European Tory MP Hugh Dykes warned that six or seven more defections were possible unless the Government returned  to moderate policies.   <p>  <P>The loss of Emma Nicholson will leave the Government ever more dependent on the Ulster Unionists whose continued loyalty, as they made clear over the  weekend, comes with a strict price tag attached. If the defections continue the Conservatives will pretty soon find themselves running a minority  government trying to implement legislation that hardly anyone wants while responding like Pavlov's dog to the bleatings of a minority of disaffected  rightwing MPs whose views are unrepresentative of the electorate at large. It is not impossible to run a successful minority government. Some people  still look back to the Lib-Lab pact as a watershed of sensible policies. But the conditions of consensual policies which existed then certainly don't  exist now. Where is the support for privatisation of the railways or nuclear power, for the draconian measures of the asylum bill, for the cynical  financial squeeze on one-parent familes, for the one-eyed determination to cut essential public spending to generate pre-electoral tax cuts that very  few people admit to wanting?   <p>  <p>In his New Year message yesterday - supported at the weekend by full-page advertisements to ram home the message he thinks the Tory press won't print  - John Major said that Great Britain needed and deserved a government that could lead from experience as well as conviction and which would continue to  steer the economy with skill. "Only the Conservatives can do that", he added. What piffle. Even long standing Conservatives - of which Ms Nicholson and  Alan Howarth are the tip of an iceberg - no longer believe it. Can even Mr Major himself believe, deep down, that the party which twice in a decade  steered the British economy into an unnecessarily deep recession not experienced by other countries and which blew the housing market apart in the late  Eighties, did so with "skill"? Even the modest recovery we are now enjoying owes much more to the failure of a seminal government policy - the dogged  determination to maintain an overvalued currency until it fell apart in September 1992 - than to any skills that the Prime Minister might claim.   <p>  <p>Earlier this year Mr Major did a courageous thing. He laid his leadership of the Conservative Party on the line, daring anyone to put up or shut up,  in order to clear the air. That has patently failed. His beloved Conservative Party is disintegrating before his eyes unable to hold itself together  even though a general election is looming. The maximum period of 14 or 15 months between now and the next general election may not seem long to a party  that has been in power for nearly 17 years, but it is a very long time for a country to be ruled by a party which has lost the will - and the ability -  to govern in the interests of everyone. It is time for Mr Major to put the interests of the country above those of his party and to call a general  election at the earliest possible moment.  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Emma Nicholson defects to Lib  Dems</b><br><br><br><b><h2>1 January 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Chance remark set Nicholson on path  to defection  </h2>
 <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Sue Quinn</b><br><br>      <p> <p>Emma Nicholson last night gave her first detailed account of her move to the Liberal  Democrats. Her defection process began in a corridor in the House of Commons two-thirds  of the way through December, when Nick Harvey, Liberal Democrat MP for Devon North, asked her  how things were going, she said in an interview with the Daily Mail. She replied: "I'm deeply  unhappy with the Conservative Party and the Government." <p> <p>When Mr Harvey said she should  join them, she replied: "Maybe I will, if you ask me." Soon afterwards, she received a message  that Lord Holme, one of the party's most influential figures, wanted to talk to her. <p>  <p>While no definitive overtures were sought or given, Ms Nichsolson said the significance of  their meeting so close to Christmas was clear to both of them. In Christmas week she met  Lord Holme again at the Meridien Hotel in Picadilly, where she told him that the similarities  between her political beliefs and Liberal Democrat policies were uncanny. They agreed that if  she wanted to commit herself any further she would have to talk to Paddy Ashdown, whom she rang  two days before Christmas and subsequently met on Christmas Eve. <p> <p>"We just had an open  discussion, purely talking politics and policies, and that to me was immensely relevant,  because the only talk these days in the Conservative Party is how to hang on to power. "It is not about the impact of policies on the electorate," she told the newspaper. <p>  <p>At the end of the meeting Mr Ashdown said: "Call me if you want to." On Boxing Day evening  she rang Mr Ashdown and asked to meet him again, which she did the following day in London, and  told him she wanted to join the Liberal Democrats. <p> <p>The die was cast. Now her seat, Devon  and Totteridge, the one in Devon the Liberal Democrats thought they had the best chance of  winning, will be the scene of a fierce battle. Paddy Ashdown's agent at the last General  Election and three former prospective parliamentary candidates are among the seven people  trying to carry the Lib Dem's colours on to the hustings. <p> <p>Geoffrey Gibbs and Rebecca  Smithers write: Until Ms Nicholson's defection, the constituency was the Liberal Democrats'  number one target in Devon, requiring a swing of less than three per cent to overturn her 3,500  majority. Boundary changes, removing a traditionally Conservative-voting area, could boost the  party's chances. Ms Nicholson will not contest the seat as she is planning to stand as a  Euro-MP. <p> <p>The Liberal Democrat constituency party chairman, John Rawlinson, said  yesterday that interviews with the five hoping to be selected as prospective candidates would  begin at the end of this week. Selection will be at the beginning of February. Mr  Rawlinson said his members were determined to work closely with Ms Nicholson. <p> <p>In the  village of Winkleigh, Conservative constituency chairwoman Margaret Taylor said the overall  mood was one of sadness. "I and other people do feel somewhat let down. We have all worked hard  for over eight years both to get her there and then to keep her there." <p> <p> <p> <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td  width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td  width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td  width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td  width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr> <td  align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td> <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A  HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td> <td align=right  valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td> </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Emma Nicholson defects to Lib Dems</b><br><br><br><b><h2>1 January 1996</h2></b><br><h2>The ones who get away  </h2>
  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Michael White</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>A chum in the City rang me in November: "Have you heard about the latest Tory defections in the West Country? Four of their MPs are  going to join the Liberal Democrats." We went through the names, one of which was Emma Nicholson's, before I explained how unlikely it  all was. Defection is not a strong cultural tradition among disillusioned middle-aged Conservatives. They have other vices.  <p>  <p>A few weeks later I lunched with a lobbyist who gave me chapter and verse about another West Country Tory on my City source's list.  How he had drafted his resignation letter, but been caught in time by Government whips newly-sensitised to defection by the departure of  Alan Howarth to Tony Blair's ranks on the eve of the party conference. They had promised him free trips, early nights off, and a K in the  New Year's honours list, said the lobbyist.  <p>  <p>"Is this true, Bob?" I asked him next time we met. "Of course not," replied Robert Hicks, an MP of incorrigibly genial and moderate  disposition in South East Cornwall for 25 years, before explaining that he had seen off the Liberal Democrats for years and would do  again, if needs be. "And you won't find me in the New Year's Honours list either."  <p>  <p>Nor did we. But we enter 1996 with Miss Nicholson gone and Bob Hicks announcing his decision to step down at the coming election,  gently protesting that the party has changed a great deal since he first won Bodmin in Ted Heath's famous victory of June 1970. More than  50 sitting MPs are also retiring, many of them before their time. More will do so. One retiree, Julian Critchley, is refusing to vote for  his local Euro-sceptic Tory MP, Ludlow's Chris Gill, and Westminster is again awash with rumours that moderate MP X or Y - but no longer  Broxtowe's Jim Lester, who did get a New Year K - is poised to desert the waterlogged hulk that is John Major's second administration.  <p>  <p>What does it all mean, apart from a boost to Paddy Ashdown's troops? In one sense, not very much. As Tolstoy might have said, had he  been lucky enough to have had a Fleet Street column, all happy MPs are happy in the same fulfilled way, but each unhappy MP is unhappy in  his or her own way. Miss Nicholson has variously cited Nolan and the need to clean out the Augean stables, Redwoodism, pregnant Holloway  mothers in chains, Europe and Michael Portillo's self-parody of a patriotic conference speech.  <p>  <p>Tory defectors tend to be self-confident, even a bit grand, socially-concerned types, too fastidious to get far in an increasingly  unfastidious organisation, which, in Critchley's snobbish phrase, is increasingly dominated by the arrivistes and garagistes.  <p>  <p>Between Miss Nicholson and Mr Howarth, several comparisons are striking. Both are children of the confident upper-middle class; the  daughter of a baronet MP, the son of the High Master of St Paul's School. Both are imbued with a strong, unfashionable, patrician sense  of public service. Both accidentally came to see the limits of stand-on-your-own Thatcherism, through personal experience; she has been  deaf since childhood, he had a handicapped son 10 years ago.  <p>  <p>In the Winners' Party such underdoggery has been out of fashion since the rise of the New Right. Like the disasters of rail  privatisation and Yorkshire's winter water shortages, the two MPs' decision to commit political suicide - the likeliest outcome - is one  more sign of a sea change in the public mood, making a Blair victory as curiously inevitable as Mrs Thatcher's was in 1979. Unlike  pre-1992, this now looks and sounds like a broken-backed regime, at Westminster and beyond. To old hands, the smell of decay is  unmistakable.  <p>  <p>Yet therein lies another lesson of the Seventies: the game is not quite over. In mathematical terms what Friday's defection does, as  every article pointed out on Saturday, is render John Major's tiny majority vulnerable to the Grim Reaper and Ulstermen or combinations  thereof. That ups their price, as Unionist MPs were quick to point out yesterday. It means that with luck and skill, John Major could  soldier on to May 1997, his reported ambition. But does he and his battered army have the will to carry on? Labour in 1951, the Tories in  1974, even Labour again in 1979 were not at the end of their term or lacking in room for manoeuvre and survival. They'd just had enough  and, it almost seemed, couldn't wait to resume their private party quarrels unencumbered by office. Blair's high public standing almost  justifies the Tory self-absorption. Whatever their lurid propaganda, they know he won't burn the house down.  <p>  <p>Miss Nicholson was one of those Tory MPs who feared that a Portillo leadership win in 1996 or 1997 would finally split the Tories over  Europe. Hence recent talk of compromise figures to paper over the crack: Malcolm Rifkind or Ian Lang, though another compromise  candidate, John Major, has a better chance of holding his seat. A formal split remains unlikely. But the mere party political mechanics  of survival are only part of the wider story of disillusioned MPs defecting or, more likely, quitting for greener pastures.  <p>  <p>What is the point of being an MP nowadays when great ideological passions are spent? When demanding constituents and single-issue  pressure-groups harry you night and day, despising you as they do so because of all those media sleaze stories they've read? Let alone  all of the above in Opposition and under the Nolan rules.  <p>  <p>Tory MPs are obviously asking themselves such questions - the "sodit" factor as one put it yesterday. Idealistic types like Emma  Nicholson who have (in Denis Healey's famous phrase) hinterland, are not prisoners of status or &#163;33,000 a year. They can make their  contribution elsewhere, perhaps as an MEP in her case. Less idealistic types can make their fortunes elsewhere. Will either be missed?  Yes, if the standard of aspiring candidate declines as a result of parliament's declining status and risking workload of the kind once  handled by councillors before parliament undermined their status too. In differing versions Labour and Miss Nicholson's new party have  the answer in parliamentary reform. Yet all their larger constitutional panaceas envisage power shifting from Westminster, or more to the  point from Whitehall, up the line to Brussels or down to regional assemblies and below. There will be plenty left for MPs to do, not  least as legislative regulators - OfLeg, so to speak - of what Brussels and Wessex get up to. But who will want that kind of grind?  <p>  <p>Yesterday's "sodit" MP singles out junior transport minister Steve Norris as precisely the kind of modern politician Westminster can  least afford to lose. Not because his colourful private life is essential to tabloid circulation figures, but because he is street-smart,  intelligent and practical, a politico-barrow boy in a populist age. Not an ineffectual intellectual like myself, Sodit might have added.  But Norris is standing down in Epping Forest to repair a fortune (he was literally a garagiste) ravished by recession. So now is Emma  Nicholson. Sodit is also leaving the Commons before his time.  <p>  <p>Street-smarts, idealism and fastidious intellect. Not even a House dominated by wholesome New Labour will be so well-endowed with all  three qualities that they can lightly shrug off their passing.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Gary Younge</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>People worth less than 40m:    <p>Nigel Mansell &#163;33m    <br>Rod Stewart &#163;30m    <br>Michael Winner &#163;28m    <br>Michael Caine &#163;25m    <br>Nick Faldo &#163;25m    <br>Lord Archer &#163;25m    <br>Cliff Richard &#163;25m    <br>Alan Clark &#163;25m    <br>Bill Wyman &#163;25m    <br>Eddy Shah &#163;25m    <p>Source: Sunday Times richest 500  <p>  <p>Church leaders launched a swingeing attack on the National Lottery yesterday, describing the coming week's &#163;33m rollover  jackpot as "obscene" and accusing the organiser, Camelot, of "moral bankruptcy" if it went ahead with the record payout.  <p>  <p>The Bishop of Wakefield, the Rt Rev Nigel McCulloch, called on the Government to set up an all-party committee urgently to review  the situation. Last night it became clear that the rollover could even reach &#163;40m.  "There is something obscene about having over &#163;30m as a prize when only 28 per cent of the money which goes to Camelot  goes to the good causes, and only 5.6 per cent goes to actual charities," the bishop said. A spokesman for the Church of England Synod  said the bishop's comments were representative of the Church as a whole.  <p>  <p>A leading member of the Church of Scotland added his voice to the protest, describing next week's prize as "absurd". Bill Wallace,  convener of the Church of Scotland's Board of Social Responsibility, said: "We don't think it's the sort of thing government and big  business should be involved in." Next week's jackpot has rocketed from a more usual &#163;9m because it has rolled over twice with  no winners on 23 December and on Saturday. If no-one wins the big prize next Saturday it will not be rolled over again. Instead the  jackpot prize money will be shared equally among those who pick five correct numbers plus the bonus number. The previous record  pay-out was &#163;23.4m.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

 <br>By 
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Lawrence Donegan</b><br><br>      <p> <p>The Government came under renewed pressure to impose a limit on National Lottery  jackpots last night after it was announced that the prize for tonight's draw would be at least  &#163;40m. <p> <p>Camelot, the lottery operator, said the record jackpot would arise from  ticket sales expected to reach 115 million - 70 per cent above an average week. Camelot's  communications director, David Rigg, said: "Hourly sales will probably top &#163;5m during  tomorrow afternoon. Sales yesterday and today have been tremendously high and we expect this to  continue right through until close of terminals tomorrow at 7.30pm." But in previous weeks with  a rollover draw, both the final prize and total ticket sales have exceeded the operator's  estimates. <p> <p>Michael Taylor, director of the charity Christian Aid, led the calls for a  jackpot limit to be imposed. "Even &#163;10m would be over the top. Forty million is beyond all  reason. It is more than three-quarters of our annual income and I know how much good can be  done with it. So far, the operator, Camelot, seems to be the biggest lottery winner,  selling mostly empty dreams to ordinary people while lining the pockets of well-to-do  shareholders with the profits," he said. <p> <p>The game is proving so successful, with  ever-increasing top prizes, that Camelot is to open up to 14,000 more outlets this year on top  of the existing 26,000. Tonight's double rollover jackpot is almost twice the previous  highest prize of &#163;22.7m. Under lottery rules, it can be rolled over for one more week if  no one picks the correct six numbers. <p> <p>A spokeswoman for Camelot said that,  statistically, the top prize was likely to be shared by at least six people, given the number  of players covering the possible combinations. The total prize fund is expected to be  &#163;73m, shared by 1.5 million punters. <p> <p>But Gail Howard, a US-based lottery analyst  and author, predicted pandemonium in the event of a triple rollover. "If experience in [the US]  is repeated, people will just go crazy, spending money they don't have on a dream they can  never attain." <p> <p> <p> <p> <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td  width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td  width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td  width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td  width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE  height=30 width=400 border=0><tr> <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A  HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td> <td  align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td> <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>40m lottery jackpot</b><br><br><br><b><h2>22 January 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Second huge jackpot renews lottery storm   </h2>
  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Andrew Culf</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>A new outbreak of National Lottery mania is expected this week, with record ticket sales predicted for the year's second  &#163;40m-plus jackpot. But the controversy over the size of the prize intensified yesterday when it emerged that the National  Heritage Secretary, Virginia Bottomley, had agreed to meet church leaders to hear their concerns.  <p>  <p>Saturday's draw will be the second double rollover jackpot in three weeks, a statistical freak which has astonished the organiser,  Camelot. The weekend's &#163;23.8m top prize was not won, despite ticket sales of &#163;86.7m, a record for a single rollover week.  <p>  <p>A Camelot spokeswoman said: "Statistically, we would expect a double rollover every three or four years, not two so close  together. It is extraordinary."  David Rigg, director of communications, said it was likely to be 400 years before two double rollovers occurred consecutively.  <p>  <p>Although it is likely to generate record sales, the timing is unfortunate for Camelot, anxious to calm controversy about the size of  jackpots. Opposition politicians and church leaders are likely to renew their attacks. A delegation of church leaders - including  representatives from the Churches of England and Scotland, the Roman Catholic Church, Baptists and Methodists - is to meet Mrs  Bottomley. Led by the Rt Rev David Sheppard, Bishop of Liverpool, it hopes to raise questions about the size of the jackpot and about  under-age players.  <p>  <p>The Rt Rev Philip Goodrich, the Bishop of Worcester, who described the first double rollover as grotesque, said the meeting was  timely. "If it gets bigger and bigger, where is it going to stop? I would rather see a lot of people being helped, than it going to help one  person."  <p>  <p>Speaking on BBC Radio 4's 'Any Questions' at the weekend, Mrs Bottomley defended large jackpots as a way to maximise the cash  raised for the lottery's five good causes.  Labour would consider capping the jackpot and John Cunningham, the shadow heritage secretary, is leading a working group  reviewing the party's lottery policies.  <p>  <p>Saturday's jackpot could exceed the &#163;42.5m, shared by three winners on 6 January. Then, ticket sales topped &#163;128m, with 90 per cent of the population taking part, and the computer  network crashed briefly hours before the draw.  <p>  <p>Double rollovers could become less likely after March, when Camelot introduces a new way of playing called Lucky Dip. Customers  will be able to choose to let the ticket machine select six random numbers for them. This will mean many more possible combinations,  because players at present are more likely to choose numbers between one and 31, using birthdays and anniversaries to make their  selection.  <p>  <p>The numbers drawn at the weekend were: 5, 23, 25, 30, 33 and 37; the bonus number was 3. Twenty-one people each won  &#163;165,765 for matching five numbers and the bonus ball. A total of 1,084 people won &#163;2,007 each for matching five  numbers; 81,069 won &#163;59 for getting four numbers; and 1,728,211 picked up &#163;10 for matching three numbers.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Water crisis in north  as thaw bursts pipes</b><br><br><br><b><h2>3 January 1996</h2></b><br><h2>North facing water  crisis over bursts  </h2>
 <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>David Ward</b><br><br>      <p> <p>Water companies yesterday warned of a growing supply crisis, as millions of gallons  continued to be lost from pipes fractured during the big thaw. In Northumberland and Tyneside,  Strathclyde, Northern Ireland and parts of Leeds and Greater Manchester, tankers took water to  thousands of consumers, while other users - particularly those living on high ground - suffered  severe falls in water pressure. Companies said new leaks were appearing as fast as they  repaired burst mains. They had been powerless to deal with those in factories, offices and  schools shut over the holiday. John Cuthbert, managing director of North West Water, said: "The  situation is now critical. We are putting as much water as possible into the system but until  we get on top of our bursts and customers get on top of theirs, we are still losing water." <p>  <p>Problems were worst in Strathclyde, where 500,000 customers were without water, and in the  north-east of England where Northumbria Water estimated it was losing 18 million gallons a day,  with 250,000 customers cut off from mains supplies. Andrew Panting, Northumbria's head  of public relations, described the situation as "pretty critical", and said bursts had caused  an unprecedented drain on supplies. <p> <p>"Some areas have been without water for a couple of  days and others are at risk of losing their water as demand increases. We have plenty of water  but we cannot get it treated and supplied quick enough to satisfy demand." Because of shortages  in the Ashington area, Northumberland Fire and Rescue has brought in a 5,000-gallon bowser and  two 300-gallon appliances in case of a big fire. North West Water is struggling to keep  reservoirs filled. "We have the water but these local reservoirs are being drained faster than  we can fill them," said a spokeswoman. "Our managers say they have never seen anything quite  like this before." <p> <p>A Strathclyde council spokesman said: "We are running very fast just  to stand still." Yesterday the council called in eight tankers and 200 smaller vehicles to take  water to collection points in stricken areas, to which householders were asked to take their  own containers. In parts of Ayrshire and Argyll, people were urged to boil drinking water as  some untreated water was put into the supply in order to avoid cutting off more areas.  Yorkshire Water reported that about 6,000 customers in Leeds had suffered cuts in supplies. "We  are putting more water into the system and boosting pumps. But bursts are still occurring,"  said a spokesman. <p> <p>Chris Mullin, Labour MP for Sunderland South, has urged John Gummer,  the Environment Secretary, to order an independent inquiry into water supplies. He said it was  needed to establish what provision water companies had made for such emergencies and if  resources for coping with them had been increased or cut since privatisation. <p> <p>* British  Gas has admitted that due to the severity of recent weather it was unable to fulfil its  commitment to thousands of its three-star service customers, who were left without heating for  several days although it promised them an engineer would be sent within 24 hours of a fault  being reported. A spokesman said: "We have to hold up our hands. In some areas we were caught  out over Christmas. We will consider every case for compensation on its merits." <p> <p> <p>  <p> <p> <p> <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td  width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td  width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td  width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td  width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE  height=30 width=400 border=0><tr> <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A  HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td> <td  align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td> <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>John Carvel</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>The Government is considering abandoning a central plank of comprehensive education to allow all state schools to select their intake  by interviewing children and parents to assess suitability.  <p>  <p>In a move to boost the flagging momentum of the policy to encourage schools to opt out of local authority control, proposals for  scrapping the ban on selective admissions policies will be published for consultation next week by Gillian Shephard, the Education and  Employment Secretary. She is expected to argue that the measure would allow all schools greater freedom to run their affairs. In  practice, selection is likely to be taken up mainly by the 1,100 grant-maintained schools which have opted for self-governing status and  want more efficient methods of rationing their places.  <p>  <p>Under the present rules, most schools are not allowed to give preferential access to high-achieving pupils. According to a  Government circular updated in 1993, they should not require pupils to sit a test or use any other form of selection procedure.  <p>  <p>"Schools which do not select on the basis of ability or aptitude should in general avoid using reports or interviews as part of their  formal admission arrangements, except in the case of church schools where reports and interviews may help the school to understand  the family's religious background... Governing bodies may otherwise be vulnerable to criticism that judgments about a child's  suitability were based on social, ethnic or academic considerations," the current circular says.  <p>  <p>The London Oratory, a grant-maintained school chosen by Tony Blair for his son, Euan, was accused of operating a policy of social  selection by interviewing parents. Roy Hattersley, Labour's former deputy leader, led a rebellion at the party conference in October  against coming to terms with self-governing schools. He argued that social selection was anathema to the comprehensive ideal.  <p>  <p>The Government may now be hoping that permitting social selection will play well with middle class voters and may prise open splits  within Labour on an issue which has become closely identified with Mr Blair.  <p>  <p>Mrs Shephard's consultation paper will propose scrapping its guidance on admissions to allow schools to compete more fiercely by  having greater control over their own destiny. It is also expected to remove restrictions obliging grant-maintained schools to seek  Government approval before changing catchment area.  <p>  <p>Schools would have a free hand to introduce overt selection procedures to admit up to 10 per cent of pupils by aptitude in subjects  such as music, art, drama, sport and technology. They could also amend policy on admitting siblings or the children of governors and  teachers without ministerial approval.  <p>  <p>The proposals may take some of the political sting out of Mrs Shephard's announcement next week that the Government is to drop  plans to allow church schools a fast track for opting out without having to ballot parents. The idea was vociferously opposed by the  Anglican and Roman Catholic churches. The Grant Maintained Schools and Nursery Bill is expected to offer little extra inducement for  opting out. Measures will be included to allow grant-maintained schools to borrow against their assets, but this is unlikely to revive the  momentum of the policy which Mr Major wants to be a main Conservative theme at the next election.  <p>  <p>According to data from Local Schools Information, a council-funded monitor of the grant-maintained sector, only 17 schools voted  last term for self-governing status.  <p>  <p>Mrs Shephard would not need legislation to change the rules allowing schools to select pupils by interview. The proposal could  therefore be used to give a pre-election fillip to Mr Major's objective of giving self-governing status to all schools.  <p>  <p>In September he offered head teachers of grant maintained schools "a substantial expansion of your freedom to make sensible choices  between pupils in the way you think best".  <p>  <p>Alan Parker, education officer of the Association of Metropolitan Authorities, said Mrs Shephard's proposal was an insidious  restoration of selection which would be even worse than the 11 plus. "They are not proposing selection on the basis of objective  criteria, but a much more nebulous social selection. It is difficult to see how giving a power to head teachers which cannot easily be  checked will be in the interests of parents and children. The practical effect of giving maverick head teachers their heads is likely to  cause problems and it may become increasingly hard in some areas for parents to educate their children locally."  <p>  <p>Andrew Turner, director of the GM Schools Foundation, said any policy which reduced the obligation to apply to the Government for  trivial changes in admissions policy was welcome.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Selection to be reintroduced to schools  </b><br><br><br><b><h2>5 January 1996</h2></b><br><h2>No place for dreams on the syllabus   </h2>
 <br>Commentary by
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Peter Preston</b><br><br>      <p> <p>Education's 30-year rule is iron-clad inexorable: what goes around comes around. This  week's burst of old Cabinet papers may, in most respects, appear the stuff of pre-history -  Harold Wilson, George Brown, Rhodesia, the TUC. But time does not touch education. There the  issues come deep-frozen. Three decades ago, a Labour Cabinet was agonising about comprehensive  schooling - and, in particular, the baleful havoc to the principle of non-selection wreaked by  public schools. Education Secretary Michael Stewart - the grey man's grey man - was saddled  with some manifesto chat about abolition. He murmured a few warnings and left for the Foreign  Office. Enter one of the great political brains of post-war politics. <p> <p>Tony Crosland,  louche waistcoats, long cheroots and all, was the kind of Labour politician who seems to have  become extinct: an intellectual, rather supercilious toff who could yet move policy mountains.  He was the real beginning of comprehensive education. He gave a series of experiments cohesion.  He laid the foundations for a revolution which, seven years later, had become so consensual, so  utterly uncontentious, that a Conservative Education Secretary called Margaret Thatcher could  set records for blending grammar schools and secondary moderns into a comprehensive future.  Crosland got so far because he worked wholly with the grain of public opinion. Selection wasn't  popular. It was deeply, deeply reviled. Labour may, after the war, have embraced the 11-plus as  a neutral, quasi-scientific way of recognising ability irrespective of a kid's social class.  But, 20 years on, that which pronounced one child in five a talent - and four in five  non-starters - had become political poison. <p> <p>Comprehensives offered two great boons. One  was the apparent end of selection. All pupils from a single catchment area could have the same  teachers, the same buildings, the same chance. The other was the greater good of social  engineering. If children from every background could share the same opportunities in education,  then class and privilege would surely drop away as friendships and experiences grew from a  common classroom. It was here, manifestly, that public schools got in the way. They were the  preserve of a rich elite. Whilst they remained, the full dream of a classless society could  never be realised. Crosland, like Stewart, was required to act: but trouble came quickly.  Stewart had already begun to shrink from the original purity of manufactured catchment areas -  where children, from, say, deprived neighbourhoods would be bussed each day to a leafy suburb.  That was not, he concluded, "politically practical". <p> <p>Crosland, equally, found the establishment  aroused by the threat to its own schools - and a cost for abolition to make the Treasury  cringe. He set out to slide around the problem. Something called "boarding need" was created.  Thousands of children, we were told, might be better taken from their (perhaps broken) homes  and found quota slots at Eton or Charterhouse. A saintly Public Schools Commission, under the  wisest of old birds, John Newsom, was set up to quantify this need and produce detailed plans.  The wizard Wilson loved such bodies. They consulted extensively and, with any luck, reported  only when the moment for possible reform had passed. So it proved with Newsom. Crosland had  departed: Labour was stuck in a place of strife. The public schools went on their merry way  untouched. <p> <p>And now? It is almost as though 30 years had never happened. Blair's Labour  would give the public schools a little financial discomfort, but they lie in the Vauxhall  Conference of his priorities. Grant-maintained status - in a way that would make Newsom twinkle  - will be circuitously maintained. There is no surging faith in comprehensive expansion. How  could there be in a country whose educational standards are (allegedly) the laughing stock of  the developed world? And where is the triumph of social engineering in a society (allegedly)  more violently divisive than ever before? John Major, here, really does stand to the far right  of Margaret Thatcher. He reveres grammar schools; he baits the hook for any headmaster minded  to opt out; he will, next week, allow an overt return to the forms of tested or interviewed  selection which blossomed before the invention of the 11-plus. And he does all this because he  thinks it's popular, a vote-winner, an election issue he can work with. <p> <p>The huge English  delusion - for the Scots are steadier in these matters - is that miracles flow from shifting  the scenery we like to call our system. In one resounding way, there has been profound change -  its unlikely hero, Kenneth Baker. A country where getting on for 30 per cent of schoolchildren  now go on to higher education, a country touching European levels of university population,  cannot possibly return to the grammar-school elitism where only half that number had a chance  of moving on. Mr Major, blankly uncomprehending, is spitting on the second great achievement of  Margaret Thatcher. It is crass to look back to the supposed tranquilities of Rutlish School in  the Fifties and seek to recreate them - for Rutlish then was an island already eroded by public  frustration. <p> <p>But how does New Labour - led by an old public schoolboy - move the clock  forward? The hope - the best, fragile hope - is that it has learned something from the futile  years of system churn. Comprehensive schools are the schools that most of our children have.  There is nothing to be gained from their abolition. But they cannot be made suddenly better by  some fresh systemic move against the selective sector. There is no appetite to find nirvana via  a renewed attack on the public schools: and England north of the Wash would barely notice in  any case. Selection by well-heeled suburbia, which defeated Michael Stewart, continues as  politically impractical as ever. The transformation of society from a shared classroom  continues as elusive as ever. <p> <p>If Mr Blair is reading his runes of Cabinets past aright,  he will knock dreams from the syllabus. It is necessary to give parents real choice. It is  necessary to publish all the facts about schools which reasonably fit a questioning brief. It  is necessary to let individual schools have individual specialities - like music or art - and  thus to provide the chance for children from across a big city who have the talent (yes, by  selection) to travel to them. It is necessary to have the framework for coherent governance  that local education authorities can still provide - but not to allow them to prescribe in  onerous detail. And it is necessary - on all battered experience - to divide pupils by the  aptitude of set once they're under the same comprehensive roof. <p> <p>This, by no chance  whatsoever, is already the essential Labour pitch. No systemic change: mere fine tuning.  Perhaps Tony Crosland would blow cheroot smoke in its face and think it the wreck of the future  he planned. It isn't, after all, a system: just a compilation of differences. But as John Major  launches into the past, seeking to recreate a system which failed utterly, there is a lot to be  said for abandoning such illusions altogether. There is, at root, no such thing as an English  education system. There is only a spatchcock of compromises which makes education a little  better or a little worse. No prizes for the current class of political meddlers. No prizes,  surveying the detritus of 30 years, for meddlers to come. <p> <p> <p> <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td  width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td  width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td  width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td  width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr> <td  align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td> <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A  HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td> <td align=right  valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td> </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Selection to be reintroduced to schools  </b><br><br><br><b><h2>9 January 1996</h2></b><br><h2>When few are chosen</h2><h3>The  implications of Government plans to allow state schools to select their pupils by  interview</h2> <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Francis Beckett</b><br><br>      <p> <p>There were plenty of good reasons for the 1993 circular advising state schools to avoid  interviewing pupils or their parents as a method of controlling admissions. Since Gillian  Shephard, the Education and Employment Secretary, is now preparing to tear up the document, it  is worth remembering what they were. <p> <p>The interview can be used to select middle-class  children, or children whose parents can offer skills or prestige. It can be used to keep out  children who are not docile, or who may cause disruption and eat up precious resources. It  could easily be used, so long as the school was discreet about it, to keep down the numbers of  black children. <p> <p>A Government circular issued in 1993 advised against the interview  process, but it is not illegal, and the circular has been widely ignored, not least by the  ministers who issued it. One ministerial adviser said it was issued by mistake: "It was slipped  past education minister Robin Squire. I don't think he even looked at it. Gillian Shephard will  now simply replace it." The London Oratory School, which has used the system for years,  confirmed last week that it has no interest in becoming a selective school and choosing its  pupils on ability by examination. Why should it? It has admissions criteria which are so vague  as to be meaningless ("... acceptance of firm discipline and the school regulations; commitment  by the parents and boy to 11-18 schooling... the aims, attitudes, values and expectations of  the parents and the boy are in harmony with those of the school.") <p> <p>Headteacher John  McIntosh interviews each boy with both his parents, and makes his choice, with no obligation to  give reasons. He claimed that he does not select on the basis of the parents' vocation, but no  one thought Mr McIntosh would reject the boy whose mother was a successful barrister and whose  father is likely to become Prime Minister, and he did not. Most LEA schools are tied to  admissions criteria that ensure the bulk of their intake is chosen by proximity to the school.  But grant-maintained schools can agree their own admissions standards with the Education  Secretary, who has generally been relaxed about accepting vague criteria. In many areas, there  is now a baffling mixture of criteria. The London borough of Barnet has two long-established  girls' grammar schools, left over from the days of the 11-plus. Until 1989 they were the only  Barnet schools which selected. In 1989 Barnet's Queen Elizabeth's Boys School was one of the  first schools in the country to become grant-maintained and to agree its own admissions  standards. <p> <p>These criteria were as vague as the London Oratory's. Parents must be willing  to ensure that their sons "support the corporate and extra-curricular life of the school",  pupils with "family connections" will get "sympathetic consideration" (though siblings can be  rejected, and sometimes are). <p> <p>There was also an imaginative clause to ensure the school  could never be tied to anything: "The governing body may, in exceptional circumstances, refuse  admission to any applicant if, in its view, to admit the pupil would be to prejudice the  fulfilment of school aims..." <p> <p>Parents reported being cross-examined about their record  of activity at their son's primary school. Were they, for example, on the Parent Teacher  Association committee? One mother was convinced that she and her husband, not her son, were  rejected. A father who was principal viola player with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra was  told: "You're just the sort of parents we want to have." <p> <p>Other local schools started to  complain. A chair of governors said: "Now we just get the boys QE Boys doesn't want to teach."  The result was a rush to opt out. Ten of Barnet's 21 secondary schools are now grant  maintained. Two are voluntary aided, and nine are still under LEA control. <p> <p>In August  1994 QE Boys upped the ante by going selective, choosing its boys on ability by examination.  This, again, created a flurry of similar applications. One of the opted out schools, Hendon  School, has succeeded in getting a new banding system. It is to take a quarter of its intake  from the top ability range, half from the middle range, and a quarter from the lowest range.  Two other schools hope to have a similar system in operation next year: St Mary's Church of  England High School and Mill Hill County School. Mill Hill County put in its application to the  Education Secretary in May last year and is still waiting for a decision. The school interviews  all applicants. Many parents believe that these interviews affect their children's chances of  admission. Deputy head Dr Louise James says: "The idea is to give a clear idea of what sort of  school this is. How parents perceive the interview is something we can't define." But another  local head says: "You don't need interviews to do that." <p> <p>Once these schools introduce  selection, the pressure on the rest of the borough may become unbearable. Mike Welch,  headteacher at Edgware School, one of the LEA schools, said: "There may be a domino effect.  There is always a fear that, with so many schools becoming selective, those that do not could  become sink schools. But it is not happening to us at present, our numbers are still buoyant."  <p> <p>Ironically, the rush to go selective may be the final nail in the Government's drive to  get schools to go grant maintained. Parents at another Barnet LEA school, Christ's College,  have just decisively rejected a proposal to opt out in a ballot, and headteacher Paul O'Shea,  who favoured opting out, said it was because they feared opting out would lead to selection.  <p> <p>For primary schools selection is a thorny issue. Barbara Thorne, headteacher at Holly  Park School, said that even where schools are supposed to be non-selective, "There is a  perception among parents that if they make an approach in the right way they can influence what  happens, and they may be right". <p> <p>There are ways, even with standard LEA admissions  criteria, by which schools can slip in pupils they want. Jenny Brown of Barnet Parents, which  campaigns locally against selection, said: "Some parents refuse to sign our petitions because  they think it will get known and affect their children's chances of admission." <p> <p>Barbara  Thorne added: "The process of applying to secondary schools starts earlier each year. When  children should be concentrating on their last and most productive year at primary school, they  are off for examinations and interviews all the time. Some will go for four or five of these,  taking whole days off each time. There is also pressure on schools to coach. We refuse  to do it and parents go elsewhere and get all kinds of examination papers and coaching  systems." <p> <p> <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td  width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td  width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td  width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td  width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE  height=30 width=400 border=0><tr> <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A  HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td> <td  align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td> <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>John Carvel</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>State schools were warned last night that they could be taken to court by aggrieved parents if they change to the selective  admissions system proposed yesterday by Gillian Shephard, the Education Secretary.  <p>  <p>As the Guardian disclosed last week, her draft circular would scrap the guidance which has stopped most head teachers interviewing  prospective pupils and their parents as a form of covert social screening. The document would also remove the restriction limiting open  selection by comprehensive schools to 10 per cent of places for pupils showing special aptitude for subjects such as music, art, or  drama.  <p>  <p>It was now "likely to be possible" for any school to be able to choose about 15 per cent of its intake according to pupils' general  ability. Schools could switch to the new system without having to go through the "cumbersome" procedure of publishing their plans for  local consultation, Mrs Shephard said.  <p>  <p>She was warned by Local Schools Information, a council-funded advisory group, that this new guidance would clearly infringe  legislation obliging schools to get government approval for any significant change of character. "It is almost inevitable that schools  adopting Mrs Shephard's approach will be taken to court by aggrieved parents," said Martin Rogers, the group's director.  <p>  <p>Mrs Shephard's officials acknowledged the circular might have to be tested in the courts, but the Government's lawyers thought the  increased selection would not amount to a significant change in the character of a school. Estelle Morris, Labour's education  spokeswoman, said the Government was "undermining parental choice by allowing head teachers to vet parents and pupils rather than  letting parents pick schools".  <p>  <p>Peter Smith, general secretary of the Association of Teachers and Lecturers, said the proposals ran directly counter to John  Major's vision of a classless society.  <p>  <p>Doug McAvoy, general secretary of the National Union of Teachers, said the proposals would further encourage schools to choose  parents rather than parents choosing schools.  <p>  <p>Nigel de Gruchy, general secretary of the National Association of Schoolmasters/Union of Women Teachers, said the announcement  "heralded selection on social grounds, accent and the size of the family car".   <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Glastonbury Festival to take a year off</b><br><br><br><b><h2>4 January 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Glastonbury takes one-year  break to regain hippy spirit  </h2>
  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Geoffrey Gibbs</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>Glastonbury festival yesterday became a victim of its own mammoth success when its founder cancelled this year's event, saying it  needed a rest to recapture its original hippy spirit.  <p>  <p>Michael Eavis, the Somerset farmer who has seen the festival grow in 25 years to become the biggest rock music event in Europe,  said: "We're having a fallow year, having a rest - it's good farming practice."  <p>  <p>Mr Eavis, aged 60, denied the decision was linked to his recent selection as the Labour candidate for Tory-held Wells at the next  general election. He added that the next festival would take place in June 1997.  <p>  <p>The gaping hole in this year's pop calendar is music to the ears of the big-time promoters, Mean Fiddler, who have been relentlessly  buying into the business and now control the four next highest-profile events, including Phoenix and Reading.  <p>  <p>It will also be greeted with a measure of relief by locals near Mr Eavis's Worthy Farm, at Pilton, near Shepton Mallet, not all of  whom welcome the invasion of tens of thousands of people for the three-day event. Last summer's festival was the busiest so far, with  all 80,000 tickets sold and at least another 20,000 people who scaled the perimiter fence. The cream of Britpop, such as Oasis and  Pulp, played, and there were acres of fields containing activities ranging from stone masonry to meditation. Its success confirmed  Glastonbury's reputation as one of the most vibrant and diverse festivals in the world.  <p>  <p>Mr Eavis said: "It's become very high profile, and that's a bit of a problem. I won't say we're going back to our hippy roots, but it's  nice to be a bit magical and mystical about it. We want to take the profile of the festival back a bit."  <p>  <p>The break would give the farm and wildlife a chance to recover and provide an opportunity for those involved in the organisation to  take stock. "It will also be a break for the people who don't like it - because they are pretty long suffering," he added.  <p>  <p>Mr Eavis, a father of eight children from two marriages, is treated with almost as much devotion by festival-goers as the pop stars  that perform. He is often seen driving around the site in his Land-Rover shaking people's hands.  <p>  <p>Bald with a bushy beard, he may look like an eccentric, but has a shrewd business brain in running the &#163;4m festival as well as  his organic farm, which produces 8,000 pints of milk a day.  <p>  <p>He said there had been no pressure to cancel the festival from either the police or the local authority, and both bodies had sounded  disappointed when he informed them. "Normally I get done for something, but 1995 was the first time in six years that I have not been  prosecuted," he said. "In recent times we have had years off in 1988 and 1991 following problems in the festivals of the proceeding  year. In 1995 the well-publicised event of the fence coming down led to some problems, and these will have to be resolved for future  years."  <p>  <p>Graham Jeffs, chief executive of Mendip district council, said the decision to suspend the 1996 event would enable the council and  the organisers to give further consideration to ways of controlling the perennial problem of the numbers attending the festival.  <p>  <p>Charities will lose out from the festival's cancellation, especially Greenpeace, which uses the festival as a showcase for its  campaigns. It also got the lion's share of the &#163;450,000 which Mr Eavis donated to charity last year.  <p>  <p>Mr Eavis is not considered to have much of a chance in winning Wells. The previous Labour candidate came a poor third in 1992,  polling just over 6,000 votes compared with almost 22,000 for the Liberal Democrats and 28,620 for the victorious Tory, David  Heathcoat-Amory.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Glastonbury Festival to take a year off</b><br><br><br><b><h2>5 January 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Field of shattered  dreams  </h2>
  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>John Harris</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>For some, it will be almost as if Christmas had been called off. Veteran Glastonbury organiser Michael Eavis may have his reasons -  re-thinking, re-grouping, serving the laudable cause of British socialism (he's Labour parliamentary candidate for Wells) but his  cancellation of this year's festival has already produced misery among thousands. No bands! No drugs! No three days spent plodding  around a temporary rural settlement that's a cross between Billy Smart's Circus and a refugee camp.  <p>  <p>Glastonbury's solstice-centred timing - six months after the excesses of yuletide - is surrounded by the requisite air of primeval  perfection. By the time they have detected the first scent of summer, the Glasto tribes have begun to feel the need for another  hedonistic safety-valve: an opportunity to momentarily live in a shabby utopia and head rapidly towards varying levels of plot-loss.  <p>  <p>This is the crux of most Glasto quests. Despite the presence of kid-carrying parents, petition-toting Marxists and other wholesome  stereotypes, most are there to get off their heads. Eavis's garden of delights is an ideal backdrop. Here, after all, one can watch 10  minutes of Tricky, start to feel twitchy, and then hobble off to the comedy tent, encountering friendly, stilt-wearing blue gargoyles  along the way. But while the Glasto nation weeps into its home-made boysenberry punch, many of its hapless victims will be celebrating.  <p>  <p>The poor toddlers who are forced to have their infant ears blasted by some deathly American noise troupe will sleep soundly in their  cots. The publicans of nearby Shepton Mallet will no longer have to reach for the 'Clean Clothes Only' signs. The elderly Christian who  erects a neon cross in her garden each year to ward off Satan can leave it in the garage. On a national scale, of course, such refuseniks  are in a dwindling minority. Slowly, Britain is coming to accept the festival as the largely harmless display of love 'n' peace it always  was. Last year saw the premiere of the first Glasto-based washing powder commercial: a bedraggled male youth returns home to be  quizzed about his time at "the rock festival", only to proudly reject such a limp term and utter the word "Glastonbury" as some people  utter "Heaven". More importantly, the involvement of Channel 4 and Radio 1 has become a permanent fixture, so the weekend was  starting to assume all the kudos of a Cup Final. Which explains why the disappointment is already spreading way beyond festival  diehards. Millions of us deserve sympathy - the suburban voyeurs who were set to spend two days gawping at their TV sets, the  latter-day nomads who'd already reserved their tent space by way of astral projection, and the crestfallen youngsters who simply  wanted to run away from mum and dad, go slightly mental and watch a few pop groups.  <p>  <p>There is also the matter of the Glastonbury Spirit. Last year's festival, the much-trumpeted 25th, found the more straggly elements  of its clientele bemoaning the way that it had "gone corporate". After a ruckus with travellers, Eavis had cancelled 1991's Glastonbury  to work on making it more straight-laced; for next year he should perhaps think about moving it a wee bit the other way.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

 <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Sally  Weale</b><br><br>      <p> <p>A subdued and nervous Madonna made a reluctant appearance before a Los Angeles court  yesterday to give evidence against a man accused of stalking her, declaring he had haunted her  life. The pop star, who was ordered to testify despite her lawyer's attempt to keep her  off the stand, told the jury she felt sick to be in the same room as Robert Dewey Hoskins. <p>  <p>Mr Hoskins, who is charged with stalking, making terrorist threats and assault, could face  up to 10 years in prison. He is accused of entering Madonna's Hollywood Hills home in April and  again in May, when a guard shot him. <p> <p>Dressed in a black knit suit, Madonna said she had  been told by one of her bodyguards that Mr Hoskins had scaled the walls of her property,  declared he would marry her and threatened to "slice her throat from ear to ear". She told the  court she felt "incredibly violated" by the threat and said she was "sick to my stomach" to be  in the same room. <p> <p>"I feel incredibly disturbed that the man who threatened my life is  sitting across from me and he has somehow made his fantasies come true," she said. The singer's  lawyer, Nicholas DeWitt, had earlier asked Judge Jacqueline Connor to either have Mr Hoskins  removed or to allow Madonna to testify elsewhere. <p> <p>"He wants to see the fear he's  instilled in her," Mr DeWitt said. But the judge said that to remove Mr Hoskins from the  courtroom would be so prejudicial as to invalidate any verdict. <p> <p> <p> <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td  width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td  width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td  width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td  width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr> <td  align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td> <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A  HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td> <td align=right  valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td> </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Jonathan Freedland</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>Madonna won a legal victory last night when a drifter who had threatened to kill her was found guilty of stalking and terrorising her  and assaulting her bodyguard. Robert Dewey Hoskins, who believed that he and Madonna were married, faces up to 10 years in jail after a Los Angeles jury found  him guilty on all counts.  <p>  <p>Hoskins threatened to slash Madonna's throat from ear to ear if she would not accept his love. He broke into her Hollywood home  three times and was caught last May when he scaled the wall of her estate and led one of her bodyguards on a 10-minute chase.  <p>  <p>The guard eventually shot and wounded Hoskins - who was clutching a wooden heart with the intriguingly-mispelled inscription,  "Love To My Wife Madnna". The three-day trial provided the set for a piece of theatre surreal even by Madonna's standards. Hoskins sat  throughout in a wheelchair, wearing hospital-style pyjamas, his arm in plaster.  <p>  <p>Madonna appeared only on the first day, dressed in a black suit. Initially the star had resisted a court summons. But threatened with  a $5m fine for contempt of court, she reluctantly testified last Wednesday. "I feel it made his fantasies come true," she told the court. Madonna said she had become terrified by Hoskins, whom she  had seen for the first time last April, and suffered from regular nightmares. A spokesman later announced that she plans to sell her  Hollywood home.  <p>  <p>Hoskins's court-appointed lawyer argued that his client was a harmless, homeless person guilty only of trespass. The defence  charged that Madonna was a "prima donna" who was exaggerating her fears. Hoskins will be sentenced next month.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Madonna gives evidence in court against stalker </b><br><br><br><b><h2>11 January  1996</h2></b><br><h2>Caught in the glare of the public's interest  </h2>
  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Suzanne Moore</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>It's good to stalk - it's the joke that everyone has made about Madonna's stalker, because he happened to be called Bob Hoskins. Now  that Robert Dewey Hoskins has been convicted, we can laugh like drains about a man who leaves a woman a letter threatening to "slice  her throat from ear to ear". Madonna had to convince the jury that she was truly frightened of this man, who had already broken into  her estate twice. The four female jury members had to spend some time convincing the eight men "on what would or wouldn't scare a  person".  <p>  <p>There are calls this week in the national press for a man, formerly employed on military projects for Rolls-Royce during the Gulf  war, to be locked up. A psychiatrist who has never met Jim Quinn (known in the Sunday Times as Bernard Quinn) suggests that he could  be dangerous. Though he has bombarded the Princess Royal with letters, and got divorced so that he may form a relationship with her,  as well as twice trying to get through the palace gates, he has not, as a senior police officer pointed out, actually broken the law. This  clearly ill and confused man has now become "the stalker at the palace", his photograph appearing in the papers and handed around to  those responsible for Princess Anne's security.  <p>  <p>In the meantime, four other men hang around another princess, communicating to each other on their mobile phones information about  her whereabouts. Late at night they accost her in the street when she is alone and when she bursts into tears they take pictures of her.  If she doesn't co-operate with them, she knows they will get what they want anyway. Their colleagues abroad have just spent their time  pursuing her young son. Their recent moment of triumph was a picture of Prince Harry falling over. These pictures were offered to  tabloids for &#163;5,000 each. Better still was a snap of Harry being sick out of a minibus window. The men who do this are not, of  course, stalkers and these activities are carried out in the name of journalism.     <p>So let's get this clear, this phenomenon of stalking... It is, as you would expect, big in America, where there was a special anti-stalking law passed in 1990 in Los Angeles. The LAPD, as  anyone who has witnessed their recent sensitivity would have expected, even has a special "threat-management" unit. Nearly a third of the cases it handles involve celebrities but, hey, it's a democracy, anyone can be  stalked. It's nasty stuff alright. It can make your life hell. Sometimes it can make your life end. We know of the cases involving the rich  and famous - John Lennon, Monica Seles, the fan of Sharon Gless from Cagney And Lacey who locked herself in Gless's home after  inundating her with countless love-letters and phone-calls. <p>  <p>We know that the psychological sub-genres of stalking can be classified as  anything from obsession, to erotomania, to simple fandom. We hear from time to time of more ordinary people whose lives are made  miserable through such persecution. We talk of this type of fixation as irrational, as scary, as blinkered. Most people who indulge in this  kind of behaviour believe that they are indeed having some sort of relationship with the object of their desire.  <p>  <p>How, then, are we to deal with the increasingly intrusive behaviour of the paparazzi and the tabloid press? There is something so  jaded, so horribly fin de si&#232;cle about the tabloid relation to celebrity, that it creates a vacuum that all of us are eventually sucked into.  This kind of 'photo-journalism', we are led to believe, is not a product of psychosis. It is rational, it is created out of the need to see.  <p>  <p>These guys know exactly what they are doing. Their object of desire is the dosh. They do not delude themselves into thinking that  they have a relationship with the Princess of Wales but their 'work' surely encourages us, the punters, to share intimate moments with  her. And if they push it too far, as they have this week, they ask not for forgiveness but point the finger in any other direction but their  own.  <p>  <p>Hence we are asked to guess what Princess Di is crying about. Her friends said that she was crying about the act of being  photographed itself but one paper, the Mirror, that published those pictures of her weeping, running away and trying to hide, makes  great efforts to decode them differently. She has no friends and is being pressurised to divorce and is missing her children and feels  desperately alone and has had a difficult session with her shrink... and whatever else might make you burst into tears. "The truth is  that Diana cannot say with certainty why she cried," writes royal correspondent James Whitaker with certainty. Fear not, though, you  can write to the Mirror on why you think the Princess wept. Mark your envelope 'Di's tears' and illuminate your favourite theory -  whether it be that she just hates James Whitaker or has lost an earring.  <p>  <p>The Mirror's editorial reminded us that those pictures "showed us just how far she has been pushed". The Mail promised its  readership that though there was an insatiable appetite for royal exclusives, if the paparazzi pushed the princess too far there would be  a backlash against the press. So who is pushing whom here? Certain sections of the press create distress in Diana, photograph it, muse  about the causes of this distress - all in the guise of appearing to care. This, when you think about it, is remarkably close to the  imaginary relationships that stalkers have with their victims. Their actions may cause intense misery, yet they continue to delude  themselves that they are in fact involved in a mutual relationship - if only their love-object would see the light.  <p>  <p>Failing that, any attention, any contact, is better than none at all. Critics of Diana will always say - and rightly so - that she  manipulates the press and is therefore fair game. The same could be said of Madonna. Stars who so exploit their fame cannot be  surprised that the celebrity they have created inevitably begins to resemble a black hole that is turning in on itself.  <p>  <p>Words like privacy, protection and intrusion mean something different in the age of sophisticated equipment used by people who are  prepared to live in a dustbin for a week to get a snap. One cannot be too shocked that those who seem to reveal all do not always want to  reveal any more, yet somehow we still are. The truth is that there may not be a lot more to reveal and that the wealth accrued by  seducing the public is now spent in keeping the public away.  <p>  <p>This may be a dangerous game, but does that justify such pictures? The tabloid imagination actually allows its readers very little. It  is never enough to believe something without seeing it before our eyes. Did we really need Di's tears to know that she may not be having  the best of times? Are we so de-sensitised that we need visual evidence of every single emotion? And what we must ask ourselves is  what does this achieve, apart from a last gasp for the declining newspaper industry?  <p>  <p>Like stalking, it actually achieves the opposite of what it intends. The forces of projection and identification are there in all  relationships. Without them we could not fall in love with one another, but they are not the whole story.  <p>  <p>The reality of the other person may interrupt our fantasies. Yet through the media we achieve not a closeness with the celebrity of  our choice, but a fantasy of closeness, a feeling of sharing something with them that they have not chosen always to share with us. We  see everything. We watch. We observe. We know so much about them that it's scary. We are linked to them, though they do not even  know our names. We should not be shocked, therefore, that occasionally some loony goes too far, but that more of us don't go further.  <p>  <p>We are all stalkers now, some more professional than others. But don't worry, we don't really want to hurt anyone. Do we?  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Mohammed al-Mas'ari is expelled from  UK</b><br><br><br><b><h2>5 January 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Giving in to blackmail</h2><h3>The  handling of Mr al-Mas'ari has been craven  </h2>
<br>
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Leading article</b> <br><br><br>      <p>There is no mystery about the real reason for deporting the Saudi dissident Mohammed  al-Mas'ari to Dominica instead of considering his application for asylum. He has not breached  any condition for political refugee status. It is not suggested that he is breaking British law  or promoting terrorism. No one has cast doubt on his claim to have a well-founded fear of  persecution if he returns to Saudi Arabia. Indeed his application for asylum has not been  examined at all: it has been refused "without substantive consideration of the claim". <p>  <p>The reason why Mr Mas'ari is being banished to a Caribbean Elba was set out with total  clarity yesterday by the Home Office minister Ann Widdecombe in the following terms: "We have  close trade relations with a friendly state (ie Saudi Arabia) which has been the subject of  considerable criticism by Mr Mas'ari." Are Mrs Widdecombe's listeners to recoil with shock and  horror? So an applicant for British asylum has ventured to criticise this wholly undemocratic  repressive state which has arrested hundreds for their political or religious activities and  routinely inflicts cruel and inhuman punishment. How dare he! No, even Mrs Widdecombe cannot  expect such a response. There is no reason why applicants for asylum (or those granted such  status) should refrain from political activity, so long as it is non-violent and is not illegal  in Britain. Neither the 1951 UN convention nor the subsequent UNHCR guidance to states make any  such stipulation. Nor can it be regarded as "self-serving" - a bogus performance to strengthen  Mr Mas'ari's claim. He was jailed and tortured for political protest in Saudi Arabia and is  continuing to protest in the same vein. <p> <p>The answer, simply, is that the government is  scared witless by the prospect of upsetting the Saudis. There was some surprise yesterday that  Mrs Widdecombe should have confirmed this so openly, but her only alternative was to keep quiet.  There was no other plausible reason for the Home Secretary's arbitrary act. Deporting Mr  Mas'ari to a third country is not, as it happens, a breach of international law, though the  practice has been expressly opposed in a recent document from the UNHCR. But the expected  approach is for the host country to consider an application for asylum, and then either accept  or reject it. Instead Britain has refused consideration while, illogically, finding another  country which will not only receive Mr Mas'ari's appplication but has promised in advance to  accept it. The result is that Britain looks ludicrous and craven at the same time. The blatant  admission of a political motive behind this decision may strengthen Mr Mas'ari's case for  appeal or judicial review. The nature of Mr Mas'ari's views as an Islamist who advocates  Shari'a law is beside the point - and not only because Saudi Arabia is already an Islamic state  where the same law is arbitrarily applied. Asylum is not granted only to those whose views we  applaud. <p> <p>There remains the Government's appeal to self-interest of the narrowest kind.  Protection of British jobs would be a more noble cause if it had been pursued elsewhere with  equal enthusiasm to prevent the run-down of our manufacturing industry. Besides the linkage of  trade and politics - normally opposed by the Government - creates a dangerous precedent.  Britain will be seen as more open to blackmail by trading partners who object to political  criticism - and there are plenty of them. Nor do massive arms sales to Saudi Arabia do anything  to promote a wider stability. Surely the lesson of the Gulf War was that the region needs fewer  guns, more democracy. <p> <p> <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td  width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td  width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td  width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td  width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE  height=30 width=400 border=0><tr> <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A  HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td> <td  align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td> <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Mohammed al-Mas'ari is expelled from  UK</b><br><br><br><b><h2>5 January 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Court challenge to Saudi's 'political  deportation'</h2><h3>Government admits decision to throw out dissident is aimed at  protecting relations with Riyadh  </h2>
 <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Seumas Milne</b><br><br>      <p> <p>The British deportation order against Saudi Arabia's most prominent dissident will be  challenged in the courts, human rights and political leaders pledged yesterday, after a  government minister admitted the decision had been taken to protect relations with the kingdom.  <p> <p>Claude Moraes, director of the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants, said his  organisation was prepared to seek judicial review of the order against Mohammed al-Mas'ari on  the basis of remarks made yesterday by the Home Office minister, Ann Widdecombe, and was taking  legal advice last night. <p> <p>Mr Mas'ari, leader of the Committee for the Defence of  Legitimate Rights, who has been given until 19 January to appeal against his expulsion to the  Caribbean island of Dominica, said he was prepared to fight the decision in the High Court if  necessary. <p> <p>The prospect of a legal challenge came as news of the deportation order was  greeted with outrage by opposition politicians at home and consternation in the Middle East. But the Government appeared ready to brazen out the controversy with its unqualified  confirmation that the expulsion was primarily aimed at maintaining good relations with oil-rich  Saudi Arabia. <p> <p>Mrs Widdecombe denied that there had been any "blackmailing pressure", but  said the Government had had representations from Riyadh and "people in British business" about  Mr Mas'ari, who was "complicating our relations with the Saudis". <p> <p>"If people come here  and use our hospitality in order to attack extremely friendly governments with whom we have  good diplomatic and very good trade relations, we have a very difficult balance to strike. On  this occasion, we have concluded that British interests do require his removal." Mr Moraes said  Mrs Widdecombe's comments exposed the decision to legal challenge because she had acknowledged  that the Government had used discretion in the deportation decision. The move evidently had  nothing to do with Mr Mas'ari not being "conducive to the public good", as required by the  Immigration Act. <p> <p>At a Westminster press conference, Mr Mas'ari said he felt "pity that  such a great country has come to this level. It is like a very dignified businessman, working  in the markets, his word is more valuable than his signature - and suddenly he gives up all  that reputation, all that character, all that dignity, for two or three drug deals." He added  that the opposition would continue its fight for an elected Islamic government in Saudi Arabia  wherever they were sent. <p> <p>Doug Henderson, Labour home affairs spokesman, demanded  assurances from ministers that the Government had stuck to the law and the UN Convention on  asylum and that Mr Mas'ari had been treated as any other refugee. Lord Avebury, the Liberal  Democrat peer and chairman of the Parliamentary Human Rights Group, said he was "appalled" by  the Government's decision. It had "given way to blackmail". <p> <p>Ken Livingstone, Labour MP  for Brent East - where the Saudi dissident leader has been based for the past 18 months - said  Mr Mas'ari's interests were being sacrificed to "suck up to the Saudis". <p> <p>The deportation  order was greeted with alarm by other Arab opposition movements based in London. "The great  British democracy has surrendered to the most corrupt regime in the world," the editor of an  independent London-based Arabic newspaper said. <p> <p>Meanwhile, Tunisian diplomats demanded  similar action against Rashid Ghannouchi, a fundamentalist leader granted asylum in Britain  despite his alleged involvement in terrorist attacks at home. <p> <p>It also emerged that Mr  Mas'ari had been seeking permission to operate a television station to broadcast to Saudi  Arabia. This prompted a frantic attempt by the Home Office to amend the guidelines of the  Independent Television Commission to require consideration of Britain's national security  interests. <p> <p>Businessmen welcomed the decision to expel Mr Mas'ari. "It was in the  interests of the UK to try to remove a man who was abusing British hospitality," said John  Grundon, of the Middle East Association, the leading trade body for the region. <p> <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td  width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td  width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td  width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td  width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr> <td  align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td> <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A  HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td> <td align=right  valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td> </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Mohammed al-Mas'ari is expelled from UK</b><br><br><br><b><h2>6 January 1996</h2></b><br><h2> The  silencing of al-Mas'ari  </h2>
<h3>Leading article</h3>  <br>      <p>The parallel world of Britain's defence establishment is hard to penetrate. The chaps follow one  another through revolving doors marked government, industry or one of the three services in soberly  clad anonymity. Just occasionally a little light is shed on the way that this cosy mafia operates and  its influential connections extend into the intelligence world. The confidential memorandum from Sir  Colin Chandler, chief executive of Vickers and formerly Britain's chief arms salesman, is a document  worth studying as much for what it tells us about the exotic culture of this government as for the  specific light which it sheds upon the Mohammed al-Mas'ari affair.   <p>  <p>Mr Mas'ari was deported from Britain, we were told again yesterday by the Home Secretary with the same candour as his minister Ann  Widdecombe on the previous day, in order to protect "commercial links" with Saudi Arabia. This, in the  Guardian's view, also stated yesterday, is tantamount to giving in to blackmail. Whatever the view,  the directors of those arms industries making money out of selling weapons to Saudi Arabia would have  been expected to express concern to the Government about the effect of Mr Mas'ari's campaigning on  their profitable relationship with the Saudi royal family. But the memorandum goes far further,  revealing a degree of intimacy between the arms manufacturers, government officials (including senior  diplomats) and intelligence agencies which is both incestuous and dangerous.   <p>  <p>Vickers and British Aerospace, by this account, were not merely engaged in presenting a case to ministers and civil  servants on behalf of their own commercial interests. They were engaged in a concerted effort to  silence Mr Mas'ari with the apparent full cooperation of the Foreign Office as well as with British  intelligence and the CIA. They were acting on behalf of King Fahd of Saudi Arabia and his brother the  defence minister in an attempt to silence Saudi dissidents. It was deemed quite in order for the head  of a British industry in the private sector to offer advice to the British government on a matter of  extreme diplomatic sensitivity - how to deal with the defecting son-in-law of Saddam Hussein. Sir  Colin's proposal got a quick and positive response from the British ambassador-to-be in Riyadh.   <p>  <p>The "material" gained from this Iraqi war criminal, it appears, was used in an unsuccessful attempt to  appease Saudi royal outrage at Mr Mas'ari. What the document reveals is a type of presumptuous  behaviour which makes nonsense of democratic accountability. Vickers and BAe should stick to selling  their lethal goods and leave policy to the elected government. As a sinister footnote we note the  regret expressed that "direct Saudi intervention" against Mr Mas'ari would be "difficult". At least he  was safe in Britain, or so we hope, from having a limb amputated.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Stock Exchange sacks Michael  Lawrence</b><br><br><br><b><h2>5 January 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Market grandees stick the knife  in </h2>
<h3>Top-level delegation forces action against Lawrence in face of crisis at the  Stock Exchange  </h2>
 <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Paul Murphy</b><br><br>      <p> <p>The shock departure of Stock Exchange chief executive Michael Lawrence yesterday was  precipitated by a delegation of Stock Exchange board members demanding urgent action from the  Bank of England, according to market sources. Reports indicated that one member of the  delegation had indicated that his broking firm would withdraw its capital from the London stock  market if concerns over the leadership of the exchange were not addressed. Others are believed  to have stated that they were prepared to resign their membership of the exchange. <p> <p>The  group represented the City's most powerful trading houses and is said to have included the  likes of BZW, the investment banking division of Barclays bank, American brokerage Merrill  Lynch, which took over Smith New Court last year, and NatWest Securities. It is said to  have visited the Bank just before Christmas, arguing that Mr Lawrence was ignoring their  concerns over the strategy being pursued by the exchange and, in particular, the speed with  which new trading systems were being introduced. <p> <p>Mr Lawrence's resignation comes after a  string of blows to the exchange's credibility. Last autumn Rudi Mueller, the London head of  Swiss financial powerhouse UBS, resigned from the board and helped stir up the row over the  exchange's future with a charge that it had failed to keep pace with innovations in other  European markets. <p> <p>In November, Mr Lawrence infuriated the biggest market-making firms -  those who make constant two-way prices in shares and who rank as the exchange's most powerful  members - by bringing forward the introduction of the Sequence 6 trading system to August this  year. This system will allow big investors, such as pension funds, to trade on an 'order  driven' basis - posting their transactions on trading screens and avoiding having to put their  business through market-makers. <p> <p>Brian Winterflood, head of small-company market maker  Winterflood Securities, insisted the council had simply "shot the messenger". "We have had a  lot of propaganda about how quote-driven systems are no good because no one else uses them. But  London is the third-biggest equity market in the world, and 85 per cent of European share  trades go through the City." Brokers currently have to be members of the exchange so that they  can use the Talisman system for settling share bargains. But from next summer, when the Crest  system (run by the Bank) is due to replace Talisman, they will be able to purchase this service  regardless of membership of the exchange. "The exchange is going to be &#163;40m a year worse  off, but we have not seen it doing much to cut costs," one said. An order-driven system would  give it the opportunity to charge for usage. <p> <p>Peter Rawlins, a former exchange chief  executive, last night called for wide-ranging reform to make the organisation's board "more  truly representative of the entire user community". In an interview on BBC radio, Mr Rawlins  said: "I think it (the Stock Exchange) should look to its own government's arrangements,  whether the size and composition of its board is still appropriate to today's needs and whether  the executive has the support it undoubtedly needs to continue to push through continuing  changes in the face of a changing financial world." <p> <p> <p> <p> <br><br><center><TABLE  border=0><tr> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif"  ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td  width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td  width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td  width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr> <td align=left  valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td> <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A  HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td> <td align=right  valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td> </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Edward Pilkington</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>It was a classic death, played with admirable conviction by a farmer's wife called Daphne Banks, aged 61. At least, until the plot strayed drastically from the script.  <p>  <p>Mrs Banks's death began smoothly when she collapsed on New Year's Day in Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire, John Major's parliamentary constituency. All the usual stops were pulled.  <p>  <p>The police were called and went through the motions of a routine operation. The local GP was summoned to pronounce Mrs Banks officially deceased. Next, the undertakers arrived dressed, of course, in black. With due solemnity, they made the initial preparations of Mrs Banks's body and placed her on a stretcher.  <p>  <p>The ambulance took Mrs Banks's body to Hinchingbrooke Hospital, where it was wheeled to the mortuary.  <p>  <p>If the story had ended there, it could have been classified as a perfect death. But the attendants were astonished to see movement. To use more technical language, Mrs Banks was breathing.  <p>  <p>William Goldby, area manager of funeral directors T L Cobbold of Hail Weston, said: "A member of my staff actually detected signs of life. He did not detect any sign of a pulse, but there was a rise and fall of the chest. "This member of staff is a friend of Mrs Banks's family and he was already upset to hear of her death. The whole thing has been highly traumatic for him."  <p>  <p>A 'crash team' of doctors and medics trained to prevent death were then assigned the rather more onerous task of bringing her back from the dead. They succeeded.  <p>  <p>"The body was brought to us by undertakers having been certified dead," the hospital's spokeswoman, Margaret Markey, said yesterday. "So as far as we're concerned, it wasn't our fault."  <p>  <p>Cambridge and Huntingdon Health Commission has opened an inquiry. After a spell in the emergency ward followed by intensive care, Mrs Banks is now recovering satisfactorily in a general ward.  <p>  <p>She is as alive as she was officially dead five days ago.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

 <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>John Mullin</b><br><br>      <p> <p>The undertaker who noticed a woman was alive after a doctor certified her as dead said  yesterday it was a miracle he had spotted a varicose vein twitching. She had then snored twice.  Ken Davison, aged 61, said he had taken a closer look at Daphne Banks, 61, before  putting her in a sealed body tray at the mortuary because he had known the family for 40 years.  He was astonished to realise she was still alive. <p> <p>Mr Davison, of St Neots, Huntingdon,  Cambridgeshire, said: "It was such a wonderful feeling that this could happen to me with  somebody that I knew." People saw babies being born all the time, but it didn't compare with  what he had seen. <p> <p>Mrs Banks, of Stonely, near Huntingdon, was continuing her recovery  last night in Hinchingbrooke Hospital, Huntingdon. She was said to be satisfactory in a general  ward. Her husband, Claude, is considering whether to sue the local health authority over the  doctor's error. <p> <p>Mr Davison, who works for Cobbold's undertakers in the village of Hail  Weston, arrived at the Banks's home with his colleague, Gary Morris, 32, early on New Year's  Day. Two hours earlier, a doctor, as yet unnamed, had declared her dead. They spent five  minutes checking her body. They then lifted her on to a stretcher, covered her with a sheet,  and put her in an ambulance. <p> <p>Mr Davison said: "We looked at her fairly carefully, but we  noticed no signs of life at that stage. As far as we were aware the doctor, who was no longer  at the house, had pronounced her dead and that was that." <p> <p>After they arrived at the  mortuary at Hinchingbrooke Hospital, Mr Davison was left to prepare her body. "Because I  knew the person very well and I knew the family, I just stood there in contemplation, and I  could not believe it when I noticed a vein in her right leg which seemed to twitch. I looked at  her again, and her chest started going in and out. I went to consult Gary and said the lady was  still breathing and I don't think they believed me for a while. Then I said 'actually, I have  seen her snore twice'." <p> <p>After his colleague and the mortician confirmed Mrs Banks was  still alive, a hospital crash team was called. Several doctors quickly arrived. Mr Davison said  Mrs Banks was just minutes away from being loaded into a sealed tray. That would have meant  certain death. <p> <p>The thought of what might have happened continued to bother him. He was  having trouble sleeping. <p> <p>"I think more than anything I am glad that it was me who  noticed that she was still alive having known her and the family for all these years. I  wouldn't say we were close friends but I've known Claude all my life and I've known Mrs Banks  since they were married which was about 40 years ago."

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Blair unveils the stakeholder  society</b><br><br><br><b><h2>9 January 1996</h2></b><br><h2>New Labour, new stakeholders</h2>  <h3>Feelgood words from Mr Blair, but give him credit for trying  </h2>
 <br><b>Leading  article</b> <br><br><br>      <p>Tony Blair's speech to Singapore businessmen yesterday marks a milestone in the evolution of  New Labour's ideas from a portfolio of policies into a coherent philosophy. Just as in the  1960s Harold Wilson used the prospect of a new society forged in the "white heat" of technology  to divert the party faithful from nationalisation, so Tony Blair is trying to infuse the party  with a new binding moral imperative to replace the dying embers of collectivisation. <p> <p>The  Stakeholder Economy is in one sense simply a portmanteau word to embrace a large number of  individual initiatives - from putting the long-term unemployed back to work to providing  portable pensions - but it is also an attempt to communalise Labour's project and to sublimate  the economic insecurity which global economic change, aggravated by Thatcherism, has brought  about and to which there may be no instant solution. <p> <p>Where Mrs Thatcher offered a share  owning democracy, Mr Blair offers rich and poor a seductive stake in education, welfare,  information technology, and corporate governance. All the ideas have powerful antecedents, but  gathering them under one all-embracing concept is more than a mere political necessity. If  there is one Old Labour virtue that unashamedly shines through, it is equality of opportunity,  including the right not to have to spend the rest of your life disintegrating in the dole  queue. <p> <p>New Labour needs a moral imperative because there is no magic wand which a  fiscally cautious Blair government can wave. It will probably inherit the best macro-economic  framework of any Labour administration (including it seems record North Sea oil output), but  that won't stop the global economy from downsizing and marginalising the concept of a secure  job. Once globalisation is accepted, it is difficult to turn back the globe on which you turn.  It is one thing to talk about creating "a unified society with a strong sense of purpose and  direction" and building a trust relationship in firms; but in practice it is like asking for a  culture transplant. <p>  <p>Cynics can reel out a depressing catalogue of past pre-electoral panaceas  which never fulfilled their promise including nationalisation, privatisation, technological  change, monetarism and reduced government spending. However, the daunting nature of the problem  should not prevent fresh solutions being tried. New Labour's macro-economic policy won't be  much different from John Major's and its headroom will be even more constrained if it signs up  for the single currency. On micro-economic policy he has a number of interesting initiatives  which could have a significant effect. <p>  <p>Changing society itself may be beyond the power of one  man or one government, but merely to alter direction from the self-interested,  anti-communitarian cul-de-sac along which the nation has been bounced against its will would be  a liberation worth waiting for. <p> <p> <p> <p> <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr> <td  width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td  width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td  width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td  width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr> <td align=left  valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td> <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A  HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td> <td align=right  valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td> </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Blair unveils the stakeholder  society</b><br><br><br><b><h2>9 January 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Tony Blair  should ignore the critics of his new big idea</h2>  <h3>The stakeholder society finally gives the left a  credible ideology that stands up effectively to laissez-faire capitalism  </h2>
 <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Will  Hutton</b><br><br>      <p> <p>The snap reaction of the left to the idea of the stakeholder economy and society is that  it is little more than Thatcherism in drag, just another way of talking about popular  capitalism or the enterprise culture. The right is no more forgiving. The dynamics of  capitalism are immutable and brook no reform. Tony Blair will find that championing  stakeholding is no easy ride; he has entered the political battle of ideas with a vengeance.  But the stock criticisms are wrong. Like it or hate it, stake-holding does represent a  different political economy of capitalism with profound implications for economic, social and  political organisation. It stresses that workers should be seen as members of firms rather than  locked into an antagonistic confrontation between capital and labour. In this world view, firms  are social organisations embedded in a complex skein of rights and moral obligations, and if  they are reduced to commodities bought and sold on the stock market, that undermines the trust  and reciprocity of obligation on which long-termism and productivity thrive. <p> <p>Too much  fracturing and tiering of society in the quest for simple economic efficiencies is ultimately  socially unsustainable - and that spills over into the sustainability of economic growth.  Social citizenship and economic membership are interdependent - but this links up with  political citizenship. An active participative democracy goes hand in hand with underpinning  social cohesion and promoting stakeholder firms. These are no platitudes. A different  vocabulary opens up - social inclusion, membership, trust, co-operation, long-termism, equality  of opportunity, participation, active citizenship, rights and obligations - in sharp contrast  to the right's language of opting-out, privatisation, the primacy of individual choice,  maximisation of shareholder value and the 'burden' of welfare and social costs. <p> <p>Behind the  vocabulary lies a different value system, a different view of what makes a successful market  economy tick - and a dramatically different approach to economic and social policy. Corporate  law, the organisation of pensions, systems of training, company decision-making, the behaviour  of the Stock Exchange and the role of education are markedly different in a stakeholder world.  The international evidence, as Blair said in Singapore, is that this approach delivers social  cohesion and economic growth; the two feed off each other. By pinning his colours to the  stakeholder mast, Blair has taken a decisive political step. New Labour has now enlisted a  substantial and novel body of ideas: it stands in sharp opposition to the laissez-faire,  financially-driven model of capitalism promoted by the right. <p> <p>This may have been good  enough to beat its ideological rival, communism, and even good enough to take on and beat  British collectivism - but as a model for the good society or efficient economy it falls far  short of any decent yardstick. It is characterised by endemic short-termism, economic  volatility and social divisiveness - and, when married to the top-down centralised nature of  British government, has delivered a society in which civic duty and public service have become  progressively emasculated. <p> <p>It was exactly against this kind of laissez-faire capitalism  that the stakeholder idea was first developed - by the American left during the Sixties. The  word derived from the way US settlers staked their claim in virgin territory. Business  strategists in the late Fifties and early Sixties used it to rethink the idea of a company as a  network of reciprocal claims between shareholders, employees, bankers, suppliers and managers.  Large industrial organisations were bureaucracies which arbitrated between these rival claims -  a necessary function in any industrial economy, market capitalist or market socialist. <p>  <p>But it was when J K Galbraith picked up the idea in the New Industrial State, published in  1967, aided and abetted by Robin Marris, author of the 'Theory of Managerial Capitalism', that  the idea first gained economic and political currency. During the Seventies, American corporate  raiders complained that companies were cynically appealing to stakeholder interests to obstruct  takeovers and limit shareholders' rights (a complaint they still make). But as no US politician  has attempted to organise the ideas into a legislative programme, stakeholding has not  progressed much beyond encouraging worker share ownership through Employee Stock Ownership  Plans. <p> <p>In Germany, the social market ideas developed by left theorists in opposition to fascism  and communism had similar roots - they thought of the firm as a social organisation with  long-term stakeholders, which operated in highly competitive markets. The welfare state was  seen as a protective social instrument to promote social inclusion, and allow capitalism its  much-needed flexiblity to build up and run down industries without worrying about the social  consequences. The political purpose was the same as Galbraith's: to secure the fecundity of  capitalism whilst humanising it - and defending it from authoritarianism of the left and right.  <p> <p>In Britain the whole debate has never taken off before. The post-war settlement was a  compromise, allowing the left to achieve its social goals through raising public spending and  extending public ownership, but leaving the right to protect City freedoms and the ancient  notion that the firm represented no more than the shareholders' interests. The case for  stakeholding was left to fringe groups campaigning for worker participation and co-operatives.  But with the instruments of Old Labour collapsing, and the right building on the laissez-faire  model, the most promising avenue for the left is stakeholding. <p> <p>The TUC has recognised  this for some time, and General Secretary John Monks has established a task force to suggest  legislative proposals and ways the unions might profit. The Dahrendorf Commission on Wealth  Creation and Social Cohesion came out firmly in favour of stakeholding last summer. Tony  Blair's has been tantalisingly slow to adopt it publicly but the Singapore speech is a  watershed. <p> <p>It establishes authentically left credentials, blindsides his opponents and  has a reforming sting. Witness just one passage. "It is surely time," he said, "to assess how  we shift the emphasis in corporate ethos - from the company being a mere vehicle for the  capital market to be traded, bought and sold as a commodity - towards a vision of the company  as a community or partnership in which each employee has a stake, and where the company's  responsibilities are more clearly delineated." <p> <p>Michael Portillo immediately attacked  this as a straight copy of long-standing Conservative policy - but it is difficult to recall a  Conservative politician ever indicting the operation of stock-market capitalism for  commoditising companies and workers, or proposing a clear delineation of corporate rights and  obligations. Isn't the Conservative idea to promote deregulation and to regard stock-market  freedoms as sacred? But Blair's advocacy of what he calls the Stakeholder Welfare System may  arouse more concern. There is a clear accent on social cohesion and the necessity to recast the  welfare state so it ceases to offer an obstacle to training or self-employment; and it is  equally attractive to open up collective means of self-insurance to allow individuals to  produce pensions or sickness benefit above the basic levels. The danger, though, is also clear:  Singapore-type provident funds could be progressively used to replace existing welfare  structures, with their accompanying need for a redistributive tax system. <p> <p>Yet in sum the  commitment to a stakeholder economy and society is a key moment - a way of binding the centre  and left together in common cause while providing the ideological impetus for important  economic and social return. Blair went to Australia this Christmas with no advisers and a  suitcase of books. On this evidence he should go again. <p> <p> <p> <p> <br><br><center><TABLE  border=0><tr> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif"  ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td  width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td  width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td  width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr> <td align=left  valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td> <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A  HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td> <td align=right  valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td> </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Blair unveils the stakeholder society</b><br><br><br><b><h2>29 January 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Battle for Britain</h2><h3> Tony Blair  believes we have reached the third critical point in post-war politics, and argues that his stakeholder dream can change people's lives</h2>     <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Tony Blair</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>Ten years ago, 'Faith In The City', the report of the Archbishop of Canterbury's Special Commission On Urban Priority Areas, sounded  a warning note about the condition of Britain. It argued that economic and social inequality were becoming more pervasive in our society  and that we all had a moral responsibility, rich or poor, religious or secular, urban residents or country, to contribute towards the  creation of a more just society. Ten years on, the condition of our country should concern us all. Growing inequality is defended.  Responsibility and mutuality are spurned. Public services are broken up. Decency and tolerance are scorned. And Britain lacks the  common purpose to take it forward.  <p>  <p>It is clear from the fury of politics within the last few days that we have a choice between debating the condition and future of  Britain on the high ground, or having instead a rather nasty, personalised, negative campaign fought in the gutter. I believe we must  fight the battle of ideas, because the essential challenge posed by 'Faith In The City' remains unanswered: do we have the confidence and  the ideas as a nation to achieve prosperity with fairness in the next century? Three weeks ago in Singapore, I set out my vision of a  stakeholder economy - an idea with modern relevance across traditional political boundaries.  <p>  <p>Next week, I will be making the case for political reform - what one might call stakeholder politics. In a speech today I will be talking  about Labour's belief in social cohesion - a stake in society - and the need for a war on social exclusion if we are to move forward as a  nation. Britain is today more divided and more insecure than when 'Faith In The City' was published. One in five households have no one  working, the poorest 10 per cent are 17 per cent worse off in real terms than they were in 1979, and one in three children grow up in  poverty.  <p>  <p>At the top, privilege is more obvious than before. In the privatised utilities, salaries of chairmen and chief executives have gone up  on average by over 250 per cent since privatisation.  <p>  <p>Meanwhile, in the middle, sits the anxious class. People insecure about their jobs. Afraid that public services will not be there when  they need them. Struggling to pay mortgages and new charges. Prompted to opt for private pensions and now finding that they get very  little in return. The Conservatives used to say that to be cruel was to be efficient. In fact, social justice is a necessity not a luxury. The  most meaningful stake anyone can have in society is the ability to earn a living and support a family. So we propose education,  employment and community initiatives for the young unemployed that would slash youth unemployment over a parliament. Benefit  reforms would provide hope for the one-in-five workless households, trapped on benefit by a system designed for a labour market and  family structure that no longer exists. A jobs, education and training programme for single parents would offer help to a group of people  currently on a 16-year ticket to reliance on the state.  <p>  <p>Next to employment, secure housing is the foundation of personal security. I welcome the Government decision to extend the  rough-sleepers' initiative. But they could do much more. The release of the capital receipts held by local authorities would provide jobs  and homes that so many people are desperate to live in. Instead of cracking down on rights to housing benefit, we should be attacking the  &#163;1bn-a-year cost of housing-benefit fraud. And why not tackle homelessness at root by combining housing with training so that  young people are set on the road to financial independence? However, the core economic challenge facing us as a nation is to use the  power of all our people and not just an elite. The real lesson of last week does not concern selection in 150 grammar schools, but  standards of provision in 25,000 schools up and down the country.  <p>  <p>It is very clear why the Tories want to focus debate on selection not standards. Our deficit for the average child is stark: last week,  figures showed 50 per cent of 11-year-olds failing to reach expected standards; at GCSE and A level we get half as many good grades  as the French and Germans. Overall, we rank 35th in the world education league.  <p>  <p>We won't turn this round by returning to the 11-plus. With their record, the Tories are making a terrible mistake if they think that a  debate about education will benefit them. That is why we will keep education right at the top of the political and campaigning agenda. If a  few more Conservative ministers actually used the state sector for their own children, they might come to realise what the real  concerns of parents actually are. First, a proper start for all pupils, with decent nursery education and childcare provision. Second,  smaller class-sizes in infant schools, paid for by phasing out the assisted places scheme. Third, a new partnership with teachers to  reward excellence, promote professional development, and raise standards. Fourth, making the most of information technology, by  combining free and fair competition with the public interest to cable up all schools to the information superhighway. Fifth, new links with  the community: associate teachers drawn to help in the classroom, parents and families working in partnership with teachers. And  sixth, broader A levels and upgraded vocational qualifications.  <p>  <p>The traditional 'factory' model of education assumes all children proceed at broadly similar speed in every subject. We should refuse  to go back to selection but refuse too to make do with uniformity. Today we need a system where students forge ahead in areas of  strength, breaking down the traditional equation of ages and stages.  <p>  <p>It can be done. In Birmingham, bright 11-year-olds are doing GCSEs. In Oswestry, 15-year-olds are taking Open University courses.  New technology and a flexible curriculum should make accelerated learning possible for any pupil with talent in a particular subject.  <p>  <p>In addition, we need to make special efforts to improve inner-city schools. Labour has already committed itself to year-on-year  pressure and support for school improvement, and to encourage every school to develop distinctive ethos and specialism.  <p>  <p>Nothing is more important than strong leadership from a skilled headteacher. This isn't just about money. We are looking at ways to  provide incentives for headteachers with a proven track-record of success to commit themselves to help turn round difficult schools.  'Twinning' or 'mentoring' schemes have started. But we also need special school improvement networks to promote best practice. I will  have more to say about this and other initiatives tonight [at Southwark Cathedral].  <p>  <p>Strong communities are about what people give as much as what they take, and any attempt to rebuild community for a modern age  must assert that personal and social responsibility are not optional extras but core principles. This means attacking the conditions in  which crime breeds, and at the time insisting that serious crimes require punishment. It also means asserting the importance of  commitment to strong families, which provide the critical context for children to grow and learn.  <p>  <p>In addition, I want to see public service encouraged and developed. For example, we have suggested the idea of new 'lessons for life'  in schools, including practical community service with the elderly or those in need, as well as a new national citizen's service  programme for young people, allowing them to see how they can fulfil responsibilities and at the same time fulfil themselves.  <p>  <p>There are two futures for Britain. The Tories offer a Britain split into two tiers, with affluent communities turned into private  fortresses against the world outside. Labour offers the vision of Britain as One Nation - a belief that to help individuals get on we need  to reinvent community for the modern world.  <p>  <p>I believe we have reached a third critical turning point in post-war politics. For a generation after 1945, state-led collectivism held  sway. The Thatcherites capitalised on its limitations, and ushered in an era of unfettered individualism. That is now coming to a close.  Today, the search is on to reinvent community for a modern age, true to core-values of fairness, cooperation and responsibility, but  applied to the world as it is not the world as it was.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Rebecca Smithers</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>Would-be Labour candidates who found themselves thwarted by the party's policy of all-women shortlists yesterday criticised two  male party members who won a ruling that the policy was illegal.  <p>  <p>Andy Mudd, local councillor and potential candidate in the West Yorkshire marginal consituency of Keighley where an all-women  shortlist was imposed by Walworth Road, said: "I personally doubted the legality of it from the start. But I wouldn't have taken the thing  to court. In a political party you need to win or lose your arguments within the party. I lost it and was prepared to accept that."  <p>  <p>Leeds city councillor Fabian Hamilton, who lost out in Leeds North East despite considerable local backing, said it was wrong to have  taken the matter to court. "It's outrageous. You argue your corner in a democratic forum. If you take the party to court, where does it  end? This will cause more strife and it's not good for the party."  <p>  <p>Labour's policy of women-only shortlists was overwhelmingly approved at its 1993 party conference after an earlier package of  measures failed to achieve significant progress towards the party's target of 'breaking the glass ceiling' by doubling its number of  women MPs.  <p>  <p>New rules, enthusiastically backed by the then Labour leader John Smith, decreed that in each region half the candidates in target  seats and in seats where a Labour MP was standing down must be drawn from women-only shortlists.  <p>  <p>Clare Short, former shadow minister for women who was instrumental in drawing up the policy, highlighted the  under-representation of women in the British political system a year ago.  <p>  <p>She pointed out that of the 651 MPs elected in 1992 only 60 (nine per cent) were women. "Labour has made more progress than the  other parties, with 13 per cent of our MPs and 21 per cent of our MEPs being women, but we are determined to continue progress until  50 per cent of our representatives are women."  <p>  <p>The new system was designed to boost the proportion of women Labour MPs to 25 per cent, 80-90 MPs. But the policy ran into  fierce opposition from grassroots party members opposed to what they saw as a 'quick-fix' solution which swapped discrimination  against women for discrimination against men. Labour HQ showed its determination to enforce the policy by imposing women-only  shortlists in constituencies like Slough, Gravesham and Great Yarmouth. Some members in Leeds North East were convinced the  consitituency party would not have selected leftwinger Liz Davies but for an all-women shortlist. Labour's National Executive  Committee has since refused to endorse her candidature. In July Tony Blair signalled an end to the system, declaring it "not ideal" and  saying it would only apply to the next general election.  <p>  <p>That decision came too late for Peter Jepson and Roger Dyas-Elliott, who won their case that the party's policy amounted to sex  discrimination yesterday before a three-man tribunal.  <p>  <p>Mr Jepson, a law lecturer at University College, London, had been rejected by Brentford and Isleworth and the new Regent's Park  and Kensington North constituencies. Mr Dyas-Elliott had been seeking selection by Keighley Labour Party, which picked Ann Cryer, the  widow of its former MP, Bob Cryer, to fight the seat.  <p>  <p>Mr Jepson said yesterday: "All we want is the equality of opportunity and equal treatment for both sexes, all races and those with  disabilities. I am considering re-applying to the two constituencies which turned me down." But Mr Dyas-Elliott said he would not pursue  his ambiitons at Keighley. "I have been a member of the Labour Party for 26 years and I do not want to rock the boat," he said. "I see  this as a moral victory, and I do not want any redress or compensation."  <p>  <p>Labour was repeatedly warned by leading experts in sex discrimination law that its policy was illegal and could be successfully  challenged in a court or tribunal.  <p>  <p>The Liberal Democrat peer Lord Lester QC, who spent two years drafting Britain's sex and race discrimination laws in the 1970s as  special adviser to the Labour government, said: "More than two years ago I warned colleagues and friends in the Labour Party that this  should not be allowed to happen." Labour's policy may have been short-lived, but it also has done much to expose the  under-representation of women in the Conservative Party, where few women are making it to final shortlists. Employment minister  Cheryl Gillan insisted yesterday that the Conservative Party's policy, with no discrimination, was "the right way forward".  <p>  <p>Ann Carlton, wife of the former Labour frontbencher Denzil Davies and co-convenor of Labour Supporters for Real Equality, said the  tribunal ruling was "a good day for equality". She said Labour should drop all quota systems, and called on women who had been selected  as a result of all-women shortlists to demand re-selection on a fair basis. "We are only talking about 30 seats. I suspect most of them  would have won anyway."   <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Labour Party's  women-only shortlist policy illegal</b><br><br><br><b><h2>9 January 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Drive  for women MPs illegal  </h2>
 <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Martin Wainwright</b><br><br>      <p> <p>Labour's controversial women-only shortlist policy was torpedoed yesterday in the  unlikely forum of a Leeds industrial tribunal, heralding months of possible legal battles over  one of the party's most radical internal reforms. A three-strong panel ruled that  confining the chance to fight parliamentary seats to one sex was contrary to the 1975 Sex  Discrimination Act, however well-intentioned the aim of increasing the total of women MPs. Of  Labour's 270 MPs, 38 are women. <p> <p>The party is likely to appeal, but has frozen selection  in nine seats with women-only shortlists until it receives the full written judgment in the  next two weeks. Thirty-four women candidates have been chosen by the party under the policy. A  question mark hangs over a further five constituencies - three in the North and Yorkshire  region, one in South Wales and one in Leicester - where the process of selecting a woman  candidate was due to start soon. <p> <p>If Labour appeals, the case would take 12 months to  reach the Employment Appeal Tribunal unless the tribunal agreed to expedite it. Further appeals  would be possible to the Court of Appeal and House of Lords, and it would be open to any  appellate court to refer the case to the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg, delaying a  result still further. <p> <p>Under the policy, which was formally introduced at Labour's 1993  conference, half of new constituencies, seats due to be vacated by sitting members, and those  considered most winnable were set aside for women candidates. The tribunal's chairman, John  Prophet, who presided over the three-day tussle between James Goudie QC, chairman of the  Society of Labour Lawyers, and the do-it-yourself presentation of a Ruskin College graduate and  a pony-tailed parish councillor, said the law had clearly been breached by the policy. <p>  <p>"It may be many would regard the motives of the policy as laudable, in wanting to increase  the number of women MPs from under 10 per cent," he said. "But that has no relevance to  the issue. The Government passed the Sex Discrimination Act and has given tribunals such as  this the responsibility to enforce it. We conclude therefore that the complaints of  both applicants, that they have been unlawfully discriminated against on the grounds of their  sex, are well founded." <p> <p>Tom Sawyer, general secretary of the Labour Party, said he was  surprised at the decision and confirmed that the party was considering an appeal. "We have  proceeded throughout in the belief we have been acting in accordance with the law," he said.  <p> <p>The shadow health secretary, Harriet Harman, who backed the 'Emily's List' campaign to  get more seats for women, said she was bitterly disappointed. The Conservatives and Liberal  Democrats seized on the ruling as evidence of an "unfair" policy. <p> <p>Tory deputy chairman  Michael Trend said: "Labour's blatant exercise in sexism and political correctness has now been  rejected by an industrial tribunal. They should reopen the selection in all those  constituencies where all-women shortlists have been imposed." <p> <p>Diana Maddock, Liberal  Democrat women's affairs spokeswoman, said: "Parliament would greatly benefit from having more  women, but the way to achieve that is through a programme of positive action rather than  positive discrimination." <p> <p>The two victors, long-standing Labour Party members Peter  Jepson, aged 45, and Roger Dyas-Elliott, 49, were jubilant after the vindication of hours of  research followed by patient argument at the tribunal. Mr Jepson, of Feltham, Middlesex,  was debarred from standing for the London seats of Brentford and Isleworth, and Regent's Park  and Kensington North. Mr Dyas-Elliott, of Carlton in Lindrick, Nottinghamshire, was turned away  from Keighley. They declined to claim compensation or redress, saying that winning their  point was sufficient reward. <p> <p> <p> <p> <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td  width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td  width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td  width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td  width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE  height=30 width=400 border=0><tr> <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A  HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td> <td  align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td> <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>James Meek</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>President Boris Yeltsin and his senior ministers, their authority in tatters, last night vowed to block any attempt to negotiate the  release of over 2,000 hostages, including new-born babies, children and pregnant women, held by heavily armed Chechen separatists in  a hospital in the small town of Kizlyar in Dagestan.  <p>  <p>"This time, nobody will walk out of there alive," said the interior minister, General Anatoli Kulikov, referring to previous  hostage-taking attacks by the Chechens. Troops encircling the town in the autonomous Russian republic would "exterminate the bandits",  he said, adding that a grave was ready and waiting for the 'Lone Wolf' Chechen group's leader, Salman Raduyev, aged 28.  <p>  <p>Last night the captors offered to release women and old people if Moscow gave in to some of their demands. Later it was reported  they had asked for buses to take them and about 300 hostages to Chechenia. Two hostages are reported to have been killed. Earlier a firefight with police left at least seven police and civilians dead.  <p>  <p>Speaking on Russian television after cameras were let into the hospital, Mr Raduyev was equally uncompromising, saying he was  prepared to fight to the death to rid Chechenia of Russian troops. "We are not at all concerned for our own lives... We have made an oath to our president that we will be kamikazes to the end and  carry out his orders... for the sake of our independence," Mr Raduyev said, referring to the Chechen separatist leader, Dzhokhar  Dudayev.  <p>  <p>The 'Lone Wolf' leader said he could order mortar fire on to the town, which is close to the Dagestan-Chechenia border. "We are ready  to conduct active military operations with any unit of the Russian army for a week. It will go on without end until the war in Chechenia  is over."  <p>  <p>"We just want this to end peacefully," one woman told the TV crew who filmed dozens of frightened captives.  <p>  <p>Kizlyar was sealed off last night. Interior ministry forces at police control posts leading to the town prevented all movement in and  out. There was no sound of fighting from the town itself. Local people said the fighting had begun in the early hours of yesterday morning. Abdukhallim Ramazomov, aged 37, who runs a shop  near the police post, said he heard heavy-calibre gunfire. He said people leaving the town told him they had seen many bodies lying in the  streets.  <p>  <p>Kizlyar is a multi-ethnic community including several hundred Chechen families.  <p>  <p>The nationalities minister, Vyascheslav Mikhailov, reinforced the government's tough line: "You don't talk to bandits. They are  maniacs, a collective Chikatilo (an infamous serial killer)." Mr Kulikov said Russia would start attacking all the rebel bases in the  Chechen mountains. Slipping past thousands of Russian troops, the group of more than 100 Chechens achieved complete surprise.  <p>  <p>They tried to seize a military airfield but were beaten back, after losing six of their men. Running battles with Russian troops spread  through the town as Chechens herded local residents into the hospital. Two men who refused to go were shot dead.  <p>  <p>Once in the hospital Mr Raduyev, a son-in-law of Mr Dudayev, demanded the withdrawal of Russian troops, saying he would kill 15  hostages for every fighter of his who died.  <p>  <p>Like Shamil Basayev, who walked free from a similar hostage-taking episode in the southern Russian town of Budyonnovsk last year,  Mr Raduyev claimed he had not originally intended to take hostages: "Our military diversion ended up in a slightly different direction,"  Mr Raduyev said. "There is a military base in Kizlyar and our mission was to destroy eight helicopters. We found three and destroyed  them and smashed the military base."  <p>  <p>A furious Mr Yeltsin delivered a humiliating public rebuke to his entire military ministerial team, also before the television cameras.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Chechen rebels hold 2,000 hostages in hospital siege</b><br><br><br><b><h2>11 January 1996</h2></b><br><h2>The hawks versus the 'Lone Wolf'</h2><h3> What exactly does Mr Yeltsin think he's up to in Chechenia?  </h3><br> 
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Leading article</b><br><br><br>      <p>Boris Yeltsin has been demanding more "explanations" over Chechenia from his generals. If he could explain what Russian policy has  been trying to achieve there over the past year, his outrage might be more convincing. At the end of December 1994, Mr Yeltsin  emerged from hospital to order a halt to bombing raids on civilian Chechen areas - resumed the next day when an orphanage was  destroyed. This time Russian forces have been on the receiving end, wholly outmanoeuvred in a daring raid staged by Chechen 'lone wolf'  fighters into the neighbouring republic of Dagestan. But the question remains: what is the Russian aim in Chechenia and is there the  slightest hope of it being achieved?  <p>  <p>The military accord signed in July, which provided for the withdrawal of Russian troops and the surrender of weapons by Chechen  fighters, was shaky from the start. The Chechen side was certainly not an innocent party: few weapons were surrendered and areas  vacated by the Russian army were re-occupied by local gunmen. The rebel leader Dzhokhar Dudayev is a dubious character whose  behaviour verges on the psychopathic. In a chilling interview which we published last month, conducted in a disused SS-22 silo, he  praised war as "a special art form" and predicted more terrorism against Russia. The people of Kizylar have discovered that he was not  joking. But the Russian army showed its impatience early on with the agreement. Civilians continued to die and there was little effort to  win hearts and minds. <p>  <p>After an assassination attempt in September on Mr Yeltsin's envoy, the Kremlin hawks appear to have persuaded  him that the military option should be resumed. Within weeks the defence and interior ministry forces were once again waging war  without effective political control by the President or authorisation by the Russian Duma. They have been singularly ineffective:  assassination attempts and ambushes have continued at regular intervals and the flow of body bags has resumed. <p>  <p>In December Mr Yeltsin  signalled a definitive end to seeking a negotiated solution by ordering elections for a new regional government in Chechenia to coincide  with the national parliamentary elections. This was an empty exercise, criticised as "premature" by the OSCE mission which was trying  to broker a deal. Even Moscow's own man in Chechenia, the former Communist Doku Zavgayev, was dubious at first. The elections set  off a new bout of fighting as rebels occupied the second largest city of Gudermes on the eve of a meaningless poll.  <p>  <p>The kinder view of Mr Yeltsin is that he has been unable to work out a consistent way of tackling an almost insuperable problem. The  darker interpretation, shared by quite a few Russians, is that renewed war in Chechenia may suit his purpose in a year of presidential  elections which he might prefer to see postponed.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

We do not care how we die," says the Chechen 'Lone Wolf' who has spread his  captives around the village of Pervomayskaya  </h2>
  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>James Meek</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>Salman Raduyev's eyes twinkled with good humour, unshakeable confidence in the rightness of his deeds on earth, and absolute  certainty of a martyr's honour, if need be, in heaven. <p>  <p>The Chechen rebel leader known as the 'Lone Wolf', whose motley band of fighters is holding the might of an outraged Russia at bay,  welcomed guests yesterday to the yard of the little house he has commandeered in this village like a proud local celebrity delighted by  the attention and feeling himself worthy of it. Two small children played nearby. Though some of the fighters around him wore black masks, his face was adorned only by his long red beard and his black woolly hat  wrapped in a green band bearing the Arabic words: 'There is no God but God, and Mohammed is his Prophet.'  <p>  <p>A few yards away lay a reminder that Mr Raduyev is bargaining with Russia for his life, the lives of his 150 fighters and the lives  of as many as 160 hostages. Covered in velvet cloth were the bodies of three of his men, killed in the fighting in the Dagestani town of  Kizlyar on Tuesday when his band seized the hospital and 2,000 captives.  <p>  <p>"If Russia does not want a peaceful outcome, we are ready," he said. "We are soldiers. We do not care how we die."  <p>  <p>President Boris Yeltsin, in Paris for the memorial service for Francois Mitterrand, made a conciliatory gesture, saying: "As soon as  they agree to not using weapons we will withdraw our troops. Only the police will remain to maintain public order."  <p>  <p>Russian helicopters bristling with guns and rockets clattered low over the village as Mr Raduyev spoke. In the snow-covered fields beyond, Russian armoured troop carriers dipped and reared in and out of irrigation ditches as they  struggled for vantage points before darkness fell. Yet even yesterday afternoon it was possible to walk unchallenged into Pervomayskaya along an open road.  <p>  <p>Mr Raduyev, son-in-law of the Chechen separatist leader General Dzhokhar Dudayev, said his group had originally planned to attack  the military airfield in Kizlyar, because they believed a large consignment of artillery rockets for use in Chechenia was to be unloaded  there.  <p>  <p>Taking the hospital was a reserve plan they put into effect when a number of fighters were badly wounded and needed surgery. The Chechens released most of their hospital captives on Wednesday morning after reaching, as they thought, a deal guaranteeing  them safe passage to Chechenia, after which they would release the rest. But according to Mr Raduyev the convoy of buses carrying them and their hostages, including an unspecified number of women and  children, was fired on with rockets from a Russian helicopter just as it was leaving Pervomayskaya, only a few hundred yards from the  Chechen border. The Chechens ordered the convoy to turn back and they quickly took over the village, capturing 37 interior ministry  soldiers and an arsenal of weapons. Most of the 500 or so villagers fled.  <p>  <p>The hostages have been dispersed among the village houses, making a successful attempt to free them by force virtually impossible.  Mr Raduyev said he was prepared to free the interior ministry troops and even return the weapons they had captured from them, but  would not leave Pervomayskaya without cast-iron guarantees of a safe passage back to the Chechen mountains. These guarantees would have to be living ones, he said - not just the hostages from Kizlyar but Russian officials, foreign journalists  and representatives of the Red Cross and Medecins sans Frontieres as human shields. He made no mention of a threat to begin shooting hostages.  <p>  <p>"We have proposed a solution. We don't want to destroy this village. We don't want the hostages to be hurt. We don't want Dagestan  to be drawn into the conflict. If they want to save the lives of these people, then they can, but we need hard guarantees."  <p>  <p>Mr Raduyev is very like his compatriot Shamil Basayev, who led the earlier Chechen hospital raid on Budyonnovsk last year: the  same bravado, the same joy in leading his men, the same easy flow of self-justifying, mythologising north Caucasian rhetoric.  <p>  <p>"We are ready to offer active opposition," he said. "Our situation is considerably more advantageous than the Russians': we hold the  village and they are in the open fields."  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Terry Venables announces he will quit</b><br><br><br><b><h2>11 January 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Venables quits to fight Sugar in  the courts  </h2>
  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>John Duncan</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>Terry Venables announced yesterday that he will quit as England coach after the 1996 European Championships to concentrate on his  legal fight with the Tottenham chairman, Alan Sugar.  <p>  <p>"The Football Association is deeply disappointed by his decision," said a terse statement read out by the FA spokesman, David  Davies, at a hastily arranged press conference yesterday, "but we understand the thinking behind it. Terry Venables faces a number of  time-consuming legal battles in the latter part of 1996 which he believes could interfere with England's efforts to qualify for the final  stages of the next World Cup. He is absolutely determined to clear his name."  <p>  <p>Venables confirmed the reasons for his departure last night, focusing on the October court case in which he is being sued by Sugar  over allegations in Venables's autobiography. The date of the case was switched to after Euro 96 in June after an appeal to Sugar by the  FA chairman, Sir Bert Millichip. "I felt that in the circumstances it would be better after Euro 96 when my contract comes to an end  that that would be it," said Venables yesterday. "I felt that what I've got ahead could be problematical. We would have a World Cup  qualifying game around October or November and I could be in court for several weeks.  <p>  <p>"I think it's maybe a bit of an embarrassment to the FA but in the circumstances I have made the decision and it gives them time to  get somebody else. I don't think it's possible at all to continue after Euro 96, though obviously I would want to leave the job on a  successful note." The FA said that Venables first told them of his decision in Birmingham on 16 December, the day before the draw for  the European Championship finals took place there. "He was urged to think again over the Christmas period and also while he was abroad  last week," said Mr Davies. "He told Graham Kelly [the FA chief executive] at lunchtime today that his decision was unchanged."  <p>  <p>Venables was given a two-year contract in 1994. He was an almost unanimous selection, but concerns were expressed at the time  that Venables's feud with the Tottenham chairman and the lingering allegations about his business affairs in two BBC Panorama  programmes would affect his ability to do the job.  <p>  <p>The FA are setting up a subcommittee today to appoint Venables's replacement, who is likely to be known before June's  championships. England are likely to start their World Cup qualifying campaign in early September. Venables's departure is a humiliating  blow for the FA who had hoped to start a new era of continuity with Venables as a starting point.  <p>  <p>"I have no comment to make. I don't want to talk about him," said Sugar from his Essex home last night.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Terry Venables announces he will quit</b><br><br><br><b><h2>11 January 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Venables spares  FA blushes</h2> <h3>Why the former Spurs manager gave himself no option but to stand down after the European  Championship  </h2>
 <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>David Lacey</b><br><br>      <p> <p>Terry Venables will quit as England coach after the European Championship in order to spend more time  with his lawyers, leaving the Football Association to reconsider the wisdom of appointing him in the first  place. There is also the small matter of finding someone to take over the squad for the next World Cup. <p>  <p>Having intimated to the FA before Christmas, and shortly before the draw for Euro 96 was made in Birmingham,  that he did not want to remain in charge of the England squad for the 1998 World Cup qualifiers, Venables has  now confirmed his departure. <p> <p>Last night he said he had decided to step down after the European  Championship to save the FA embarrassment. He confirmed that the weight of litigation had been behind the  decision. <p> <p>"I felt that in the circumstances what I've got ahead could be problematical," he said. "We  would have a World Cup qualifying game around October or November and I would be in court for several weeks. I  think it's maybe a bit of an embarrassment to the FA but in the circumstances I have made the decision and it  gives them time to get somebody else." He ruled out a change of heart, even if England were to win the European  Championship. "I don't think it's possible to continue after Euro 96," he added. "Obviously I would want to  leave the job on a successful note and I will do everything in my power to make it successful." <p> <p>Venables  felt that removing speculation about his England position would enable him to concentrate on the job in hand.  To the last he was pursued by querulous headlines, with some of yesterday's back pages suggesting that he was  about to challenge the FA to back him or sack him. In fact an extension to his present contract was never  seriously discussed. <p> <p>Kelly admitted that Venables's decision had not come as a total surprise. "It's sad  that a highly valued, highly regarded and very inventive football coach, who's done well, should feel it  necessary to reach the decision he has done," he said. <p> <p>Sad though the situation may be, it was  avoidable. The FA made itself a hostage to fortune when it gave Venables a 2.5-year contract two years ago  knowing that his legal dispute with the Tottenham chairman Alan Sugar, as well as a number of libel actions,  was still unresolved. Now fortune has claimed the ransom in spades. <p> <p>It is clear that after his courtroom  experiences so far, Venables realised he could not go into the next World Cup serving two benches - England  team and High Court. <p> <p>When questioned yesterday about the choice of Graham Taylor's successor, Kelly said  that anybody could apply hindsight, and he added: "The vast majority of you here today applauded the decision  at the time." From a footballing point of view that was true, but the doubts expressed about Venables's  problems off the field were considerable and, as events have proved, totally justified. <p> <p>Judgment on  Venables as England coach must be reserved until after the European Championship. It could be that on 30 June  Tony Adams will stride up the Bobby Moore steps at Wembley to receive the trophy while Venables walks quietly  towards the tunnel accompanied by strains of "Will ye no come back again?" <p> <p>So far, for a coach whose  team have won six games out of 14, lost one and drawn the rest, he has shown promise. Amid yesterday's official  panegyrics Kelly spoke warmly of the "progress which the England team and England's football in general have  made since his appointment". <p> <p>Really? So far as Venables's England team are concerned it has to be hoped  that the best is yet to come. As for English football in general, well, the recent performances in Europe have  hardly offered the prospect of a new golden age. <p> <p>The reality is that although Venables has been England  coach for two years there has been no competitive yardstick, apart from the Umbro Cup, by which his  international qualities can be judged. The European Championship will prove the point one way or the other. <p>  <p>Remembering how successful England were in the 1990 World Cup, which they entered knowing that Bobby Robson  was about to take a job with PSV Eindhoven, yesterday's news may even be the happiest English omen for Euro 96  so far. Venables, with nothing much to lose from a footballing point of view, may be all the better for it. <p>  <p>Players tend to be detached in these situations but those whose international careers he has enhanced may  feel the need to give him a decent send-off. <p> <p>As to the next England coach, who knows? The bookmakers  dusted off the familiar betting list once Venables's impending departure was confirmed, with Kevin Keegan at  the top followed by Bryan Robson, who is part of Venables's backroom team, Howard Wilkinson, Gerry Francis and  Ray Wilkins. Glenn Hoddle's credentials are bound to put him among the front runners as well. <p> <p>Whoever is  persuaded to take the job will surely need no reminding that running the England team is not merely a matter of  winning football matches and qualifying for the major tournaments. It also involves the ability to live with  intensive press coverage which ranges from the merely critical to the downright abusive - and, in Venables's  case, with a prolonged campaign of calumny experienced by none of his predecessors, not even Bobby Robson or  Graham Taylor. <p> <p> <p> <p> <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr> <td align=left valign=middle  width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td> <td  align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td> <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Terry Venables announces he will quit</b><br><br><br><b><h2>11 January 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Tel's red card</h2><h3>  How Terry Venables lost the game of being England's manager  </h2>
  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Richard Williams</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>He is going quietly, but this particular icon of the national life is not going prettily. There never was much of a chance that Terry  Venables would win his laurels and melt quietly into a bucolic retirement.  <p>  <p>The last man to bring off that concluding feat at the end of his stewardship of the England football team was Alf Ramsey, who  collected his knighthood for winning the 1966 World Cup but still would not let go of the job until failure to qualify for the 1974  tournament cost him the job. However, Ramsey's unique achievement 30 years ago had earned him a reputation that neither subsequent  defeats nor the adjustments of hindsight could imperil. If Venables takes England to victory in the European Championships on home soil  in June, he will be able to walk away a hero. But nothing in his two-year stewardship has made this seem anything but a remote dream.  Since Ramsey gave up, the successive regimes of Don Revie, Ron Greenwood, Bobby Robson and Graham Taylor have seen England drift  further and further down the league of nations. Under Venables they have sometimes barely managed to stay in the top 30 of the tables  produced each month by the international governing body. <p>  <p>When the Football Association cancelled the scheduled visit of Croatia to  Wembley last year, the stated reason - a shooting war - seemed less plausible than England's fear of humiliation at the feet of yet  another small nation with more skill and appetite for football than the players whose forefathers had taught the game to the world. Yet  Venables was the man who had been carefully chosen to change all that. Anxious at all costs to avoid the sort of mess left by the gauche  outsider Graham Taylor, the FA had been assiduous in canvassing opinion within the game. The people's choice may not always be the  right one but the pro's nod surely means something. And the view of active players and managers was that Venables fitted the bill.  <p>  <p>Few concerned observers outside the dressing rooms would have disagreed with the consensus of Venables's peers. He had been a  shrewd player and a canny coach; his gift for taking over and inspiring a squad - particularly of young players - had been demonstrated  in his successive stints at Crystal Palace, Queens Park Rangers and Tottenham Hotspur.  <p>  <p>Crucially, too, he was among the very few Englishmen to have succeeded as a club manager outside Britain: three years amid the  splendour of Barcelona's Nou Camp stadium had ensured that his horizons extended beyond Carrow Road and the Dell. There he had struck  up an enduring partnership with Gary Lineker, one of the very few England footballers of his generation to enjoy both the unqualified  respect of his contemporaries around the world and an untarnished moral standing within the game.  <p>  <p>When he accepted the FA's offer, Venables's ventures into unrelated fields - crooning, novel-writing, nightclub-owning - seemed to  be more or less out of his system, or at least contained. The ripples from the bitter row with Alan Sugar which saw him ejected from  the managership of Tottenham Hotspur in 1991 appeared to be receding. Yet, not for the first time in Venables's career, the timing  turned out to be wrong.  <p>  <p>The players, or at least those who established themselves as regular members of his England squad, loved him unquestioningly. He  spoke their language, which has changed little - too little, perhaps - since his own playing days. His tactics might have been wrong  sometimes, but he never asked seasoned professionals to do the sort of childish or outlandish training routines that had the players  shaking their heads and sniggering behind Taylor's back during the weekend get-togethers at Bisham Abbey. But eventually it became  clear that it was all, somehow, too late.  <p>  <p>Managers do not have to be either young men or distinguished former players to succeed at the highest level of international football.  The veteran Helmut Schoen, Ramsey's great West German rival, and the former physiotherapist Carlos Alberto Parreira, who  weathered a year-long blizzard of criticism before guiding Brazil to their fourth World Cup victory in 1994, are the proof that no  stereotype exists. But for each individual man, no matter how well qualified he might be for the job, the time has to be right.  <p>  <p>A Terry Venables in his late thirties, succeeding the disgraced Revie or the dismayed Greenwood, might have made England into a  formidable foe once more. Then he was streetwise and hungry. Now, although a Venables in his early fifties appears sharp and spry, and  cuts a convincing figure directing the practice-ground routines in an England strip, some element of mental elasticity has weakened.  <p>  <p>Drawing games against Norway, Romania, Uruguay, Sweden, Colombia and Portugal in the Wembley redoubt over the past two years,  Venables has seemed at a loss to generate sparks among his players. The occasional victory has been hailed as the new dawn, but since  his second fixture in charge Venables has never managed two wins in succession. Strangely, not once has his England team approached  the astonishing quality of football demonstrated by Taylor's team in the first half of a World Cup qualifying match against the  Netherlands at Wembley three years ago. And Venables has put his faith in many of the same players who shone that night, which makes  it even more puzzling that he should have been unable to lift them to a level of which they are clearly capable.  <p>  <p>Perhaps the signs were there in 1991, when he took Tottenham to the FA Cup Final, which they won after Paul Gascoigne's most  manic display of hypertension had thrown their opponents, Nottingham Forest, into confusion. Venables has quite correctly stuck by  Gascoigne, recognising in him England's one player of true genius and sympathising with his psychological problems, but has shown  himself no more capable than Dino Zoff at Lazio or Walter Smith at Glasgow Rangers of taming Gascoigne's furies and focusing his talent  when the chips are down in a big game. Nor has he been able to help Alan Shearer, his main striker, realise in an England shirt the  goal-scoring gift that made him the only Englishman to appear in the table of the world's top 70 players, announced this week after a  vote among the coaches of 95 national teams (Venables himself voted for two Italians and a German).  <p>  <p>But what condemned Venables in many eyes, or at least reduced his standing sufficiently to make a Venables-must-stay movement  difficult to conceive, were two factors.  <p>  <p>The first, and most delicate, was his apparent reluctance to allow the national team to reflect the ethnic balance of most English  league clubs in the mid-Nineties. Most Premiership teams now take the field with two, three, four, five or even six black players. Yet  since he dropped Paul Ince, who left Manchester United for Italy in the summer and has since failed to reproduce his best form, no black  player has been an established member of Venables's team. Almost 20 years since Viv Anderson became the first black to wear the  England shirt, Venables's refusal to give wholehearted backing to the talents of players such as Les Ferdinand, Andy Cole and Stan  Collymore has seemed to constitute a retrograde step, perhaps the result of age breeding a mistrust of mercurial flair and a  disinclination to deal with difficult temperaments when honest, uncomplaining journeymen are readily available.  <p>  <p>The second charge, closely related to the first, is that even if he has not actively encouraged the establishments of cliques, that is  the way it seems to some outsiders. Venables's Kensington club, Scribes West, is the haunt of certain players, agents and journalists  who enjoy the informal conviviality of an evening of champagne and karaoke. When some of those players make regular appearances in  his England squad, it is hard to avoid the unworthy suspicion that a certain amount of favouritism is going on. The episode of Dennis  Wise, who appeared in court on charges of assaulting a taxi driver while attempting to leave Scribes West one night, did nothing to  dispel the odour already clinging to the England coach as a result of his protracted battle with Alan Sugar.  <p>  <p>At least Venables can now be clear about the nature of his task. No longer need he detain himself with thoughts of leading a radical  restructuring of English football, based on a wholehearted admiration of the much admired system of youth development and tactical  training evolved by the Ajax club in Amsterdam. Between now and June, he need fear only the hooligans who forced the abandonment of  England's match in Dublin last year. He has five months in which to ensure that if England cannot win the European Championship, thereby  achieving their greatest hour of football glory since Bobby Moore lifted the Jules Rimet Trophy, at least they can compete without  disgracing themselves. For that small redemption, whatever the future may hold, he would earn the nation's lasting gratitude.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

  <br><br>      <p>The case of a 65-year-old heart attack victim who died after at least 10 hospitals were unable to find him an intensive care bed,  prompted a call for a government inquiry yesterday. The unnamed man died on Tuesday in Scarborough Hospital, North Yorkshire, after  staff 80 miles away at Bradford Royal Infirmary, where he was admitted after collapsing in a doctor's surgery, struggled for nearly  three hours to find him a bed. All five of BRI's beds were taken and calls to hospitals in Sheffield, Hull, Leeds and Wakefield failed to find  him a place.  <p>  <p>A spare bed was found in Scarborough where he was airlifted, but he died 20 minutes after being admitted.  <p>  <p>Labour health spokeswoman Harriet Harman yesterday wrote to the Health Secretary, Stephen Dorrell, demanding an inquiry. A  spokesman for Bradford Hospitals Trust said staff regretted what had happened and talks were under way with the health authority to  accelerate the provision of another &#163;125,000 for intensive care beds. The man's family was said to be full of praise for the efforts of  the two hospitals.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Lawrence Donegan</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>The Church of England delivers yet another blow to traditionalists but brings some relief to sinners today when it will announce that  hell should no longer be seen as a place of eternal torment.  <p>  <p>Senior clergymen say that "sadistical" views of hellfire and damnation, which have been passed down the generations, are wrong.  "Christians have professed appalling theologies which made God into a monster." The report, compiled by the Church's doctrine  commission and entitled 'The Mystery of Salvation', suggests that hell should not be seen as eternal damnation. It was the final and  irrevocable "choosing of that which is opposed to God so completely and so absolutely that the only end is total non-being... whether  there be any who do so choose, only God knows". The commission warns, however, that Christians cannot afford to ignore the reality of  final judgment.  <p>  <p>The church had to communicate its belief in a saving God. People had to be rescued from sin but, because society did not have a sense  of ultimate accountability, life no longer had any shape or meaning.  <p>  <p>"What is clear, as the century moves to a close, is that for many people in our culture there are not only no more divine certainties  but no more 'divine'." The commission also argues for greater account to be taken of the changes in society created by feminism when  attempts are made to define the sins people need saving from.  <p>  <p>"All the major branches of theology evolved in a context in which the dominant role of men passed for the most part unquestioned and  indeed unnoticed."  <p>  <p>Tom Wright, the dean of Lichfield and a member of the commission, said the report was an attempt to clear away Victorian ideas and  get back to the understandings of the early church.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Eric Griffiths</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>Hell is just to the south-west of Jerusalem. It is, as one reference-book quaintly puts it, "a deep and narrow glen", whose name in  the New Testament (Gehenna) means "the valley of Hinnom". It has long been notorious as a low dive. From the time of King Ahaz, it  seems, children were burned there as sacrifices by their parents to a god variously identified as Baal, Moloch or Yahweh. King Josiah  tried to stamp out the practice seven centuries before Christ but he failed. People found it as hard to give up burning then as some of us  now do to give up smoking. Jeremiah's God laments - a generation later - that the flames are still alight and fed with babies, "a thing I  never commanded, a thing that never entered my thoughts".  <p>  <p>Whether the fires of Gehenna never crossed God's mind because He was saving incineration up for eternity, preferring, like the  fathers of most families, to manage the barbecue Himself, is not clear. But it is clear and odd that human beings are reluctant to be  deprived of their old pictures of hell. Many cling to brimstone like children to a mangy toy whose appeal nobody else can fathom; they  accept no substitute, however gleaming, decent and up-to-date. Dr Johnson, for example, was rattled by the Reverend Dr Adams, who  appears to have been ahead of his time:  <p>  <p>Johnson: "As I cannot be sure that I have fulfilled the conditions on which salvation is granted, I am afraid I may be one of those who  shall be damned (looking dismally)."  <p>  <p>Adams: "What do you mean by damned?"  <p>  <p>Johnson: (passionately and loudly) "Sent to Hell, Sir, and punished everlastingly."  <p>  <p>Adams: "I don't believe that doctrine."  <p>  <p>Johnson spoke vehemently and, as he himself knew, that was always a sign he wasn't quite sure what he was saying. Would that all  hell-fire preachers had so keen an ear for the sound of their own raised voices.  <p>  <p>We should respect this loyalty to unpleasant teachings, if only because we should suspect our motives for abandoning them. When  Baudelaire said of George Sand that she had "every reason to wish to believe that hell does not exist", he spoke a truth about most of us.  We have a natural inclination to arrange our convictions for our own comfort. This inclination is sometimes dignified by the  philosophical-sounding term 'pragmatism'. Of course, that a teaching is unpleasant or awkward is not evidence of its truth either, but  this is so often forgotten that the heart warms to people like Professor Peter Geach. It is reported of him that, taking questions after a  lecture on hell, he replied to the objection "But you talk about hell as if it were a real place, like Australia", "All I can say is that it  seems to me more likely that I shall go to hell than that I'll ever go to Australia."   <p>  <p>Anyone who has ever said to a child, a colleague, someone loved and trusted, "you've gone too far this time" and meant it has believed in hell, if only for as long as it took to say the  words. Hell is at least a name for the irreparable, and the belief that a person might go to hell at least means that it is possible for  someone to do something which cannot be undone, healed or tidied away. God felt like this about the Israelites when they built the golden  calf: "And the Lord said unto Moses, I have seen this people and, behold, it is a stiffnecked people: Now therefore let me alone, that my  wrath may wax hot against them, and that I may consume them..." (Exodus 32:9-10). Fortunately, Moses was able to calm Him down.   <p>  <P>The trickiness hereabouts confronted Dickens at the ending of Great Expectations. The reader will remember that Pip and Estella meet  after many years, each of them a broken person with vivid memories of cruelties he or she has perpetrated and suffered. Dickens first  wrote an ending in which they were politely affectionate to each other but permanently severed. Under pressure from his friends, he  revised the last pages, throwing ambiguous shadow over the meeting, so that it is possible to think they forgive each other and their  selves, and are united. Neither ending wholly satisfies (which is why they are both such good last chapters) because we tend to  generalise from stories like this, and neither generalisation afforded by either version is wholly credible. If they can't overcome the  bitter past, the moral seems to be that reconciliation is sometimes impossible - "you've hurt me too much". And this is a harsh thought.  If they can put it all behind them and start afresh, the story seems to claim that this can always be done, the past always be dissolved,  not matter - "oh, it's nothing". The problems with the doctrine of hell write large the problems with the great expectations of  Christianity. (There are different problems with the afterlifes of other faiths.) <p>  <P>There have always been Christians who did not believe in  eternal punishment, even more distinguished ones than Dr Adams. The third century Church Father, Origen, had a beautiful notion with a  name to match: apocatastasis. His idea was that, at the end of the cosmos, all would be again as it had been at the beginning, everything  restored to God's delighted self-communing. Even the devil would participate in the final restoration. This is a restful thought. The  universe with all its years is like a stone dropped in a pool of godhead; the ripples self-efface, leave no trace behind when the divine  resumes its entire placidity. All would be, as May says of herself in Beckett's Footfalls, "as though she had never been, it never been".  <p>  <p>The snag is that such a thought might imply an "oh, it's nothing" attitude to all creation, and everything we do in it. Origen turns out  strangely to resemble John Maynard Keynes with his celebrated views about "the long run". The Catholic requiem for the dead contains  a line of extreme promise: Nil inultum remanebit - on the Last Day, it will appear that nothing in all of history, recorded or otherwise,  has been meaningless. Whereas, from Origen's account, it might seem that the whole business was a waste of time. The Church  disapproved, and in 1215 at the fourth Lateran council insisted on the reality of poenam perpetuam (everlasting punishment). We don't  know exactly what prompted the assembled bishops to this declaration. It can't have been the text of Scripture because they knew that  the word translated now as "everlasting" (aionios) does not always mean clearly "for ever" in those writings. Perhaps they had in mind  something like the view of the Protestant theologian, Paul Tillich, who remarked that hell existed so that we would not all be  frog-marched into heaven.  <p>  <p>Hell, that is, guarantees human freedom. It really is possible to defy God; He will not at the last haul us all back to Himself, by means  of a tagging-device we had not previously noticed attached to ourselves, erase our rebellions, however hard we tried to rebel, and call  us His little rascals. We go, finally, where we want to go; there are those who would not feel at home in heaven. If hell is not open to us,  we are puppets. This is a striking thought but, like other guarantees, it is as well to squint carefully at it.  <p>  <p>Cardinal Newman, with his usual sharp eye for where the hardest puzzles lie, wrote that "the great mystery is not that evil should  have no end, but that it had a beginning". Why God made us free, that is the question. The possible consequences of this alleged freedom  do not bear thinking about. Orthodox teaching comes over loud and clear, or loud at any rate: "Those who have responded to the love and  compassion of God will go into eternal life. Those who have refused them to the end will be consigned to the fire that is never  extinguished." (Paul VI, Solemni hac liturgia, 1968). It may still be asked what "responded" and "refused" and "to the end" mean. And  this is a genuine asking, distinct from speculative fretting about the temperature in hell, because such responses and refusals simply  make up the actuality of our lives now.  <p>  <p>The New Catechism of the Dutch Catholic Church tells us that "to be lost [ie, damned] means to be entirely closed in on oneself,  without contact with others or with God." But that's paradise for some - a night in, with a couple of videos, a bottle of wine (or a joint),  and the phone off the hook. It is a mark of what Donald MacKinnon called "the pathetic intellectual (and spiritual) naivety of the clerical  mind" that it tries to explain hell to our world as an eternity of selfishness without seeing that it needs first to spell out the pains of  selfishness. Has even Mr Blair, as he goes to and fro in the earth proclaiming community, thought how to bring alive a picture of hell  such as Hopkins's: "The understanding open wide like an eye, towards truth in God, towards light, is confronted by that act of its own,  which blotted out God and so put blackness in the place of light. Against these acts of its own the lost spirit dashes itself like a caged  bear and is in prison, violently instresses them and burns, stares into them and is the deeper darkened"?  <p>  <p>As for 'The Mystery of Salvation' as understood by the Doctrine Commission of the Church of England, it is a document remarkable  only in that, as the Bishop of Newcastle announces, with some pride and no little surprise, it "has the unanimous support of all the  members of the Commission". Unanimity is certainly "News from the Church of England", as the press release has it. There is the  familiar whinging about the modern world and "the absence of any generally accepted diagnosis of the needs of humanity, let alone a  commonly agreed religious framework for meeting them" - when, exactly, was the world agreed about its own needs, its religious  framework? Not in the days of the martyrs. There is the equally familiar selfcongratulation: "The rise of the welfare state enhanced  sensitivity to all forms of discrimination. I find it hard to believe that such intelligent men as the Anglican Bishops of Basingstoke and  Monmouth wholeheartedly supported these sayings. There is an even more familiar, indeed hallowed, paltering about the sane and lovely  doctrine of purgatory, though Article XXII of the Church of England condemns it as "repugnant to the Word of God".  <p>  <p>Elsewhere in the report, Macbeth at his most despairing is quoted as a reliable witness to the meaning of life, and Dante is  completely misrepresented (Judas, Brutus and Cassius are not in the depths of hell because they were "betrayers of their friends" but  because they committed treason against their rightful lords).  <p>  <p>The members of this commission are against death. This is the shocking thing, not what they say about hell. They think we live in "a  world marked by an ultimate futility, for the universe as we know it will sooner or later die"; in their unanimous opinion, "human hopes,  human aspirations, and human achievements, the thirst for eternity and immortality, are mocked by death". Yet human beings are not  thwarted by mortality any more than fish drown in water, though it takes us longer to get used to our native element (but then we are  so slow to learn everything that appertains to us as creatures). Simone Weil: "Everything which is threatened by time secretes  falsehood in order not to die, and in proportion to the danger it is in of dying. That is why there is not any love of truth without an  unconditional acceptance of death."  <p>  <p>Those who wish seriously to think about hell, and they cannot be many, would do better to read Primo Levi's honest book about  Auschwitz, 'If This is a Man': "This is hell. A huge empty room: we are tired, standing on our feet, with a tap which drips while we  cannot drink the water, and we wait for something which will certainly be terrible, and nothing happens and nothing continues to happen.  What can one think about? One cannot think any more, it is like being already dead."  <p>  <p>Eric Griffiths, a Fellow of Trinity College Cambridge, is currently editing a collection of English translations of Dante.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Alan Travis</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>'Annette', the Holloway prisoner kept in chains while in hospital to give birth, may sue the Home Secretary. She is expected to meet supporters and legal advisers today to decide whether to launch a legal action against Michael Howard.  <p>  <p>Annette's supporters believe that her letters describing the humiliation and misery she suffered during her pregnancy give strong grounds for launching a case for assault and battery - or for "degrading and inhumane punishment" in the European courts. One avenue being explored is for her to sue Mr Howard for personal injury compensation.  <p>  <p>Simon Creighton, spokesman for the Prisoners' Advice Service said that based on the published evidence there could be several courses of legal action open to her.  <p>  <p>The Prison Reform Trust said it knew of three other recent cases in which seriously ill Holloway prisoners were chained during hospital visits. One woman was receiving chemotherapy for cancer, the second had dysentery and the third pleurisy.  <p>  <p>A Prison Service spokeswoman said a risk assessment was carried out on all prisoners before hospital treatment. It determined whether they went with only an escort and whether they needed to be chained or handcuffed. In all cases restraints were removed once treatment began. She said a prisoner receiving chemotherapy recently escaped with help from an armed accomplice.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Case against Princess Anne's stalker</b><br><br><br><b><h2>13 January 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Court dismisses case against royal 'stalker'  </h2>
  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Edward Pilkington</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>The man accused of stalking the Princess Royal was cleared by a magistrate in Liverpool yesterday of behaving in a way likely to cause a breach of the peace after he sought on Thursday night to talk to the princess during her visit to the city.  <p>  <p>Bernard Quinn, aged 53, was cleared after the magistrate, Paul Firth, accepted the defence argument that there was no case to answer. Mr Firth ruled that he could not be satisfied that violence would have resulted from the defendant's behaviour.  <p>  <p>Mr Quinn was arrested in Liverpool and held overnight on Thursday having been spotted by police outside St Nicholas Church shortly before Princess Anne arrived. He told police officers that he had come to test security arrangements on her behalf.  <p>  <p>Detective Constable Albert Howard-Murphy told the court that Mr Quinn had spoken of his feelings for the princess while being held at Liverpool police station. "He told me in the past he had entertained sexual fantasies about the Princess Royal and had been involved in a motor car crash after imagining a session of sex with the Princess Royal."  <p>  <p>Mr Quinn had added that since the crash his emotions towards her had changed into "a very deep admiration".  <p>  <p>The defendant, from Weston-super-Mare, has been following the princess around the country and has reportedly sent her a stream of love letters. Security around the princess has been stepped up as a result. During the hearing Mr Quinn denied the charge, insisting he had never intended a breach of the peace.  <p>  <p>James Higgins, a psychiatrist called as an expert witness, said the defendant was suffering from chronic mental illness, probably schizophrenia, and could suffer delusions and hallucinations.  <p>  <p>"I suspect his attentions cause distress to the Princess Royal, but I don't think he poses any physical risk to her," said Dr Higgins.  <p>  <p>After the case, Mr Quinn said: "I'm glad it's all over. I just want to get on with my life."  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Music industry launches 'Rock the Vote'</b><br><br><br><b><h2>15 January 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Rocking the young into vote awareness  </h2>
  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Alex Bellos</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>Pop bands, record companies and nightclubs are supporting a high-profile drive to get more young people to vote, in a campaign with the potential to be a big electoral gift to the Labour Party.  <p>  <p>Rock the Vote aims to copy the US campaign of the same name, which registered 350,000 new voters for the 1992 election and helped reverse a 20-year trend of declining political participation among 18 to 24-year-olds. Rock the Vote UK will enlist the help of pop stars to promote awareness of politics and aims to culminate in a Band Aid-style concert in the run-up to the next election. Blur's lead singer, Damon Albarn, is the biggest name so far to pledge support.  <p>  <p>Adverts in youth magazines and on television will encourage young people to register and then use their vote. They will try to combat a disillusionment with British politics which resulted in 40 per cent of 18 to 25-year-olds not voting at the last election - either because of non-registration or apathy - compared with about 22 per cent of the population as a whole. "There is a sense in which young people are not as involved in the political process as they should be. Getting them to register to vote and use that vote is a basic democratic right. Anything that makes them do that is worth having a stab at," said John Preston, chairman of BMG records, who is on the Rock the Vote board.  <p>  <p>He is aware the campaign needs to attract politically active young people who have abandoned the established two-party system and concentrate on 'single issues' such as the environment and civil or animal rights. Mr Preston said: "Single issue politics may be more exciting and more emotional but in terms of getting to grips with how the country is run, that is exercised through your vote."  <p>  <p>To be launched the day before the televised Brit awards ceremony next month, Rock the Vote's first PR stunt is to get the winning acts to mention the campaign as they accept their prizes.  <p>  <p>BMG is the first major record company to back the campaign, although several others are expected to join.  <p>  <p>Ministry of Sound, one of the country's 'superclubs', is organising a campaign under the Rock the Vote umbrella, which has already raised &#163;50,000. The London club is printing 200,000 flyers telling people how to register to vote and will chase up non-registered people on its 30,000 name database.  <p>  <p>Rock the Vote will be urging record companies to put stickers on all CDs and urging retailers to have in-store promotions. Pop stars will be urged to talk about it on tour. "The bandwagon will start rolling very soon and hopefully it will grow and grow as people realise it is a very important thing to support," said board member Charles Stewart-Smith, director of PR firm Luther Pendragon.  <p>  <p>The campaign is endorsed by the three largest political parties, as none can be seen to discourage political participation, and a Conservative, the former MP Matthew Parris, is on the board. But Labour is likely to be the main beneficiary. Polls show young people are more likely to sympathise with the left, and pop stars, if political, have traditionally leant that way. Mr Stewart-Smith said: "The music industry has no interest in being seen as partisan and loathed by Conservatives. We know we cannot stop pop stars using us as a platform to espouse their political views, but by asking and getting the support of all parties we have acted responsibly in not taking sides.  <p>  <p>"According to polls, 25 per cent of young people have not decided who to vote for. The idea is to raise the profile of young people. It will then be up to the parties to decide how they make use of that profile by having policies that win them over."  <p>  <p>In the US, Rock the Vote was founded in 1990 by members of the music industry as an action group against the threat of Republican-backed censorship of contentious lyrics. It quickly grew into a registration drive and has since become a more general public education campaign, enlisting the help of stars such as REM, Lenny Kravitz and Tom Cruise. An anti-piracy clampdown announced by President Clinton soon after his inauguration was seen as a thank-you to the music industry for recruiting voters. UK record companies are keen to be taken more seriously in Westminster, and have been considering forming something like Rock the Vote for 18 months.   <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Music industry launches 'Rock the Vote'</b><br><br><br><b><h2>19 January 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Don't rock the vote </h2>
<h3>A new campaign using pop stars to urge young people to vote forgets one thing - pop and politics don't mix  </h2>
  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Pat Kane</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>The florid men in unadventurous suits are at it again: trying to use rock music to grab the youth vote. Except this time, it's  'apolitical' - supposedly.  <p>  <p>Rock The Vote is a new organisation which, according to campaign organiser Charles Stewart-Smith, is aimed at "encouraging young  people to participate in the process of parliamentary democracy". Blessed with cross-party endorsement, and with a budget of  &#163;1m to spend, Rock The Vote is promising a media blitz (star supporters, videos and billboards, a mega-concert) all to one end -  persuading 5.2 million 18 to 24-year-olds that they should get on the electoral register over the coming months, and then actually tick  the box (any box) on the day of the General Election. For those wearied by the regular calls-to-arms of political pop over the last 20  years - from Rock Against Racism in the Seventies, to War Child in the Nineties - Rock The Vote's ambitions have an initially appealing  modesty.  <p>  <p>They also have a successful precedent: a drive in the US - supported by MTV, and enlisting the services of Madonna, REM and Pearl  Jam - managed to boost youth participation in the 1992 presidential elections from 37 to 43 per cent.  <p>  <p>So will Rock The Vote treat us to the sight of Liam Gallagher's hairy arse wrapped in a Union Jack, as he growls over his shoulder,  "you fookers berra vote". That would add to the general gaiety.  <p>  <p>But let's cut to the chase here. Like its American predecessor, the essence of 'rocking the vote' is to help elect the opposition party  to power - whether Clinton's Democrats in 1992, or Blair's New Labour sometime soon. As the Financial Times kindly pointed out,  Clinton's victory forged a very close relationship between the US music business and the Administration, which has been particularly  supportive of the industry's anti-piracy stance. Given Blair's vigorous schmoozing of the rock establishment recently - addressing  British Phonographic Industry AGMs, popping up at Bowie concerts and Q Awards - we can suspect a similar unwritten pact here. (Rock  The Vote's chairman, John Preston, is president of the BPI and a close friend of Tony Blair.) But there's more to this than subtle  industrial lobbying. In the vicious battles for the middle-classes that will stamp the forthcoming General Election, a rogue million or two  either way will count. The first-time youth vote thus becomes a crucial factor. With current Mori polls showing that 60 per cent of 18  to 24 year-olds support Labour, you would have thought Walworth Road would simply make its pitch directly. But the awkward debacle  of Red Wedge - a desperate Kinnock joshing with a po-faced Weller over cups of tea in the House of Commons - will be a cautionary throb  in the party's collective memory.  <p>  <p>So Labour's route to those essential millions has to be indirect. The single-issue agendas that dominate youth politics - militant  environmentalism, the freedom to rave, drugs decriminalisation - are clearly emancipatory and collectivist. Yet party politics,  including Labour's, tend to bounce off their semi-legal surfaces.  <p>  <p>Rock The Vote portrays itself as an attempt to make a lost generation into basically functioning citizens again, before any particular  party can make its appeal. But the hope of its thinly disguised Blairite organisers must be that some youthful idealism will infuse these  newly responsible citizens, which may translate into an anti-Government vote.  <p>  <p>It's a forlorn hope. The complexities of what pop music does to its listeners far surpasses the identification model implied by Blair'n'  Bowie'n'Blur: that politicians (or even the political process) being endorsed by pop stars means their fans will do the same. Wrong,  wrong, wrong. Pop isn't just a separate entity from politics, which connects and then separates: pop is a kind of politics in itself - a  way to be an active, empowered subject in a deadening, objectifying modern society. And that power comes from the way that pop  makes concrete our desires, expands and sometimes explodes our range of pleasures and intensities.  <p>  <p>Would that the parliamentary democratic process were as sexy, as surreal, as sensuous as pop music! But it ain't, and never will be:  the power of pop and the power of traditional politics pull in two completely opposed directions. You could, I suppose, invoke the  passionate furies of nationalism - Britpop for a new Britain, and so forth - but that's probably a genie best left uncorked.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Buddhist monk admits to murder of Jo Masheder</b><br><br><br><b><h2>15 January 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Thai monk admits killing Briton</h2><h3>Woman's murder highlights dangers of backpacker tourism  </h2>
  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Nick Cumming-bruce</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>A Buddhist monk confessed yesterday to murdering Johanne Masheder from Wincle, Cheshire. Police found her body hidden in a cave near a temple at one of Thailand's most popular tourist destinations.  <p>  <p>The 23-year-old's decomposed remains had been identified earlier in the day by her father, Stuart, who had flown to Thailand with his wife, Jackie, to search for her. Ms Masheder had been missing since failing to catch a flight back to Britain on December 21 at the end of a four-month journey around the world.  <p>  <p>She is the third Briton to have been found murdered abroad already this year - heightening concerns about the safety of backpacker tourism. In Thailand itself, the killing has focused attention on the less-than-saintly behaviour of some Buddhist monks.  <p>  <p>Thai police yesterday charged Yodchat Suapoo, aged 21, with Ms Masheder's murder after he had admitted robbing her of a camera and &#163;15 in cash. Suapoo, who lived in a monastery in the western town of Kanchanaburi, had confessed to hitting Ms Masheder on the head and pushing her over the edge of a ravine, but denied sexual assault.  <p>  <p>A local police officer, Lieutenant-Colonel Apichit Thianpermpool, said Suapoo was an amphetamine addict who used the stolen money to buy drugs, and had previously spent two years in jail for rape. He had joined the monastery eight months earlier, after his release.  <p>  <p>Kanchanaburi is a tourist destination close to the railway built by Allied prisoners during the second world war.  <p>  <p>Forensic tests suggested Ms Masheder had been dead for several weeks. The motorbike she had rented lay in tall grass nearby. Her body was sent to Bangkok for a post mortem.  <p>  <p>A newly-qualified solicitor, Ms Masheder had been on the final stage of a backpacking holiday which took in Canada, Fiji, Australia and New Zealand, and was due to take up her first job with a London law firm early this year. She last telephoned her family from the northern city of Chiang Mai on 7 December before heading south.  <p>  <p>The discovery of Ms Masheder's body ends an intensive search by police and her father, who had combed beach resorts putting up posters carrying her photograph.  <p>  <p>Although Buddhist monks live austere, celibate lives which prohibit them from killing any living thing and ban contact with women, there have been several scandals. In February last year a prominent monk, Phra Yantra, was accused of seducing a nun and fathering a child by a Thai woman. The dangers of travelling in parts of Asia were highlighted last week when a man from Oxfordshire was found dead in Bangalore, southern India. However, according to Foreign Office figures, the most dangerous destinations for British tourists over the last five years have been the United States, South Africa and Spain.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Imogen O'rourke</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>Since the first reports of Jo Masheder's disappearance last month, The Lonely Planet's London office has been inundated with calls  from anxious parents and travellers. Their advice is: be sensitive to local culture and don't show too much flesh; avoid troubled areas  and travelling alone at night; if your guest house is cheap, make sure it is secure; don't accept lifts from strangers or unofficial taxis.  <p>  <p>Travelling is about living on your wits, never knowing what's around the corner. Three women offer some salutary stories.  <p>  <p>  <p><b>Gay, 25, writer</b>  <p>  <p>The Independence weekend in Malawi had taken me completely by surprise. I hadn't been able to change money for four days. But I  managed to hail a sugar truck going to Selima Bay, where I was meeting my travelling companion Georgia, and I piled in the back with  men, women, sheep and goats. Many villages later, I was the only one left in the back. The two drivers told me they had to stop at the  sugar cane factory to load up. I was dropped outside the gates and the truck drove on, with my rucksack. It was mid-afternoon and I was  stuck in the middle of nowhere. By the time they returned, four hours later, it was dark. I realised now that my position was extremely  precarious.  <p>  <p>They invited me into the front of the cab and offered to buy me dinner at the next village. I was starving. I made cheerful enough  conversation over mealie meal while they drank Chebooka, a highly toxic maize drink. The older driver kept putting his arm around me  and saying: "Don't worry, I'll take you" which made me feel even more uneasy.  <p>  <p>His driving got progressively worse as he smoked Malawi weed. I knew we were never going to make it to Selima. Around midnight,  the driver's apprentice started putting his hand down my back. I kept replacing it on his knee and asking about his wife and family. I just  wanted to be safe on the side of the road.  <p>  <p>This carried on for what seemed like hours, until the men swapped seats. I managed to stall the older man's advances by persuading  him that I was married. As long as I could control him, the other was no threat. It wasn't long, however, before he fell asleep. I  prepared for the worst. Finally it happened. At 2am, the driver stopped, wound up the windows, locked both doors and cut the lights. I  could feel his acidic breath on my face and he laughed. At that moment, I brought a Coke bottle down on his head and was able to lean  over, unlock the door and propel myself so that I, the other man and my rucksack tumbled out. I ran until I found a ditch to hide in. The  men looked for 10 minutes, then drove off.  <p>  <p>I put my tent over my head and fell asleep, and woke up the next day in the middle of a village.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p><b>Jo, 23, student</b>  <p>  <p>I knew it was going to be a dodgy bus ride when a Turk, who spoke perfect English, befriended my boyfriend and I, offered to buy us  supper, then told us not to worry if we ever got taken hostage by the Kurds, because they'd treat us well.  <p>  <p>We had been warned about the hostage-taking in Eastern Turkey but had dismissed it and carried on. In the middle of the night, the bus  stopped suddenly at a roadblock and heavily armed soldiers got on and filed us off the bus to check our passports. We were separated.  <p>  <p>The next moment, we were being frogmarched up a hill. We were marched in military line for hours, too terrified to ask questions,  until we reached sand and heard shells dropping in the distance. This was a war zone. The guards stopped and offered us cigarettes, and I  saw how young they were. Later, they shared their supper with us and tried to communicate. When they heard we were from  Manchester, they were ecstatic and shook our hands and chattered about football and United.  <p>  <p>The first morning, lying in hiding, I asked were they going to shoot us. They shook their heads and said: "No, no problem... John  Major". We were political hostages for the Kurd freedom fighters and could have been held for months - but a Turkish ambush saved us.  At midday, shells came flying out of nowhere. The guards ran away, but the United enthusiast turned to us and said: "Go, go!" The  Afghani hostages who were with us said we were now free, but we couldn't escape because the Turks didn't know we were there. We  were sitting in this desert ditch for four hours with no water, under fire. I thought simply: "I am going to die". Then the Afghanis  suddenly made a break for Turkish lines. They saved our lives.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p><b>Teresa, 24, saleswoman</b>  <p>  <p>It was the first time I'd been abroad and I haven't been since. I was 19 and my boyfriend Andy and I went on a tour of America. We  were pretty gullible and didn't have much money, so hitched around and relied on people's hospitality.  <p>  <p>We were marching along the highway towards Manhattan when a man pulled up and offered us a ride into town. I didn't like his face  and said: "No thanks. We like walking." Half an hour later, the same man pulled over again. By this time it was pouring with rain. He said  he felt sorry for us and pleaded with us to get out of the wet. We were in no state to argue. We got chatting in the car - it seemed we  had misjudged him - and we accepted his invitation to stay in his apartment. That night, we sat up talking and drinking beer. His wife had  left him and I felt sorry for him. Then a couple of hours into the conversation, he turned weird. He started prying into our relationship,  asking personal questions. We didn't know what to do.  <p>  <p>Then he turned ugly, calling us fucking tourists and making sexual innuendos. We got up to leave. He said he had locked all the doors  and windows, and then he pulled a gun to my head. It happened so fast. The next 22 hours were the worst of my life. He made us do  horrific things to each other - things I prefer not to remember - treating us like performing animals. He said he was going to kill us.  Andy was a wreck. I was scared at first, but strangely, as he grew tired, I was filled with an inner strength. I thought about my parents  and my friends back home, and I knew that I had to make this man see me as a human being, not a piece of meat. So I started telling him  about my family in Liverpool, my ambitions - everything I could think of. I talked for hours and hours, trying to persuade him that he  didn't really want to hurt us.

  <br><br>      <p>Devon Malcolm has launched a scathing attack on Ray Illingworth, England's chairman of selectors, accusing him of destroying his confidence during the South Africa tour. Malcolm claims in the Daily Express that he was verbally abused and humiliated by Illingworth and would have packed his bags if his team-mates had not dissuaded him.  <p>  <p>The fast bowler, now home in Derbyshire, claims Illingworth swore at him and ordered him to leave the nets on Christmas Day. Earlier in the tour Illingworth and the bowling coach Peter Lever tried to get him to change his action. He was accused of having "no cricket brain".  <p>  <p>"I have to ask: would this have happened if I had been a white bowler?" he says.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

  <br><br>      <p>Devon Malcolm yesterday denied that his dispute with Ray Illingworth had anything to do with colour.  The England fast bowler had created a furore on Monday by suggesting that race might have accounted for his supposed ill-treatment by the England chairman. Yesterday his solicitors issued a statement: "Recent media comment has suggested that Devon Malcolm has accused the tour management of discriminating against him because of his colour.  <p>  <p>"Mr Malcolm has asked us to clarify his position. He has not alleged that either the TCCB or the tour management discriminated against him on account of race but felt that he had been treated harshly on tour.  Devon Malcolm's reference to colour, as reported, was in the context of his trying to understand the reasons for his treatment and was one of several reasons considered by him.  He hopes that a post-tour analysis will reveal the reasons for his treatment."  <p>  <p>Illingworth said that he did not think the England team had been unsettled by the fuss. "The only person that has been affected is me, and I am very upset about it. But I have spoken with Lord's and I am sure they will take the necessary action."  <p>  <p>Derbyshire entered the controversy last night when the club's members voted unanimously at their annual general meeting in Derby to send a message of support to Malcolm.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Devon Malcolm race row with Ray Illingworth</b><br><br><br><b><h2>19 January 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Illy back on the attack   </h2>
  <br><br>      <p>Having seen off Devon Malcolm, Ray Illingworth yesterday turned his fire on more traditional foes: the men in charge of county  cricket.  <p>  <p>England's outspoken chairman of selectors has long advocated structural change in the domestic game, favouring a two-divisional  championship, and he believes that counties do not do enough to produce new cricketers. "The bottom line is that we are at a pretty low  ebb for talent in England," he said. "The counties are just not producing young players of the calibre of, say, Shaun Pollock. I believe the  counties have to look at themselves. People say the game has improved but I don't think it has.  <p>  <p>"The counties have to bring on some decent players, then I can select them." His trenchant views found little support among the  county hierarchy, with Warwickshire's chief executive Dennis Amiss saying he was "disappointed" by the remarks and Lancashire also  offering a stern defence of their youth policy.  <p>  <p>Illingworth is particularly concerned about the dearth of promising young bowlers, and since arriving in South Africa he has admired  the development of Pollock and Paul Adams. England, by contrast, have only the emergence of Dominic Cork to show for 1995.  <p>  <p>"I have been pushing for a two-division championship for 20 years. That's a long time, and I'm getting tired of it now. There are too  many arguments around against it from non-cricketing sources.  <p>  <p>"I read recently that Northamptonshire members said they would rather see their own team win than England win. I think counties  have got to put their own houses in order and start producing cricketers for England. I am not in favour of a national academy for young  players. That would just not work because you would never get counties agreeing on when to release players. What we should have is 18  academies, one at each first-class county."  <p>  <p>Illingworth also bemoaned his side's general lack of professionalism. Amiss was quick to distance himself from the criticism. "It's  disappointing to hear comments like that because we don't feel we could be doing more to produce good cricketers for Warwickshire and  England," he said. "At Edgbaston we have an annual budget of between &#163;100,000 and &#163;150,000 for youth development.  Last winter we went into 100 primary schools and this year we are going into another 100.  <p>  <p>"Obviously our aim is to find players and be successful as a county, but there is a knock-on effect in that the best players could  become successful for England."  <p>  <p>* Shane Warne took two wickets in a miserly 10 overs to help Australia beat Sri Lanka by 18 runs in the opening match of the World  Series final in Melbourne. Chasing Australia's 201 for seven, Sri Lanka got off to a promising start but lost their way in the middle  order when six wickets went down for 25 runs.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Helena Smith</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>The Greek prime minister, Andreas Papandreou, who has been critically ill in hospital since November, finally announced his  resignation last night and urged that a successor be chosen as quickly as possible.  <p>  <p>In a brief letter addressed to the central committee of his Panhellenic Socialist Party (Pasok), Mr Papandreou, aged 76, said a  speedy choice was important for the stability of the country.  <p>  <p>"It is obvious the country cannot remain incapacitated by my illness. The parliamentary group should proceed immediately with the  election of a prime minister because the country's problems cannot wait," the veteran politician said.  <p>  <p>The favourites are the United States-educated defence minister, Gerasimos Arsenis, a Papandreou loyalist, and the former industry  minister, Costas Simitis, a reformist moderate. Like Mr Papandreou, both are economists. Mr Papandreou is still on life support  machines, although his chances of recovery are reported to have increased to 80 per cent.  <p>  <p>Mr Papandreou was re-elected for a third term two years ago. His autocratic leadership, which saw challengers immediately  dismissed, was directly linked to his refusal to name a successor despite his increasing frailty. In recent weeks, he had come under  increasing pressure to hand over power, as fears for political and economic stability grew.  <p>  <p>Pasok's parliamentary party will meet tomorrow to begin selecting a new prime minister. Under Greek law, they have three days to  do so.   <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

 <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Helena  Smith</b><br><br>      <p> <p>Andreas Papandreou, who resigned as Greece's prime minister last night, has dominated  the Greek political scene for the last 30 years and carved out a new role for the country in  Europe. <p> <p>He introduced popular socialism to Greece, turning his Panhellenic Socialist  Movement (Pasok) into the country's main political force. He founded the party on the ruins of  the Colonels' regime, which collapsed in 1974, and came to power in seven years as Greece's  first socialist leader. His first Pasok government was widely hailed as healer of the country's  bitter divide in the aftermath of its brutal 1946-49 civil war. Mr Papandreou was a dynamic  figure with his unique brand of international socialism. He had a difficult relationship with  Nato but held back from taking Greece out of the alliance. He irritated the United States by  forging close links with Middle East radicals, including the Libyan leader, Colonel Muammar  Gadafy. <p> <p>His resignation marks the end of a political era. Few leaders have ever been as  loved or loathed as Mr Papandreou, who could captivate Greeks as much with his brilliant  oratory as his highly public extra-marital affairs. His first name has become a household word  in Greece - unlike his father, George, who was also prime minister, or any of his colleagues.  Mr Papandreou made a spectacular comeback in October, 1993, when he was returned to office for  a third term. His re-election, following a humiliating defeat in 1989 amid scandals which left  him tarnished as the only civilian leader to be accused of wrongdoing, cast him as Greece's  eternal comeback man. <p> <p>But the dramatic decline in his health since the Socialists'  return to power and his steadfast refusal to delegate powers - until his resignation decision  last night - meant that vital government decisions were put on hold. <p> <p>During his months  in hospital, Mr Papandreou, aged 76, came under fire within Pasok for his failure to appoint a  successor and over the role of his controversial third wife, Dimitra Liani, whom he made his  chief of staff. A former stewardess 36 years his junior, Ms Liani was heavily accused of  meddling in government affairs by socialist ministers. <p> <p>Her husband's initial stubborn  refusal to nominate a successor as prime minister and leader of the party he ruled with an iron  grip, sparked a fierce behind-the-scenes battle for the Papandreou mantle. <p> <p>A master  tactician, Mr Papandreou was one of Greece's most maverick politicians and probably the last of  Europe's post-war charismatic leaders. Even his battle to hang on to life has become a  thriller, with the veteran politician miraculously cheating death several times in the heart  hospital's intensive care ward. <p> <p>None of the heirs now jockeying for his job can boast  his extraordinary colour or flair. "I was," he told the Guardian shortly before being narrowly  acquitted of masterminding the multi-million dollar looting at the Bank of Crete, "never a  'yes-man'." <p> <p>Pasok was a one-man movement built around its leader. It exuded the cult of  personality. But by cannily mixing autocratic leadership with sheer unpredictability, Mr  Papandreou managed, often against the odds, to unite its disparate groups of Marxists, social  democrats and reform-minded pro-Europeans. While sweeping to power on a platform of  change, he soon abandoned his anti-European and anti-American rhetoric to become a staunch  defender of his allies and fiscally conservative in the late 1980s. <p> <p>His long hospital  fight has quickly highlighted the fault lines in the ruling party. As pretenders have openly  fought to assume his mantle, the rival factions have become ever more apparent. With  infighting now a major party hallmark, few believe that Pasok will be able to survive as an  entity now. <p> <p>"There is a growing feeling that the socialists are not going to be able to  complete their four-year term in office," said Dimitris Dimitrakos, who teaches political  science at Athens University. "Infighting is such that at some point they are bound to split  over the issue of a successor." Under the constitution, the socialists' 170-strong  parliamentary group must now elect a new prime minister. Costas Simitis, aged 58, a university  academic and former industry minister and Gerasimos Arsenis, the Defence Minister have already  emerged as the front-runners in the race to replace Mr Papandreou. <p> <p> <p> <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td  width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td  width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td  width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td  width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr> <td  align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td> <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A  HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td> <td align=right  valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td> </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Helena Smith</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>Greece's ruling socialist party, Pasok, elected Costas Simitis, a reform-minded moderate, as the country's new prime minister last  night. Mr Simitis, a university academic, replaces Andreas Papandreou, who resigned six days ago during his eighth week in hospital.  <p>  <p>The former industry minister was elevated to the post by a vote margin of 11 over his competitor, Akis Tsochadzopoulos, who  gained 75 ballots in the two-round race. On hearing the result, Mr Simitis hailed it as an historic moment for Pasok, the Panhellenic  Socialist movement founded by Mr Papandreou from an anti-junta resistance group 21 years ago. "This is not a personal victory, but a  victory for the whole of Pasok, the country and the future of the centre-left," Mr Simitis, aged 59, said in a short speech to the party.  <p>  <p>The election was welcomed by Western diplomats who praised his pro-European views and drive for reform. "He will be less  hidebound on foreign policy and probably more forward-looking on issues like Cyprus and Turkey," a European Union diplomat said.  <p>  <p>But the victor's honeymoon, at least with the public, is unlikely to last long. Mr Simitis will inevitably be compared to Mr  Papandreou, not least in his ability to unite Pasok's rival groups. While trying to satisfy the socialists' many different factions, he will  also have to meet the growing demand for a more democratic leadership.  <p>  <p>"We were prepared under Andreas Papandreou to put water in our wine and accept his kind of leadership," said Giorgos Anomeritis,  the deputy economy minister. "But now we want decision-making to be more of a collective business."  <p>  <p>The socialists are acutely aware that they have less than two years left in office. As a result, the new prime minister faces the  unenviable task of placating a public that has become increasingly disgruntled with the government's handling of economic and foreign  affairs.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Edward Pilkington</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>The prompt and sharply-worded response from Buckingham Palace yesterday to news of the Duchess of York's critical finances  underlined the determination of the Queen and the royal household to wash their hands of a woman whom they have long considered to be  a liability.  <p>  <p>The intention of the statement was clear: to hold her at arms length. "Management of her financial affairs is the duchess's  responsibility," it said.  <p>  <p>Sarah Ferguson, or Fergie as she is affectionately called, has been out in the cold since she was captured on camera topless by a  poolside, five months after her marriage broke down, having her toes sucked by her American 'financial adviser' John Bryan.  <p>  <p>The Queen is believed to have ordered that the duchess conducted no more official engagements after the separation from Prince  Andrew in March 1992. In 1991, she undertook 213 such duties.  <p>  <p>The palace's hope in dissociating itself from the duchess's cash-flow troubles is that the flak from creditors and the press will not  hit the monarchy. The royal household has tacitly colluded with the image of the duchess as a loose and uncontrollable woman - a senior  palace press aide once famously accused her of being unfit to be a member of the royal family. <p>  <p>The information apparently leaked from  her private accounts suggests that last year she spent &#163;384,000 on staffing - a butler, cook, nanny, gardener, cleaner, dresser,  lady-in-waiting and two personal assistants. Then there was a spending spree of near Imelda Marcos proportions in New York, where  she allegedly bought 20 pairs of hand-made shoes and boots for a total of &#163;3,000. Her hair-stylist, Nicky Clarke, costs  &#163;150 a go - although a friend said yesterday that the duchess was now doing her own hair as a cost-cutting measure. She is  reported to have spent &#163;50,000 on 12 dresses from top designer Isabel Kristensen, and she enjoyed holidays in Switzerland and  the Caribbean. <p>  <p>The duchess said yesterday her financial affairs were "not anybody else's business". A year ago she told an audience in  Washington that she was hard-up. "I'm a separated mother of two, largely responsible for the finances of my family." She was then  having to leave a rented home she shared with her two daughters, princesses Beatrice and Eugenie. She may return to Sunninghill Park,  her &#163;5m marital home in Berkshire, to live in a converted out-building.  <p>  <p>The palace is annoyed by the latest rash of bad publicity because the Queen has been striving to dilute criticism that the royals are  profligate. In 1993, following a wave of adverse commentary on the fact that she was not paying tax, the Queen agreed to reimburse  Parliament the annuities paid for the Duke of York and other lesser royals.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

 <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Tim Radford</b><br><br>      <p> <p>US astronomers have discovered two planets orbiting stars 35 light years away which  could support the formation of life. Yesterday they christened one of them Goldilocks. <p>  <p>The two planets were detected by sophisticated techniques which analysed 'wobbles' in the  period of the parent stars 70 Virginis, in the constellation Virgo, and 47 UMa in Ursa Major,  the Big Dipper. The find was announced by Geoffrey Marcy of San Francisco State University and  researcher Paul Butler, at a meeting of astronomers in San Antonio, Texas. "We have tentatively  nicknamed one of these planets Goldilocks because Jeff said to me one night, this one is just  right," Dr Butler said yesterday. "I said it must be Goldilocks." <p> <p>No one has actually  seen either planet. Their mass and orbit have to be estimated from the shifts in the spectral  light from the stars. Jupiter, for example, produces a 12.5 metres per second wobble in the  sun's orbit. Using similar techniques, astronomers had already claimed two other planet  discoveries in other constellations. One - orbiting a pulsar, or neutron star - could not be a  home to any recognisable form of life. Another, 51 Pegasi, spotted in the Pegasus constellation  last year by two Swiss astronomers and confirmed by Prof Marcy and Dr Butler a week later, was  the first 'solar system-type' planet to be detected, but was too massive, too close to its  parent star and therefore, at 1,000C, too hot. <p> <p>But 70 Vir and 47 UMa are another story.  "The stars are very like the sun. The orbits are not unlike the Earth's orbit. One of them  orbits at about half the Earth-sun distance. One of them orbits at about twice the Earth-sun  distance. So they both are in a region where you would expect liquid water to be able to  exist," Dr Butler said. <p> <p>The real significance of the find may simply be that there are  Earth-like planets out there. There is nothing special about Earth. If life can arise on one  planet around one star in one galaxy, then it could happen on billions of such planets. <p>  <p>But until late last year, no one had detected any candidate planets. Now there are two.  "After the discovery of 51 Peg everyone wondered if it was a freak, a one in a million  observation," said Prof Marcy. "The answer is no. Planets aren't rare, after all." <p> <p>There  is no problem about the raw materials for life. The universe is rich in oxygen, hydrogen,  carbon, calcium, iron and surprisingly rich in organic chemicals. More than 100 complex  chemicals - including alcohol in awesome quantities - have been identified in the dust between  the stars or in meteorite material. But conditions have to be 'just right' for complex  chemicals to turn into complex, self-replicating proteins and then cells. It happened on Earth  - sometimes called the 'Goldilocks planet'. No one can possibly know, but the speculation is  that the two new candidates are gaseous, rather than rocky, more like Jupiter than Mars. "There  is going to be a zone where it is warm, where liquid water exists and where you have a whole  cauldron of complex organic chemistry going on," Dr Butler said. Even so, life could be  imagined. "If the laws of physics and chemistry are the same everywhere - and as far as we can  tell, they are - then that sort of speculation seems entirely reasonable." <p> <p>But, as they  say in Star Trek, it may not be life as we know it. Dr Paul Murdin, director of science at the  British National Space Centre, said: "The planets would have extremely heavy gravity, so if  there are creatures there they are going to be short and fat, not long and thin like us. They  will be more like crabs and limpets than sheep and horses and would move by scuttling  sideways." <p> <p>But the two astronomers in San Antonio last night had a better bet to place.  Gas giants like Saturn and Jupiter also have huge rocky moons. A moon the size of Mars or  bigger, orbiting either of the new planets, could have Earth-like gravities and Earth-like  atmospheres, even oceans. Professor Marcy said: "Life is now possible. There is a harbour, a  site, on which life might form." <p> <p> <p> <p> <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr> <td  width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td  width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td  width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td  width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr> <td align=left  valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td> <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A  HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td> <td align=right  valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td> </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Chris Nuttall</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>The leader of pro-Chechen hijackers holding about 200 hostages on a Black Sea ferry approaching Istanbul this morning promised not to enter the Bosphorus straits, as Russian forces mopped up after the end of the related crisis in Dagestan.  <p>  <p>"We'll do what the Turkish side wants us to do. They are our elders," the hijackers' Turkish leader, Mohammed Tokjan, said by telephone. The Turkish prime minister, Tansu Ciller, said the ship, being shadowed by two navy destroyers, had to be stopped before it reached the straits. The gunmen had threatened to blow up the ship.  <p>  <p>Mr Tokjan said his demands for Russian forces to let the Chechen fighters in Dagestan go free were no longer valid now the fighting there was over. "There is nothing to ask of Russia any more," he said. "They have lost their minds, they are only looking for blood."  <p>  <p>This relaxation of earlier demands encouraged Turkish hopes of a bloodless end to the three-day-old drama.  <p>  <p>The foreign ministry denied reports that it had offered to allow the militants to hold a news conference in Istanbul before surrendering. Popular support for the Chechen cause has led to demonstrations in Istanbul, and boats have been hired by welcoming parties wanting to go out to meet the ferry.  <p>  <p>Meanwhile, Salman Raduyev, leader of the 'Lone Wolf' gang that defied the might of the Russian army, appeared to have escaped after Russia overcame the last pockets of Chechen resistance in the destroyed village of Pervomayskaya, Dagestan.  <p>  <p>The 10-day crisis ended as it had begun, in confusion and disbelief. Smirking grimly in the Kremlin, President Boris Yeltsin claimed to have "taught Dudayev a lesson" - a reference to the Chechen separatist leader, Dzhokhar Dudayev. Mr Yeltsin claimed 82 hostages held by the gang in the village had been freed and 153 Chechen rebels killed, with 28 captured. He said 26 Russian soldiers had died.  <p>  <p>The Russian military also claimed that dozens of the Chechen gunmen had been killed during an attempted breakout from Pervomayskaya. Like the other statements, this could not be independently verified. Foreign journalists were barred from the scene.  <p>  <p>General Anatoli Kulikov, the interior minister, confirmed his forces were still looking for Mr Raduyev. Mr Yeltsin was undaunted. "All bandits have been exterminated, if no one is hiding underground."  <p>  <p>The bodies of dozens of rebels, some missing heads and limbs, lay in a ditch outside the town yesterday.  <p>  <p>Two freed hostages said yesterday many of their captors had slipped away under cover of night and dismissed Russian reports that some captives had been executed.  <p>  <p>On Wednesday, with only 28 hostages free, the Russian authorities said they were certain virtually all the remaining hostages were dead and began an indiscriminate artillery barrage.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>John Hooper</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>The frightening hijacking of a Black Sea ferry ended last night in an almost festive atmosphere, with the four pro-Chechen gunmen  throwing down their weapons and surrendering to Turkish authorities.  <p>  <p>As a rubber dinghy sped the group to shore through the dusk near Iriva, a fishing village at the mouth of the Bosphorus, supporters of  the Chechen cause chanted slogans, lit torches and danced hand in hand round a bonfire on a headland overlooking the hijacked ferry,  Avrasya.  <p>  <p>Just before leaving the ship, one of the Turkish gunmen said: "We hit our targets. "  <p>  <p>Turkish security officials early this morning detained a fifth person suspected of taking part in the hijack, the semi-official Anatolian  news agency said.  <p>  <p>According to the captain, the gang had turned the ship into a floating bomb by strapping explosives to the fuel tanks and other parts  of the ship. They had threatened to blow up the vessel in the Bosphorus, in protest at Russia's bombardment of Chechen rebels who were  holding hostages in the Dagestan village of Pervomayskaya.  <p>  <p>But Istanbul's deputy governor, Ridvan Yenisen, said last night that no explosives had so far been found. Anatolian said security  forces were still questioning passengers. The ferry is expected to sail to the Black Sea port of Eregli, 130 miles east of Istanbul, for  further investigation. Already questions were being asked, not least in Moscow, about the deal the Turkish authorities had struck to end  the affair so abruptly. According to one report, the hijackers were promised prison sentences of only eight months if they surrendered.  <p>  <p>The Avrasya was stormed last Tuesday in the Turkish port of Trabzon by a group thought to number seven or eight Turkish nationals  of Caucasian origin. Their mostly Russian hostages numbered up to 250.  <p>  <p>The ferry spent yesterday encircled by Turkish naval and coastguard ships. Shortly before 5pm black smoke issued from its  funnel and it made a wide, slow turn to cheers from the onlookers.  <p>  <p>Ali Curey, an Istanbul jeweller whose family left the Caucasus last century, watched the ship's stately progress. "We support these  kids," he said of the hijackers. "We don't want an unhappy end, though. The people aboard are innocent... but we are sick of their  government."  <p>  <p>In Moscow, President Yeltsin was attempting to fend off criticism for his handling of the Chechen crisis in Dagestan, but new figures  he produced on the storming of Pervomayskaya only added fuel to the fire. Mr Yeltsin said 153 of the 300 rebel gunmen in the village  had been killed and 30 captured, confirming reports that a large contingent of fighters, headed by the chief of the gang, the 'Lone Wolf'  Salman Raduyev, got away.  <p>  <p>Mr Yeltsin said of the Chechen rebels, "the mad dogs must be shot", and promised all-out war against their mountain bases.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

 <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Ian Katz</b><br><br>      <p> <p>Barely six months after she went on national television to declare her undying love for  her husband and end rumours that their marriage was a sham, Lisa Marie Presley has filed for  divorce from singer Michael Jackson, citing "irreconcilable differences". <p> <p>The improbable  union of the troubled entertainer and the glamorous daughter of the king of rock 'n' roll had  been the subject of unkind speculation almost from the moment it was consecrated in a secret  15-minute ceremony in the Dominican Republic. <p> <p>In the couple's chat show interview with  Diane Sawyer last June, Ms Presley - a member of the Church of Scientology - strenuously denied  that the alliance had been motivated more by convenience than love. She insisted: "I'm not  going to marry anyone for any reason other than I love them." For good measure she confirmed,  three times, that the couple enjoyed normal conjugal relations. She added that she found "the  jokes and degrading comments" about their relationship "really irritating". <p> <p>"We will be  expecting children but I won't be saying when. It's in the hands of the gods." <p> <p>But Ms  Presley's own children, two boys aged six and two, from her previous marriage to rock star  Danny Keough, did not take to Jackson, according to reports. Mr Jackson wanted to adopt them  but his wife allegedly refused. Within weeks, the couple were once more denying reports of a  split. "Never believe the tabloid garbage," snapped Mr Jackson in a news conference. "Don't  waste your time and money." <p> <p>As recently as last month, Ms Presley was to be found  dutifully beside her husband's New York hospital bed after he collapsed while rehearsing for a  show and was found to be suffering from a heart ailment. <p> <p>Under California's no-fault  divorce laws, the dissolving of the couple's marriage should be routine. Since they signed  pre-nuptial agreements, it is unlikely that Ms Presley will have any claim on Mr Jackson's  earnings, which amounted to $67m (&#163;40m) in 1994, or any of his several properties and  exotic animals. <p> <p>The couple were joined before Judge Hugo Fransisco Alvarez Perez for the  princely sum of $45 in July 1994. For several weeks, however, the judge's claim that he had  married the couple was treated with scepticism in the face of vehement denials from the  couple's aides. <p> <p>Finally in August 1994, the duo conceded they had, in fact, tied the  knot. "I am very much in love with Michael," Ms Presley declared in a statement. <p> <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td  width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td  width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td  width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td  width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr> <td  align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td> <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A  HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td> <td align=right  valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td> </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Harriet Harman sends son to selective grant maintained school </b><br><br><br><b><h2>20 January  1996</h2></b><br><h2>Harriet Harman's son to attend selective school  </h2>
  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Helen Nowicka</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>Harriet Harman, Labour's shadow health secretary, is to send her 11-year-old son to a selective grant-maintained grammar school,  it emerged last night. Ms Harman's decision to have her son Joseph educated at St Olave's and St Saviour's boys' grammar in Orpington,  Kent, will embarrass Labour, given its policy to oppose selection in schools.  <p>  <p>A row developed over Tony Blair sending his son Euan to the Oratory, a grant-maintained Roman Catholic school in west London. Ms  Harman's son Harry is also a pupil at the Oratory.  <p>  <p>Ms Harman's son Joseph currently attends Dulwich Hamlet, a state primary in south London and a feeder school for St Olave's. He  was one of 700 applicants to the grammar and finished in the top 90, with boys chosen on the basis of examination results and an  interview.  <p>  <p>St Olave's has a strong academic record, with 99 per cent of pupils gaining an average of five GCSE passes at grades A to C and 96 per  cent of sixth formers going on to higher education. Exam results in the London borough of Southwark, which includes Ms Harman's  Peckham constituency, are below the national average.  <p>  <p>Founded 400 years ago, St Olave's has 28 acres of grounds and playing fields and its own swimming pool and squash courts.  <p>  <p>Last night Ms Harman said: "This is a state school that other children in my son's class will be going to. That he has got in has  absolutely nothing to do with the fact that I am an MP. Any child in Southwark can apply, many go and admission is irrespective of  money or who their parents are." She added that while people outside London tended to send children to local schools, that was not true  in the capital. "There has always been a lot of travelling in London. It has also been common for a long time for parents in inner London to  send their children to schools in outer London boroughs." Ms Harman said that the decision not to send Joseph to the Oratory was not a  reflection on that school. "Sometimes a school is perfect for one child and another is perfect for another. There is nothing unusual in a  parent sending one child to one school and another to a different school," she said. At the party conference in October, David Blunkett,  the shadow education secretary, pledged "no selection, either by examination or by interview under a Labour government". He said no  more selective schools would be created.  <p>  <p>The party's education policy document stresses that Labour will leave the decision to preserve existing grammar schools with local  authorities. Mr Blair's decision to send his eldest son to the London Oratory last September caused a damaging row within the party.  <p>  <p>The Labour leader defended his decision to send his son eight miles across London to a grant-maintained school on the grounds that  choice could not be sacrificed to "political correctness". Many party members argued that the move was giving tacit approval to  grant-maintained schools and selection by interview.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>
