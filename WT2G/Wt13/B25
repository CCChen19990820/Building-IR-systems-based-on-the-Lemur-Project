<IMG SRC="INTERNET.GIF" HEIGHT=149 WIDTH=100 ALT="The Internet offers many opportunities to get free environmental information"ALIGN=LEFT>

If you have a computer and a modem, you have access to a vast array of virtually free environmental information on the Internet. The data available is so comprehensive that soon you'll forget about getting information from books, magazines, and newspapers (except, of course, <I>Beyond Compliance </I>).

<P>

First, you'll need a personal computer that can run either Windows, DOS, or the Mac operating system. Second, you'll need an Internet account and a browser (software that searches the Internet). One of the easiest ways to get an account and a browser at the same time is to sign up with one of the major on-line companies, such as America Online (AOL; 800-827-6364) or CompuServe (800-487-0453). Both companies send you free, easy to load and use software. The service costs about $10 a month and includes about five hours of connect time per month-additional time is about $4 per hour. Another option is to hook up with a direct Internet Service Provider (ISP), such as Netcom or GNN (800-819-6112). They also provide free software, and for about $20 per month, you get unlimited access time.

<P>

If your ISP doesn't provide it free, you'll need browser software. The most popular browser is from Netscape, but others such as Microsoft Explorer or Netcom Netcruiser work fine for most of us.

<P>

Today, the easiest method of searching the Internet is via the WorldWide Web (WWW), and Internet browsers make searching the Web easy.

<P>
 
Some information is only available via File Transfer Protocol (FTP) which is a fast way to download data files and software, but you have to know where the information is, and exactly what you are looking for, to find it. A "gopher" search tool, which is built into AOL and some Web browsers, can help you find your way through FTP files.

<P>
 
To find information from a world wide web home page, type the address (if you know it) into your browser. Most addresses look something like ours, <A HREF="http://www.ercweb.com">http://www.ercweb.com</A>. For environmental information, our home page is the best place to start because you'll find information that we have developed to keep you up-to-date with environmental regulations. Another good place to look is EPA's home page at <A HREF="http://www.epa.gov">http://www.epa.gov</A>.

If you don't know the address, you can search one of the Internet directories on-line. To do this, use the address - <A HREF="http://www.yahoo.com">http://www.yahoo.com</A>. If Yahoo can't find what you are looking for, in place of yahoo, type "altavista" or "webcrawler" or "infoseek."

<P>

If you ever get lost, just click the "back" button on your browser and you'll go back to the previous page; or click on home, and you'll get back to where you started.

<P>
 
Our home page contains "links" to most of the other home pages that you'll want to search. A link is a connection to another page of information that could be at the same organization or across the planet. Links are usually highlighted in blue, and when clicked on, they jump you to the new location. Our home page has links to EPA, OSHA, DOT, all 50 states, and other useful sources of information.

<P>
 
If you have an e-mail address that is connected to the Internet, you can join a "listserver" and let the information come to you. Listservers will send you continuous e-mails of all kinds of environmental information. Just send an e-mail to a listserver and then wait for the flood of information.

<P>
 
Here are a few listservers to get you started:

<P>

<CENTER><TABLE BORDER>
<TR><TH>Name</TH><TH>Description</TH></TR>
<TR><TD>EPA-PRESS</TH><TD>EPA press releases.  If you want to know <BR>where Carol Browner is speaking next week,<BR>this is for you.  You'll also get releases on <BR>new regulations</TD></TR>

<TR><TD>EPA-TOX</TD><TD>TSCA Federal Registers</TD></TR>


</TABLE></CENTER>

<P>

To subscribe to any of these listservers, follow these instructions closely. One typo and it won't work.
<OL>
<LI>Send an e-mail to: <A HREF="mailto:listserver@unixmail.rtpnc.epa.gov">listserver@unixmail.rtpnc.epa.gov</A>
</LI>
<LI>Leave the subject field of your e-mail message blank (very important)
</LI>
<LI>Your e-mail message should read (for example): subscribe EPA-PRESS Jane Doe
</LI>
<LI>Use your real name in place of "Jane Doe."
</LI>
<LI>In place of "EPA-PRESS," enter the name of any one of the other listservers that you want to subscribe to.
</LI>
</OL>

<P>

If you subscribe to all of the listservers described earlier, you could receive several dozen e-mails per day. If that's too much for you, or if you prefer your information in English (rather than regulatoreese) you can subscribe to our Environmental Tip of the Week, which includes selected information from the listservers and other sources. To subscribe, send an e-mail to <A HREF="mailto:tnielsen@ercweb.com">tnielsen@ercweb.com</A> and include your name, mailing address, and the word subscribe in the message.

<P>

In future issues of Beyond Compliance we will include more information about useful Internet sites and listservers. If you have a favorite site, newsgroup, or listserver that our readers would be interested in, send it in an e-mail to <A HREF="mailto:bkarnofsky@ercweb.com">bkarnofsky@ercweb.com</A>.

<P>

The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) was scheduled to publish the first of its final standards in the 14000 (environmental management) series by mid-1996. So far, they have only published the Committee Drafts (CDs) or Draft International Standards (DISs) of the foundation documents of the series. Informed sources now believe that the final 14001 and 14004 environmental management system standards will be published by mid-October, about the same time as the 14010, 14011, and 14012 environmental auditing standards.

<P>

The ISO 14000 series is the first set of generic standards developed by ISO to provide business management with a structure for managing the environmental impacts of their activities. The standards cover a wide range of environmental disciplines, including Environmental Management Systems (EMSs), Auditing, Environmental Performance Evaluations (EPE), Labeling, Life-Cycle Assessment (LCA), and Environmental Aspects in Product Standards (EAPS).

<P>

As of mid-1996, ISO intends the initial 14000 series standards to be organized as shown below:

<P>

The best way to plan for conformance with the new standards is to begin the ISO five-step process described in Environmental Resource Center's new <I>ISO 14000 Handbook: Preparing for Certification or Registration under ISO 14001</I>. The steps are Commitment and Policy, Planning, Implementation, Measurement and Evaluation, and Review and Improvement.

<P>

Under a final rule signed May 24, 1996, facilities that manufacture, process, use, store, or otherwise handle any of 139 regulated substances that exceed threshold quantities are required to develop and implement a risk management program. Owners and operators of sources subject to the Risk Management Program have until June 20, 1999, to achieve compliance with the final rule.

<P>

Under the final rule, your facility will be required to do three things: (1) register with EPA, (2) develop and implement your risk management program, and (3) develop and submit to the Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board, EPA, the State Emergency Response Commission, and the Local Emergency Planning Committee a risk management plan (RMP) that outlines the results of your risk management program.

<P>

Your risk management program will be required to have three major elements: (1) a hazard assessment, (2) a prevention program, and (3) an emergency response program.

<P>

<H3>Hazard Assessment</H3>
The first element, the hazard assessment, must be completed for each regulated substance present at the site in quantities greater than the associated thresholds (see sidebar.) You should evaluate many scenarios to determine a range of releases that may occur within the facility. It is important that the worst-case scenario is also identified and included. Usually, the worst-case scenario is considered the instantaneous loss of all of the regulated substance in a process, with failure of all mitigation systems. The range of releases should only include those "significant" events that could lead to off-site deaths, injury, or serious adverse effects to human health or the environment.

<P>

After identifying "significant" release scenarios at your facility, analyze the potential off-site consequences associated with each of the scenarios. You should estimate the possible rate of release of regulated substances and the quantity that may be released, identify potential human and environmental pathways of exposure, estimate the duration of releases, and identify any other consequences.

<P>

As part of your hazard assessment, you are also required to submit a five-year accidental release history that outlines any "significant" releases. You should include information on the substance released, the quantity released, the concentration of the substance when released, time and date of release, duration of the release, off-site consequences, and any other pertinent information.

<P>

<H3>Prevention Program</H3>
The second element, the prevention program, adopts and builds on OSHA's process safety management standard (57 FR 6356). The nine procedural areas outlined by EPA as areas that should be addressed in your prevention program include:
<UL>
<LI>Process Hazard Analysis
</LI>
<LI>Safety Information
</LI>
<LI>Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)
</LI>
<LI>Training
</LI>
<LI>Maintenance
</LI>
<LI>Pre-startup Review
</LI>
<LI>Management of Change
</LI>
<LI>Safety Audits, and
</LI> 
<LI>Accident Investigation
</LI>
</UL>

<P>

<H3>Emergency Response</H3>
The third element is emergency response planning which includes development of evacuation plans, emergency response plans, community relation plans, and informing the appropriate authorities of what responses will be taken in the event of an accidental release. The emergency response program should also include written sections covering emergency response equipment, first aid and emergency medical treatment, training, and drills and exercises.

<P>

<H3>Getting Started</H3>
To find out if your facility must develop a Risk Management Plan, you can <A HREF="http://www.ercweb.com/INBC.HTM">download a copy of the proposed rule and final chemical list</A>.

<CENTER><H5><A HREF="http://www.ercweb.com/EMPL.HTM#Ednuti">C. Edward Nuti<BR>Transportation Consultant</A></H5></CENTER>

<P>


Since President Clinton's Regulatory Review Initiative, which directed all Federal agenices to eliminate, simplify, or revise those regulations in need of reform, the Department of Transportation has issued and finalized several hazardous materials proposals, summarized in the table below.

<P>

<CENTER><TABLE BORDER>
<TR><TD ALIGN=TOP>HM-200</TD><TD>Defines "Materials of Trade" in 49 CFR 171.8, and provides exceptions in new section 173.6 for these materials via motor carrier.  Only certain hazard classes are eligible and only in certain quantities.  Maximum gross weight on a motor vehicle is 150 kg.  Designed primarily for private carriage of materials used in the conduct of business.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD ALIGN=TOP>HM-214</TD><TD>Establishes a requirement for comprehensive response plans for oil shipments in bulk packagings in quantities greater than 42,000 gallons.  Less detailed plans are required for petroleum oil shipments in bulk packages of 3,500 gallons or more.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD ALIGN=TOP>HM-216</TD><TD>Miscellaneous amendments to the hazardous materials regulations for transportation by rail.  Section 172.205(f) is amended for consistency with the EPA hazardous waste manifest requirements for transportation by rail contained in 40 CFR 263.20(f).</TD></TR>

<TR><TD ALIGN=TOP>HM-222A</TD><TD>Format changes to the Hazardous Materials Table in 49 CFR 172.101 are made.  Label column 6 changed to specify "label codes" instead of the associated hazard class name.  Codes are defined in a new Label Substitution Table.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD ALIGN=TOP>HM-222B</TD><TD>Eliminates 49 CFR 172.203(e)(3) to preface non-bulk packages of hazardous substances with "RESIDUE: Last Contained."<BR>Adds a new section 173.13 incorporating the provisions of DOT exemptions E-7891 and E-9168 (poison pack exemptions).<BR>Changes to marking requirements for hazardous substances on non-bulk packages.  Must identify and mark the two substances (if more than one) with the lowest RQs.  Changes are in 49 CFR 172.324.<BR>Consumer Commodities will no longer require emergency response information or emergency telephone number on shipping papers.<BR>Recurrent Training requirements for "hazmat employees" decreased to "at least once every three years."</TD></TR>

<TR><TD ALIGN=TOP>HM-224</TD><TD>Oxygen generators prohibited from passenger aircraft, except when for medical or personal use of a passenger.</TD></TR>
</TABLE></CENTER>

<P>

Some changes were significant and others were not.  All of them, however, change the regulations in some way. The "materials of trade" exceptions, for instance, are particularly helpful if your business requires you to carry certain quantities of hazardous materials in a truck free of regulations. This provision excepts from regulation certain small quantities of hazardous materials transported and used by carriers (particularly private carriers).

<P>

Another change is somewhat controversial. In light of the recent Valujet tragedy, and the importance of a re-commitment to safety training in general, there have been indications of a movement underway to repeal the change that decreases the recurrent training provisions for "hazmat employees" from once every two years to once every three years. This ruling does not affect the current requirements of IATA/ICAO which continues to mandate recurrent training every 24 months. Stay tuned to <I>Beyond Compliance</I> to keep up-to-date. Contact Ed Nuti at (919) 469-1585 or e-mail him at <A HREF="mailto:enuti@ercweb.com">enuti@ercweb.com</A> if you would like to arrange on-site DOT or IATA training.

<P>

Attend Environmental Resource Center's Hazardous Material Handling Certification for DOT HM-181, HM-126F, and HM-215A or The Advanced Hazardous Materials DOT and IATA Workshop to stay current with DOT regulations.  If you can't attend the course, buy the book!

If you are confused about how to handle mercury-containing lamps, you are certainly not alone. On July 27, 1994, EPA proposed a regulatory program that would give mercury-containing lamps an exclusion from classification as a RCRA regulated hazardous waste if the lamps were recycled or managed at an appropriate land disposal facility. EPA does not have a projected time table for establishing a final rule regarding mercury-containing lamps, and sources at EPA have indicated that with the publication of the universal waste rules, the mercury lamp proposal is not a high priority.

<P>

The Universal Waste Rule, published May 11, 1995, deals with certain hazardous wastes generated by a wide cross-section of the regulated community, whichpose relatively low levels of hazard. The universal waste program includes three types of wastes: hazardous waste batteries, hazardous waste pesticides, and mercury-containing thermostats. EPA designed the universal waste system to allow authorized states to add other low hazard wastes, such as fluorescent lamps, to their state universal waste programs.

<P>

Fluorescent lamps contain elemental mercury as an essential component for operation. A typical 4-foot lamp contains between 30 and 40 milligrams (mg) of mercury. When these lamps are evaluated using the EPA toxicity characteristic leaching procedure (TCLP), they exceed the maximum regulatory level of mercury (0.2 mg/l) that qualifies a material as a hazardous waste.

<P>
 
In addition to federal regulatory standards, many states have published compliance documents dealing with the management and disposal of spent mercury-containing lamps.  Following are some of the strategies that state regulatory agencies have taken:

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Some states have made the determination that if fluorescent lamps are accumulated, maintained intact, and managed in a recycling program they are classified as characteristic by-product and are not subject to the hazardous waste regulations.
</LI>
<LI>States who have received universal waste authorization may add fluorescent lamps to the universal waste program.  This would require a generator to comply with the standards at 40 CFR 273 or their state universal waste codes.
</LI>
<LI>Crushing fluorescent lamps is considered treatment under the hazardous waste regulations in some states and will require a permit or license.  In other states, it is not considered treatment and is permissible provided that there is a vapor recovery system installed to capture the mercury vapor that is released when the lamps are crushed.  If the lamps are crushed, the crushed material must be evaluated to determine if it is a hazardous waste by performing a toxicity characteristic leaching procedure for mercury.
</LI>
<LI>Other states have linked the regulatory status of mercury-containing lamps to the quantity of lamps that a particular site generates in a month.  Under this system, any site that generates greater than 1000 kg of lamps per month will be required to manage their lamps as hazardous waste, or as universal waste if the lamps are recycled.  Sites that generate less than 1000 kg, but more than 100 kg, may recycle their fluorescent lamps as non-hazardous waste, or send them to an authorized disposal facility as a universal waste.  Sites that generate less than 100 kg of fluorescent lamps may send their lamps to a landfill or recycle their lamps as non-hazardous waste, provided they do not discharge the mercury to the environment or send their lamps to a landfill that is not authorized for mercury-containing lamps.
</LI>
</UL>

<P>

Given the ever-changing state of regulations that could be applicable to fluorescent lamps, you must be very careful to establish the proper handling and management procedures for your facility.

Preparing and implementing multiple emergency response plans can be complex, confusing, and costly. Finally, the agencies that require you to develop emergency response plans have gotten together and will allow you to develop a single plan. The interagency "one-plan guidance" document that you can use to prepare emergency response plans, The National Response Team's Integrated Contingency Plan Guidance (One Plan), was published in the June 5, 1996, Federal Register.

<P>

<CENTER><IMG SRC="CONTPLAN.GIF"><H5>Preparing emergency response plans just got easier.  The agencies that require you to develop emergency response plans have gotten together and will allow you to develop a single plan.</H5></CENTER>


<P>

A Presidential Review concluded that facilities faced a burden when preparing emergency response plans due to multiple and overlapping federal requirements. A National Response Team was created to provide a mechanism for consolidating multiple plans that facilities may have prepared to comply with various regulations into one functional emergency response plan or integrated contingency plan (ICP). The National Response Team (NRT) is composed of several agencies including Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), U.S. Coast Guard (USCG), Minerals Management Service (MMS), Research and Special Programs Administration (RSPA), and Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA).

<P>
 
The NRT believes that the preparation and use of the ICP has several advantages, such as the use of a single emergency response plan which will eliminate confusion for first responders who often must decide which of their plans is applicable to a particular emergency; it will minimize duplication in the preparation and use of emergency response plans at the same facility; facility expenditures for the preparation, maintenance, submission, and update of a single plan should be much lower than for multiple plans; and the use of a single integrated plan should also improve coordination between facility response personnel and local, state, and federal emergency response personnel.

<P>
 
For some instances, the NRT believes that the adoption of a single, common, ICP outline such as the one proposed in the guidance, would facilitate a move toward integration of facility plans with local, state, and federal plans, which will more efficiently and effectively protect public health, worker safety, the environment, and property. 
The ICP does not relieve facilities from their current obligations, although the NRT designed it specifically to help meet those obligations by providing a format for organizing and presenting material currently required by the regulations. You are free to continue maintaining multiple plans to demonstrate federal regulatory compliance; however, the NRT believes that an integrated plan prepared in accordance with the guidance is a preferable alternative.

<P>

The ICP format is organized into three main sections:  an introductory section, a core plan, and a series of supporting annexes. The elements contained in each of these sections are not new concepts or new planning requirements, but rather accepted emergency response activities addressed in existing contingency planning regulations in various different forms. 
The introductory section includes a statement of purpose and scope, a table of contents, the current revision date, and general facility information. It is designed to provide basic information about the plan so users may assess the relevancy of the plan to a particular type of emergency.

<P>
 
The core plan is intended to reflect the essential steps necessary to initiate, conduct, and terminate an emergency response action. In the guidance, the core plan is based on the structure of the National Interagency Incident Management System (NIIMS) Incident Command System (ICS). It is intended to contain essential response guidance and procedures.

<P>
 
The annexes are to contain more detailed supporting information on specific response management functions as well as document compliance with regulatory requirements not addressed elsewhere in the ICP. The annexes should also address issues such as incident history, training and exercises, prevention strategies, written follow-up reports, and plan critique.

EPA recently announced the first Project XL plan (Excellence and Leadership) with Jack M. Berry, Inc., a citrus juice manufacturer. This is the first of as many as 50 planned pilot projects designed to streamline environmental compliance while creating better environmental results.

<P>

"EPA has found that allowing facilities and other entities to explore non-traditional pollution control solutions can result in the regulated community achieving environmental protection results beyond those anticipated by traditional means. We have also found that better environmental decisions result from a collaborative process with people working together.  We are fortunate to have formed such a partnership with Berry and the Florida DEP and South Florida WMD," said John H. Hankinson, Jr., Administrator, EPA Region 4.

<P>
 
Under Project XL, regulated entities test creative strategies that will achieve cleaner, cheaper, smarter results than conventional regulatory approaches. Last year, EPA announced that both private and federal facilities can participate in the program, and that several were testing the design elements of Project XL. Criteria for a full-scale program in which additional companies can apply should be developed by January of 1997.

<P>

Organizations that participate in the leadership program could receive public recognition, fewer inspections, and expedited permitting. Facilities that discover deficiencies may also have a limited time in which to correct any violations as long as none are criminal in nature or could pose an imminent threat to public health or the environment.

<P>

Each participating facility develops and tests one or more of the following compliance projects:   

<P>

<OL>
<LI>advancing the design of Environmental Management Systems (EMS) which both prevents and assures continuous environmental improvement;
</LI> 
<LI>incorporating multi-media compliance assurance into daily management practices;
</LI> 
<LI>using independent verification of compliance;
</LI> 
<LI>developing and conducting self-certification protocols;
</LI> 
<LI>enhancing public accountability by measuring a facility's compliance record and making goals for improvement;
</LI>
<LI>initiating facility involvement; and for large companies,
</LI> 
<LI>becoming a mentor to smaller businesses by assisting them with model training programs.
</LI>
</OL>
<P>

The full-scale leadership program will be available in those states that buy into the project. To join, the facility will submit an application to EPA, then EPA will work with the state and region to establish how each company qualifies as an environmental leader. Later this year EPA will receive comments, hold meetings, and publish their preliminary findings in the Federal Register to establish how to review a facility's leadership program for approval.

<TR><TD>The Berry company project is expected to result in cost savings that will be reinvested by the company in new environment enhancement efforts and environmentally beneficial operating procedures.  Following are the benefits of the Berry project.

<P>

<B>Environmental Benefits:</B> Berry is committed to achieving superior environmental performance in water consumption reduction, the utilization of process wastewaters for irrigation, the use of non-hazardous pest controls, reserving of acreage for habitat conservation and overall pollution prevention practices.

<P>

<B>Consistency in environmental protection during non-monitoring periods</B> as a result, assuring the predictability of the environmental protection process.

<P>

<B>Cost reductions for the facility and for the regulatory agency:</B> A comprehensive operating permit will be prepared by EPA and the company and will allow for public comment.  This new type of singular permit will be multi-media, assuring the requirements of several previous permits, and will translate to greater flexibility and cost savings.  It will not expire automatically and will allow expedited development of a new permit with reduced paperwork and reduced expenses for the company and the agency.  This permit will be for the entire facility, call for maintaining all environmental standards, and consolidate federal, state and local facility permits.

<P>

<B>Increased compliance with environmental regulations:</B> Since employees will be involved in writing the comprehensive operating permit, they should be able to understand its language better.</TD</TR>

<A HREF="REASSCR.HTM"><IMG SRC="REASON2.GIF" ALIGN=RIGHT ALT="Click here to view a sample screen"></A>If you are a safety, operations, or quality professional who is responsible for root cause problem-solving, then you should consider REASON. This Windows-based software is a powerful, expert system that guides you through the entire problem-solving process. It is designed to thoroughly identify all root causes, complete the investigation and analysis process quickly, and clearly document your work so that a decision can be made and implemented promptly.

<P>

REASON breaks down a problem into its essential parts, orders those parts into a logical model that can be measured, and then uses the results to help make informed decisions. Although most commonly used for accident investigation, REASON can be used on any business or operational problem:  a defective product, a severe laceration, a late delivery, a vehicle accident, a radioactive exposure, the loss of a valuable employee, a notice of violation received from a regulatory inspection, and more.

<P>
  
REASON can do this because it is a rule-based system, using a set of logic rules to guide the process. You do not have to know the rules because the expert system leads you through each step, then helps you verify the accuracy and completeness of your work.

<P>
 
For those environmental and safety professionals responsible for occurrence reporting, REASON provides a consistent and thorough analysis to identify both common deficiencies and prevention options. For those in Total Quality Management, REASON fulfills the "management by fact" mandates seen in the Malcom Baldridge Award and ISO 9000 certification.

<P>
 
Find out why manufacturers, chemical companies, refineries, nuclear plants, utilities, laboratories and more have turned to REASON when identifying root causes is critical.

<CENTER><H1>CD-ROM Based Health and Safety Training is Finally Affordable</H1></CENTER>

<P>

<IMG SRC="ODONNELL.GIF" BORDER=1 ALIGN=RIGHT>In the past, <I>Beyond Compliance</I> has documented the exciting growth in computer-based training (CBT) for compliance with safety and environmental regulations. We have detailed the benefits multimedia-based training can provide: on demand availability, self-paced learning, effective interaction (combining hearing, seeing, and doing), ability to capture and maintain student interest (through video, graphics, text and digital sound), improved retention, and automatic performance tracking.

<P>

Until now, the financial investment has been higher than many training budgets would allow. Now, multimedia CBT technology is within the grasp of anyone that wants convenient and effective training. Most new computers come equipped with Pentium processors, massive hard drives, plenty of RAM, video drivers, digital audio, and built-in CD-ROM capability; all at an increasingly more attractive price. Many programs (including the ones we are reviewing today) can now be run on affordably-priced, but powerful training workstations.

<P>
 
As for product cost, Environmental Resource Center has just announced a series of Safety and Health training programs that dramatically reduces the cost while providing state of the art training. You can now get any of 15 titles at the unprecedented price of $195 each! These quality, Windows-based training programs compare favorably to the highest priced alternatives, and offer advanced features such as course customization, curricula setup, performance tracking, and management reporting. Now, every training manager can provide state of the art training methods for their employees.

<H2>Safe Packing Assistance</H2>

<P>

To promote safe packaging reduction, the Institute of Packaging Professionals (IoPP) has prepared Guidelines for Responsible Chemical Packaging Management and Guidelines for Disposition of Used Packaging. This guide helps companies determine the best strategy for managing containers that have been used to store hazardous materials. The guide includes sections on residue minimization, recycling, reconditioning, returnable packaging, and consumable chemical packaging. Each section contains an introduction, a description of the strategy, its pros and cons, and specific examples. The guide is available from IoPP for $25. To order, contact IoPP at 703-318-8970.

<H2>Silver BMW not Carol Browners's</H2>

<P>

It turns out that a silver BMW that carries the tags "EPA 1" and has a Clinton-Gore bumper sticker on it, doesn't belong to EPA administrator, Carol Browner. (She drives a Volvo wagon with a "Treasure the Chesapeake" sticker with Maryland tags.) The car belongs to David Petrou, president of the marketing firm Eisner, Petrou & Associates (EPA), who reports he constantly gets notes from citizens tucked under his windshield.

<H2>New Audit Policy Gets Good Start</H2>

<P>

According to Eric Schaeffer, of EPA's Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance, 76 companies have participated in EPA's new limited-immunity audit policy which began January 22, 1996. The companies discovered a variety of environmental violations and agreed to correct them. Most of the companies will not be fined by EPA, and the Agency will release detailed information about the companies and their violations. EPA expects increased participation in the program in the future.

<HR>

<H2>10 State Air Permitting Programs Taken Over by EPA</H2>

<P>

As published in the Federal Register August 1, 1996, EPA will establish a Clean Air Act Title V federal operating permit program for 10 states, three territories, and one local operating permit program. Most of the 10 states will be subject to the federal program for only a short time until they submit applications for permit programs.

<P>
 
States affected are Alaska, Arizona, Connecticut, Idaho, Maine, Michigan, New Hampshire, New York, Vermont, and Virginia. Virginia will likely be subject to the federal program for a longer period due to contention between EPA and the commonwealth. The agency will also issue permits for the South Coast Air Quality Management District in California.

<H2>Introducing Amy Knight</H2>
Environmental Resource Center is proud to introduce <A HREF="mailto:aknight@ercweb.com">Amy Knight</A>, our newest environmental consultant. Ms. Knight has extensive environmental, public health, and safety experience, with an emphasis on regulation compliance, environmental health program management, technical assistance, and public affairs. She has worked with both government and private industry to maintain compliance with state and federal environmental regulations. She has served on a Local Emergency Planning Committee and an environmental response team responding to hazardous materials spills and providing guidance on environmental protections.

<HR>

<H2>EPA Issues Volatile Organic Compound Proposal</H2>
EPA has issued a proposal to control volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions from a variety of consumer products, including engine degreasers, insecticides, and oven cleaners. VOCs are a prime ingredient of urban ozone, or smog, which has serious health effects. The proposed rule is based on reformulation of products, instead of add-on control devices, to reduce the amount of VOCs in the product. Several states have already set reformulation standards for these products as part of their smog-control programs. EPA's proposal will establish one national standard with which manufacturers will have to comply rather than numerous state standards. EPA expects its proposal to reduce VOC emissions nationally by 90,000 tons annually. The proposed rule is computer accessible immediately through EPA's Technology Transfer Network at (919) 541-5742 under "Recently Signed Rules."

<HR>

<H2>RCRA Fax Back</H2>
Now you can get immediate access to EPA's Office of Solid Waste guidance documents regarding hazardous waste regulations via EPA's new Fax-Back service. The Fax-Back system enables you to receive selected materials by calling their fax machine. Instructions for the Fax-Back system can be obtained through the RCRA/Superfund Hotline at (800) 424-9346 or (703) 412-9810.

<HR>

<H2>20 Toxic Substances Targeted for New Workplace Exposure Limits</H2>
OSHA wishes to establish new Permissible Exposure Limits (PELs) for 20 substances. The targeted substances are: carbon disulfide; carbon monoxide, chloroform, dimethyl sulfate, epichlorohydrin (used in some epoxy mixtures), ethylene dichloride, glutaraldehyde, n-hexane, 2-hexanone, hydrazine, hydrogen sulfide, manganese, and manganese compounds, mercury and mercury compounds, nitrogen dioxide, perchloroethylene, sulfur anhydride, toluene, toluene diisocyanate, trimellitic anydride and vinyl chloride. While this list is not large there are several widely used chemicals covered by the proposed new regulations. Many painting operations use toluene as a paint solvent or thinner. Almost all welding rods contain manganese or will generated manganese or manganese compound fumes. Perchloroethylene is widely used in cleaning and degreasing operations. You should review your lists of chemicals used in your processes to determine if you will be impacted by the forthcoming regulations.

<HR>

<H2>Perchloroethylene Not A VOC</H2>
Perchloroethylene is no longer classified as a Volatile Organic Compound (VOC) for purposes of the ozone depletion regulations. In a rule issued February 5, 1996, perchloroethylene was listed as "negligibly reactive" when released to the atmosphere. This compound is still considered a "hazardous air pollutant" and continues to be regulated under the HAP regulations and the hazardous waste regulations of RCRA.

<HR>

<H2>New EPCRA 313 Reporting Deadline for 1996</H2>
The government shutdowns in December and January have resulted in an extension to August 1, 1996 for submission of required "Form R" reporting under section 313 of EPCRA. The agency said it does not expect to mail out the required forms until mid to late April.

<HR>

<H2>Used Oil Mixture Rule Revisited Again</H2>
EPA's administrative stay (40 CFR 279.10(b)(2)) which said that generators would no longer be able to mix their used oil with hazardous waste has been overturned.

<P>

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit overturned the decision to claim a stay action on the used oil ruling.  An administrative stay can delay proceedings of a proposed regulation, however a stay cannot suspend rules that have already been adopted until there is time for public notice and comment.

<P>

According to the used oil regulations (40 CFR 279.10 (b)(2)(iii)), mixtures of used oil and hazardous waste which solely exhibit the characteristic of ignitability are regulated as used oil as long as the resulting mixture does not meet the definition of ignitability.  However, if the resulting mixture is EPA ignitable, then the resulting mixture would be classified as hazardous waste.

<P>

The final news is that EPA will allow more time for comment on this issue before taking action on existing used oil regulations, and used oil mixed with hazardous waste (solely ignitable) won't be subject to stringent RCRA requirements unless it is ignitable.

<H2>EPA Announces New, Flexible Ways to Meet Clean Air Act Standards</H2>
On March 25, 1996, EPA announced a draft final regulation that will ensure that all types of industrial categories as yet unregulated by the agency must protect the public from toxic air pollutants until an applicable federal standard for the industry is issued. The action could result in a substantial reduction in paperwork, while still protecting public health. It also allows states a transition period to prevent project delays for sources where construction is about to start.

<P>

The proposal limits requirements to the facilities where air toxic emissions are likely to be highest-, such as the construction of new facilities, and the reconstruction of large existing facilities. The proposed regulation removes the complex requirements for modifications at existing facilities. An existing source would only be affected if it adds or rebuilds a large production line or process that emits air toxics above the "major" source threshold in the Clean Air Act (above 10 tons annually for any single pollutant or above 25 tons annually for a combination of pollutants). 

<P>

Under the 1990 Amendments to the Act, EPA is required to regulate by category major industrial facilities that emit one or more of 189 congressionally-listed air toxics. EPA has already issued air toxic standards for 47 different industrial categories and expects to regulate most remaining industries by the year 2000.

<P>

The proposal is computer-accessible immediately through EPA's Technology Transfer Network (TTN) at (919) 541-5742 under "Recently Signed Rules" on the TTN's Clean Air Act Amendments bulletin board.

<HR>

<H2>ISO 14000 Update</H2>
The final voting on the proposed ISO 1400x series of standards related to environmental management systems (EMSs) is scheduled to be complete by April 1996. No substantial changes from the proposed standards or requirements are expected. Insurance companies in the United Kingdom, Japan, and Switzerland are prepared to promise rate reductions for companies which promote "best environmental practices" including installing an ISO 14001 EMS. The US DOE has stated that certification under the ISO standards will be required of certain contractors beyond 1997. Several state agencies are meeting to determine what regulatory relief will be available to companies or organizations certified under the ISO standards.

<P>

In a related note, an Arthur D. Little survey reported that 60 percent of managers of large corporations surveyed see certification as a competitive advantage in the market place. The same survey reported that 90 percent stated that their EMS should be at least equivalent to the minimum ISO 14001 requirements.

<P>

Now is the time to get informed about these important standards and to begin the first steps in meeting the requirements that will most probably lead to reduced waste or compliance costs.

On December 21, 1995, EPA proposed the establishment of constituent-specific exit levels for low-risk solid wastes designated as hazardous because they are listed, or because they have been mixed with, derived from, or contain listed hazardous wastes. Under this proposal, if you generate a listed hazardous waste that meets the self-implementing exit levels, it will no longer be subject to the hazardous waste management system under Subtitle C of RCRA as listed hazardous waste. The proposal, referred to as the Hazardous Waste Identification Rule (HWIR), establishes a risk-based "floor" to hazardous waste listings. EPA says it will encourage pollution prevention, waste minimization, and the development of innovative waste treatment technologies. This proposal would apply to wastes generated from manufacturing processes as well as soil and groundwater that contain listed wastes.
<P>
Many of the exit levels were established using an innovative risk assessment which evaluates potential exposure pathways, both direct and indirect, from a variety of sources such as waste piles and surface impoundments. This assessment focused on both human and environmental receptors. The remaining exit levels are based on an alternative risk analysis.
<P>
To exit Subtitle C regulation as a listed hazardous waste, all the listed hazardous constituents (in a proposed new Appendix X of 40 CFR 261) would require concentrations less than or equal to the numeric exit levels, and when specified, the waste must meet the applicable land disposal restriction requirements at 40 CFR 268. EPA derived the constituent list from constituents listed in Appendix VII, Basis for Listing Hazardous Waste; Appendix VIII, Hazardous Constituents; and Appendix IX of part 264, the Ground-Water Monitoring List.
<P>
For an eligible waste to exit Subtitle C, every constituent in the waste must be below its exit level. The proposed exit levels are in Appendix X of 40 CFR 261, Tables A and B. Table A includes constituents and their risk exit values which can be measured analytically. Table B includes quantitation limits (exemption quantitation criteria, or EQCs) as exit levels for waste constituents which cannot be measured at the modeled or extrapolated risk value. EPA will require compliance with the land disposal restrictions as an additional condition of exit, for any waste exempted through a constituent exit level on Table B. With each waste stream for which you want an exemption, you'll be required to test the waste for all of the constituents on Appendix X expected to be present in the waste. At a minimum, you must test for the following if they are on Appendix X:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>	Appendix VII constituents for which your waste was listed,
<LI>	LDR constituents in 268.40 for the waste,
<LI>	constituents identified in previous analyses of the waste,
<LI>	constituents added to the process that generated the waste, and
<LI>	constituents that you know may be in the waste.
</UL>
<P>
You must also develop and implement a sampling and analysis plan. There is overlap for some constituents between Tables A & B. For example, the wastewater exit level for a constituent may be on Table A, but the nonwastewater exit level may be on Table B. Also, if an exit level does not exist on Table A or B for a particular constituent, the waste need not be tested for that constituent. For example, some constituents that are hydrolyzers have exit levels for nonwastewaters, but not for wastewaters.
<P>
EPA proposed two exit level options. In Option 1, Maximum Contaminant Levels (MCLs) from the Drinking Water program are used as an acceptable toxicity exposure for human drinking water exposure and toxicity benchmarks are used for other exposures. In Option 2, toxicity benchmarks are used as acceptable exposure levels for all exposures. The effect of co-proposing these two options is that there are two independent sets of proposed exit levels. If your web browser supports tables, you may follow this link to <A NAME="TABLEA"></A><A HREF="TABLEA.HTM">see an excerpt of Table A</A>. You may also choose to <A HREF="APPENDIX.HTM">download the entire table here</A>.

<P>

Columns 3, 4, and 5 of proposed Tables A and B include the exit levels based on MCLs. Columns 6, 7, and 8 are the exit levels based on toxicity benchmarks. Columns 1 and 2 include the chemical names and CAS (Chemical Abstracts Service) numbers.
Other steps involved in obtaining this exemption will include notifying EPA, publishing a notice in a local newspaper that you are claiming this exemption, and re-testing or certifying your waste if there are any changes in the information that you submitted. To maintain your exemption, re-testing is required under a schedule that depends on the amount of waste generated each year.

<P>
<IMG  SRC="EPAMIX.GIF"  ALT="Oil Mixtures" ALIGN=LEFT>Until recently, the federal used oil rules allowed mixtures of characteristic hazardous waste and used oil which no longer displayed a characteristic to be managed as used oil. On October 30, 1995, EPA announced an administrative stay of the regulations (40 CFR 279.10(b)(2)) applicable to mixtures of used oil destined for recycling and characteristic hazardous waste or waste listed as hazardous because it solely exhibits a hazardous waste characteristic. The stay reinstates the regulatory requirements ordinarily applicable to mixtures containing hazardous waste, along with other applicable regulatory requirements including land-disposal restrictions (LDRs) until the agency completes a new rulemaking. The stay became effective December 29, 1995.
<P> 
The new rulemaking was based upon the Chemical Waste Management, Inc. v. EPA decision which challenged portions of the EPA's LDR regulations because the prior used oil rule allowed dilution of certain characteristic hazardous wastes with used oil instead of treatment. As a result, some such mixtures (or residuals) containing significant levels of hazardous constituents potentially could be disposed in land-disposal units without adequate prior treatment.
<P> 
The court held that dilution only removed the short-term threat posed by the characteristic and did not address the long-term threat posed by hazardous constituents that could be present in such wastes. Therefore, the Chemical Waste Management decision appears to indicate that such mixtures should be subject to LDRs, unless no hazardous constituents are present in concentrations sufficient to pose a threat to human health or the environment.
<P> 
EPA plans to propose a rule in the near future concerning how mixtures of used oil destined for recycling and characteristic hazardous wastes should be regulated under RCRA in light of the Chemical Waste Management decision and other comments. EPA believes that further analysis is needed to determine whether mixtures of used oil destined for recycling and characteristic hazardous wastes differ significantly from other mixtures containing characteristic wastes in terms of potential threat to human health and the environment.
<P> 
According to the ruling, you may not dilute your characteristic hazardous waste to render it non-hazardous. In addition, if the resulting mixture exhibits a characteristic, it must be managed as a hazardous waste. Used oil which is mixed with listed waste (that is not listed solely for a characteristic) will be also be classified as hazardous waste. The stay replaces the used oil mixture regulation (40 CFR 279.10 (b)(2)(iii)) with the hazardous waste mixture rule (40 CFR 261.3 (a)(2)(iii)) and makes the LDRs applicable to all mixtures of used oil and hazardous waste.
<P>
Persons who change their own oil ("do-it-yourselfers") and conditionally exempt small quantity generators (no more than 100 kilograms of hazardous waste per month) will not be impacted by the stay.

On December 6, 1994, (59 FR 62896), the Office of Air and Radiation of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency published a new rule adding Subpart CC-Air Emission Standards for Tanks, Surface Impoundments, and Containers to 40 CFR 264-Standards for Owners and Operators of Hazardous Waste Treatment, Storage, and Disposal Facilities. The Office of Air and Radiation is not where we usually expect hazardous waste rules to come from, but in this case, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) required air emission rules for storage or accumulation in tanks, surface impoundments, and containers.
<P>
June 5, 1995 was the effective date originally set by EPA for large quantity generators and owners/operators of treatment, storage, and disposal facilities to comply with the monitoring, documentation, and management of emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from waste streams accumulated in tanks, containers, and surface impoundments. In EPA's estimates, implementation of the subpart CC regulations will reduce nationwide organic emissions from TSD facilities and generator wastes stored in tanks, surface impoundments, and containers by over 1,400,000 metric tons per year. EPA also predicts that the reduction in VOCs will address many air quality problems including ambient ozone formation, adverse human health effects from inhalation of air toxins, and the depletion of stratospheric ozone.
<P>
On May 19, 1995 (60 FR 26828), EPA published a notice delaying the effective date of the new rules until December 6, 1995. Then, on November 13, 1995 (60 FR 56952), EPA further delayed the effective date of the rules until June 6,1996.
<P>
Both notices announcing the postponement of the effective date for the final Subpart CC rules noted that since the initial promulgation, EPA became aware that certain provisions of the final standards may require clarification. EPA plans to publish a later Federal Register document to clarify those provisions. This process may result in compliance options that facilities do not realize are available. To ensure that all options are clear to affected facilities, and to ensure that all affected facilities have time to make any such alterations in their compliance plan prior to the effective date of the standards, EPA is postponing the effective date of the final rule to June 6, 1996.

TRI reporting requirements are expanding! Spring of this year is expected to bring changes in the TRI reporting requirements. EPA plans to announce several changes which will affect facilities required to file Toxic Release Inventory reports, commonly referred to as the TRI or Form R reports.
<P> 
The TRI program was formed under Section 313 of the Emergency Planning and Community Right-To-Know Act, (EPCRA) or SARA Title III, in order to establish a publicly available database of toxic chemical information. Under the Act, facilities are required to report their environmental releases of any of the more than 600 listed toxic chemicals which are made, produced, or used by the facility in quantities equal to or in excess of specified amounts. Reporting facilities must submit their TRI reports to EPA and state agencies annually by July 1 of each year.
<P>
For some time, according to EPA, there has been interest in expanding the TRI to include additional facilities and requiring a more comprehensive data set be reported. The last significant phase of TRI expansion was a 1994 chemical expansion rule that added 286 new chemicals and chemical categories to the TRI list of toxic chemicals. The upcoming second expansion phase adds to the types of industries covered by the TRI requirements. EPA states that the third expansion phase could fill in what the agency says are "remaining data collection gaps" by providing information on chemicals moving through communities and workplaces in products.
<P>
Currently, only facilities that fall within Standard Industrial Classification Codes (SIC) 20-39 and federal facilities have the potential to be subject to regulation under the Section 313 requirements. Industries that EPA is considering for addition to the reporting requirement include electric utilities, waste management facilities, mining, and oil and gas production facilities. Materials recovery and recycling activities as well as certain warehousing activities may also be included.
<P>
According to an EPA issues paper released in the fall of 1995, another change in the TRI reporting program is expected to be announced in March of this year. This modification is an expansion of the type of chemical end use and chemical exposure data that EPA obtains through the TRI reports. The issues paper was in response to an August 8, 1995 memorandum, issued in conjunction with Executive Order No. 12969, from President Clinton to EPA Administrator Carol Browner. In the memorandum, EPA was directed to develop and implement a plan to expand the TRI reporting requirements by adding information on mass balance, materials accounting, or other chemical use data to the reporting form.
<P>
According to the issues paper, EPA may include materials accounting data and worker exposure information in future versions of the TRI report format. Materials accounting (MA) involves determining the amount of a chemical at key points in its progression through the processes at a facility. MA differs from engineering mass balance in that mass balance is a more technical procedure and requires the measurement of process streams. In the past, the National Research Council has concluded that a materials accounting approach would satisfy the public right-to-know intent of TRI and would also create less of a reporting burden to industries subject to these requirements.
<P>
The issues paper stated that EPA is considering adding the following data elements to the TRI:
<P>
<UL>  
<LI>	Starting amount of raw material inventory;
<LI>	Amount of toxic chemicals brought on-site;
<LI>	Amount of toxic chemicals produced or manufactured on-site;
<LI>	Amount of toxic chemicals processed on-site;
<LI>	Amount of toxic chemicals otherwise used;
<LI>	Total input amount of toxic chemicals;
<LI>	Amount of toxic chemicals shipped off-site;
<LI>	Ending raw material amount;
<LI>	Amount of toxic chemicals stored on-site in product;
<LI>	Amount of toxic chemicals shipped off-site in product;
<LI>	Total number of workers on-site;
<LI>	Number of workers potentially exposed to the reported toxic chemicals; and
<LI>	Whether exposure monitoring has been performed at the site.
</UL>
<P>
Six data gaps in the current TRI, which EPA may choose to address in future actions, were identified in the issues paper. These data gaps include:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>	Lack of information on the flow and use of toxic chemicals at a facility;
<LI>	Need to track toxic chemicals in products;
<LI>	Need for a scorecard to promote and track pollution prevention/source reduction efforts;
<LI>	Lack of a ledger check on TRI estimates;
<LI>	Need to enhance the TRI for regulatory integration efforts; and 
<LI>	Need to identify and research issues such as multiple chemical exposures.
</UL>

A clear understanding of an employee's work functions and an understanding of the training programs required by each regulatory agency is essential to maintaining compliance with the multiple laws governing training for employees who work with potentially dangerous chemicals. Each employee's duties and the chemicals they work with should be evaluated and documented to establish the applicability of environmental, safety, and health training requirements.
<P>
Take Jeff, for example, a degreaser technician, who operates a parts washing machine that uses methylene chloride. On a weekly schedule, Jeff drains the used degreasing solvent from the machine and places it in 55 gallon drums. The used solvents are transported to a solvent recovery facility to be recycled every 90 days.
Jeff's duties and the chemicals he works with require OSHA hazard communication training, RCRA hazardous waste training, and DOT hazmat training.
<P>
The topics that must be covered under these three programs overlap significantly. Each training program is regulated by a different agency and during an inspection you need to show clear documentation that all employees have met each particular agency's training requirements.
<P>
Due to the complexity of the information that must be presented, the differences in the frequency of training, and the independent certification requirements, employee training documentation must be managed very carefully. In industrial settings where there are many employees who must receive training, a computer database such as <A HREF="TRNTRK.HTM">Training Management Software (TMS)</A> is useful to manage and document training compliance. In <A HREF="TRNTRK.HTM">Training Management Software (TMS)</A>, each employee has an independent file which identifies their work function, the training topics required for that employee, the required frequency of training, and the latest training date for each topic.
<P>
At any time a training record can be generated that shows any or all of the training that Jeff has received. This information can be arranged to document compliance with each regulatory program. Also, the database will warn the user of any employee who has a training deficiency. This allows a manager to track, document, and schedule training modules to ensure compliance.
<P>
When evaluating training compliance, the three regulatory agencies will request to see different types of documentation. The databases allow you to generate pre-selected reports that are specific to the requirements of a regulatory inspection.
<A HREF="TRNTRK.HTM">Training Management Software (TMS)</A>;  is essential to keeping your facility in compliance. See for yourself by calling 1-800-537-2372 for a free demo disk or <A HREF="DEMOS.HTM">download a copy here</A>.

Waste minimization strategies that go <I>Beyond Compliance</I>   are a long term solution to rising waste management costs and disposal liabilities. Preventing or eliminating waste at its source not only makes sense for long term environmental health, it can result in substantial benefits.
<P>
It takes informed employees to achieve waste minimization. Since employees are ultimately the people that will implement waste prevention ideas, make them a part of waste minimization strategies. Teach them the company and employee benefits of waste minimization strategies.
<P>
<H3>Economic Benefits</H3>

Regulations governing the handling, storage, treatment, and disposal of waste have caused a significant increase in waste management costs. Reduction efforts offer a way to reduce disposal, permitting, and insurance costs. Also, production costs are reduced through better management and reuse of spent materials, thus reducing the risk of employee layoffs.
<P> 
You may decide to reward employees for their efforts toward waste minimization. These rewards may be either financial or in the form of personal recognition, or both. You could: 
<OL>
<LI>return some of the savings to the budget of the department that generated the savings; 
<LI>establish a special bonus for teams that achieve their waste minimization goals;
<LI>use some of the savings to buy successful team members "waste buster" jackets or coffee mugs; 
<LI>use the savings for high priority budget items that were not funded; or 
<LI>send your entire team to an Environmental Resource Center workshop in Orlando!
</OL>
<P>
<H3>Decreased Employee Exposure</H3>

Waste minimization strategies that reduce the volume or toxicity of waste also decrease employee exposure to toxic constituents making jobs easier and safer.
<P>
<H3>Environmental Benefits & Minimization of Liability</H3>

Myth No. 1: When waste leaves the plant, it is gone for good. Improper waste management may someday pollute your workers' neighborhoods and potentially harm their families. How we manage (or mismanage) hazardous waste is a crucial environmental issue with vast implications for public health and the ecological systems on which we depend.
<P>
<H3>Improvement of Corporate Image</H3>

Because of several incidents in the past involving industrial wastes, the general public is extremely sensitive to industrial releases and mismanagement of wastes. In addition, the public is becoming increasingly more informed. Consumers are looking at your company's policies, and a positive image associated with reducing waste could improve public perception about your company.
<P>
<H3>Government Mandate</H3>

Section 3002(b) of RCRA requires hazardous waste generators who ship hazardous waste off-site to certify on the manifest that an economically practicable waste minimization program is in place at their facilities, and the generator has selected the practicable method of treatment, storage, or disposal currently available. Section 3005(h) requires owners/operators of permitted on-site treatment, storage, and disposal facilities to make the same certification at least annually. Small quantity generators certify on the manifest that they have made a good faith effort to minimize the generation of hazardous waste and have selected the best, affordable waste management method available.
<P>
This column, "Waste Minimization Pays Off" explores what companies have done to minimize or prevent waste. Sharing successful waste minimization programs will serve to benefit everyone.

Confronted with escalating costs for waste disposal and concerns for increased liabilities, companies and government agencies and installations that generate waste have responded with waste minimization strategies. Many of these minimization strategies go <I>Beyond Compliance</I> .
Frequently, good materials are disposed of as waste before they are spent. Employees are usually the first to recognize waste, and with encouragement, can minimize waste. Here are just four ways employees can save money:<BR>
 
<OL>
<LI>Many preventative maintenance programs set specific times to change filter media; instead, encourage employees to change filters only when they are spent. An increase in pressure drop, indicated by a differential pressure gage, across the filter bag is a good indicator that it is time to change a dirty filter. Also available are filters on rolls that automatically advance when the pressure across the filter media builds up.
<LI>Many materials that are removed from filter housing, pipes or hoses, and containers may still be usable. Frequently, these materials can be used directly in the process or transferred to a new container.
<LI>Material losses from spills, leaks, and evaporation are difficult to measure and are often underestimated. Consequently, these losses are often a low priority. One leak, extrapolated over a year, and multiplied by the number of such leaks can be significant. Although it seems obvious, we often fail to recognize that material leaking is being paid for three times. First, as raw materials; second, for disposal; and third, to replace it. The best leak detection system available today may be employees.
<LI>Create an in-plant waste exchange. If one department or shop area has unused or partially used materials that they want to dispose of, check to see if another department needs it before they dispose of it. Anything from unused bench stock or partially filled aerosol containers is a candidate. If you can't use it on-site, maybe someone else can use it off-site. Make sure, however, that wastes use it for a beneficial purpose and be sure that they are not speculatively accumulated.

The International Standards Organization (ISO) has established standards for environmental compliance that go well beyond simply meeting legal requirements.  These standards make up the ISO 14001 program. The five elements of the program include:
<BR>

<OL>
<LI>Commitment and Policy
<LI>Planning
<LI>Implementation
<LI>Measurement and Evaluation
<LI>Review and Improvement
</OL>

<BR>
If your organization has been involved with the ISO 9000 standards related to quality certification, you will note a definite similarity.  The intent of the ISO 14001 standards is to define structured systems that recognize organizations with a systematic approach to continual improvement of environmental management. Although the final requirements of the ISO certification process have not yet been confirmed by all of the ISO committees, there is currently enough information available to allow you to begin preparations.
Start the process by establishing your organization's policy and commitment statements and conducting a survey of your existing systems to determine actions or changes which will be required to meet the standards.
During the survey of your existing systems, you should:

<BR>
<UL>
<LI>Identify the legislative and regulatory requirements which impact your facility
<LI>Identify the environmental aspects of all activities, products, and services produced or conducted at your facility to determine which may produce significant environmental impact or liabilities
<LI>Evaluate your performance compared to relevant internal criteria, external standards, regulations, codes of practice, and benchmarks
<LI>Determine your existing environmental management practices and procedures
<LI>Identify existing policies and procedures related to procurement and contracting
<LI>Examine feedback and reports from the investigations of previous incidents or non-compliance situations
<LI>Examine opportunities for competitive advantage in your industry due to your management of environmental issues
<LI>Determine the views of all parties that will be incorporated into the program from existing programs
<LI>Determine existing functions or activities that may enable or impede environmental performance
</UL><BR>


Concurrent with the review process, your organization should establish a formal policy which clearly defines your organization's commitment and goals related to the environment, continual review, and improvement.  It is not necessary for this statement to stand alone; it may be part of a larger organizational policy statement, but certain elements must be present in order to establish it as an ISO 14001 policy statement.
The following questions can serve as a guide to the construction of your policy statement:

<BR>
<OL>
<LI>Does your organization currently have an environmental policy that is relevant to all of your activities, as well as any products or services produced?
<LI>Does the policy reflect your organization's values and guiding principles?
<LI>Has the environmental policy been approved by top management and has someone been identified and given the authority to oversee and implement the policy?
<LI>Does the policy guide the setting of environmental objectives and targets?
<LI>Does the policy guide your organization towards monitoring appropriate technology and management practices?
<LI>What commitments are embodied in the environmental policy (e.g. support for continual improvement, support for pollution prevention, meeting and monitoring legal requirements, worker training, considering the expectations of other interested parties, etc.)?
</OL>
<BR>

The policy should be a comprehensive document designed to guide the progress of the company in environmental compliance throughout many years to come. While the policy may be used to set short term goals and objectives, specific items should not be included in the policy.  The inclusion of specific items in a guiding policy will make it necessary to revise the policy frequently and undermine its credibility as a long-term document.
Once your organization has completed the review process and developed a policy statement, you will be well on your way to compliance with ISO 14001 standards when they are finalized. This early preparation will pay off in dividends of lowered compliance costs, higher quality goods and services, and goodwill towards your neighbors for years to come.<BR>

<CENTER><H1>How to Determine SARA Reportable Chemicals</H1></CENTER>

<CENTER><h5>Esther Christian<br>
Environmental Consultant</h5></CENTER><BR>

As 1995 ends, you should be thinking of your Tier II reports required by SARA Title III (Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act). Although these reports are not due until March 1, you can compile your reportable information now and even beat the reporting deadline this year!
Two groups of chemicals must be reported on the Tier II form: 1) OSHA Hazardous Chemicals present in a quantity of 10,000 pounds or greater and 2) Extremely Hazardous Substances (EHS) present in a quantity greater than or equal to 500 pounds or the Threshold Planning Quantity (TPQ) of the chemical (whichever of these quantities is the more stringent reporting requirement applies).<BR>

This article presents a 4-step process to determine which chemicals must be reported on your Tier II. Additionally, we've included some tips to help you organize your chemical inventory control program so that next year the determination process will be a snap!<br>

<h2>Hazardous Chemical Inventory</h2>

Survey all operations at your facility to identify all OSHA hazardous chemicals that your facility manufactures, processes, uses, and stores on-site. Walk through every work area, examine every process, and look into each storage area. Compile a list by gathering and studying all Material Safety Data Sheets, searching records for all chemicals that have been purchased since May 17,1987, and surveying all department managers.<BR>

Be careful not to limit your search to just those chemicals you believe are dangerous. For SARA Title III reporting, the term "hazardous chemical" is used as it is defined at 29 CFR 1910.1200, OSHA's Hazard Communication Standard. This means that any chemical with a physical or health hazard associated with it must be considered in your determination. However, if a material is exempt from consideration as an OSHA hazardous chemical under 29 CFR 1910.1200, it is also exempt from the SARA Title III reporting requirements.
Chemicals with physical hazards include combustible liquids, compressed gases, explosives, flammables, organic peroxides, oxidizers, pyrophorics, unstable reactives, or water reactives. Chemicals with health hazards are those that may cause immediate or delayed health effects. This includes chemicals that are carcinogens, toxic or highly toxic agents, reproductive toxins, irritants, corrosives, sensitizers, hepatotoxins, nephrotoxins, neurotoxins, materials that act on the hematopoietic system, and materials that damage the lungs, skin, eyes, or mucous membranes.<BR>

As you conduct your on-site search, you should compile a list of every hazardous chemical that you encounter. As you determine which materials are hazardous chemicals, list the names as they appear on the Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS). Also, if known, indicate the appropriate storage code and storage location. Consider organizing your list as shown in Figure 1.<br>

<H2>Check MSDS Records for All Hazardous Chemicals</H2>
Obtain or develop an MSDS for every chemical that you have on your list. Write or call immediately for any missing MSDSs. Prepare a checklist so that you can cross out each chemical when the requested MSDS arrives and easily note those that do not arrive. Check each MSDS to be certain it is for the chemical that is used at your site, and that the MSDS is legible and complete.<br>

<H2>Identify Extremely Hazardous Substances</H2>
Next, determine if any of the materials identified for your hazardous chemical list are comprised entirely of or contain any Extremely Hazardous Substances (EHS). The EHS list, including threshold planning quantities (TPQ), is published as Appendices A and B of 40 CFR 355.<BR>
 
You can typically obtain most information for each material from the MSDS. The name of each EHS should next be added to your list in the column marked "EHS Name" on Figure 1. Also, enter the TPQ for the EHS in the column marked "TPQ." Enter the percent by weight of each EHS present in each material on your list. Compile the total number of pounds present at your facility for any EHS present. This total (aggregate) amount for each EHS is compared to the 500 lb./TPQ reporting trigger.<BR>

One important concept to remember when making the TPQ determination is that you may encounter an EHS with two TPQs on the EHS list, such as phenol (500/10,000 lbs.). A material with two TPQs is a solid under conditions of standard temperature and pressure. The regulations state that you must use the lower number if any of the following three criteria are met for an EHS:
<UL>
<LI> the solid exists in powdered form and has a particle size less than 100 microns, or
<LI> the solid is handled in solution or in molten form, or
<LI> the solid meets the criteria for a National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) rating of 2, 3, or 4 for reactivity (refer to NFPA 704 in their latest edition of "Fire Protection Guide on Hazardous Materials").
</UL><br>

<H2>Identify Chemical Inventory Amounts</H2>
Enter the maximum amount and average amount for each material on-site. The maximum amount on-site would be based on your facility's chemical inventories over the previous calendar year. All measures of quantity must be converted to pounds. While this presents little challenge if your facility purchases a material as a solid, a calculation is required if a material is present on-site as a liquid or gas. If the material is a liquid, the calculation requires a specific gravity or density as well as a volume amount. To convert gallons to pounds, perform one of the following two calculations:<BR>

<OL>
<LI>  (Gallons of Liquid) x (Specific Gravity) x (8.3 lbs/gal) = Pounds of Liquid
<LI>  (Gallons of Liquid) x (Density of Liquid) = Pounds of Liquid If the material is a gas, you are only required to determine the number of pounds of the gas on-site, i.e., you need not include the weight of the gas cylinder. The pounds of a gas are calculated in a similar fashion as the pounds of a liquid. You need to know whether the material in the cylinder is a gas or has been com-pressed to a liquid, and the corresponding vapor or liquid density (the density of a liquid is not equal to the density of a vapor). Pounds can then be determined by adapting equation (2) into one of the two following forms:
<LI>  (Volume of Gas*) x (Density of Vapor) = Pounds of Gas	
<LI>  (Volume of Liquid*) x (Density of Liquid) = Pounds of Liquid *  a conventional unit of measure is "cubic feet," in which case density would carry units of pounds per cubic foot.
</OL>

There are "de minimis" exemptions when regulated substances are present in mixtures at very low concentrations. EPA allows you to omit materials from your Tier determination that are present in very small amounts.
Under Section 312 of SARA Title III, components of mixtures only need to be factored into your determinations if the hazardous component is present in a concentration of greater than 1% (by weight) or 0.1% (by weight) for materials considered by OSHA to be carcinogens.<BR>
 
The data obtained in steps 1 - 4 will be all you need to complete your Tier II forms. If you find that you have to report on more than a few chemicals, it might be easier to use software to collect the data and print the forms. Use the order form and select product number 1099 for a demo disk of software that can create your Tier II reports as well as the Form R report that is required by Section 313 of SARA Title III.<BR>

Looking for an easier, more effective way to prepare OSHA safety and health compliance programs? Concerned about the completeness and accuracy of your safety programs?
<P>
Since failure to maintain and implement written safety programs is a leading source of OSHA violations, and creating new plans is a time consuming process, Environmental Resource Center has welcome news. A set of compliance programs is now available that can satisfy all your OSHA compliance program requirements. Each program comes with a complete set of instructions, a thorough hard copy document, and software that allows you to customize the program to meet the needs of your workplace and produce high quality originals. The hard copy is bound in an attractive 3-ring binder with printed instructions, a complete plan, plus attachments, forms, and checklists as appropriate. The software comes on a 3 1/2 inch diskette and includes a series of files that can be read by most popular word processing applications (such as WordPerfect and Microsoft Word) that allow you to modify the program to reflect organization-specific information.<P>

A new and enhanced Material Inventory Report System (MIRS) version 3.4 was just announced and will be available in January. This easy-to-use, modular program offers automated solutions for SARA Title III reporting (including Tier I, Tier II, and Form R), MSDS management, CAA management, waste tracking, inventory tracking, NPDES, and state/local reporting.<P>
 
For the 1995 reporting year, there are a number of SARA Title III changes. EPA has added 286 chemicals to the TRI reportable chemicals list (there are now over 5,700 identified chemicals for the section 313 Form R alone). EPA also has made some important delisting decisions involving acetone and ammonium sulfate solution.<P>

MIRS software will keep you current every year <I>before</I>  the deadlines. You will also be one step ahead of EPA with thorough work sheets, audit trails, and multi-year reports.<P>

Whether you work on the latest Pentium workstation over a sophisticated network or on an older stand-alone DOS machine, there is a version of MIRS to meet your needs. The Windows version of MIRS is Windows `95 compatible and offers new features like automatic print driver compatibility, which is especially useful for network applications.<P>
 
Other MIRS features include read-only network access of company MSDS records, an expanded CAA module, a Chemical List Extension that has over 13,000 chemicals/categories, plus analysis and reporting capabilities of consolidated information with the Corporate MIRS module.<P>
 
MIRS continues to offer you the best set of tools for greatly simplifying your environmental compliance and safety data management responsibilities. To learn more or to request a demo, call 1-800-537-2372 or you may choose to <A HREF="DEMOS.HTM">download a demo here</A>.

There is a new reference for environmental, health and safety professionals that will change the way you think of Material Safety Data Sheets. Imagine how much file space it would take to hold over 162,000 MSDSs. Now imagine them all on two CD-ROMs. The MSDS Database on CD-ROM includes all products and chemicals purchased by the U. S. government that require material safety data sheets and is considered the largest and most comprehensive compilation of its kind in the world.<P>
Each MSDS record contains over 230 data fields, including:
<UL>
<LI>product identification data
<LI>general information
<LI>health hazard data
<LI>physical/chemical characteristics
<LI>fire and explosive hazard data
<LI>reactivity data
<LI>precautions for safe handling and use
<LI>control measures
<LI>disposal data
<LI>label data
<LI>ingredient data
<LI>record control data and more!
</UL>
<BR>

A complete search and retrieval engine is built-in, and information from the database may be sent to a printer or exported as either an ASCII or dBase file.<P>

The price for an annual subscription, which includes quarterly updates, is $325. Access over a local area network is available at no additional cost. In addition to using the database to locate MSDSs for the products you use today, you can also use it to find safer alternates, competitive products, or to find out the composition and hazards of products that you are considering for purchase. This thorough resource is an excellent value that you can order today by calling 1-800-537-2372 (ask for product #1255).<P>

<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>USAF RDLL</TITLE></HEAD><BODY>
<H2>The United States Air Force Research and Development Liaison Office - London  <BR>
(USAF RDLL)</H2>

<H3>Background</H3>

USAF RDLL was created in the mid 1980s to place specific representation in-country for USAF international cooperative R&D, acquisition (including acquisition logistics) (ICRDA) with the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (UK).  USAF RDLL works closely with other organizations in the UK that participate in the broad ICRDA mission spectrum. Three are collocated with USAF RDLL in the Edison House in London:  the USAF European Office of Aerospace Research and Development (EOARD), the Office of Naval Research-Europe (ONREUR), and the US Army Research, Development, and Standardization Group (USARDSG).  Another is the DOD Office of Defense Cooperation (ODC) in the US embassy. <P> 

The focus then and now is to integrate the broad range of activities touching on but beyond the "science" mission of the EOARD and touching on but not overlapping with the "Foreign Military Sales" mission of the ODC-London.  Also, in contrast to EOARDs pan-European coverage, RDLL concentrates on the UK.  In contrast to ODC-Londons DOD interests, USAF RDLL concentrates on USAF interests.  <P>

USAF RDLL reports to the Deputy Under Secretary of the Air Force (International Affairs) Armaments Cooperation Division (SAF/IAQ).  When communicating with USAF RDLL consider it "SAF/IAQ(UK)".  The term USAF RDLL derives from the fact that the much older, original, sister office in Bonn GE has always used the simple abbreviation "RDLO", stemming most likely from an old HQ USAF organizational symbol, AF/RDLO, reporting to AF/RD-I.  What was once AF/RD-I became SAF/AQXI in the late 1980s.  In 1994, SAF/IAQ was created out of the former SAF/AQXI.<P>

<H3>Mission</H3><P>

As we were quoted in a recent (3 Sep 94) Janes Defence Weekly article, "USAF RDLL is to maximize the benefits of and demonstrate USAF commitment to US-UK cooperation in order to strengthen USAF capabilities through acquisition of the best technologies available and interoperability".  In simpler terms, the mission of USAF RDLL is to seek out, promote, and support ICRDA for the mutual benefit of the USAF and the UK.  USAF RDLL works closely with the British Ministry of Defence (MOD) and its RDT&E support establishments, including the Defence Evaluation and Research Agency (DERA) as of 1 Apr 95, and industry.  The Janes article expands in detail on USAF RDLL.  There are seven areas of mission responsibility:  

<OL>
<LI>Identify key UK technologies and requirements.  This is accomplished through close observation and interaction with the MOD Operational Requirements and Scientific Staffs, DERAs Defence Research Agency (DRA) and the other establishments, and through meetings and visits with UK defense equipment suppliers.  The last are often referred to USAF RDLL by the Defence Export Services Organization (DESO).  USAF RDLL does not indiscriminantly send UK industry knocking on USAF lab and program office doors.  We screen and advise industry if they have something of potential interest to the USAF, what points are of main interest, and how to communicate with American customers, then attempt to coordinate with the right people to review the technological information before ever passing industry along.  This area is among the toughest to work due to our limited resources and the nature of the area.
<P>
<LI>Advise US/UK senior leadership of their counterparts government/industry policies, procedures, organization, and situation.  This is accomplished mainly in two ways:  1) by obtaining information and briefing various audiences, 2) by collecting news items from sources not readily available in the US and forwarding to selected audiences and/or publishing summaries in London Calling!, the USAF RDLL newsletter.  This area has taken increasing proportions of USAF RDLL resources as the Post Cold War Era brings on massive reorganizations and physical moves on both sides.
<P>
<LI>Prompt, arrange, and facilitate meetings and visits among appropriate officials.  USAF RDLL also accompanies visitors who need help in-country.  USAF RDLL enjoys special rates at a convenient hotel nearby for visitors.  For the convenience of its visitors, USAF RDLL maintains a visitor support office in its suite for visitors to work.  Visits to the UK are not "controlled" by USAF RDLL, but visitors are encouraged to inform USAF RDLL via their country clearance message if their upcoming visit is of a USAF "R&D" nature.  Informing us of your business here helps us be prepared to support you.  Refer to DOD 4500.54-G.  Please note, visitors in the context of extensive support means government personnel and government support contractors on official business.   
<P>
<LI>Lead or assist in the negotiation/tracking of agreements.  This is accomplished as required to ensure the viability and value of the numerous information (data) exchange and development memoranda of understanding.  Often our knowledge of an existing agreement itself is enough to solve a problem in cooperation.  The art of creating an international partnership is in place here through previous experience and training at the Defense Systems Management College and UK institutions.  Fortunately, as this area also grows due to the Post Cold War Era prompting a renaissance in cooperation, the support tools and community of experienced "internationalists" are also growing.  For US government visitors, we have the International Agreements Generator on hand.
<P>
<LI>Establish new relations to expand cooperation.  This area is both an adventure and a challenge.  There are several MOD organizations for which there is little direct interaction with the USAF.  At the same time, some of these organizations are being subsumed under DERA, while others are being deactivated.  The RAF itself, in the acquisition logistics area, is an example of cooperation USAF RDLL is seeking to expand.
<P>
<LI>Provide critical communications/terminology support.  USAF RDLL provides visitors voice, fax, and secure voice commercial and DSN dedicated lines.  Additionally, it is procuring a portable secure telephone unit and upgrading its secure telephone function to identify in finer detail the type of call based on the participants on this end.  USAF RDLL enjoys the latest technology in internet access and e-mail sevices, and word processing, spreadsheet, and graphics applications, thanks to the host of experts in the Edison House.  Terminology support seems rarely needed, but is in fact integral to international cooperation, even between the US and the UK.  For example, to "table" an issue in the UK means essentially the opposite of the US meaning.  Here it means to bring something to immediate discussion.  If you tell someone to "call first", here it will not necessarily mean to "phone first".  Speaking of phoning, USAF RDLL has broadcast the country-wide telephone area code change of 1995, and stands ready as always to locate anyone in the ICRDA business in the UK as change continues.
<P>
<LI>Administer assigned activities in-country.  USAF RDLL supports the Air Senior National Representatives meetings in-country, processes proposed Nunn-funded project and other agreements, and will act for EOARD as required in the placement and oversight of USAF participants in the UK under the Engineer and Scientist Exchange Program.

The Office of Naval Research ONR, is interested in receiving proposals for long-range projects which offer potential for advancement and improvement of naval operations.  This notice constitutes ONRs Broad Agency Announcement BAA, as contemplated in FAR 6.102 dX2.  Readers should note that this is an announcement to declare ONRs broad role in competitively funding meritorious research across a spectrum of scientific disciplines.  No request for proposal RFP, solicitation or other announcement of this opportunity will be made.  This announcement will be open for one year from date of publication.  Proposals may be submitted any time during this period.  Awards may be made at any time throughout the year and may take the form of contracts, grants, or cooperative agreements.  Submission of proposals is not restricted in any way to any particular entity.  Historically Black Colleges and Universities, minority institutions, and small and disadvantaged businesses are encouraged to participate.  Before preparing proposals, potential proposers are encouraged to contact the ONR scientist whose program best matches the proposers field of interest as listed in the ONR Home Page accessible through FEDIX or computer and modem at 1-800-783-3349 or 301-258-0953, through Internet, Telnet, FTP or Gopher to "<A HREF="gopher://fedix.fie.com">fedix.fie.com</A>" and at log-in type "fedix", or through World Wide Web at <A HREF="http://www.onr.navy.mil/">http://www.onr.navy.mil/</A>.  The FEDIX helpline is 301-975-0103.  Proposers should state in their proposal that it is submitted in response to this BAA.  Award decisions will be based on a competitive selection of proposals resulting from a peer and/or scientific review.  Evaluations will be conducted using the following evaluation criteria: [1] Overall scientific technical or socio-economic merits of the proposal, [2] Potential naval relevance and contributions of the effort to the agencys specific mission, [3] The offerors capabilities, related experience, facilities, techniques or unique combinations of these which are integral factors for achieving the proposal objectives, [4] The qualifications, capabilities and experience of the proposed Principal Investigator, team leader or key personnel who are critical in achieving the proposal objectives, [5] Realism of the proposed cost and availability of funds.  For awards made as contracts the socio-economic merits will include the extent of commitment in providing meaningful subcontracting opportunities for small business, small disadvantaged business, woman-owned small business concerns, and historically black colleges and universities.  Information regarding areas of interest and points of contact are available without fee through an on-line database service the Federal Information Exchange FEDIX.  This is to notify potential proposers that each grant or cooperative agreement that is awarded under this announcement or solicitation to an institution of higher education must include the following clause: "As a condition for receipt of funds available to the Department of Defense [DoD] under this award, the recipient agrees that it is not an institution that has a policy of denying, and that is not an institution that effectively prevents, the Secretary of Defense from obtaining for military recruiting purposes: [A] entry to campuses or access to students on campuses, or [B] access to directory information pertaining to students.  If the recipient is determined, using procedures established by the Secretary of Defense to implement section 558 of Public Law 103-337 [1994], to be such an institution during the period of performance of this agreement, and therefore to be in breach of this clause, the Government will cease all payments of DoD funds under this agreement and all other DoD grants and cooperative agreements, and it may suspend or terminate such grants and agreements unilaterally for material failure to comply with the terms and conditions of award".  If your institution has been identified under t5he procedures established by the Secretary of Defense to implement section 558, then: [1] no funds available to DoD may be provided to your institution through any grant, including any existing grant, [2] as a matter of policy, this restriction also applies to any cooperative agreement, and [3] your institution is not eligible to receive a grant or cooperative agreement in response to this solicitation.

<H2>Conference Support Program (CSP) Guidelines</H2><HR><BR>

The Office of Naval Research Europe (ONR Europe) maintains scientific and technological liaison between U.S. naval research and development activities and scientific research establishments in Europe and the Middle East.  This liaison began in 1946 to expand scientific communication and continues to the present with beneficial results for all.  To assist in carrying out its liaison function, ONR Europe has limited funds for supporting various symposiums, conferences, and workshops held throughout Europe and the Middle East. Recent reductions in resources requires emphasis on topics of Navy Interest particularly small workshops with strong Navy program impact.  CSP does not generally support major meetings of international or national societies.  Rather, it supports the following types of scientific and technical meetings, usually at the instigation of ONREUR Science Officers:<P>

a.  Gatherings of invited international scientists and engineers specifically to discuss research of particular interest to Navy;<P>
	
b.  Topical or special focus sessions at larger international meetings, on aspects of the major theme that are of particular interest to Navy;<P>
	
c.  Workshops to develop papers describing the state of the art on specific topics in specific geographic regions, or to develop plans for research initiatives;<P>
	
d.  US access to international meetings not normally attended by US researchers;<P>
	
e.  Meetings between US and international scientists and engineers to discuss needs, compare programs and progress, and develop proposals for collaborations.<P>

As a condition of its support, ONREUR generally requires, free of additional cost, recognition of its sponsorship, a comprehensive written report of major events and conclusions suitable for distribution by ONREUR (within 30 days of the meeting), copies of all meeting materials, meeting space with audio visual support (if appropriate), and registration for a designated number of US participants.<P>

A request for CSP financial support should be in the form of a written proposal, signed and dated by a business official of the institution.  Organizations should submit proposals as soon as possible to allow sufficient time for reviews and for necessary correspondence to be completed for processing of payment of funds.<P>

The Office of Naval Research (ONR) Naval International Cooperative Opportunities in Science and Technology Program (NICOP) fosters international cooperative S&T through:<P>

(a)  Development of strategies and supporting regional and country plans for DON international cooperation in S&T;<BR>
(b)  Construction of a distributed data base of international S&T contacts and capabilities; and
  Cost-sharing with other S&T Sponsors to encourage and support high quality collaborative international S&T projects that respond to DON priorities.<P>

NICOP is one of the major programmatic mechanisms by which the ONR International Field Offices support DON objectives by identifying opportunities for S&T collaboration and encouraging US sponsors to participate in them.  The program is administered by ONR Europe on behalf of the International Field Offices. <BR>
This memorandum provides information on the cost-sharing portion of the program, and more specifically on the submission of requests for the next semi-annual deadline, 15 January 1997.<P>

NICOP Cost-Sharing Program:<P>

The objective of this portion of NICOP is to encourage and support long-term collaboration between US and international researchers on projects of major importance to DON.  Ideally, NICOP projects result from co-planning of S&T programs between US and partner sponsors and researchers, and lead to co-development of naval concepts and systems.  Dedicated planning workshops are encouraged to develop NICOP proposals.  The international Field Office Conference Support Programs are appropriate vehicles for supporting such planning workshops.<P>

The next selection will pay particular attention to larger projects, in this context viewed to be greater than $100K, which have significant potential to impact DON requirements.  Smaller projects which address country-specific interests of the DON/ONR; provide NICOP program balance between basic and applied research; or foster new collaborations, will also be considered.  All projects, regardless of size, will be judged on technical merit; potential impact on Naval needs and ONR objectives; and potential for long-term collaboration.<P>
  
To be eligible for NICOP cost sharing, a project must provide for face-to-face exchange of technical expertise and perspective among participating US and international scientists and engineers.  International participants may be from any nation other than the US, and substantial portions of the research must be accomplished outside of the US.<P>

The format for requests is  Attachment 1.  Approximately 50% of the NICOP funding allocated for any fiscal year will be competitively awarded after each deadline.  Thus of the $1M allocated for FY97, approximately $500K will be available for the next competitive award, which will be determined from those requests received prior to the 15 January 1997 deadline.<P>

All requests must be submitted by, or with the endorsement and financial commitment of, the sponsor who will share costs with NICOP.  In addition, all requests submitted from sponsors other than ONR Program Officers (POs) must contain a comment from the cognizant ONR PO; this is intended to keep NICOP projects consistent with core ONR programs.<P>

NICOP awards will be made by funds transfer to the sponsor who requests the cost-share; that sponsor will be responsible for all grants & contracts, and for management of the projects.  NICOP will assist as requested and periodically will request follow-up information on progress.<P>

NICOP generally will provide no more than 50% of the US contribution to the costs of the non-US researchers.  NICOP funds generally will not be used to support the US partners costs.  However, it is understood that foreign investigators ability to participate financially vary widely. <BR>
In some instances, more than 50% of the award may be required to be invested abroad, or alternatively, some funds may be required to be invested domestically to insure a collaboration with a well-supported foreign partner moves forward.  Requests for exception to either of these guidelines must be explained in detail.  <P>

Procedures<P>

1. Forward requests for NICOP cost-sharing support, in the format of  Attachment 1, to ONR Europe.  Requests should be less than three pages long (Courier 12 pitch).<BR>
2. ONREUR will acknowledge all requests, discuss their completeness (but not quality) with the requester,  and maintain a data base of their status.<BR>
3. ONREUR will consider all requests before a selection board and recommend approval of awards, with justification, to DCNR prior to 1 Feb 97.<BR>
4. For successful requests, the sponsor who requested NICOP cost sharing will be notified of the amount and duration of the NICOP award. If that sponsor decides to proceed as proposed with the amount of support to be provided by NICOP, ONREUR will provide ONR Headquarters the necessary information on funds transfer.  If that sponsor decides that the NICOP award is inadequate to permit the program to proceed as planned, the funds will be either be awarded to another request, or held until the next call.<P>

Comments and Suggestions<P>

Based upon questions asked during the first round (15 Sep 96) of NICOP awards, the following hints may prove useful:<P>

There are no geographic or institutional restrictions on NICOP participants, except that each project must involve collaboration between US and non-US investigators.<P>

Collaborations should be mutually beneficial, and match strength to strength.<P>

If the project is military-to-military, information exchange must be covered by a DEA or similar agreement.<P>

The intent of NICOP cost-sharing is to fund projects where the US should appropriately bear some or all of the costs of the international participant.<P>

Requests that come directly from investigators, without the commitment of another US sponsor to share costs with NICOP, will not be considered.  It is the responsibility of investigators to identify such sponsors,   although ONR Europe and ONR Asia will help international investigators locate potential sources of support.  The reason for this requirement is that NICOP is not a stand-alone program. Rather it seeks to support and encourage US sponsors to take advantage of international opportunities.   It does this by assistance from the ONR International Field Offices with planning and coordination (via, e.g., liaison visits, conference and visit support), and by providing some financial support for the international portion of the work. <P>

Intellectual property rights are a significant issue for all projects that do not result solely in new knowledge that is published in the open literature.  The International Field Office in Europe has an Intellectual Property Rights lawyer on site who can assist with advice, although in all cases final negotiations and decisions will be made by the contracting office that supports the requesting sponsor.<P>

Not all cost sharing must come from an ONR source.  Other government agencies, universities, industry and philanthropic organizations can participate in sharing. However, NICOP is an ONR program, and the projects it supports must be important to the command.  Therefore all requests must have a comment from an appropriate ONR Program Officer, discussing how the project will enhance the ONR core program.<P>

NICOP has two annual deadlines for submission of requests for cost sharing: 15 June and 15 January.  Deadlines dates are hard.<P>

Please use e-mail for submitting requests and communicating. The best address for the 15 Jan 97 call is -<A HREF="mailto:nicop@onreur.navy.mil">nicop@onreur.navy.mil</A><P>

There are no set rules regarding the amount of support that NICOP will provide to any project, or to the number of years supported (subject to appropriated funds).  However, the bias is toward focused collaborative programs that can substantially impact major DON initiatives.  NICOP will seek to have maximum impact for money available.<P>

Full proposals need not accompany requests.  If they are available, fine.  However, many international collaborative projects are best finalized in formal proposals after the available funding has been determined, i.e. after it is known whether or not a NICOP award has been won.  The simple request, per the Attachment 1 format, is adequate.  The request must however contain adequate technical and managerial information that a decision can be made based on the criteria mentioned above.  Research objectives, procedures, and participants must be clearly identified.  Funding amounts and sources required for the total project must also be described, so that the scope of the effort can be understood; and in particular, the use of the share requested from NICOP, its destination, and the nature of the share from the other US sponsor, must be clearly identified.  Requests for exception to the above guidelines must be clear and compelling.<P>

The cost sharing rules caused considerable confusion during the first round, so they need some discussion. NICOP is a relatively small program, and its objective is to involve the best international scientists in important US S&T thrusts in which they ordinarily would not participate.  Because the US is actively seeking and promoting the collaboration, it is appropriate that the US fund some or all of the costs of the international participant.  Some contribution by the international partner is of course encouraged, since the project must be one that they will benefit from.  In projects which are independently supported both here and abroad, NICOP could be used to provide the "glue" (e.g., travel, shared international graduate students or post-docs, etc.) that ties together efforts in the US and abroad.<P>

NICOP is designed to encourage S&T sponsors to think more broadly about international opportunities.  Therefore it requires them to initiate the request for cost sharing and leaves program management completely in their hands.<P>

As with all ONR projects, the likelihood of support is considerably enhanced by prior consultation with the sponsor.  For NICOP, that means with an International Field Office staff member; with the ONR Program Officer; and most importantly, with the sponsor who is officially making the request for cost sharing.<P>

Our overall objective is to encourage collaborations that result from co-planning of S&T projects and that ultimately lead to co-development of naval concepts and systems.<P>

<CENTER><H3>Progress in Electromagnetics Research Symposium 1996 (PIERS'96)</H3>
<I>Report to the<BR>
Office of Naval Research European Office<BR>
and the U. S. Army Research and Standardization Group</I></CENTER><P>
by H. Rott<BR>
General Chairman, PIERS'96<P>

The Symposium took place in the Congress Center, Innsbruck, Austria, from 8 July to 12 July 1996. 560 scientists from 41 countries participated.<P>

On 8 July, morning, a plenary session was held with opening addresses and review papers on Computational Electromagnetics and on Remote Sensing Use of Multisatellite Constellations.  Between Monday noon and Friday noon 72 session with oral presentations of papers on a wide range of topics in electromagnetic theory and its applications was held.  The session were organised in thematic streams with the main topics:<P>

<UL>
<LI>Electromagnetic theory and computational electromagnetics
<LI>Wave propagation in the atmosphere and atmospheric remote sensing (with emphasis on microwaves, radar, and communication)
<LI>Scattering theory and inverse scattering for surfaces and media
<LI>Radar and optical remote sensing of the earth surface (with emphasis on quantitative methods for vegetation, cryosphere, and hydrosphere)
<LI>Radar signal processing, interferometry and polarimetry
<LI>Antenna theory and applications 
<LI>Wave propagation in planar structures and in complex media 
<LI>Guided waves
</UL>

Detailed information on the sessions and presented papers is contained in the Final Program and in the PIERS'96 Proceedings which have been sent to ONR Europe by separate mail.  A high percentage of the papers at the conference contained significant and new contributions.  This high standard was reflected in scientifically stimulating discussions throughout the 5 days of the conference, both during the sessions as well as during breaks and unofficial meetings.<P>

Below is a summary on the contributions of the supported invitees.  Though representing only a small part of the whole symposium, these contributions reflect well the diversity and actuality of the papers presented at PIERS'96.<P>

<B>Contributions of the supported scientists</B><P>

The attendance of 11 scientists from Russia and Ukraine was supported by the grant of ONR Europe.  The papers presented by these scientists gave clear evidence that the level of theoretical research in electromagnetics, and in some fields also of experimental research, is very high in these countries.  The symposium provided the opportunity to discuss potential collaborations and to exchange information on ongoing and planned research activities.<P>

All the papers presented by the supported scientists were of good quality.  The papers covered topics in the field of radiowave propagation, radar polarimetry, atmospheric remote sensing, wave propagation in media.<P>

The papers were presented in the Following sessions:<P>

<I>Session on Transhorizon Tropospheric UHF/VHF Radiowave Propagation</I>.  This session was organised and chaired by Prof <I>G. V. Sharygin</I>. 10 papers on original results of experimental investigations and on theory of UHF/VHF tropospheric propagation beyond the horizon were presented.  In spite of financial difficulties the investigations m this field are going on in Russia, because they are very important for telecommunication.<BR>
<I>G.S. Sharygin</I>: Review on recent experimental research Russia regarding tropospheric VHF wave propagation.<BR>
<I>Yu. P. Akulinichev</I>: (i) on theory of trans-horizon propagation and experimental verifications at 100 to 3000 MHz over the Sea of Okhotsk and the Caspian Sea; (ii) on experimental studies of temporal and spatial correlation lengths in the atmosphere related to radiowave propagation.<BR>

Programmes: Originally described as `Fregates Legeres' but this was    
changed in 1992 to `Fregates type La Fayette'. First three ordered 25 July    
1988; three more 24 September 1992. Planned total of up to 10 but may stop    
at 6. The programme was delayed by up to one year by the 1989 defence    
budget. First steel cut for each hull about 14 months before the keel is    
laid.<BR> 
Structure: Space left for a SAAM launcher forward of the bridge which will    
replace Crotale in the second three of the class on build and the first    
three at refit. This might mean putting the Arabel fire-control radar on    
top of a more solid looking foremast once Crotale is removed.    
Superstructure inclines at 10 to the vertical to reduce radar echoing    
area. The radar echoing area is claimed to be 60 per cent less than for a    
traditional design. External equipment such as capstans, bollards etc    
either `hidden' or installed as low as possible. Radar absorbent paint is    
used extensively. Sensitive areas are armour-plated. SLAT anti-torpedo    
system may be fitted when available. Magazine for AM 39 Exocet and AS 15    
for the NFH-90 helicopter. Plans to fit sonar have been dropped but in the    
future an ASW version of the ship could be built with hull and towed array    
sonars, lightweight torpedo launchers, and an ASW configured helicopter.    
Operational: La Fayette started full sea trials 27 September 1993. Surcouf    
planned for May 1994 and Courbet in 1996. These frigates are designed for    
out of area operations on overseas stations and the first three are    
assigned to the Indian Ocean. <BR>
Sales: Three of an improved design to Saudi Arabia if the order is    
confirmed and the first six of a possible 16 are being prefabricated for    
shipping to Taiwan for completion.<P><HR><P><A HREF="http://www.ehis.navy.mil:80/eranews2.htm">Return to previous page</A></BODY></HTML>

     <H3>   Innovative system for the shipbuilding industry based on an
        integrated project to automate the prefabrication cycle</H3>
  
        Project description<BR>
        The research concerns an innovative system for the
        shipbuilding industry based on an integrated project to
        automate the prefabrication cycle.  The project covers
        fabrication, handling, fitting and welding operations of
        blocks up to 200 ton.  The project consists of three major
        phases which, starting from the analysis of the current
        system goes up to the implementation of innovative
        production systems in a pilot prefabrication shop within a
        FINCANTIERI shipyard.  The system envisages automatic cells
        and lines consisting of handling devices for heavy
        components up to 100 ton., robots and sensors for operation
        in non-structured environment, integrate control systems
        for CAD-CAM-CAPP, Real-Time scheduling as well as automatic
        quality control systems.<BR>
        Developments<BR>
        Considerable effort in applied research and integration of
        advanced technology is envisaged with special emphasis to
        be placed on the following:
 
<UL>
<LI>Automatic handling, positioning, clamping and welding systems for large and heavy parts
<LI>Robots for operation in non-structured environment
<LI>Sensors, vision systems and associated artificial intelligence programmes for operation in non-structured        environment.
<LI>Advanced CAD, CAM, CAPP and systems SW developments
<LI>Expert systems for workshop scheduling in a single lot production environment
<LI>Advanced man-machine interfaces and supervision system

<B>1.  Summary</B><BR>
The Conference on Hyperbolic Systems of Conservation Laws was held at the Oberwolfach Mathematics Research Institute, Germant, 28 April - 3 May 1996. The Conference covered recent theoretical and computational advances in solving hyperbolic systems of conservation laws, and the application of the new ideas to solving problems in fluid mechanics, solid mechanics, phase transitions, and two phase fluid flows.  The author describes the meeting and discusses 3 issues: the gap between theoretical and computational communities, lack of a criterion for comparing computed solutions in the (usual) absence of an exact solution, and pros and cons of different numerical schemes. See Trip Report #6 for additional views on this conference.<P>

<B>2.  Conference Description</B><BR>
The Mathematics Institute at Oberwolfach is located in the picturesque Black Forest, and runs meetings all year round in the format of one-week workshops devoted to a particular topic.  This is a highly prestigious institute and participation is by invitation only. The forum is usually quite small and the atmosphere is very informal.  Working conditions are ideal, the stay at the institute is very comfortable (and free of charge).  The institute has an impressive mathematics library, convenient  computer access to all and Xerox facilities.  The organization and hospitality are impeccable, and permit participants to concentrate solely on the meeting and make the most out of it. <BR>
The meeting was organized by Constantine Dafermos of Brown University, Dietmar Kroner of University of Freiburg and Randy LeVeque of University of Washington, Seattle.  Participants could choose their preferable format of presentation, ranging from long talks (40 mins.) through medium (20 mins) and short (10 mins.) talks, to leading a discussion session. The program was flexible. It was organized from one day to the next and tried to answer to the interests and requests of the participants. Substantial amount of time was left for discussions, both organized and informal.<BR>
A central aim for the meeting was to bring together  researchers from both the PDE community and the numerical and computational communities and to provide a forum within which to present and discuss the state of research in the field of hyperbolic systems of conservation laws, and get some feel for where the field is going. Indeed, the program provided a nice balance between theory and applications.<P>

<B>3.  Narrative</B><BR>
Among the topics of interest were multidimensional conservation laws, both the theoretical understanding (e.g. self similar solutions) as well as the design and implementation of numerical methods for multidimensional flows; high order numerical schemes for fluid flows, which have less dissipation hence may be more suitable for problems involving long time integration or small amplitudes (e.g. aeroacoustics); low Mach number (near incompressible) flows, where one has to deal with stiffness in the governing equations; reactive flows, two phase flows, and nonequilibrium flows; kinetic models and their gas dynamical limits including numerical schemes with relaxation. <BR>
The program included several informal discussion sessions led by one (or more) participants of the meeting. Several important issues came up. <BR>
(*) The need to bridge the gap between the theoretical and numerical communities and the expectations that these communities have from each other for more fruitful collaborations in the future.  Certain mutual frustration has been voiced.  On the one hand, there are expectation of the theoretical community from the computational/ experimental communities to provide a lead as to what problems are of interest and importance to study, yet realistic problems of interest turn out to be much too hard for theory. On the other hand, the numerical community wants more problems with closed form solutions that have enough 'meat' in them, which could be used to validate schemes, and such closed form solutions are extremely difficult to obtain. <BR>
(*) A criticism has been raised toward the numerical/ computational communities, as to the lack of some tools to assess the accuracy of numerical solutions in situations where exact solutions are not available (as is usually the case).  Is it possible to design a criterion which will enable to compare two computed solutions and decide which one solves the problem better?  I totally agree with this 'complaint', and have already started preliminary work toward establishing such a criterion.<BR>
(*) A useful discussion was held on the dis/advantages<BR>
of genuinely multidimensional schemes versus more 'simple minded' schemes such as  dimensional splitting and 'one and a half' dimensional schemes that are less grid independent. The former contain genuinely multidimensional physics and are 'grid-blind', but are difficult to extend to high order of accuracy, the latter are usually quite straight forward to implement in any number of space dimensions and to extend to higher orders, but suffer some grid dependence.  Here, again, there is no clear winner and one can always find a counter example to any general statement. <BR>
All in all, this was a very good meeting. I presented my work on computations of slowly moving shocks, which are notorious for generating post-shock oscillations.  These oscillations are very undesirable, for example they inhibit convergence of transient solutions to steady states. They occur only in nonlinear systems of conservation laws which makes rigorous analysis difficult. My talk was very well received and raised interest from both the theoreticians and practitioners. <P>

<B>1. General European S&T Topics:</B>  
<B>a.  R&D in Turkey: Overview & Focus on METU and 
Oceanography, Craig Dorman</B> (<A HREF="mailto:cdorman@onreur.navy.mil">cdorman@onreur.navy.mil</A>)<BR>
Turkey is a staunch ally, a strong NATO partner, and a "Big Emerging Market" with a rapidly growing but volatile economy.  The Turkish Defense Forces remain a highly respected and powerful force for Turkeys secular western orientation.  The Turkish General Staff recognizes the multiple security threats in the region, and plans continued modernization accompanied by expansion of indigenous defense industries through co-production and technology transfer.  Turkey historically has invested very little in R&D, but both defense and commercial trends indicate a significant upswing in the near future; and the Universities, exemplified by the Middle East Technical University (METU), are ready and eager to respond.  One area where Turkey does have a significant world-class scientific capability is oceanography.  Turkish ocean scientists play a leading role in physical and biogeochemical studies of the Eastern Mediterranean and the Black Sea.  The Black Sea is of interest intrinsically, geopolitically, and as a model for both environmental processes and approaches to the remediation of a badly damaged ecosystem.  This newsletter briefly treats this set of issues: defense cooperation and modernization, the Turkish S&T Research Council, METU and its structure for innovation, and METUs Institute of Marine Sciences and the status and plans for Black Sea studies.  <A HREF="http://www.ehis.navy.mil/cdnews10.htm">CO/TD Report #10</A><BR>
<B>b.  Computer Science and Education in Europe, Bruce Barnes</B> 
(<A HREF="mailto:bbarnes@nsf.gov">bbarnes@nsf.gov</A>)<BR>
Computer Science and Engineering education in Europe is extremely active and of very high quality.  The programs are vigorous, well structured and taught by highly educated and dedicated faculty.  They tend to be professionally oriented with most of the instruction in Computer Science, Computer Engineering, and Software Engineering; liberal arts and science do not play a very significant role.  Since the programs are professionally oriented, accreditation is a well-established part of the educational infrastructure. The content of European programs is comparable to that of the US.  English language is widely used in European education in computing and many institutions teach some classes in English.  The Masters programs are considered to be part of the undergraduate programs.  The Ph.D. programs are focused almost entirely on research and the thesis, with very little course work or other requirements.  <A HREF="http://www.ehis.navy.mil/bbnews29.htm">Newsletter #29</A><BR>
<B>c.  Joint EC-US Workshop on Environmental Biotechnology 
(EB), Igor Vodyanoy</B> (<A HREF="mailto:ivodyanoy@onreur.navy.mil">ivodyanoy@onreur.navy.mil</A>)<BR>
The EC-US Task Force on Biotechnology Research encouraged the EU Working Group on EB to support this EC-US workshop, Nov96, Granada, Spain. Objectives were to examine the biochemical and genetic bases of biodegradation in different environments and for the rational design and use of microbes in polluted sites; to foster EC-US cooperation; and to provide research managers with insights, based on case studies, into new directions in EB. 19 research leaders and 20 advanced students and post-docs took part in oral and poster sessions and extensive discussions that generated a number of interesting new research venues. <A HREF="http://www.ehis.navy.mil/ivnews27.htm">Newsletter 27</A> summarizes the discussions and directions, lists presented papers, and describes the EC-US Task Force and the current EC EB program.<P>

<B>2.  Division of Hydraulics & Environmental Engineering, 
Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Michael Bruno</B> (<A HREF="mailto:m1bruno@stevens-tech.edu">m1bruno@stevens-tech.edu</A>)<BR>
The Division is an active participant in EU and locally-sponsored research covering a wide range of ocean engineering issues.  Primary interests are Aegean Sea circulation and water quality dynamics; nearshore processes; fundamental fluid dynamics; and water resources management.  The Division's focus is heavily weighted towards numerical modeling, an area in which the staff excels.  It possesses an impressive suite of numerical models, including codes developed by the staff as well as codes originating in the U.S. and Europe.  The Division is less well equiped for lab and field work.  However, via participation in EC MAST and the EU-sponsored facilities-sharing programs, it is becoming more active in acquisition and analysis of field and lab data.  This has greatly enhanced staff capabilities, and should contribute to the continued expansion of the Division's ocean engineering research.  <A HREF="http://www.ehis.navy.mil/bruno12.htm">OAS&T #12</A> is based on the Dr. Brunos experiences during a 4-month Fulbright appointment. He acknowledges the generous assistance of the staff and students of the Division during his stay in Thessaloniki.<P>

<B>3. Marine Technology Directorate Merger, Peter Majumdar</B> (<A HREF="mailto:pmajumdar@onreur.navy.mil">pmajumdar@onreur.navy.mil</A>)<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.ehis.navy.mil/pmnews2.htm">Newsletter 96-002</A> reported on Marine Technology Directorate (MTD), a UK consortium for research in ship and offshore technologies, of which ONR had just become the first non-UK-based member.  Very recently a merger has occurred between MTD and the Edinburgh-based Petroleum Science and Technology Institute (PSTI) which has been an organization for basic and applied research in sciences related to petroleum and extraction.  The name for the amalgamated organization is Centre for Marine and Petroleum Technology (CMPT); its management and operations will follow that of MTD, but oil company sponsorship is expected to promote additional emphasis on marine petroleum topics. <A HREF="http://www.ehis.navy.mil/pmnews8.htm">Newsletter 97-001</A>.<P>

<B>4.  Conference Reports<BR>
   a. Light Scattering and Photon Correlation Spectroscopy, Aug 27-30 96, Krakow, Poland.
Directors: Prof E.R Pike, FRS, Dept Physics, King's College, London </B> (<A HREF="mailto:erp@maxwell.ph.kcl.ac.uk">erp@maxwell.ph.kcl.ac.uk</A>); <B>Dr Igor Yudin, Oil and Gas Research Institute, RAS, Moscow</B> (<A HREF="mailto:yudin@fluid.msk">yudin@fluid.msk</A>)<BR>
Since their inception over 25 years ago, photon correlation techniques for temporal or spectral analysis of fluctuating light fields have found ever-widening applications.  These methods are non-invasive, intrinsically digital in nature, and in many experimental situations offer a unique degree of accuracy and sensitivity, particularly in using a laser probe to study light scattering from pure fluids and macromolecular suspensions, but also to study the flow and turbulence of fluids. Following the earliest developments in laser scattering by dilute macromolecular suspensions, in which particle sizing was the main aim, significant advances have been made in recent years in many other areas; those presented included experimental techniques, statistics and data reduction, colloids and aggregation, polymers gels, liquid crystals and mixtures, protein solutions, and critical phenomena and dense media. Other notable recent developments have been in basic physics experiments on phase transitions in the microgravity environment provided by the space-shuttle missions, in quantum cryptography and in the application of the technique at x-ray wavelengths.  <A HREF="http://www.ehis.navy.mil/confsum5.htm">Conference Report #5</A> contains abstracts of the 40 talks from 17 nations, and presenters email addresses.<BR>

Jul 20-27 96, hosted by Ruzena Bajcsy and Sherman Frankel at their farm at Sjaellands Odde. Denmark. The Workshop gathered 23 experts within vision research to discuss alternatives of image capturing electronic and optic devices, and how specific tasks within applied informatics might benefit from such devices in terms of augmented or enhanced 3D scene analysis capabilities, or in terms of lower cost or less computational power requiring equipment. <A HREF="http://www.ehis.navy.mil/confsum6.htm">Conference Report #6</A> summarizes workshop motivation, scientific background, objectives, and conclusions, and gives email addresses of participants.

  <B>a. Tri-Service Workshop; Private R&D in the FSU, Igor Vodyanoy</B> (<A HREF="mailto:ivodyanoy@onreur.navy.mil">ivodyanoy@onreur.navy.mil</A>)<BR>
The three Service organizations here at Edison House (Air Force EOARD, Army EOR and Navy ONREur) jointly sponsored a review of research being conducted by small private FSU R&D companies, held near Moscow in Sep 96. As the first meeting of its kind, it attracted the attention of the Russian Department of Commerce and large Russian R&D institutions, as well as US industrial reps in Moscow. About 40 formal papers were given as discussion posters. Most were on materials, physics of materials, and surface physics. There were also papers on laser physics and laser technologies. A private design bureau based at the Bauman Technical University (Moscow) offered a number of materials and robotics technologies based on their space vehicle research. <A HREF="http://www.ehis.navy.mil/ivnews26.htm">Newsletter #26</A> lists all reviewed papers and describes a few general interest items such as thermal insulating materials, coatings, and lasers. The unedited proceedings can be made available upon request to Dr. Vodyanoy.<BR>
  <B>b. European and Middle East Technology in Support of Littoral Warfare: a Survey and Assessment, R. Kenneth Lobb</B> (<A HREF="mailto:rkl4@psu.edu">rkl4@psu.edu</A>)<BR>
Report 96-1-R summarizes the author's assessments while at ONREUR from Dec 95-May 96.  It surveys European technology needs and developments with emphasis on regional and littoral conflicts.  The principal warfighting and technical areas covered in the study are: AAW - Ship Self Defense; ASW; C4I; Mine Countermeasures; and Naval Surface Fire Support.  It contains information that is for "official use only", and distribution is limited to DoD components (copies available from Dr Lobb).  A few summary comments:<BR>
<I>AAW  (Ship Self Defense)</I> -  A number of our allies are working hard to overcome the critical problems associated with the advanced sea-skimming missile threat (High speed, maneuvering, low signature, and saturation attacks).  The combination of a new APAR radar plus ESSM will give some of these nations a greatly improved capability.  More power in the radar would be desirable but even so the active elements in APAR are at the leading edge of technology.  Some of our allies are just starting to think about an anti-tactical ballistic missile capability.  The Rolling Airframe Missile is still a winner.<BR>
<I>ASW</I> -  Our European allies see a continued threat from the large number of exported modern, quiet, diesel, air-independent, bottom-sitting, low target strength submarines.  Over 40 new export orders are under contract.  4th gen SSN and SSBNs also will appear early next century.  Many countries seem to believe that the submarine is destined to become the Capital Ship of most navies in the future.  There is great concern for ASW in the difficult littoral environments and there is an increased interest in air ASW and non-acoustic ASW.<BR>
<I>C4I</I> - In the past, many of our allies focused primarily on European conflicts and only those communication links required to support their ground forces on the continent .  Landlines were the key element.  Now there is increased interest in over the horizon communication links to support their naval forces at sea, but even so there are considerable deficiencies with respect to providing timely imagery data, interoperability with GCCS, T1 data rate SHF modems, and replacement satellites - to mention a few.  (It is interesting to note that there is increasing support for high-altitude aerostats or balloons that could be used as relay platforms for over the horizon communications.)  And finally, there seems to be little interest in organic, theater, and strategic targeting systems (such as JSTARS, ASARS-2, GUARDRAIL Common Sensor, etc) that could support naval and amphibious forces operating in the littorals.<BR>
<I>Mine Countermeasures</I> - MCM has always been an important aspect of Naval warfare for our European allies, but now they are thinking about operations beyond their own territorial waters (NATO and coalition ops).  There is great concern about the appearance of "modern" mines and as a result considerable emphasis on remote mine hunting and sweeping. There is also some excellent work on expendable mine neutralization vehicles e.g. the Norwegian minesniper.<BR>
<I>Naval Surface Fire Support (NSFS)</I> -  Based on this assessment study, it appears that there is little European interest in NSFS.  There is, however, an increasing support for amphibious operations (particularly in the UK, the Netherlands, and France), so an increased interest in NSFS should follow.  Practically all the work in Europe and the Middle East seems to be in support of Army needs.  There is some good electrothermal chemical gun work that is showing excellent reproducibility and a roughly 20% increase in velocity.  Israel and Sweden have pushed some advanced technology for base bleed projectiles that confirms the author's theoretical and experimental results that were obtained at the old Naval Ordnance Laboratory in the 1950s.<P>

<B>2. More on UKs Defense Evaluation & Research Agency</B> (see <A HREF="http://www.ehis.navy.mil/cdnews9.htm">CO/TD Report #9</A> for an overview of DERA and its components)
  <B>a. DRAs Structural Materials Center, Farnborough, Ben Wilcox</B> (<A HREF="mailto:bwilcox@onreur.navy.mil">bwilcox@onreur.navy.mil</A>)<BR>
DRAs Structural Materials Centre (SMC) was established in 1994 to bring together the staff working in structural materials from 8 MOD labs.  SMC now has some 500 materials scientists and engineers conducting research in three general areas:  Advanced Metallic Alloys and Ceramics, Advanced Non-Metallics, and Multi-Functional Materials.  Their mission includes providing technical advice and research to assist all three services, both directly and through the other DRA Sectors.  Approximately 20% of SMCs effort is directed toward dual-use research aimed at benefiting both the military and the civilian sector.  The extremely capable technical staff soon will occupy an outstanding new 28,000 square meter lab. <A HREF="http://www.ehis.navy.mil/bwnews5.htm">MS&E#96-005</A><BR>
  <B>b. DRA Lab at Winfrith, Dorset, Bob Dolan</B> (<A HREF="mailto:rdolan@onreur.navy.mil">rdolan@onreur.navy.mil</A>)<BR>
This lab is part of DRAs Sea Systems Sector. Its 50 DERA scientists, augmented by about 30 researchers under contract, focus on military applications in oceanography.  <A HREF="http://www.ehis.navy.mil/bdnews3.htm">Report #3</A> describes conversations with Graham Jackson who heads the program, John Scott who manages the satellite remote sensing group, and Tony Heathershaw, head of the applied coastal research program.<P>

<B>3. DANTEC Measurement Technology, Peter Majumdar</B> (<A HREF="mailto:pmajumdar@onreur.navy.mil">pmajumdar@onreur.navy.mil</A>) <A HREF="http://www.ehis.navy.mil/pmnews7.htm">Newsletter 96-007</A> <BR>
Long recognized as a world leader in technology for measurement of complex fluid flow, Dantecs corporate headquarters are in Skovlunde, Denmark.  In addition to its recent advanced techniques in Laser-Doppler Anemometry (LDA) with real-time data processing, Dantec has maintained a consistent focus on developments toward understanding fluid flow phenomena which are not easily assessed by point-measurement techniques such as LDA or hot-wire anemometry.  It thus has invested substantially in development of a very comprehensive measurement method based on Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV), together with capabilities for on-line, real-time processing of data.  Dantec has also utilized its laser expertise in the development of precision measurement techniques for manufacturing.<P>

  <B>a. 10th International Ship Operators Meeting - Lots of Ship Resources Available, Alan Weinstein</B> (<A HREF="mailto:aweinstein@onreur.navy.mil">aweinstein@onreur.navy.mil</A>), <A HREF="http://www.ehis.navy.mil/awnews7.htm">Newsletter #7</A><BR>
The purpose of this annual meeting is to compare notes and share experiences.  25 operators and sponsors from 11 countries attended.  Following regular reports by each ship operator on activities for the year, discussions centered on insurance, autosubs, performance indicators, databasess and planning, Marine Technicians Workshop, ISM code, manning and budgets, vessel and personnel clearances, scientific diving, and deep CTD deployments.  Highlights:<BR>
a)  Although the U.S. has the largest number of oceanographic research vessels, many other countries have excellent facilities, and there are a lot of them available.<BR>
b)  There is an increasing use of other countries vessels as part of a "bartering" system,<BR>
c)  All countries share common concerns over budgets, manning and excess capacity.<BR>
  <B>b. International Symposium on "New Challenges for North 
Sea Research" - Lots of Interaction, Alan Weinstein</B> (<A HREF="mailto:aweinstein@onreur.navy.mil">aweinstein@onreur.navy.mil</A>), <A HREF="http://www.ehis.navy.mil/awnews8.htm">Newsletter #8</A><BR>
21-23 Oct 96, Hamburg, Germany; the symposium was both a retrospective look at twenty years of North Sea research since the Fladenground Experiment (FLEX 76), and a prospective view.  @ 150 scientists, most from countries around the North Sea, remained right up to the very last session, a testimony to the importance that northern Europe attaches to the North Sea. The retrospective look showed that we understand quite a lot about the boundary forcing (from air, land via river runoff, and surrounding water from the Atlantic Ocean and Baltic Sea) and the resulting circulation, and are beginning to gain insight into the resulting biogeochemical structure.  The prospective view called for research on interactions among space and time scales (e.g. coastal response to global warming) and disciplinary processes (e.g. bio-physical, air-sea), and a series of specific process studies as opposed to one major experiments. Highlights:<BR>
a)  Industrialized countries bordering the North Sea (e.g. UK and Germany) have considerably reduced the nutrient (nitrogen and phosphate) content of their river runoff;<BR>
b)  Atmospheric particle deposition contributes 4x the nutrient loading of river input;<BR>
c)  Most of the water entering the North Sea gets circulated around the coasts and exits through the Norwegian Current, leaving only very small (and hard to detect) changes in the large interior bulk;<BR>
d)  Individual species play critical roles in North Sea ecological dynamics;<BR>
e)  The Skagarrak (Channel connecting Baltic and North seas) and the Norwegian Trench are the final resting places for most of the sediments entering the North Sea; and
North Sea morphodynamics are 3-dimensional.<BR>
  <B>c. Post Cold War Collaborative Research at NRL: Lab Oceanographers Participate in Joint Research with Russians and Norwegians in Norwegian Sea, Dr David K van Keuren, NRL Historian</B> (<A HREF="mailto:dvk@ccf.nrl.navy.mil">dvk@ccf.nrl.navy.mil</A>)<BR>
An NRL led international scientific team of U.S., Russian, and Norwegian scientists spent 24 Jul-23 Aug 96 aboard the Russian R/V <I>Professor Logachev</I> carrying out geological and geophysical research in the Greenland-Norwegian Sea.  One major objective of the cruise was to return to a Norwegian Sea mud volcano site to conduct extensive surveys and analyses as a follow-up to an Aug 95 NRL/Norwegian cruise.  Unique temperature anomalies recorded there by Professor Kathy Crane were a scientific first according to Dr Peter Vogt, the lead American scientist.  Additional data from the Knipovich Ridge Valley indicates signs of hydrothermal mineralization and recent volcanism.  <A HREF="http://www.ehis.navy.mil/jjnews9.htm">Newsletter #9</A><BR>
  <B>d. Workshop on Theoretical and Observational Studies of Polar Lows, Dr Gunther Heinemann and LCDR John Joseph</B> (<A HREF="mailto:jjoseph@onreur.navy.mil">jjoseph@onreur.navy.mil</A>)<BR>
The European Geophysical Society Polar Lows Working Group (EPLWG) held its 6th meeting at the State Scientific Center of the Russian Federation Arctic and Antarctic Research Institute (AARI) in St Petersburg, 23-26 Sep 96, with 25 participants from Denmark, Germany, Iceland, Norway, Russia, UK, & US, plus papers from absent Canadian and French members. Papers covered climatological and satellite studies and numerical models. Two polar low cases were discussed in more detail in working groups, as were programs in order to coordinate international research on polar mesocyclones.

  <B>e. Workshop on International Collaboration in Nearshore Coastal Research, Bob Dolan, Tom Kinder and Linwood Vincent</B> (<A HREF="mailto:rdolan@onreur.navy.mil">rdolan@onreur.navy.mil</A>, <A HREF="mailto:kindert@onrhq.onr.navy.mil">kindert@onrhq.onr.navy.mil</A>, <A HREF="mailto:vincenl@onrhq.onr.navy.mil">vincenl@onrhq.onr.navy.mil</A>)<BR>
ONREUR hosted this workshop in London, 17-18 Oct 96, to explore potential international collaboration in research on nearshore coastal processes. The motivation was the desire of both US and European managers to promote long term international research, and to discuss the opportunity for its support under ONRs new NICOP program.  The specific objective was to develop a framework for long term initiatives based on expansion of research underway within programs of noted excellence.  <A HREF="http://www.ehis.navy.mil/rdnews4.htm">Report #4</A> lists participants and provides the results of deliberation in several focus areas.  The workshop will result in international proposals for NICOPs 15 Jan 97 deadline.  This was the first ONREUR workshop deliberately designed to promote international co-planning of collaborative research, and was deemed a major success by participants.<P><HR><P>

<B>1. Restructuring UK Public Sector Research Establishments (PSREs), Craig Dorman</B> (<A HREF="mailto:cdorman@onreur.navy.mil">cdorman@onreur.navy.mil</A>)<BR>
DoD has been tasked by both Congress and the President to rationalize the Military Departments RDT&E infrastructure.  A well accepted process in responding to such challenges is benchmarking.  The UK, for over 16 years, has been implementing a policy of public devolvement and rationalization.  In the expectation that we have something to learn from their experience, a DoD "Vision 21" delegation spent a week visiting with those involved.  The delegation focused on the Defence Evaluation and Research Agency (DERA) of the Ministry of Defense, but also looked at civil PSREs because in both countries security relies on the total national intellectual infrastructure.  <A HREF="http://www.ehis.navy.mil/cdnews9.htm">CO/TD #9</A> tries to depict what the group learned: not just the rationalization process and its results, but the national policy environment that both inspired and enabled the very remarkable changes that have been accomplished.  This lengthy report should be worth reading for those involved with the DoD process, if only as background for further assessment of US options.<P>

<B>2. Ship Science and Shipbuilding<BR>
   a. Workshop on Electronic Communications for the Shipbuilding Industry and its Vendor Base, Howard Bunch</B> (<A HREF="mailto:hbunch@onreur.navy.mil">hbunch@onreur.navy.mil</A>)<BR>
An emplaced electronic communications network is widely seen as one of the mechanisms needed to significantly improve competitiveness of the shipbuilding enterprise.  Rapid information transfer supports shortened production time, flexible manufacturing systems, and mass customization of  products.  In recognition of these benefit, shipyards and their vendors around the world are actively developing electronic communication systems.  National efforts are supported in the US, Europe, and the Pacific Rim.  Individual shipyards are aggressively evaluating concepts, and some are actively into the implementation phase.  Some vendor associations are supporting the implementation initiatives of their members, and most of the classification societies are evaluating networks linking them to the shipyards and to the vendor base.  ONREur hosted a 2-day workshop in October to examine the benefits of international cooperation among these efforts, to assess the degree of interest in cooperation, and start to address some of the technical issues. <A HREF="http://www.ehis.navy.mil/hbnews6.htm">Newsletter #6</A> describes US, European and Japanese initiatives, and summarizes the breakout sessions that all concurred on the need for coordination among interest groups.  Coordination should be directed through the MARIS G-7 organization, in particular the MARVEL activity (see <A HREF="http://www.ehis.navy.mil/cdnews7.htm">CO/TD Rpt #7</A>)<BR>
   <B>b. U. Southampton, Depts of Ship Science and Electronics, Peter Majumdar</B> (<A HREF="mailto:pmajumdar@onreur.navy.mil">pmajumdar@onreur.navy.mil</A>)<BR>
Prominent research areas in the Dept of Ship Science are ship dynamics, propulsor hydrodynamics with emphasis on computational fluid dynamics (CFD), and ship structures with emphasis on light-weight composites.  Its undergraduate program has a unique requisite, involving all of the real-world features: project definition; preparation of technical and cost proposals; presentations; obtaining approval and budget; project planning; hardware purchase; project management and execution; and, possible budget cuts!  The Dept Head, Prof W.G. Price, long regarded as one of world's foremost authorities on ship dynamics, joined University eight years ago and has brought the quality and diversity of ship related research in this Department to match today's specialized demand.<BR>
Established in 1946, Southampton's Dept of Electronics and Computer Science is the oldest such department among the UK universities.  It is engaged in very high quality research, including some which combines computer science with neuroscience, and fuzzy logic for application to real-time active control systems design.  <A HREF="http://www.ehis.navy.mil/pmnews5.htm">Newsletter #5</A>.<BR>
   <B>c. Eighth International Conference on Laser Techniques in Fluid Mechanics, Peter Majumdar</B> (<A HREF="mailto:pmajumdar@onreur.navy.mil">pmajumdar@onreur.navy.mil</A>)<BR>
8-11 Jul 96. This conference, held every two years at U. Lisbon, updates the community on developments in non-intrusive measurement techniques for unsteady turbulent fluid flow and related energy transfer. It closely followed the 21st ONR Symposium on Naval Hydrodynamics in Trondheim, which featured Navy emphasis on numerical simulation and prediction of ship dynamical and propulsive performance for realistic ship hull geometry and ocean environments.  In many cases such numerical "model tests" are aimed at replacing the traditional, expensive practice of physical model tests.  Detailed and accurate lab measurements are however essential to develop sufficient confidence in these numerical models: for validation of their physics-based modeling of fluid-flow and associated energy-transfer mechanisms, and for certification of a physical parameter-based envelope within which such validation holds.  Because this validation must be established for each computational step representing a re-distribution of energy within the fluid, the corresponding lab tests must provide a very accurate, high-resolution description of the kinematic and dynamic properties of the fluid.  Recent advances in non-intrusive measurement techniques and related data-processing software (especially in Denmark, UK and US) discussed at this conference are of great significance for numerical model validation and certification.  ONREur will hold an international workshop in a few months, towards establishing specific needs, related plans, and international collaboration possibilities in both sponsorship and execution of the research plans. <A HREF="http://www.ehis.navy.mil/pmnews4.htm">Newsletter #4</A><P>

<B>3. Computer and Software S&T</B><BR>
  <B> a. U. Leeds, Keyworth Institute of Manufacturing and Information Systems Engineering, Bruce Barnes</B> (<A HREF="mailto:bbarnes@nsf.gov">bbarnes@nsf.gov</A>)<BR>
The Keyworth Institute was endowed in 1993 to enhance the organizational competitiveness of UK manufacturing and service industries by increasing their responsiveness and flexibility.  Its principle activities involve R&D, tech transfer and education.  U. Leeds has a long and distinguished history of education and research in Computer Science and related topics.  The school of Computer Studies is among the largest in Britain and has an international reputation. It offers a very rich and diverse set of degree programs. The Faculty of Engineering, especially the Dept of Mechanical Engineering, has been a leader in the development of computer aided design (see below).  Combining these strengths within the Keyworth Institute should provide a suitable instrument for effecting change within British industry.  <A HREF="http://www.ehis.navy.mil/bbnews26.htm">Newsletter #26</A><BR>
   <B>b. U. Leeds Computer Model for Simultaneous Engineering, Peter Majumdar</B> (<A HREF="mailto:pmajumdar@onreur.navy.mil">pmajumdar@onreur.navy.mil</A>)<BR>
In the UK, both MOD and the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) (as well as industry) support research on streamlining process engineering and manufacture as well as in-service configuration control and logistics support.  The model currently under development at the ME Dept at Leeds is an example of such efforts. In conformity with ISO standards the model architecture comprises modules for requirements, resources, their interpretation and test for compatibility; the development of product model of a generic description for manufacture; and life-cycle configuration control. <A HREF="http://www.ehis.navy.mil/pmnews6.htm">Newsletter #6</A>.<BR>
   <B>c. Computer Science at U. Copenhagen, Bruce Barnes</B> (<A HREF="mailto:bbarnes@nsf.gov">bbarnes@nsf.gov</A>)<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.ehis.navy.mil/bbnews28.htm">Newsletter #28</A> reports a visit with faculty from the Computer Vision, Programming Languages, Numerical Analysis, and Optimization research groups of the Computer Science Dept at the U. Copenhagen, officially the Datalogisk Institut, Kobenhavns Universitet (DIKU).  The department grew out of Mathematics and this is reflected in the research and educational programs which have a very solid mathematical orientation.  Visual exploration, particularly 3D reconstruction from 2D images, is one of the specialties of the Computer Vision research group.  They are particularly active in various alternative camera technologies.  The department is very strong in areas associated with operations research, especially various types of optimization problems.  They are employing parallel computers in many of their applications and are beginning to incorporate computational geometry in some of their algorithms.  The English language plays a central role in their educational programs and non Danish students who are reasonably fluent in English can obtain the Ph.D. degree at the University of Copenhagen.<BR>
   <B>d.  First International Workshop on Image Databases and Multimedia Search, Stan Sclaroff</B> (<A HREF="mailto:sclaroff@cs.bu.edu">sclaroff@cs.bu.edu</A>)<BR>
U. Amsterdam, Aug 22-23 96.  The workshop was sponsored in part by the International Association for Pattern Recognition (IAPR); approximately 100 attendees and 30 papers, mainly focused on image database indexing based on color, shape, and motion properties.  Notably absent were papers that described results using texture, or methods that employed combinations of image properties. The author
presented recent results of research in shape representation, in particular nonrigid shape representation. The report gives technical highlights from the workshop, with emphasis on the shape indexing papers, though some other papers in color and video are described, plus critical analysis and assessment of scientific benefit to the ONR supported research program as appropriate. <A HREF="http://www.ehis.navy.mil/sclaroff.htm">Stan Sclaroff's report</A><P><HR><P>

<B>a.  EU & US Participation in the G7 Project MARIS</B><BR>
MARIS-the "Maritime Information Society"-is one of 11 pilot projects adopted by the G7 in June 95, to address the revolution in information technology.  The title comes from the European approach to IT: an emphasis on people and social/industrial adjustment.  The Dublin meeting (24Sep) was one of several around Europe to further develop the concept, identify opportunities for joint projects, and expose local IT and Marine industries to the opportunities.  The EC is actively soliciting and supporting research and industrial participation in MARIS.  Canada (Joint project leader with the EU) has no single source of MARIS funding, but reported a few marine safety related projects.  Japan established a national forum to develop a consensus on what theyre willing to share and how to approach the issue.  The US reported that we essentially have done nothing identifiable as MARIS; we agreed to the concept at the Presidential level, but that has not been translated into programmatics or even coordination.  The differences between the US and EU (and Japanese) approaches are palpable. We view the basic IT issue from fundamentally different viewpoints; the EC has leaped on this opportunity to advance European maritime potential and tie this initiative in with their Framework programmes via bottoms-up participation, and Japan developed a consensus national approach, while the US - for whatever reason - has virtually ignored it.  Equally interesting, no one seemed surprised at the US attitude.  Europeans are looking after their interests and pushing opportunities to improve safety and competitiveness of their industry, especially for SMEs, and if we dont want to, well thats just fine.  American maritime industry can just fend for itself, by itself. <A HREF="http://www.ehis.navy.mil/cdnews7.htm">Newsletter #7</A>.<P>

<B>b.  S&T in Ireland, Part 1</B><BR>
Universities are the center of Irish S&T.  The nation, and the Universities themselves, are avidly directing research efforts toward innovation and linkages to the booming enterprise sector.  The EU has been a major source for S&T support, and leading researchers have close collaborations throughout the continent as well as with Irish companies.  <A HREF="http://www.ehis.navy.mil/cdnews8.htm">Newsletter #8</A> describes in some detail the various EC, federal, and local mechanisms employed to successfully couple S&T to innovation in Ireland, and gives examples in materials, optoelectronics, biotech, and environmental sciences at Trinity College Dublin and U. College Gallway.<P>

<B>c.  NATO Science Programmes</B><BR>
<A HREF="http://www.ehis.navy.mil/cdnews10.htm">Newsletter #10</A> is a reminder about a NATO research program that much of our DoD audience may have heard about but not thought much about, since it is on the civilian vice military side of the NATO house, with little connection to DRGs/AGARD (except cross-briefings).  The NATO Science Programme has a nearly 40 year history of broad based support of inter-Alliance collaborative research.  Its major mechanisms are senior teaching seminars (ASIs) and visits between collaborators.  More recently, it has established priority areas (and several new funding mechanisms) for research collaboration with Cooperation Partners (CPs; essentially FWP/FSU nations).  All projects are open to application from any Alliance researcher (including those in federal labs-thus this note); the intra-Alliance programs are hotly competitive, but there are ample opportunities for support of high quality projects with CPs, especially in "S&T Policy".  The program soon will receive scrutiny for NATO relevance, and would benefit from new projects of high alliance impact.  US DoD and DoD-affiliated applicants should keep the US Mission to NATO aware of their interests.<P>

<B>a. Technology Assessment: Materials S&T (Mecholsky Final Report), Jack Mecholsky</B> (<A HREF="mailto:jmech@silica.mse.ufl.edu">jmech@silica.mse.ufl.edu</A>)<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.ehis.navy.mil/jmnews12.htm">ONREur Report 96-2-R</A> is an in-depth summary of Jacks assessments while assigned to this staff from Aug95-Aug96.  The 3 major sections cover biomedical applications of materials, advanced ceramics and composites, and fractal fracture.  The report describes the technical and procedural strengths of the European community as a whole, and national capabilities, in each of these technology areas.  The author notes several areas in which European work equals or exceeds ours, as well as European interactions worthy of emulation.<P>

<B>b. The Inaugural Hirsch Lecture: Surprises in Materials Science by Sir Alan Cottrell FRS, Ben Wilcox</B> (<A HREF="mailto:bwilcox@onreur.navy.mil">bwilcox@onreur.navy.mil</A>)<BR>
Presented Oct 4 96 at the University Museum, Oxford, it honored Sir Peter Hirsch, formerly Chair of the Materials Department on the occasion of his 70th birthday.  Sir Alan's lecture was a tour de force for both its clarity and its content of exciting "surprises". Included in his list were: the observation by Hirsch and his group in the 1950's using transmission electron microscopy that dislocations in Al moved due to stresses generated by beam heating; unexpected catastrophic failure of Liberty ships during World War II because the ductile-to-brittle transition temperature of the ship steel was not sufficiently low to withstand brittle fracture in icy waters; the surprising behavior in Ni3Al where the strength increases with increasing temperature; the observation that brittle solids (glass and ceramics) can be made to fail non-catastrophically by reinforcing with fibers; the discovery of quasicrystals ,or solids which exhibit five-fold crystallographic symmetry; fullerines or , C60, sometimes referred to as "bucky balls"; and most importantly high temperature ceramic superconductors based on the cuprate family. <A HREF="http://www.ehis.navy.mil/bwnews3.htm">MSE#96-003</A><P>

<B>c. Ceramic and Metal Matrix Composites: CMMC 96, Ben Wilcox</B> (<A HREF="mailto:bwilcox@onreur.navy.mil">bwilcox@onreur.navy.mil</A>)<BR>
This conference on CMC's and MMC's, held in San Sebastian, Spain, Sep 9-12 96, was very well attended by representatives from 25 countries.  There were 20 half day oral sessions, and 60 posters.  Five papers were on ceramic fibers, and the remaining talks and posters about equally divided between CMC's and MMC's. The presentations showed considerable recent progress in developing the microstructures (especially the interface between matrix and reinforcement) required to achieve desired performance goals.  The only composite system which appears to be gaining substantial use at present is particulate SiC reinforced Al.  Others, i.e. CMC's and SiC fiber reinforced Ti alloys, show promise in jet engine applications.  However costs must be reduced through improved innovative processing before the composites will see widespread applications. <A HREF="http://www.ehis.navy.mil/bwnews4.htm">MSE #96-004</A><P>

<B>3. International Center for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology, Igor Vodyanoy</B> (<A HREF="mailto:ivodyanoy@onreur.navy.mil">ivodyanoy@onreur.navy.mil</A>)<BR>
The UN Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) recognized at a very early stage the potential of genetic engineering and biotechnology to alleviate disease and starvation and to promote the economic progress of the developing world. It began the initiative that has led to the foundation of ICGEB, located in Trieste and New Delhi. The research, training schemes and services of ICGEB represent an innovative and comprehensive approach to promote biotechnology internationally. The Center helps developing nations help themselves by strengthening their research capabilities, and holds out the prospect for advancing knowledge and applying the latest biotech techniques in public health, nutrition, environmental protection/remediation and energy saving. ICGEB provides a scientific and educational environment of the highest standards. Its labs develop state-of-the-art research of importance to bio-industries in Member States. <A HREF="http://www.ehis.navy.mil/ivnews25.htm">Report #25</A>

<B>a. European Commission - The Joint Research Center.</B><BR>
JRC began as a nuclear research facility at Ispra, Italy.  Starting in the 70s its focus shifted to environmental and solar energy, nuclear safety, and advanced materials.  Over the years JRC expanded to eight institutes at five sites. Its annual budget is now some 300M ECUs.  <A HREF="http://www.ehis.navy.mil/nsf81.htm">Report #81</A> provides basic information about JRC and its Institute for Advanced Materials, and describes significant recent changes: As of Apr 96 JRC is an independent Directorate-General (DG) within the EC, and must competitively seek support for 25-30% of its budget from Framework Programs and third parties, including industry; and staffing has been made more fluid through the addition of 3-yr nonrenewable contracts (in addition to 5-yr renewable ones).  These changes reflect the European policy of driving S&T to productivity, innovation, and competitiveness.<BR>
<B>b. A view of Science and Technology in Finland</B><BR>
With a small but well educated population and a modern infrastructure of well equipped labs, Finland is making great strides to establish itself as an international force in advanced technology. It already has leading positions in specialties such as atomic layer epitaxy and mobile telecom equipment. Government policy is to increase investment in research and foster intimate collaboration of government labs and universities with industry. <A HREF="http://www.ehis.navy.mil/nsf86.htm">Report #86</A> gives a general background, and describes the major government players: the Academy, the University of Helsinki, the Technology Development Center (TEKES, the main agency for applied R&D and technological development), and the Technical Research Center (VTT), the largest in the Nordic countries with 9 institutes and 2700 employees.<P>

Saratov, Russia, 7-14 Jul 96; 114 attendees from 16 countries.  <A HREF="http://www.ehis.navy.mil/mcclinto.htm">Report #4</A> enumerates the 155 papers and posters in a wide range of applications, and highlights key presentations. Proceedings will be published in a special issue of the <I>International Journal of Bifurcation and Chaos</I>.  The standard of presentations was high, and the conference enabled discussion among many scientists and engineers who would not normally have encountered each other.<P>

<B>3. Intellectual Property and Business Activity in the Russian Federation, John Lewis (jlewis@onreur.navy.mil)</B><BR>
The <B>NATO</B> Advanced Research Workshop on Intellectual Property: Influence on Business Activity took place in <B>Moscow</B> from Sept 9-11 96.  This was the third annual workshop aimed at providing to the Russian Federation, Western ideas on how to expeditiously transfer state owned technology to the world market place.  The ten Western speakers and the breakout sessions discussed issues in three areas: firm strategy, finance and capital, and moving federal technology out of the state institutions into the market place.  The prescription in all three categories was the same: pass fair legislation in employee/employer relations concerning intellectual property, get a patent law on the books, straighten out the banks (2/3 of the 3000+ banks are bankrupt), and create a fair tax system so the entrepreneurs of the world can enter and do business.  A comprehensive court system and civil code needs to be put in place so that there is a means for dispute resolution.  MOUs and DEAs are needed, but first the Russians have to know what their national law and policy are, or they can not staff and sign such agreements.<BR>
	Most of the Western speakers had attended the first two workshops and they all spoke of the attitude change in the Russian participants.  There were still a few old school ideologues that advocated state ownership of technology, or at least state compensation for the technological base developed under the old Soviet institutions.  However they were in the minority and mostly derided by their Russian colleagues.  From Vice Minister Yakobashvilli, Ministry of S&T, to the Heads of Agencies, to the new S&T incubators, all appreciated the ideas and workshop, and all seemed determined to make the changes necessary to enter the free market and global market place.  They ask our forbearance and for us to understand the Russian difference, and to appreciate why it was taking a long time.  They do think differently and have a different history and culture.  It is the authors opinion that we made some mistakes in rushing in and buying research at fire sale prices.  What we needed then and need now, is truly collaborative undertakings. <A HREF="http://www.ehis.navy.mil/jlnews7.htm">Newsletter #7</A>.<P>

	<B>a. 7th AMS Conference on Mesoscale Processes - The Mesoscale has Grown; Alan Weinstein (<A HREF="mailto:aweinstein@onreur.navy.mil">aweinstein@onreur.navy.mil</A>)</B><BR>
Reading, UK, 9-13 Sep 96; 300 attendees, mostly from US and UK.  The conference reflected the current expanded definition of mesoscale by devoting almost 1/3 of the time to extratropical cyclones.  The remainder dealt with the more standard mesoscale topics of convection, orographic forcing, the boundary layer and gravity waves. Notable observations include:<BR>
<OL>
<LI>Important interactions between convective and orographic processes on the traditional mesoscale, and such synoptic scale processes and phenomena as baroclinic instability, fronts, cyclones, etc., can send energy either up or down scale. Recognition of this has tied the mesoscale and synoptic communities much closer together.
<LI>Computer technology has brought practical numerical modeling down to scales where classical mesoscale phenomena (e.g. squall lines, sea breezes, mountain winds) are resolvable, thereby unleashing important new observational considerations.
<LI>With growing availability of  "non-conventional" observations (radar, wind profilers, satellite data), data assimilation has taken on greater importance in numerical weather prediction on all scales.  In combination with growing computer power, data assimilation is making previously esoteric methods (e.g. adjoint), commonplace.
<LI>Appreciation for the impact of initial condition errors on numerical forecast skill has generated considerable interest in targeting observations where they can have the most impact on forecast skill, heralding a lively competition for ideas on how to best identify targets.

	<B>b. UK Oceanography 96: A Testimony to the Health and Vigor of Ocean Science Research in the UK, Alan Weinstein et al (<A HREF="mailto:aweinstein@onreur.navy.mil">aweinstein@onreur.navy.mil</A>)</B><BR>
This latest of the Challenger Society for Marine Science's biennial UK conferences was held at Univ. of Wales, Bangor (UWB) 2-6 Sep96.  Topics covered the spectrum from physical, through bgc, to biological oceanography; domains ranged from coastal margins (including estuaries and beaches), through the shelf, to the deep ocean, from the sediments, through the volume, to the surface and atmosphere. This conference, by design, attracts a large number of UK students and postdocs (who speak), plus the national leaders (who listen); the 380+ attendance is 3x that of the first (1984) in this series. Also by design, renowned scientists from other European nations were invited. Other than three from ONR Europe, there were none from US. Notable observations:<BR>
<OL>
<LI>European and UK oceanography continue to have many local field campaigns, resulting in a rich base of new data;  
<LI>Most analysis of this field data to date has been individual case studies, from which overall conclusions have not yet emerged; and
<LI>Many of the local findings have analogies in U.S. work, with little if any mentioned recognition.
</OL>
<A HREF="http://www.ehis.navy.mil/awnews5.htm">Newsletter 96-5</A> describes the various sessions and key papers.<BR>
	<B>c.  Signal Processing at Heriot-Watt University, 
Edinburgh, Scotland; John Joseph (<A HREF="mailto:jjoseph@onreur.navy.mil">jjoseph@onreur.navy.mil</A>) Robert Dolan/Ken Lobb (<A HREF="mailto:rdolan@onerur.navy.mil">rdolan@onerur.navy.mil</A>)</B><BR>
A research group under Dr Laurie Linnett of the Dept of Computing and EE has developed a variety of robust signal processing methods using statistical and fractal techniques to extract subtle patterns from complex fields of data, and reduce data storage requirements.  ONR Europe was sufficiently interested in this work that we have made two separate visits to Linnets lab, described in <A HREF="http://www.ehis.navy.mil/jjnews6.htm">OAS Newsletter 96-6</A> and <A HREF="http://www.ehis.navy.mil/rdnews2.htm">Coastal Oceanography Report #2</A>.  Linnetts group has demonstrated success in real world problems of texture classification, object detection, and sidescan sonar M&S; and their techniques are of significant interest for a variety of naval and oceanographic applications.<BR>
	<B>d. Notes from a visit to Proudman Oceanographic Lab (POL), Robert Dolan (<A HREF="mailto:rdolan@onerur.navy.mil">rdolan@onreur.navy.mil</A>)</B><BR>
POL, near Liverpool, England, one of the three labs of the UK NERC Centre for Coastal and Marine Sciences (CCMS).  POL specializes in storm surge research (modeling and prediction), large and small scale coastal processes, sediment transport in estuaries, and impact of climate change on coastal environments.  <A HREF="http://www.ehis.navy.mil/rdnews1.htm">Report #1</A> describes the POL funding process, and relates discussions about UK coastal oceanography with four POL scientists, Roger Flather, David Prandle, Peter Hardcastle, and Peter Thorne. <P><HR><P>

<H2>ONREUR Special Report<BR>
First FY97 NICOP Awards<BR>
15 August Board</H2>

The Naval International Cooperative Opportunities in Science and Technology Program (NICOP) made its first cost sharing awards at a review Board that met on 15 August 1996.  The NICOP funds available for FY97 and FY98 are approximately $1M and $1.35M respectively. The awards shown below were for a total of $495 FY97, $349FY98, and $150FY 99.  The next deadline for requests will be 15 Jan 97; a future announcement will provide additional details, including focal issues for the next round.<P>

NICOP has three parts: Development of country plans and strategies for international S&T cooperation, improvement of distributed data bases, and cost sharing with Navy S&T sponsors to encourage them to take advantage of international opportunities. ONREur serves as technical manager for the program.<P>

Requests for NICOP cost-sharing are submitted by sponsors (ONR POs, or managers in Labs and Warfare Centers or SYSCOMS via ONR), based on proposals from collaborative teams of US and international investigators. NICOP will fund up to 50% of the US share of overseas costs for proposals selected competitively (based on technical merit, impact on naval requirements, and potential for long term collaboration).  The S&T from such efforts should, over time, improve the opportunities for coplanning and codevelopment.  NICOP also serves to provide continuity to the special emphasis on NIS S&T under its predecessor, SOP.<P>

The projects listed below received awards from the first Board.  The success rate was 50%.  A NICOP award does not guarantee that a project will proceed.  NICOP awarded only 40% of the funds requested for the successful proposals, and it is the responsibility of the individual sponsors to determine whether on not to proceed with funds available.<P>

The requests which received awards are listed below, by nation of the non-US collaborator.  Address questions to <A HREF="mailto:cdorman@onreur.navy.mil">cdorman@onreur.navy.mil</A>.<P>

N6-14  Sonovision<BR>
 Institutions & PIs:  N.N.Andreyev Acoustics Institute, N. Dubovsky et al; Naval EOD Tech Division, Bruce Johnson<BR>
 ONR POC:  ONR 332, Wally Smith; ONR 321, Tom Swean;<BR>
 Description:  This project evolved from an ONREur workshop on ultrasonic imaging followed by a visit to the Andreyev Institute in Moscow. The Russians use a "Sokolov tube" which employs a scanned electronic beam (vice contact bonds) to provide the output signal; the US previously failed in attempts to develop this technique. This project improves imaging capability, quantifies system performance, and assesses utility of the technology for "underwater vision", a major need for divers and MCM<P>

N6-18 Modeling of Electron Cyclotron Resonance Plasmas<BR>
 Institutions & PIs: St Petersburg Technical University, Lev Tsendin; NRL DC, Wally Manheimer<BR>
 ONR POC: ONR 331, Chuck Roberson<BR>
 Description: This project supports NRL's ARI on the scientific basis of plasma processing.  The electron cyclotron plasma reactor (ECR) is important for plasma processing, and also a very complex device.  Mannheimer met Tsendin during his sabbatical at MSU.  The collaboration that resulted involves numerical, semi-analytical and theoretical modeling of ECR and other high density discharges.<P>

N6-24 Solar Powered AUVs; Sampling Systems for the 21st Century<BR>

Two SBIRs under that MURI are looking at power generation at docking nodes; this project focuses on power generation integral to the vehicle.  The Russian partner has already developed vehicle design parameters for a solar powered AUV.  This program will evaluate its feasibility.  Under this continuing collaboration IMTP will fabricate a prototype testbed in conjunction with AUSI staff, and both parties will work on subsystem improvements and tests.<P>

N6-29 Small Scale Acoustic Tomography in a Bubbly Medium<BR>
 Institutions & PIs:  Institute of Applied Physics, Nizhny Novgorod, Alexander Kkil'ko; Shirshov Institute of Oceanology, Moscow, Oleg Goldin; NRL-SSC: Jerry Caruthers<BR>
 ONR POC:  ONR 321 Jeff Simmen;<BR>
 Description: Based on SOP-supported investigations of Russian tomographic approaches by Carurthers and Khil'ko over the past two years, a technique of Goldin's using non-reciprocal tomography to measure ocean currents will be developed and applied.  This will be done in parallel with ONR's project on the influence of bubbles on sonar in shallow water, of which Caruthers is PI.  The NRL Delta Frame will be modified for a range of tomographic techniques, and data collected; Khil'ko will develop inversion techniques and conduct tank experiments on bubble clouds; Godin will analyze local currents based on his new approach<P>

N6-40  Vapor Phase Growth of 3C SiC Crystals<BR>
 Institutions & PIs: Baikov Institute of Metallurgy, Moscow; S. Gorin & L. Ivanova; Univ. Cincinnati, Prof Andrew Steckl<BR>
 ONR POC: ONR 312, Max Yoder;<BR>
 Description: SiC bulk crystals grown by Baikov in the 70's have outstanding structural properties, better than anything available in the US. The proposed 3-year program establishes at the University of Cincinnati a modernized chamber to match the Russian SiC quality, and provides both parties a new chamber design.<P>

N6-44 Turbulent Flame Stabilization & Combustion Control in Subsonic and Supersonic Combusters by a Joint Velocity Scalar PDF Method<BR>
 Institutions & PIs:  Semenov Institute of Chemical Physics, Sergei Frolov; Purdue, Steven Frankel; UCSD, Forman Williams<BR>
 Navy POC: ONR 333: Gabriel Roy<BR>
 Description: The PIs will address flame stabilization control and combustion control from the theoretical and computational point of view.  The validated codes can significantly contribute in guiding and optimizing design in missiles like Fast Hawk and Scram Shell.<P>

<B>2.  ARMENIA (3)</B><P>

N6-21 Special Technique for Laser Patterning of Large-Area High-T Superconductor Thin Films<BR>
 Institutions & PIs:  Physics Research Institute, Ashtarak, Armnen Kuzanian; NRL 6670, James Horwitz<BR>
 ONR POC:  ONR 312, Deborah Van Vechten<BR>
 Description: This project continues an SOP initiated collaboration on deposition of high-T superconducting films using a new technique called pulsed laser deposition.  Last year the PIs designed and tested a unique deposition system capable of depositing HTS thin films on 4" wafers.  NRL is securing patent rights.  In this project, the PIs will design a laser micromachining system for patterning these wafers, that will be constructed in Armenia, T&E'd in the US, and reside at NRL Code 6670.  This will allow them to customize individual samples and offer a preparation variant currently unavailable at NRL.  The system could also be used to pattern other materials such as ferroelectrics, benefiting many NRL research efforts.<P>

N6-31 Optimization of Parameters of Non-Equilibrium X-Ray/US Detectors<BR>
 Institutions & PIs:  Physics Research Institute, Ashtarak, A. Gyulamiryan; NRL 7621, Kent Wood<BR>
 ONR POC:  ONR 312, Deborah Van Vechten<BR>
 Description: This collaboration proposes to optimize parameters for non-equilibrium photon detectors, sensitive to X-rays and UV radiation and designed to serve as space based spectrometers.  There also are many potential terrestrial applications, for which this work will evaluate practicality.  The Armenian team will produce sensors that they will bring to NRL to test; the Armenian team will be augmented by a senior Armenian scientist who will be at NRL for the year.  This is the third year of this collaboration, previously supported by two SOP grants.  However, the phenomena to be exploited are recently discovered.<P>

N6-33 Rare Earth Halide Crystal Growth and Their Optical Characteristics Investigation<BR>
 Institutions & PIs:  Physics Research Institute, Ashtarak, E. Vartanian; NRL 5640, Barry Feldman<BR>
 ONR POC:  ONR 312, Ingham Mack<BR>
 Description: NRL is pursuing mid-IR solid state lasers.  An LaC13 laser grown at NRL has operated efficiently at 7.24 microns; however these crystals are hard to grow.  The Armenians have novel techniques (and equipment) which in other materials yield crystals with dislocation densities an order of magnitude lower than conventionally grown materials.  In this project NRL will work with the Armenians to improve growth of improved LaC13.  Armenians will grow the crystals and do initial testing; NRL will evaluate them and feed back recommendations.  There will be face-to-face exchanges.<P>

N6-12:  Non-Linear Analysis of Neuronal Cells Behavior<BR>
 Institutions & PIs:  Pasteur Institute, H. Korn et al; NRL Center for Biomolecular S&E, Joel Schnur et al<BR>
 ONR POC:   Tom Mckenna<BR>
 Description: This project couples two productive and original groups in a novel bioengineering project, the end objective of which is cell based biosensors for generic early detection of potential hazards. NRL has pioneered control of cell growth and Pasteur the fundamental understanding of neuronal behavior.  This project focuses on nonlinear analysis of synaptic signals and neuronal activity and the influence of chaotic and stochastic patterns of signaling on the input-output functions of neuronal networks.  It is a three year, basic research project.<P>

N6-32 Hierarchical Field Model of Hippocampus for Pattern Recognition<BR>
 Institutions & PIs: Institute de Biologie Theorique, Angers, Gilbert Chauvet; USC, Ted Berger<BR>
 ONR POC: ONR 342, Joel Davis<BR>
 Description: This project analyzes hippocampal activity, models and interprets it in Cellular Neural Network formalism, and validates the approach (including the feasibility of a chip design) for speech recognition.  The two PI's met via Joel Davis, at an ONREur workshop; Berger does biologically based algorithms for speech, and Chauvet is expert in CNN pattern recognition.  The NICOP request was actually initiated by Chauvet, and proposes this (new) collaboration.<P>

N6-25 Advanced Permanent Magnets<BR>
 Institutions & PIs:  Trinity College, Dublin; NSWC Carderock, James Cullen
 ONR POC: Kristl Hathaway<BR>
 Description: This project takes advantage of Dr Cullen's upcoming Fullbright fellowship to work with Prof Coey on magnetoelasticity, to initiate a collaborative investigation into three novel concepts in permanent magnets.  The PIs propose to formulate analytical models that can provide guidelines in optimizing the materials and structures during later experimental research.  The 3-year project looks for improvements in energy product, high-T performance, and manufacturing cost through energy-coupled two-phase magnets, dipole-coupled two phase magnets, and permanent magnet variable flux sources.<P>

N6-34 Integration of Fabric Reinforced Thermoplastics into GMT Moulding Process<BR>
 Institutions & PIs:  University College Gallway, C. O'Bradaigh; University of Limerick, Pat Mallon; University of Delaware, Jack Gillespie; NSWC Roger Crane; NRL Roger Badaliance<BR>
 ONR POC:  332 Jim Kelly<BR>
 Description: The project seeks to integrate high-performance glass-fabric composite materials into the short-fiber GMT molding process, in which Europe has the lead. ONR funds Gillespie at U Delaware, where O'Bradaigh got his PhD and Mallon spent a sabbatical, for similar work.  The project if successful would result in significant cost reduction for structural parts.  There is expected to be  significant commercial application, and industrial involvement will be sought in the third year.<P>

<B>1.  Summary</B><BR>
From 3-9 March 1996, CDR Larry Raithel, USN and Dr. Craig Dorman, respectively CO and TD of ONR Europe, visited the Romanian Military staffs and R&D Institutes in Bucharest and Constanta as a USEUCOM Joint Contact Team Program "Event" (one of about 8/week in Romania).  Trip objectives: Assist Romanians in developing laboratory capabilities (per their request), and evaluate DEA possibilities for USN following Master Information Exchange Agreement (MIEA) signing by USD(A&T) Kaminski in late February (per request of OP-091).<P>

Our event was unusual in that it was the first to deal with R&D.  It also was more senior than most.  Our Romanian hosts demonstrated and described their needs for US Navy assistance.  Now that the MIEA has been signed, they hope to move rapidly from general discussions such as ours and other Military-to-Military visits, to specific, concrete technical support in their priority areas: Design of a new standard frigate; underway refueling and replenishment modifications for their Destroyer; submarine rescue using their 300M capable diving systems; and in general, conversion to US and NATO standards.<P>

<B>2.  General Information</B><BR>
Romania is entering a period of rapid change, nationally and militarily.  Although the revolution that ousted Ceaucescu was in 89 (and they preface most descriptions of organizations and capabilities with "Since 89..."), until the last year or so change has been slow and moderate compared to many other previously Communist nations.  There will be a new budget at the end of March, and this is the first year for major reductions in Defense, due largely to IMF and World Bank pressure. The Ministry of Defense (MoD) expects about a 30% reduction; this reduction has not yet been allocated to the Services.  Local elections occur this spring, Presidential and Parliament in fall.<P>

The Military (especially the Army) is popular due to its role in standing up to (then trying & shooting) Ceaucescu in the 89 revolution.  In response to fiscal pressures and international events the military has decided to restructure and reform, though they are moving slowly and cautiously.  Leadership is, however, converted.  They are enthusiastic about PfP, and seek early NATO membership (though some problems remain, e.g. a border disagreement with the Ukraine over an offshore island).  They have made NATO standardization the top military development priority, and the need for change  now  is a consistent theme; as is lack of money.<P>

One of their major problems is that since the Russians never provided all the military equipment they felt they needed (They were always in their terms the black sheep of the Warsaw Pact, particularly after their refusal to invade Czechoslovakia in 68), they developed quite a complete capability to design/build their own. As a result they now have a huge military industry base with about 160K workers, of which 80K produce purely military equipment, but only about 15K total (9K military) are actively working.  These unproductive workers are a large drain on the national budget. In addition, they developed their own specifications and standards for this equipment, and these must all now be converted if they are to become NATO compatible.<P>  

Thus they have some hard choices to make as they restructure, privatize, and downsize, while simultaneously attempting to adopt western/NATO standards.  The civilian Chief of the MoD (Georghe Tinca) apparently asked Dr. Kaminski for a defense industrial specialist for about 6 months; his reply, we were told, was that we could send in specialist teams for shorter visits.<P>

The MoD has only recently been headed by a civilian.  In addition to the General Staff there are three service branches (Army, Navy, and Air Force/Air Defense), a Civilian-led Policy & International Relations Department, a joint Procurement and Logistics (P&L) Department, under State Secretary and Chief General Florentin Popa (reputedly hard working and extremely capable...as are many of the leaders, if not the nomenklatura), and the military industries.  The P&L Department is responsible for budget, planning, and execution of R&D, acquisition, repair, and logistics; for control of exports/imports; and for coordination (not ownership) of defense industry.  Basic research is under the Ministry of Research and Technology, and the Research Institutes are under the Romanian Academy of Science.  (Apparently science was under Mme Ceaucescu until 89...and thus didnt fare very well).<P>

The Ministry of Research and Technology coordinates the overall national research program (for which there is a plan out to 2000), of which one chapter is defense.  Some of this work is carried out by MoD Institutes - Research Institute of the Armed Forces, Centers for Research on Military Chemistry and Medicine, and the Scientific Research Center of the Romanian Navy (which is subordinated to and receives its requirements from HQ Navy Staff but works iaw P&L Department plans & funding allocations).<P>

The Navy, headquartered in Constanta, has since 89 been organized into the Black Sea Fleet, the Danube Fleet, a separate Submarine and Diving brigade, the Marine Corps (3 Brigades), and Auxiliary forces.  Major fleet units include (see Janes for a more detailed description):<P>

Black Sea Fleet:  DD111 [started in the late 70s, completed in 85 but not fully outfitted with current weapon suite until 92, finished testing 93, and has since participated in PfP and bilateral exercises in Black Sea and Med]; 5 Frigates in two classes [Program started 77; built 4 through 86.  Redesign began in 83 to complete gunnery...first new FF built in 90, in testing 91-93; and the 6th is now in final testing in the shipyard (they made no clear distinction between types of testing - also, time delays were all attributed to fiscal and internal situations, not technical capacity).  Most electronics and armament on the DD and FFs are vintage 60-70s Russian, with Romanian modifications. For the future they want to redesign, modernize, and become NATO compatible.  Development of a new "standard Frigate" and modification of the others is their first priority; the mission of the Frigates is first ASW, then air surveillance, then naval surveillance and counter-surface craft.<BR>
In addition they operate 3 ASW corvettes, 9 missile carriers (6 OSA, 3 Tarantul - with the only gas turbines in the fleet, everything else being diesel powered), 12 fast torpedo boats, 30(?) hydrofoils, each w/2 torpedo launchers, a KILO class submarine, 20 minesweepers, 2 minelayers, and various auxiliaries including 2 rescue tugs (4800HP), used to combat casualties, for support of offshore drilling platforms, for icebreaking in the canal and river, etc.  Over 80% of their ships and systems have been built in Romanian shipyards.  <P>

Danube Fleet:  3 gun & rocket carriers (BRUTAR? - 38.5M, 1.5M draft, beachable, carries a platoon, 80 rockets & many guns, armored [vs 14.5mm ammo] river boat), 25 Aluminum minesweepers, auxiliaries.  (NB: Border location varies along the Danube; agreements with Yugoslavia & Bulgaria provide for common use, with 45 day advance notice of significant military movements.  The Navy doesnt patrol the Delta; the Ministry of the Environment has environmental patrols and Ministry of the Interior has border troops that revert to Naval control in war).<P>

<B>3.  Romanian MoD Procurement and Logistics Department, and the MoD Institute for Research and Development.</B><BR>
Hosts: BG-dr-eng Nicolae Irimie, Chief of the R&D Office, MoD, P&L Dept.; and RADM-dr-eng Ion Plaviciosu, Commander, MoD Institute for R&D.<P>

The MoD Procurement and Logistics (P&L) Department receives requirements from the General Staff, and turns them into "research themes".  These are assigned to the Military R&D Institutes (which were started in 68) or to civilian institutes  to carry out, in parallel with the basic S&T agenda from the Ministry of Research and Technology.  <BR>
National scientific research is now being reorganized, with a combination of state & self-financing.  This causes MoD problems since some institutes (presumably those better able to support themselves on the economy) may not want to work with the military.  MoD will in the future favor its own Institutes because of lack of funds (i.e., theyre already paid for & no money need transfer...this philosophy was reiterated re shipbuilding the next day).  MoD funds (or at least P&L funds) now come from Parliament and the General Staff as a single lump sum, though they are discussing a division of funding into categories such as research, applied development, systems, etc. (details unclear - but there is no line item structure like ours).<BR>
Procurement, modernization and development programs are reviewed and approved by the Sovereign Council for Defense (Council for Endowment).  This Council meets quarterly.  It is chaired by the Chief of the General Staff, and comprises the Deputy State Secretary for P&L, the Service Chiefs, Service Logistics Directors, and R&D Institute representatives [?].  This council apparently makes all the decisions on what to develop and fund (e.g., the Diving Command described their presentation of a swimmer sled to the council as an essential step in obtaining funding). There is a separate commission, chaired by Gen. Popa with membership from the military industrial companies, that coordinates defense production.  As opposed to the other services, Navy spends more on procurement than R&D due to the cost of its systems.  <BR>
"In principle", each program has a manager, with a development team from the R&D Institutes, Military Academy, and appropriate civilian Institutes.  They are apparently in the process of modifying their process - the changes were described as very complex - and would like to better understand the US program management process.  Funds, however, are centrally controlled as opposed to assigned to individual programs, and shifted around in accordance with General Staff and P&L Department priorities.  Significant funding shifts are to be expected during the coming years of reduced funding (in conversations over the next several days, Navy representatives expressed concern over how they would fare relative to the other services, and emphasized the need to have their own institutes and shipyards to ensure Navy needs are met; where have I heard this before?).<P>

MoD utilizes the universities and civilian research institutes for basic science and technology, but has difficulties linking research to production.  In the past, they could simply place groups from the Military Institutes in the Military Industry companies for technical coordination and assistance; this will be more difficult and costly after privatization, so they must develop new methods of coordination.  (Both MoD and Naval R&D institutes claimed close coordination with civilian institutes; however the military prefers to use their own Institutes since they are already paid for).<P>

Radm Plaviciosu (who was spoken of very highly by the Naval Staff in Constanta, and apparently previously directed the Naval Science Research Center) stated that 86% of Romanian military equipment had been produced by their military industries.  The need for such a significant production capability was based on the strained relationships with Russia stemming from their refusal to invade Czechoslovakia in 68; since then, they have had to modify, modernize, and develop and manufacture spare parts for their Russian equipment, as well as to design and develop their own new systems.  However, the philosophy with which they approached this was eastern (example given:  mines to injure or maim vice kill, thus tying up additional forces and increasing the enemys logistic burden); now they must change to a western philosophy, as well as convert all their standards for NATO interoperability.<P>  

The General Staff has agreed that conversion to NATO standards and interoperability of Romanian forces are the top priority, and their approach is to start by cooperating with the US because of its technological leadership.  There are obviously many challenges and major changes associated with this conversion.  Priority areas, discussed with Dr. Kaminski, include sensors, C3I, and territorial surveillance (for which they are procuring a Lockheed-Martin radar), as well as weapons and ammunition.  They are very anxious to obtain STANAGs and other appropriate standards to help in modifying their current Romanian standards.  A major concern (expressed repeatedly, in all meetings) is lack of funding; they have the technical expertise, but can not afford to import anything they can develop or produce themselves.<P>

We commented that production implied sales to sustain capacity, and asked where they believed they were competitive.  Their response was light infantry armament, armored personnel vehicles, trucks, and field cars; however they need to develop new clients.  They are providing some equipment for Egypt and Turkey.  One problem is lack of materials.  They also have good hardware and software capabilities at their informatics institute, and have developed coordination with IBM, Sun, and others.  In addition, they have a large and excellent shipbuilding industry, mostly civilian (we were told the Constanta yard is booked for 2 years, and talked to a Norwegian who had just ordered two 74KT dry cargo carriers). <P>

We visited the R&D Institute, toured the "exhibition" and received a briefing on its organization.  The equipment on display, all produced in Romania, was an extensive array of tanks, trucks (all diesel propulsion; this was true also in Navy; the only gas turbines were in the 3 Soviet Tarantuls. Everything else is Romanian diesel), APVs, and weapons ranging from small arms, mortars and recoilless rifles (122mm) to 152mm artillery, plus communications and surveillance equipment (ground radars, perimeter defense systems, and a 5-station air control van to be integrated with the new Lockheed-Martin radars and their current air control systems), chemical and biological testing and decontamination trucks, and specialized equipment for mountain troops.  Our general impression is that they have an extremely extensive suite of military equipment for a small country to have to develop, maintain, and produce; it was all fairly simple and rugged, and only small portions of the inventory - e.g. the new air control system - appeared to use modern digital electronics.<P>

The MoD R&D Institute has a total staff of about 800.  Technical divisions include Weapon Systems (60 engineers; fire control, armored vehicles, weapons and ammunition), Sensor Systems and Simulation (40 engineers), C3I and Computers (80 engineers; applied software, expert systems and robotics; system architecture and basic software), and Transmission, Information Protection and Radio (60 engineers).  There are also sections for test and certification, logistics and support, patterns and prototypes, quality control, metrology, procurement and documentation, equipment and special vehicles, and administration.  The engineers in general appeared to be system and subsystem designers.  Much of the software (as at the Navy Institute) and virtually all the documentation and manuals were written in Romanian; and in general, although many of the officers under age 40 have some English, very few are fluent.  The Institute is housed in three large office buildings about 5 miles sw of Bucharest.<P>

<B>4.  Romanian Naval Science Research Center</B><BR>
Principal hosts were Capt-dr-eng Constantine Rusu, Director of Logistics, Romanian Navy Headquarters; and Capt-dr-eng Vergil Gradinaru, Commander Naval Science Research Center.<P>

After a general introduction and description of the Navy, we visited the exhibition (no further tour of the Center was offered, and when we asked we were told there was nothing but offices and desks) and then went to the Officers housing building for a briefing on shipbuilding.<P>

The Naval Research Center has a staff of about 2-300, 25% military.  Basically, the Center is responsible for conceptual design, development, and logistics (including spare parts...stressed because one of their problems is building spares for Russian equipment; and for the divers, for the COMEX equipment they purchased in the late 70s) for all naval equipment, from ships to weapons and ammunition.  The exception is diving and submarine equipment, for which there is a separate brigade and development/training organization. <P>

Like MoD, the Navys main overall priority is modernization of their last-generation Soviet equipment, combined with conversion to NATO standards.  HQ staff as well as fleet operators are all committed to NATO compatibility, and they have had many personnel exchanges and participated in several PfP exercises.  The many interactions have created an sense of anticipation of support from the US.  They are now at the point of needing detailed technical assistance, particularly US and NATO specifications and standards, since they can not afford long developments or false starts.  Because they have had to be self-reliant they have a full set of Romanian standards, and these must now all be converted.  Other problems include lack of modern digital equipment, very few computers, and no Internet connections The military is even well behind their civilian institutes and commercial yards, yet the Navy would prefer to use their own institute because of cost.<P>

The Navys exhibition room, like that of the National R&D center, displayed a full range of Romanian-made equipment. Three items were of particular interest to us:<BR>
	<DIR>A new, simple dipping sonar designed for use from small craft and helos.  Characteristics include:  15Khz, 15degree conical beam, 50 msec pulse, mechanical scan (controllable for full or sector scan), can be lowered (2m/s?) to 130m, acoustic svp connected to ray path program (algorithms unexplained, but they know to use ambient vice statistical data and indicated it included bottom conditions), 1.5kw acoustic power, claimed range tested vs their sub to 14 km.  This has been deployed on their Destroyer and the new Frigate.</DIR>
	<DIR>"Trident" minesweeping system:  three remotely controlled craft (32m, 130T ?) with magnetic and acoustic sweeping systems, deployed in advance of a parent vessel.  The modern-looking computer display shows swept path and track of the sweepers, which typically cover 100m per transit and are run in longitudinal s-tracks ahead of a parent minesweeper which carries mechanical sweep and acoustic search gear, or ahead of the vessel to be protected; they remote craft can also be controlled form a shore based van.  Apparently two of these systems have been deployed.</DIR>
	<DIR>"BRUTAR" armored (vs 14.5mm shells) river craft - multiple guns and rockets, 38.5m loa, 1.5m draft, beachable and capable of carrying a platoon.  Mean looking river boat.</DIR>

They presented separate lectures on their "Warship Design Process" and their use of standards.  Ship design at the R&D Institute is still primarily manual; they have no integrated design capability.  They stated that although they had designed and built most of their fleet, they still had a lot to learn and were interested in cooperation.  For example, there is no DC Central, and equipment is not well arranged for damage control.  They have little information on western standards and ship design processes beyond what they can glean from commercial magazines.  They strongly desire assistance and advice. <P>

They can do integrated ship design (using STEERBEAR) at Galatz, location of their naval architecture school and main ship design and test facility ICEPRONAV S.A. (although the DD and FF hulls were tested in Denmark), or in industry.  Of course they prefer to do their design, at least the initial stages, at the Institute to save money and improve control.  They used to do all execution drawings at Galatz or the Institute, but the military yard had trouble adapting their technology to the requirements.  They are trying to work with the yard to reduce this problem, but it still exists.<P>

The military shipyard in Mangalia (which reports to the Industrial Group in MoD, not to the Navy), 2400 workers, constructed the DD, Frigates, river boats and many of their auxiliaries (the DD and FF hulls were constructed in the civilian shipyard because of their size, then moved to the military yard for outfitting).  It also does their repair work, and has a 1600T floating dry dock.  The largest yard (civilian) is in Constanta.  It has built bulk carriers and tankers up to 150KT, and has 2 years of booked work, 80% for foreign customers, including China and South Africa (as noted above, when we were checking our of the hotel we met a Norwegian who had just let a contract for two, 74KT dry cargo carriers; the owner will supply engines and equipment, but uses the Romanian yards for steel, labor, and integration.  He has been dealing with them since 87 and is pleased with their products.).  <P>

Constanta is currently the fourth largest port in Europe, and is expanding to the south, to the mouth of the canal to the Danube, at which point it will be the second largest.  They count on this port and the associated duty free zone for future income. There is also a repair yard in Media, and a well equipped yard in Tulcea on the Danube, specializing in cargo vessels for the river and in fishing vessels (50KT capability).  There are four other smaller construction and repair yards along the Danube.<P>

Given the range of their equipment and the size of the task of converting standards and developing interoperability, they need to make hard choices.  When asked, they stated that their first priority was the Frigates, then the Destroyer (which was initially designed as a cruise ship and has recognized limitations). The frigates primary task is ASW, and they are developing a towed sonar for it (an adapted Russian system, depth 10-100m depending on speed, 10Khz).  Other needs include communications, fire control (now unintegrated and analog), and weapons (e.g., the only anti air armament is 30mm 6-barrel optically controlled guns).  They also several times mentioned the need to modify the DD for NATO standard unrep because of its participation in PfP exercises.  They are looking for detailed specs to minimize the time and cost of the needed conversion.  They stated that they had visited NAVSEA and been shown "the book", but were told that they could not have a copy until the MIEA was signed.  Assistance in converting to western standards is one of their top requirements, and they explicitly solicited detailed technical assistance from the US Navy.<P>

<B>5.  Romanian Navy Diving Center</B><BR>
Primary hosts in addition to Capt. Rusu were Capt. Petru Somfelean, Commander of the Center, and Cdr Paul Chiron (who speaks very good English), himself an experienced diver.<P>

The Diving and Submarine Brigade, which reports directly to Navy Staff, includes the Diving School, Hyperbaric Lab, Underwater Research Lab, Combat Divers Unit (about 60 in number, apparently with a mix of EOD and special ops training), Deep Divers Unit, and the KILO-class submarine.  There have been a number of exchange visits with US forces (the MLT should be able to provide details).  We received briefings on diver training and operations and technical developments, plus papers on submarine rescue and salvage, and toured the hyperbaric facility and the diving ship Grigore Antipa.<P>  

The Center trains all Romanian divers, both military and civilian.  There are three classes of divers (0-40m, 40-60M, >60M), with increasing levels of technical training and annual certification requirements.  In addition to military duties, the divers (and the ship) participated in construction of, and support maintenance of the eight offshore oil rigs and are responsible for their defense. Although their description of the organization was unclear, apparently a highly qualified diver would be expected to participate in a wide range of activities.  CDR Chiron, for example, was for 8 years the head of the shipboard diving unit, but also was a parachutist, pilot, and ship captain  and had specops experience in the Black Sea.<P>

The Hyperbaric lab and deep diving equipment were procured from COMEX around 1978.  The hyperbaric lab (two chambers connected to a wet pot also used for escape training) has a 500M capability; their first saturation experiment to that depth was in 1984, and they do 3-5 sat dives in it per year (training, development, and certification). They also have a number of portable chambers. There is a medical unit which conducts hyperbaric research (there is a small research chamber suitable for mice and ducks) and supports diver safety and health. The principal shipboard equipment includes a 300M capable diving bell, the SM358 (300m, 5 divers, 8 hours...) powered submersible, and two interconnected chambers below decks to service them.  Both the bell and the SM358 showed signs of extensive use, and apparently have been modified over the years to take Romanian manufactured spares and equipment.<P>

Their highest development priority is to modify either the bell or the SM358 for submarine rescue.  To do this they will need advice on Western standards and NATO interoperability requirements.  At least three additional Mil-Mil events are planned around this issue: RO-300 (Fam), a visit to San Diego in late April, and two TCTs (RO-587 and 588) not yet scheduled.  What they really need is technical assistance first to assess the condition of their equipment and practices, second to determine whether either the bell or SM358 could be modified for rescue from the KILO, and third to evaluate in more technical detail the issues of NATO compatibility.<P>

Another development priority is a closed circuit scuba for their combat divers.  They are currently using an older Russian model;  this is another case where procurement (e.g. of Draegers) is viewed as more costly than development.  They expressed further concern regarding a law now at parliament requiring research to be self-financing, and complained that the money they receive for civilian diving services (they have a national monopoly) goes to the national defense budget, not directly back to the center. Additional development projects which they mentioned but we did not see (they wanted us to focus on sub rescue) include diver communications and sonar, and underwater welding and repair technology.  <P>  

<B>6.  Romanian Navy Hydrographic Directorate</B><BR>
This Directorate is responsible for littoral and river hydrographic survey and charting (although charts are printed by MoD), navigational warnings, hydrography and meteorology, navigational buoys and lighthouses, and radio-navigational equipment.  Virtually all the electronics we saw were Soviet manufacture, vintage 60s and 70s, with Romanian modifications.  They have three survey ships and a rescue tug, a mixed civilian and military staff of 140 plus 80 conscripts.  In April and May NAVOCEANO will work with them on a cooperative hydro survey of Constanta Harbor and approaches (Paul Cooper of the NAVOCEANO Cooperative Survey European Office has details, plus more in-depth knowledge of this Directorate).<P>

Romania is a full member of the Hydrographic Commission for the Mediterranean and Black Seas, and an associate member of IHO.  They have cooperative agreements with 15 nations and mentioned good collaboration with the Turkish hydro office. <P> 

We spent some time discussing extensions of the port of Constanta and navigation on the Danube.  Constanta is now the 4th largest port in Europe, and they plan to extend it over the next 4-5 years south to the entrance to the canal to the Danube, with a major duty free zone and a barge on/off loading facility.  It will then be Europes second largest port. They envision this as a major gateway to Europe (navigable Black Sea to North Sea), and a major economic hope for the nation. There are also three navigable channels in the Delta:  The northern Kiria Branch which is Ukrainian and has 70% of the river flow, and two Romanian branches, the central Sulina which has been straightened for navigation and is continuously dredged to 7M (10% flow), and the southern St George Branch.  The delta is advancing in the area of St George, and they survey that area annually.  Since Sept 91 the Sulina branch has been partially blocked by a Ukrainian cargo vessel filled with wire which rolled over and sank broadside to the channel; they completed partial clearing last year (they noted that the Ukrainians started dredging the Kiria branch about the same time their vessel blocked the Sulina).  <P>

We next paid a courtesy call on Eng.-RADM Beches, Deputy Chief of Staff and head of Procurement and Logistics for the Romanian Navy.  The Admiral reiterated their official commitment to western standards and NATO interoperability, and the associated need for technical advice.<P>

<B>7.  Romanian Naval Repair Base</B><BR>
The Repair Base is responsible for intermediate and depot level maintenance and repair.  It reports directly to RADM Beces.  Established in 1982, it moved into new facilities adjacent to the Naval Science Research Center (which provides technical support) in 1993. Total staff is about 350, in 5 Departments: Radiolocation (navigation, sonar, fire control), Radio, Artillery, Engine, and Mechanical.  Each is headed by a senior, experienced Captain, and they claimed that the personnel were all highly skilled and carefully selected.  We saw a mix of military and civilian.  <P>

Most of the repair work is performed directly on board ship.  In addition, they have ship-sets of most significant electronics at the repair center for trouble shooting and repair of subsystems.  The center was busy when we visited, but we were told that many of the workers had come just to see the American visitors.  They were obviously delighted with our presence; although there has been significant contact elsewhere we were the first visitors to the Repair  Department.  One of their principal problems is adapting Romanian products as spares for their largely Soviet electronics.  Prints and manuals were all in Romanian, although most of the analog electronic equipment had its original Russian nameplates. <P>

The Repair Department traditionally was directly funded by headquarters; they are starting to allocate repair funds to individual ships, but stated that this was hard to implement.  Each ship does its own operational level maintenance in accordance with Romanian schedules. The Chief Engineer is responsible for spares and repairs.  Requests go through the Squadron and Brigade to Naval Hq, then to the Repair Department, which can obtain materiel and parts either from depots or industry.  To save money, however, they prefer to design and develop their own parts in the Department.<P>

The Repair Department appeared well organized and tightly managed.  Given the age and condition of their ships they must certainly have their hands full.  The new facilities, while rudimentary, are adequate for their needs and could accommodate more modern repair equipment (we saw lots of multimeters, few oscilloscopes, no computers). We believe the senior members of the Repair Base Staff (Commander and the 5 Department Heads) would benefit from a familiarization tour to a US Naval Ship Repair Facility.<P>

<B>8.  Ship Visits: DD111, "Marasesti" and FF264</B><BR>
Construction of the Destroyer started in 1976; it was initially completed in 1985 (the long delay due to funds and the "internal situation"; as noted above, it apparently started as a cruise ship). The hull was constructed by the civilian yard in Mangalia, and it was then moved to their military yard for outfitting.  After initial testing and training from 85-88 they modernized the armament, adding SS-20 missiles and a 30MM/6 barrel air defense system, and increasing the depth charge range from 2.5 to 6km.  The ship was finished in 1992, commissioned in 93, and participated in exercises in the Med in 94-95.  It is 5500T, has four main 8800HP Romanian diesels and four screws (Dutch variable pitch outboard), and a range of 4000km. Electronics is almost all Soviet, though with numerous Romanian modifications (in some cases required just to make it work). Their major technical concern is modifying it for NATO at-sea refueling; they showed us their preliminary designs for topside equipment and piping/valve changes which were based on their experience and initial discussions with NAVSEA, and requested a technical review and copies of applicable specs and standards. They want to make sure that their design is adequate before they cut metal, since they can not afford false starts.<P>

Like the DD, the Frigate - though their new class and upgraded - is outfitted with very basic, unintegrated armament and older Soviet electronics.  The ship is 1500T displacement, maximum speed 23 knots (18 kts cruise), 3000 km range, crew of 90 (7 officers, 28 warrants or chiefs) and designed only for local operations (poor habitability, no distillation or unrep capability, hard-mounted machinery). CIC was essentially an empty room with a Plexiglas sketch of the Black Sea. Also like the destroyer, with the exception of conscripts the crew doesnt rotate.  <P>

Following the ship visits they summarized for us their priorities for modernization and American assistance.  They are well aware of the limitations of their ships, and of the degree of change necessary to  reach western standards.  They view the Frigates as the core of their Navy, and want to design a new "standard frigate" that would be NATO compatible.  This is their highest modernization/NATO compatibility priority.  They showed us a preliminary concept drawing, and stated that they would send copies of what they had developed. They envision an integrated diesel (Romanian)/gas turbine (imported) propulsion system (CODOG), twin screw, maximum speed 30-32 knots, with active roll stabilization. They need a completely new integrated C3I and fire control system, integrated damage control sensors, bio-chemical protective system, and habitability/crew accommodations for extended voyages. Envisioned armament includes Harpoon and the AK-176 76mm gun for surface-to-surface, Barak and two 30mm AK630M guns for air defense, 6km range depth charges and 53 cm torpedo launchers. ASW would rely on helos for long range detection, towed sonar for mid-range, and the hull mounted sonar for short range attack.<P>

They fully recognize that this would be a stretch for them and stated that they would need US collaboration for definition and design; first to help select weapon systems that they could be assured would be available (including provisions for spares and repair - they were bit bad by the Russians here), and then to understand western and NATO standards.  Their need for help starts with items as simple as no-skid deck paint, and extends through the entire design and integration process.  They now have no integrated or computer-based deign capability in the military (although as noted above they use FORAN and STEERBEAR at ICEPRONAV, the Shipbuilding Research and Design Institute in Galatz). <P>

<B>1. Summary</B><BR>
ECMWF is a world leader in its field.  US meteorologists
and climatologists know its programs well, and make extensive
use of its analyses and forecasts.  Of recent interest, after
relying on Cray computers almost since its inception, ECMWF competitively
selected a Fujitsu VPP700 for its next upgrade.  The initial components
of the new machine are on site; by 1998, it will provide about
25x the performance of the current Cray Y-MP C90/16.  ECMWF is
pushing to complete its 1979-1993 (and possibly 1994) reanalysis
before the June switch-over.  In addition, ECMWF received permission
from its Council for a 3-year research program (starting Jan 95)
in seasonal forecasts, with four additional consultancy positions.
<P>

<B>2. General Information</B><BR>
The European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts
(ECMWF) is located outside Reading, England.  Its excellent World
Wide Web homepage, <A HREF="http://www.ecmwf.int">http://www.ecmwf.int</A>, describes its organization and products. The following is a brief introduction,
and the author's impressions from his visit on 26 March.<P>

Discussions about the need for a European meteorological
Center began under COST (European Co-operation in Science and
Technology) in 1967, at about the same time that NCAR was established
in the US.  After considerable discussion, the European nations
decided to focus on operational aspects - medium range forecasts
for distribution to the met services of the 18 member states (ECMWF
also has cooperative agreements with WMO, EUMETSAT, Iceland, Hungary,
and Croatia) - and the associated research and development of
numerical methods.  The stimuli for operational collaboration
were the computational intensity and associated costs of mid-range
(out to 10 day) forecasts, the benefits of pooling the best talent
and then rotating them back to home offices, and analysis that
projected about a 20:1 benefit-cost ratio if the then-quality
of 2 day forecasts could be achieved at 6 days (this level of
improvement in forecastsing has effectively been achieved; cost-benefit
studies have been discussed, but except for a study of the economic
benefit to the UK of hosting ECMWF, are still in the too-hard
box).<P>

The establishing Convention was signed in 1973, and
the first forecasts provided in 79.  ECMWF's ruling Council has
two representatives per member; usually one from the nation's
met office, and one from the responsible ministry (one exception
is the UK; the British Meteorological Office comes under MoD,
and both Council members have been from BMO).  Contributions to
the annual budget (&#163;19M in 95) are determined by GNP (updated
every three years by OECD).  Thus the UK, France, Italy and Germany
are the big members, followed by Spain; Germany's share will increase
considerably when the calculations switch to post-unification
GNP.  The Council normally works well by consensus; but votes
when needed are based on the double-2/3 rule (2/3 of the funding,
plus 2/3 of the members).  The budget provides for the facilities,
computers, a dedicated telecommunications net (64Kbps rates to
each member as part of the basic subscription; wider bandwidth
- used by UK and France - is paid for by the user nation), and
142 staff positions plus a number of consultancies.  ECMWF can
also accept external research contracts (e.g. NSF, JMA and the
EC are contributing to the cost of the reanalysis). <P>

All positions are filled by the member nations, but
visiting scientists from other nations are accepted (e.g., Ron
Gelaro from NRL Monterey spent a TDY period there and Jim Doyle,
also from Monterey, will arrive this summer for 9 months to work
on a coupled wind-wave model).  The organization is simple - the
Research Department (38 staff) under Dr Tony Hollingsworth (Ireland)
with Model and Data Divisions; an Operations Department (76 slots)
under Dr Massimo Capaldo (Italy) with Computer and Meteorological
Divisions; and an Administration Department.  The three Departments
report to the Director, Dr Dave Burridge (UK).  This has basically
been the organization from the start.  ECMWF is small enough that
management is quite informal and the staff all know one another;
thus there is no need to change style to resolve bureaucratic
issues.<P>

We chatted at lunch about the stability and success
of the structure; my host Dr Austin Woods cited &quot;Grooming,
Gossip and the Evolution of Language&quot; by Prof Robert Dunbar
of Liverpool University (to be published Faber on 1 April) which
contends, based on correlation of brain size and group size in
primates, that 150 is about the natural size for a human group.
 At any rate this has worked exceedingly well for ECMWF for some
20 years, and they want not to grow.  At issue of course is tapping
into the best European talent; their ability to draw from the
18 member states is envied in many circles in the US.  And from
my brief exposure, although they described national differences,
the quality and diversity of the staff as well as the rotation
process are rightfully envied.  The multi-national structure combined
with the links to the European Met offices provides them a distinct
competitive advantage.  The US has not as effectively rationalized
its efforts in mid-range (or seasonal) forecasting.  We still
have enough money that we haven't yet been forced to join forces
across organizational boundaries (e.g., NOAA, Navy, NASA), to
the detriment of our national skill.<P>

One concern, although it hasn't impacted yet, is
the potential impact of changing policies on data rights.  Satellite,
radiosonde, etc. data is the lifeblood of any forecasting group,
and restrictions or excessive subscription costs could severely
impact the product.  As indicators of change my hosts cited ECOMET,
an &quot;Economic Interest Grouping&quot; (private) established
to commercialize the products of the European weather services,
and EUMETNET - an umbrella organization of weather services to
foster collaborative projects (and potentially the embryo of a
European Meteorological Organization - there are 25K meteorologists
in Europe service the 400M population compared to some 5-10 K
in the US for its 280M population; some degree of rationalization
and job sharing will eventually occur).  I have heard similar
concerns re data management at NESDIS and Navy in the US; and
the US policy (free access to government data) is certainly at
odds with the trends in the rest of the world.<P>

ECMWF's main product is its daily medium range (10
day) forecast, distributed to the Member State met services. 
They also produce lower-resolution ensemble predictions (currently
33 integrations of the prediction model, going to 50 with the
Fujitsu) that are starting  to be used in innovative ways by some
of the larger met services.  Research associated with these efforts
focuses on exploitation of satellite data for initial conditions,
data assimilation techniques, physics, and numerical methods to
enhance speed, resolution and accuracy.  One initially unappreciated
fallout of the accuracy of ECMWF analyses and predictions is their
ability to precisely and rapidly spot anomalies in data.  This
information is routinely fed back to the collectors, and had resulted
in significantly improved quality, and recalibration of some of
the space based sensors on ERS-1 and 2.<P>

Another extremely valuable product are ECMWF's archive
of data and forecasts.  This archive is widely used throughout
the world, and collaboration with the user meteorologists and
climatologists of course has beneficial feedback to ECMWF's research.
 The 15 year reanalysis (79-93 or 94) using the baseline 1995
operational system (2.5&#176;, T106L31) will be of tremendous
value, and already is being exploited in ECMWF's own seasonal
prediction work.<P>

Of particular interest to Navy is ECMWF's wave predictions,
using the WAM model.  Operational forecasts out to 10 days started
in 1992; resolution is now 1.5&#176;.  They assimilate ERS-1 SAR
data and verify against ERS-2 and buoys.  WAM 1<SUP>st</SUP> guess
(before assimilation) standard deviation vs ERS-1 wave heights
is now about 40cm, compared to a meter or more in the days of
SEASAT.  Although Navy also uses WAM, ECMWF's forecasts are more
accurate across a wider range of sea states, perhaps because ECMWF
uses the wind field for forcing, while Navy uses calculated stresses.
 This is in consonance with the overall ECMWF philosophy of predicting
and assimilating directly observed data rather than values calculated
from the data. <P>

The 'dream' for wave forecasters is a fully coupled
wind-wave model, supported by assimilated SAR, scatterometer,
and buoy data.  Jim Dolye from Monterey arrives shortly after
Easter to work with the ECMWF wave group on its development. 
In addition, ECAWOM and other research projects are expected to
continue to enhance the physics of WAM.<P>

<B>3. ECMWF Computer Configuration</B><BR>
One of the US community's concerns before I left
the States at the end of 95 was NEC's and Fujitsu's bid for the
next ECMWF computer - followed in short order by an expected run
on the European met services (Germany's tender is out, UK is down
to a short list, France will tender soon; NCAR also is will soon
select a new machine) - and the potential impact on Cray, which
has been the traditional main line supercomputer supplier.  Fujitsu
of course won the ECMWF competition; a VPP300 (4 PE Vector Parallel
Processor) is in place for code conversion and experimentation/research,
and the 46 PE VPP700 arrives this summer.  By fall the operational
system will have 5x the performance of the current Cray C90/16,
with further upgrades planned through 1998.  ECMWF has traditionally
leased its main machine, and will continue this practice with
Fujitsu. <P>

Another recent changes in the configuration is a
new IBM RS6000 data handling system for the archives, to supplement
and presumably ultimately replace the IBM ES/9000-720.  Most work
stations are now Silicon Graphics' Indys.  The conventional 64Kbps
dedicated telecommunications links (to most nations - UK and France
pay for extra bandwidth) will likely remain standard for the next
several years.  25% of the computer resources are dedicated to
use by the Member States; most jobs are batch, and only a very
few selected investigators have on-line access. <P>

<B>4.  Other Recent Initiatives</B><BR>
Four staff members are dedicated to the 1979-1993
(hopefully 1994) reanalysis using the 1995 operational system.
 This must of course be completed prior to the switchout of the
Cray, so it has a rather tight time line.  This is an internationally
funded effort, and the resultant consistent data set, generated
with a stable modern assimilation system should be of tremendous
value to researchers worldwide.<P>

There are two aspects to the new Seasonal Forecasting
Project.  The first is to assess atmospheric predictability on
seasonal time scales, given sea surface temperature and soil moisture.
 ENSO impact is now widely appreciated; at issue are the nature
and location of other drivers, and predictability in areas such
as Europe that are less immediately impacted by ENSO.  9-member
ensemble forecasts over 120 day intervals will be made using the
15+ years of information from the reanalysis project.  Initial
results (from the first year of the three year program) do indicate
predictability, at least in cases of strong inter-annual changes
and large SST anomalies.  Other Met offices will conduct similar
studies with the same boundary conditions to test the influence
of different models.
<P>

The second part of this project is the development
and operation of a coupled ocean-atmosphere model.  The German
HOPE is the basis for the ocean model, and French OASIS is used
as the coupling interface.  Most ocean data for assimilation and
spin-up will come from NODC.  Again,.the 79-94 atmospheric reanalysis
will play a major role.  <P>

<B>5. Comments</B><BR>
Like most workers in environmental fields I have
heard about ECMWF and taken advantage of its available products
for many years.  This was my first opportunity to visit, and the
reality more than lived up to my expectations.  Perhaps more impressive
to me even than the well known excellence of the product and the
research, is the stability and quality of the management.  Most
research institutions either have gone through, or shortly will,
major perturbations because of changes in national research policies
and reductions in funding.  While ECMWF has not been immune to
such influences, its international structure and the commitment
of its leadership to spurn growth and stick to producing top quality
research plus a product that is most highly valued by its members,
have minimized disruptions.  ECMWF was well designed at the start,
is well situated in an environment conducive to top quality research,
has been and remains well managed and staffed, and knows where
it's headed.  I can't say that about many institutions I've visited
over the last several years.
<P>

ECMWF's selection of the Fujitsu VPP represents a
significant change for those who care about supercomputers.  ECMWF
was an obvious key target for the Japanese because it is a highly
respected and multinational world leader.  Others will watch its
performance closely and be tempted to follow its lead if successful.
 It will be interesting, to say the least, to watch the outcomes
of tenders at NCAR and the European met services over the coming
months.<P>

ECMWF research promises consistent and continued
progress in medium range forecasting.  Consistent accuracy at
&gt;80% levels at 5 days is in itself astounding at least to me,
and the combination of new machines, new data, new algorithms,
new assimilation techniques and ensemble forecasts should press
the limits of predictability.  After over 20 years, this field
retains every element of its excitement and promise.  If, as I'd
guess likely, the fully coupled wind-wave model becomes available
in a year or so, wave forecasts should be vastly improved and
soon see much wider application, with commensurate feedback into
the research.<P>

ECMWF's new venture into seasonal forecasts is likewise
exciting.  While the initial justification for the seasonal research
was improvements in the medium range forecasting capability (and
vice versa), the potential for effective operational seasonal
forecasts in Europe and Africa has immense ramifications for economics
and quality of life.  ECMWF is obviously in the best position
to exploit its own reanalyses, which will become the world standard.
 Others' use of the reanalyses will only enhance and improve their
own research, at negligible cost.  And ECMWFs entry on the scene
of coupled ocean-atmosphere models promises tough competition
for US researchers.  Their move into this work at the time of
the reanalysis and the acquisition of a significant increase in
computing power was prescient.  It's a safe bet that the &quot;3-year
experiment&quot; is just a warm up.<P>

<B>1.  Summary</B><BR>
	One of ONR Europe's objectives is to enhance transatlantic S&T collaboration in support of mutual security interests.  Effective collaboration is based on common technical interests and perceived equality of benefit to participants.  Science policies and practices influence the willingness of sponsors, institutions, and individuals to collaborate.  This paper discusses some initial hypotheses about S&T in western Europe, the similarities and differences with the US, and implications for transatlantic cooperation.  In general, the trends favor pan-European coalescence to the detriment of traditional linkages to the US S&T community.  The US needs to take an active role in fostering collaboration if it wishes to maintain or enhance transatlantic security-related S&T cooperation.<P>

<B>2.  Introduction</B><BR>
	Usually we at Edison House report on new S&T ideas in our area of responsibility.  When we sit around and talk, however, the conversation often dwells as much on the practices and problems of research at the institutes we visit as the work itself.  Many of us are struck by the significant differences between how "things work" over here, and how we managed our programs or labs or institutes or individual research projects in the States.  We think the differences are significant, and that we have a lot to gain from learning and talking about them.<BR>
	Thus we have decided to start occasionally writing papers on the Science System in Europe, and the differences between European and US practices.  As time goes on, we hope to extend this discussion to Eastern Europe and other parts of our area; and as we develop S&T cooperative strategies and country plans, we'll try to be more specific and to substantiate the admittedly loose arguments of this paper.  We invite criticisms and thoughts from both sides of the Atlantic - especially if you'll let us promulgate them on our web page.  <P>

<B>3. S&T Policies</B><BR>
	Let's start with S&T policies.  The main difference between European nations and the US is they've got 'em, and we don't.  The Europeans have made hard choices, largely linking S&T tightly to quality of life and economic growth (the UK refers to "wealth generation"), and concentrating on regional and local strengths.  Scientists "know" why they are doing what they're doing and how their work relates to national and international priorities, and describe the utility of their work in their proposals, or they simply don't get funded.  <BR>
Not so, of course, in the US.  Lacking a nationally accepted rationale for S&T, the US community gets buffeted by pragmatic adjustments and an inability to justify projects in terms of why the public should support them (other than "good science" which at the bottom line is a cop out).  We Americans in Europe have great difficulty in explaining this national malaise, and thus in effectively convincing our European colleagues that they should want to deal with us.  Try explaining the current straits of NSF and DDR&E and ONR etc., and our about-faces on industrial support via NIST and ARPA, and our redundant, competitive and wasteful approaches to Federal labs, and our dismal record of "partnership", to a skeptical European Commissioner or to any European national S&T sponsor (like MoD or any of the Research Councils here in the UK).  We're not dealing from a position of strength, and our hard choices - many of which they have made - are still ahead.<BR>
I find a curious inverse between S&T and industry.  There's great concern in Europe about the rationalization of US defense industry and resulting competitiveness.  They're worried here about becoming only subcontractors to the Lockheed-Martin etc behemoths that have slimmed down to competitive supremacy (at least for now...Europe's working on this though with difficulty).  However in S&T and tech transfer, the Europeans are the ones who have rationalized and reengineered, while we have fought change and failed to develop national consensus.<P>

<B>4.  EC Impact</B><BR>
	There are really two closely intertwined levels of European S&T policy, national and international, both through the European Union (whether a nation is in or out, the Union is a powerful influence) and through many other bi- and multi-lateral relationships.  We in the US often tend to underestimate the EU's impact on how science is done.  The newspapers highlight political disagreements, the European Commission's propaganda machine (it's even more prolific than NASA's) accentuates the 'Programmes', and the mechanisms and successes of European cooperation.  The EC is a large, complex, and powerful bureaucracy with a heavy overhead burden. We often tend to confuse the bureaucracy with the reality.  What really has happened in R&D however, is first that the competitive/cooperative dynamic at the European level has inevitably shaped national as well as international S&T policies.  The funding comes from the nations, and they each must figure out how to get back at least their fair share in the areas they care most about, as well as foster European programs that advance their individual interests.  Second, the bureaucratic requirements for transnational collaboration have caused the bench scientists to really come face to face and learn about what each other are doing, and to decide - however reluctantly at the start - that there's a lot to be said for collaboration.<BR>
	I listened the other day to a European scientist griping (somewhat proudly perhaps) that in spite of all the fuss and bother and the low probability of success, the EC programs do really make you fly over and get face-to-face with the folks you signed up to work with and write reports with them; and you really do learn something from the interaction as well as find that working together is fun.  Through such processes the Europeans in many fields have discovered sufficient breadth and depth of interests and capabilities among their continental colleagues that they have little need any longer to seek US training or collaboration.<BR>
	Point?  We shouldn't underestimate the degree to which "Europe" is becoming much more cohesive in S&T via the EC programs and other pan-European pressures.  When its real in the working labs, irrespective of the politics and bureaucracy and what's in the papers, its real.  And oh yes, it sure doesn't include us (US).  Deliberately, and with cause.  And since European S&T is tightly coupled to economic growth, it will contribute directly to competitive dynamics in the marketplace.<P>

<B>5.  Scientific and Public Attention to S&T</B><BR>
	Not only do Europeans take their policies and interactions seriously, they study them and their impact seriously.  Not just by commissions and in ministerial white/green/etc papers, but by graduate students and professors studying how the system works and inquiring in quite ingenious ways about how to make it work better.  In the intellectual analysis of the processes of S&T, and in fields such as IPR, they're doing world class research.  The EC even has an entire Joint Research Center, the Institute for Prospective Technological Studies in Seville, dedicated to "the observation and follow up of technological change, in the broad sense in order to get a better understanding of its links with economy and society."  By comparison, the US hardly considers these legitimate research topics; the demise of OTA is a case in point.<BR>
In a similar sense, there is active public debate in Europe about R&D policies, funding, and priorities.  Research and its impact, national and EC allocations, comparisons of investments and economic growth, and criticism of ministerial decisions are frequent topics in the popular media.  In the US, such discussions are pretty well restricted to journals read only by the affected community, and R&D is a "left-over" in the budget debates.  S&T funding is in difficulty on both sides of the Atlantic; it's the nature and level of concern and discussion that seem to be different. 
The Europe-Europe relationships are closing in with us out not just by political volition, but even more by simple recognition of common interests, strengths, capabilities, and practices, and by intellectual curiosity about the process and the products of S&T.  Europeans want to match long term strength to strength, stability to stability, concern to concern, curiosity to curiosity.  To an increasing degree in some very important areas, that doesn't include us.<P>

<B>6.  Practice of S&T</B><BR>
	Being in London, it would be hard not to comment on "Tea".  I've noticed that many of my European colleagues get together for tea of coffee at their Institutes or universities once or twice a day, and also frequently lunch together.  Departments, divisions, groups or whatever congregate very informally in some common space to have their refreshment and chat.  The work pace includes rubbing time, the work space includes rubbing space.  We in the US occasionally do this, but not as a practice and within a much more proscribed "interaction radius" (and in the government such practice is anathema).  I'd guess our mingle radius is maybe 50 feet, time maybe 1-2 minutes, group size 2-3; theirs is more like 150 meters, 15-30 minutes, 10-30 people.  Quite a different approach, with quite a different scientific society as a result.<BR>
	Formally as well as informally, Europeans seem to put more emphasis on "groups" than we do.  Science-funding agencies interact with Universities differently than we, with regard to what they fund and why.  We still focus on the individual investigator, the PI.  The stress here is on interaction and group participation - among teams, among countries, among industry labs and universities and government labs, between researchers and industrialists or policy makers, etc.  This happens at many levels, but the bottom line -- as revealed by some interesting recent bibliographic studies (Katz and Hicks, University of Suffolk) -- is that (at least in the UK) comparing early 80s to early 90s, a lot more of the peer-reviewed literature has been coming from industry and similar non-traditional sites, a much smaller share is single or double-authored (with a big growth of >4 authors), and there is a striking growth in networking and interdisciplinary work.  The nature of how science is practiced has changed, presumably partly because of the internal dynamics of increased complexity (more of the really interesting questions require a multi-disciplinary, multiple-team campaign) and improved tools for collaboration, and partly because of policy shifts to take advantage of these trends and to foster European and regional strength.  I'm not aware of similar patterns in the states.<P>

<B>7. Comments</B><BR>
My summary so far: Natural proclivities and funding patterns re rationale for, and collaboration and interaction in S&T, are quite different between the US and Europe.  Maintaining traditional levels of transatlantic cooperation will require changes of attitude and approach on the part of the US.  These issues are important for the national security community because they influence our ability to achieve successful defense cooperation in an era of coalition security.  Over the coming months we will test these hypotheses in discussions with European R&D sponsors, and try to provide more specific assessments of policies and trends in individual fields and nations.<P>

<B>1.  Summary</B><BR>
	The crime rate has risen dramatically in the last half century and violence is an urgent issue for society, though study of its causes is in its infancy.  This ASI brought together over 60 international researchers and students from the biological and psychosocial sciences to contribute their findings in an effort to develop a model of the factors and processes that lead to violence.  Criminal violent behavior is much more prevalent among males than females, and peaks sharply at around age 17.  Thus many of the studies presented at the ASI focused on early biological and social factors.  Correlations with violent aggression were shown with risk factors such as arousal, brain damage, seratonin, parental care and socioeconomic status; in some studies biological factors were more strongly implicated in favored than in deprived environments.  There appear to be at least two classes of offenders, "adolescence limited" and "life-course persistent".  At this point however the field lacks an overall conceptual model; there are few commonly accepted definitions, techniques, and typologies, and virtually no testable theories about cause and effect.  The interactive model proposed at the ASI will further increase the complexity of empirical research in this area.<P>

<B>2.  Description of the ASI</B><BR>
	The NATO Advanced Study Institute (ASI) on Biosocial Bases of Violence was organized by researchers at the University of Southern California and Cambridge University, and directed by Dr. Adrian Raine, Department of Psychology, USC.  The ASI took place in Rhodes, Greece, from 12-20 May 1996.  The format was two morning and one afternoon session per day; each session comprised one major or three shorter papers, plus a discussant and (lively) general discussion.  Per NATO ASI rules, attendance at all sessions was compulsory.  Although the ASI was attended by representatives from many NATO and Partnership for Peace nations, most of the papers were from researchers from the US and the UK.  The ASI did have a good mix of new and experienced scientists.  The papers will be published in book form.<BR>
	The study of violence is inherently multi-disciplinary.  Papers at the ASI came from criminologists, psychologists, psychiatrists, sociologists, cognitive scientists, biochemists and physiologists.  However there was a emphasis on developmental psychology, and on the correlation of various social and biological factors with male anti-social behavior during childhood, adolescence, and early maturity.  There was criticism from both the biological and social sides about gaps in the factors that were considered (e.g., neglect of extrafamilial social factors like peer pressure; no molecular biology; minimal cognitive science).  In addition many of the participants were not familiar with the work or the approaches of others; the field seems to be characterized by many small individualistic groups, with little agreement on models, methods or metrics and even less attempt to integrate process with descriptive studies.  Nonetheless, or perhaps because of these characteristics, the ASI was a significant opportunity for participants with common general concerns to learn and interact, and such of course is the intent of an ASI.  At issue is the ability of the organizers to incorporate the diverse contributions into recommendations for a coherent research agenda which can then be debated within the community as a basis for advancement of the field.<P>

<B>3.  Approaches and Findings</B><BR>
<I>a.  Violence as a Dependent Variable</I><BR>
	There is no generally accepted definition of violence.  The ASI was actually interested in (and papers covered different aspects of) the full continuum of antisocial behavior (ASB), ranging from disruptive actions of children at home and school, to extreme criminal violence such as rape and murder.  It was generally agreed that there are useful ways to broadly subcategorize ASB, e.g. by whether it is directed toward property or people, whether or not the targets are related or otherwise close to the perpetrator, and whether the behavior is impulsive or instrumental.  The relative contribution of genetic and environmental factors varies with the type of ASB.  Many of the papers made such distinctions, one of the more consistent being the degree of impulsiveness and its relationship to various aspects of temperament.<BR>
There also is an emerging and widely accepted hypothesis, credited to Dr. T. Moffitt of the University of Wisconsin, that there is a clear distinction between "adolescence limited" and "life course persistent" offenders.  The general pattern of violent activity by males is a rapid rise during the early teen years, peaking at about age 17 and then decreasing.  Adolescence limited offenders enter into ASB relatively late and desist soon; life-course persistent offenders start displaying ASB very early, and persist.  Such frequent, chronic offenders account for a significant percentage of convictions (and other measures of violence).<BR>
	One consistent difficulty for studies of ASB is the generally poor, often misleading quality of data on violent acts.  Youthful ASB is reported by parents and teachers; because the contexts of home, school and other social circumstances differ, so do these reports.  The alternatives for data on older offenders are self-reports (which no one trusts), and (for criminal violence) court records.  In many countries court records significantly distort reality.  Minors frequently have a dozen or more court appearances (and of course an undetermined number of uncaught offenses) before punishment is imposed (this has a conditioning or learning effect on the perpetrator); plea bargains and legal procedures very often result in convictions for crimes significantly different from the actual violent act (manslaughter or assault for murder, etc); criminal justice practices change over time; courts in many countries do not share records across jurisdictions, etc.  Some of the better data are from Scandinavian countries because of the quality of their records, and thus there are more studies of violence (though not necessarily more violence) in Sweden, Denmark, etc than say in Russia or Italy.<BR>
	Data on ASB can also be influenced by changes across cultures.  For example, similar behavior may or may not be classified as criminal depending on socioeconomic status and profession (generals and politicians were mentioned).  The vast majority of the data at the ASI related to modern western nations (one exception is the Mauritius longitudinal study); though there do not appear to be any major differences across the cultures reported.  While genetic factors are accepted as reasonably universal, the environmental conditions in nations which might be considered of concern to NATO were not discussed.  Perception of the issue, not to mention social factors predisposing to ASB as defined in a culture, may well be significantly different in e.g. Asian or African areas, let alone in societies and groups which promote and extol violence, such as Hammas and the IRA.  <BR>
	Historical trends can also influence findings, particularly if not accounted for in comparative assessments or in lengthy longitudinal studies.  Dr. M. Rutter (Institute of Psychiatry, London)  described the factor of 6 increase in crime rate in the UK between 1950 and 1994 (similar in the US; but in the US the homicide rate is much higher than in almost all other nations, attributed to US gun laws), paralleled by increased conduct problems in more youthful cohorts and a change in the sex ratio from 10 male to 1 female crime, to 5:1.  He also noted that its easier to rule out than to determine reasons for the change, though opportunities and stressors have risen demonstrably and there have been major changes in rearing conditions, living arrangements, and life course [e.g., prolonged transition to adulthood] which are particularly relevant to late adolescence when violence peaks.<P>

<I>b.  General biosocial Models</I><BR>
	Two basic types of models were considered at the ASI.  The first is process models which depict the interaction of different risk and protective factors (independent variables) leading to expression of the dependent variable, violence.  At the start of the ASI, the organizers proposed a model in which biological (genetically determined) and social (environmental) risk factors interact with each other and with biological and social protective factors to influence an individual's propensity for and participation in violence (with feedback); but with the added element of a distinct interactive "biosocial" pathway.  ASI participants were encouraged to debate not just the model but the very existence and nature of "biosocial" factors; and indeed there was a wide range of opinions and lively discussion throughout the workshop.  However at the level of precision with which independent variables were defined and used at the ASI, it was frequently impossible to distinguish clearly which was which (e.g. resting heart rate, which is widely used as a significant indicator of arousal but is influenced both by genetics and by conditioning).<BR>
	In his summary overview at the end of the ASI, David Farrington of Cambridge University, one of the organizers, summarized this type model as follows; even in this simplistic form, much additional debate and analysis will be required before this community has a generally accepted approach within which hypotheses can be evaluated.<P>
<IMG SRC="cd-diag.gif"><P>






 

	The second type model considered at the ASI classifies individuals in terms of personality or temperament.  The objective of such models is to depict a set of factors or traits, which in combination are predictive of propensity toward various behavior patterns.  Inventories or tests are used in classification.  There are many such models, with a similarly large range of factors.  The two models presented at the ASI were the classic 3-factor model of Dr. H. Eysenck (Institute of Psychiatry, London), and a more recent variant developed by Dr. R. Cloninger (Washington University Medical Center, St. Louis, MO).<BR>
	Eysenck's factors are termed psychoticism, extroversion (cortical arousal), and neuroticism (emotional arousal).  The three scales measure individuals' base level of arousal of different types (e.g. extroverts need and seek more stimulation to achieve cortical arousal), their degree of impulsivity, and their response to conditioning of different types.  In general higher scores in the three factors (denoting aggressiveness, insensitivity and impulsive behavior) correlate with a higher probability of ASB, with both general and specific differences with age (e.g., all three peak at ages 16-20, as does criminality; extroversion is more highly correlated with ASB in children, neuroticism in adults).  Generally speaking, traits in Eysenck's personality model relate to propensity as used in Farrington's process model.  <BR>
	Cloninger starts with and extends Eysenck's constructs.  His first set of factors relate to what he terms "temperament".  Temperament stabilizes by about the age of six.  Three of Cloninger's temperament factors are based on the type of stimulus response or conditioning involved (from animal studies).  They are Novelty Seeking (NS; behavioral activation), Harm Avoidance (HA; behavioral inhibition); and Reward Dependence (RD; behavioral maintenance).  These factors are essentially independent phenotypically and genetically, and are substantially (40-60%) heritable.  Measures of these three factors can be plotted, the resultant cube displaying temperament characteristics which then can be correlated to propensity for types of behavior (e.g. high NS and low HA characterizes anti-social adventurousness and is predictive for criminality, alcohol and drug abuse, etc.).  There is also a fourth factor, persistence.<BR>
	Cloninger then notes that the 4 "habit systems" of temperament are based on unconscious response to emotional stimuli; even in extremes, these are moderated in humans by conceptual or symbolic learning.  He thus also measures three factors of "character", which involve the sense of self and propositional learning.  As distinguished from temperament, character changes with age, and it is very strongly influenced by family and other aspects of the social environment.  The three measures are self directedness (relationship to and perception of self), cooperativeness (relationship to society), and self-transcendence (relationship to the world).  Like temperament, measures of character can be plotted on a cube, and they are predictive of maturation, learning, and performance as well as ASB.  Cloninger notes that there are many nonlinear interactions among the 7 dimensions, and the corners of the cubes tend to serve as "attractors". <BR>
	Cloninger's model was (surprisingly) not familiar to the majority of participants in the ASI.  However this report has described it at slightly greater length than other papers both because Cloninger is employing it and the associated tests in work for the USAF (and it would appear to have additional utility in military training), and because it would appear to be a good base for relating and understanding other work in the field, and for starting to formulate and test hypotheses on causative processes underlying many of the otherwise unrelated findings that were presented.<BR>
	First, most case and longitudinal studies (discussed briefly below) use personality factors as a basis for describing or relating the variables of interest.  From discussions with Cloninger, it would appear that the investigators who have employed his model have found it to be consistently useful (and predictive) across a wide range of cultures and behavioral studies (and even the one paper on violent behavior in criminal psychopaths used measures that resembled Cloninger's).  Consistent use of a model such as Cloninger's at least would allow researchers to compare results.  Second, in his talk Cloninger mentioned hormonal correlations with his temperament factors (e.g. dopamine-NS; seratonin-HA and nonepinpherine-RD).  Such hypotheses, if substantiated, may have explanatory value as well as provide guidance for the use of biological assays.  His model combines both genetic and environmental factors in such a way as could be further elucidated and perhaps modeled and studied mathematically in terms of independence and interrelationships (it would appear suitable as the basis for some powerful numerical modeling and advanced statistical analyses, perhaps incorporating chaos theory as Cloninger implied).  Finally it incorporates at least two distinctly different processes of learning (conditioning and symbolic), and thus could incorporate cognitive and information processing theory and associated studies of brain function in a consistently useful way for behavioral studies.  As an observer with minimum experience in the fields employed at the ASI, I may have misinterpreted or been inappropriately impressed, but in my opinion Cloninger's approach could serve as an excellent starting point for the discussions and debates this field will need to engage in if it is to develop a more coherent approach to the problem it has identified.  And if not Cloninger's, then some such internally consistent model will be required for the field to advance.<P>

<I>c.  Laboratory Studies</I><BR>
	These are experimentally oriented studies that focus on groups with common characteristics.  The subjects are usually captive populations which can be induced to participate in lab interventions (e.g. students, prisoners) or groups experiencing similar biological events (pregnancy, puberty, etc).  Many papers at the ASI reported such work, with topics ranging from perinatal influences on early ASB, to hormonal changes in adolescence, to hormonal and psychophysiological functions in wife batterers, to prefrontal glucose metabolism dysfunction in murderers, to the emotional and temperament characteristics of criminal psychopaths.  Such controlled studies form the basis for clinical assessments and interventions, and reveal correlations which can then form the basis for measures and hypotheses employed in longitudinal and other field studies of more diverse populations.<P>

<I>d.  Longitudinal Studies</I><BR>
	Long term field studies of cohorts are a classic tool for both biological and social studies.  A number were discussed at the ASI; two examples are the Dunedin (New Zealand) and the Mauritius Studies.  The former involved 1037 subjects from a lower SES area who were age three in 1975, with follow-up sampling every 2-3 years since.  The latter has followed 1795 children from two mixed Indian/Creole towns, starting at age 3 in 1972.  Such studies obviously require extensive efforts on the part of several generations of scholars and generate massive amounts of data; thus they also produce many theses and papers.  Equally obviously, they are complicated by changes over time in knowledge and available interventions, by historical trends, by later misinterpretation of data inadequately documented by those who collected it, and by simple logistics (e.g. families move and, as noted by one researcher, some of the best subjects for the study of violent behavior tend to get removed from the data pool through early death).<BR>
	The Dunedin and Mauritius studies have followed their cohorts through and past the typical peak of mid-late teen criminality/ASB, and -- as with the historic increase in violence discussed by Rutter --  have demonstrated that it is easier to rule out than to find causes.  As Moffitt stated at the summary session, the field is still in its infancy and practitioners are "too thrilled when we get a finding" to have yet even started to truly understand the findings.  They have however led to Moffitt's contention, mentioned earlier, that the groups of adolescent limited and life-course persistent offenders are distinct, as well as more recent findings such as that seratonin blocks signals of punishment and thus reduces behavioral inhibition.  <BR>
	As a very gross generalization, longitudinal studies show correlations between low arousal (e.g., low resting heart rate) and violence, presumptively through its influence on stimulation seeking and associated hormonal involvement.  Lack of control and disinhibited temperament at an early age (3-5) also correlate with low resting heart rate, and are predictive of violent ASB.  Biological factors like heart rate (measured at an early age, prior to the impact of athletic training) however are closely interrelated with social factors; they are often most significant in conditions of lower environmental risk, e.g. low resting heart rate appears more linked to criminality in individuals with benign backgrounds.<BR>
	Overall the balance between biological and social factors remains unclear.  Certainly adverse family environment (birth complications, maternal neglect, parental abuse or absence, low socioeconomic status) predisposes to ASB, but multiple interrelated variables are almost always involved.  Biological and social factors which lead to predispositions or propensity toward violence -- characteristics of temperament in Cloninger's terms, or factors such as impulsiveness, arousal and emotional detachment -- are strongly mediated by environmental and situational influences.  The bottom line is that in spite of the increasing levels of violence and the need for intervention, longitudinal studies have to date provided little sound scientific foundation for social policy.<P>

<B>4.   Organizer's Overview</B><BR>
	At the conclusion of the ASI, Farrington attempted a summary of the proceedings.  He sketched the model included in paragraph 3.b. above, and stated that the key question remains as to which general model to use.  He then raised eight issues before returning to the central concern of improving progress in the field.  Among his points were the following:<BR>
	<I>Violence:</I> Different theories may be required to understand different types of violence.  The validity of measurement and classification needs to be improved.  Comorbidity with nonviolent offenses, clinical disorders, ASB etc confuses results. <BR> 
	<I>Propensity:</I> Many constructs were implicated as explanatory: e.g., arousal, fearlessness, impulsivity, disinhibition, novelty seeking, self control, etc; these are not all independent, and need to be more precisely defined and related to each other and to their effects.  Cognitive, emotional, attitudinal and social learning need to be incorporated into the model of the processes leading to propensity, and this in turn must be causally linked to situational effects to yield behavior.<BR>
	<I>Biological variables:</I>  Again there is a problem with definitions.  Some of the variables reported as correlated with violent ASB include heart rate, skin conductance, genetics, serotonin, testosterone, frontal lobe disfunction and birth complications; there are disagreements over what, when or how to measure some of these, particularly in community surveys.  Because of measurement difficulties, sample sizes are often much smaller than for social variables.  Some of the data, e.g. influence of sex hormones on ASB, is extremely problematic.  Coincidence in multiple-problem individuals can be confusing.  Are risk and protective factors different, or opposite?<BR>
	<I>Psychosocial variables:</I> Among the main psychological variables discussed were personality, intelligence, self-esteem, and hyperactivity; social factors included socio-economic status, convicted or single parents, school performance, and parental violence.  Similar issues as with biological factors pertain: definition of the constructs and their measurement, separation of risk and protective factors, and coincidence.<BR>
	<I>Causal relationships:</I> There is a lack of well specified testable theories about influences among the "independent" variables, as well as about causal relationships.<BR>
	<I>Interaction effects:</I> Again, theories are needed.  Many examples of interaction were presented, e.g. the increased effect of biological factors in favored vs deprived backgrounds.  Some of these interactions may be protective and have practical implications.<BR>
	<I>Types of Individuals:</I> The postulated difference between adolescence-limited and life course persistent offenders needs to be refined and evaluated.  Models should incorporate personality theories and developmental pathways. <BR> 
	<I>Analytic methods:</I> Most studies employ fairly basic statistical procedures.  Multiple regression techniques are important for testing independence versus additive impact.  Both prospective and retrospective procedures are needed, and more complex modeling will be required to test specific theories as they are developed; to date there have been very few tests of sequential models.<BR>
	<I>How to proceed:</I>  The many different findings, although interesting, all use different constructs.  Each research group has its own approach and interests, and there is little basis for sharing data or building on others' results.  However the problem is larger than the ability of any individual or single group to solve.  The field needs to reach agreement on a general model, to develop some specific theories associated with it, to agree on the definition of its variables and their measurement, and to evolve common or at least compatible experimental designs and analytical methods.  The longitudinal studies are impressive, but the data from them needs to be usable by a variety of groups to independently test theories and to compare results.  <P>

<B>5.  Observer's comments</B><BR>
	I was interested in attending the ASI less because of its focus on violence than because "biosocial" techniques and findings have profound impact on military issues as diverse as selection and training, and information warfare.  Violence certainly is militarily significant, both as a societal phenomenon and as an aspect of warfare (and OOTW), but my curiosity was about whether we now know, or soon will know, enough about human behavior to effectively predict or manipulate it, i.e. to be deliberately helpful or dangerous.  If this ASI was at all representative of the disciplines it gathered together, the answer is pretty conclusively no, except perhaps in very tightly constrained circumstances.  Left unanswered is whether disciplines and countries not represented at this meeting have made any more progress.<BR>
	It's difficult not to make comparisons with a field with which I'm somewhat more familiar, oceanography.  It also has a broad scope and involves many disciplines.  During the last decade or so, many of its most interesting questions have been of a scale that required truly global collaboration to address.  Global climate change and the formation and movement of the ocean floor are examples.  To study such issues, researchers of many different persuasions and institutions, however intellectually (and fiscally) competitive, have been forced to agree on initiatives that combine theoretical development, numerical and analytical modeling, lab experiments and massive international field campaigns focused on a common set of basic questions, and to employ instruments and procedures that permit intercomparison and sharing of data.  <BR>
	The apparent total lack of any such construct in the field addressed by this ASI is striking.  Perhaps the only areas of consistent general agreement were that violence is an urgent social problem and our understanding of it is in its infancy, characterized more by quasi-empirical searches for relationships than by well specified and testable hypotheses soundly based on understanding of cause and effect.  There was no consistency in how to address the problem.<BR>
	The organizers' efforts in running the ASI, and Farrington's observations at its conclusion, indicate that they recognize the need for significantly enhanced collaboration and coherence.  My sense is that the basis for a more unified approach is available, e.g. in some combination and extension of the models proposed by Raine/Farrington and Cloninger.  Powerful mathematical, biological, cognitive, and experimental tools are available.  What seems to be missing is the focus, and the willingness to work together.  At issue is whether any combination of investigators and sponsors (both will be required) have enough concern to devote the needed years of effort, and enough credibility within the community, to change the process by which the problems of violence (and other issues of behavior) are approached.<P>

<B>1. Summary</B><BR>
The <B>Office of Naval Research</B> celebrated the 50th birthday of both ONR Europe and the parent organization during <B>The Oceanography Societys</B> 1996 Meeting in Amsterdam, The Netherlands, 8 - 11 July .  In honor of this anniversary, TOS allocated the evening of 8 July  for a "Symposium on 50 Years of ONR Contributions to International Oceanography".  The Symposium included a plenary session at the main conference site at the Okura Hotel, followed by a poster session and birthday celebration at the Netherlands Maritime Museum.  Attendance was approximately 215 people from 20 countries worldwide.<BR>
The full TOS meeting is summarized in a separate ONR Europe Newsletter.<P>

<B>2. Symposium Details</B><BR>
<B>2 1.  Plenary Session</B><BR>
The plenary session (Fig 1) started at 16:30 on 8 July 1996 in the Heian Zaal Room of the Okura Hotel with welcoming remarks by the Deputy Chief of Naval Research/ONR Technical Director, Dr. <B>Fred Saalfeld</B> (Fig. 2).  Besides welcoming the attendees to this Symposium, Dr. Saalfeld traced the history of ONR, its present mission and the role of  ONR Europe in that mission.  ONR supports science and technology (S&T) in areas of importance to the U.S. Navy.  ONR Europe forges partnerships between U.S. S&T and that going on in Europe.  Dr. Saalfeld emphasized the importance of international partnerships with his discussion of the new <B>Navy International Cooperative Opportunities in Science and Technology Program (NICOP)</B>  that will open a new era of joint U.S. - International cooperation.  Choice of the TOS meeting as the venue for celebrating ONRs 50 birthday highlights the importance of the ocean sciences to the overall missions of ONR in general, and ONR Europe in particular.<P>

Dr. <B>Klaus Hasselmann</B>, Director of the Max-Planck Institute fuer Meteorologie, Hamburg, Germany, followed with a paper entitled "ONR Contributions to International Ocean Science" (Fig 3).  Dr. Hasselmann opened his presentation by noting that the success of ONRs policy of supporting international ocean science can be largely attributed to two essential ingredients: vision and consistency.  He chose two specific examples to make his point; Arctic/Marginal Ice Zone, and Surface Waves.  The paper proceeded to describe the evolution of these areas and highlighted scientific results from both.  The most important result from the latter was the development of the third generation ocean wave model, WAM, which is used today for routine wave forecasts at weather centers worldwide (e.g.. Fleet Numerical Meteorology and Oceanography Center, National Centers for Environmental Prediction, European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasting, and the U.K. Meteorological Office).<P>

Dr. <B>Giancarlo Vettori</B> (Fig 4), Deputy Director of the SACLANT Undersea Research Centre, La Spezia, Italy, next illustrated ONRs contributions to international ocean science and technology with his paper entitled "ONR Contributions to the SACLANT Undersea Research Centre" (Fig 4).   Some of the examples Dr. Vettori chose to highlight included conference support, field experiments, comprehensive reviews, collaborative studies and instrumentation development.  Specific examples included a conference on bottom shear waves, low frequency volume reverberation experiments in the GINSEA to connect fish distributions with reverberation levels, shallow water acoustic measurements review and summary, and collaboration with Columbia University to develop an expendable bottom penetrometer.  These contributions were set into the context of 15 years of SACLANT Centre S&T.<P>

<B>2.2.  Poster Session and Birthday Celebration</B><BR>
Following the plenary session, Symposium attendees boarded canal boats (Fig 5) for cruise to the Netherlands Maritime Museum .  At the museum, six invited authors (Fig 6) presented poster papers illustrating work presently funded by ONR.  These covered the spectrum from ocean surface phenomena and processes (<B>Caulliez</B> et. al, FRANCE, <B>Hasselmann</B> et al , GERMANY; <B>Larsen</B> et al, DENMARK; and <B>Serio</B>, ITALY) to the marine atmosphere ( <B>Johnson</B>, UK and <B>Grisogono</B>, SWEDEN).  In addition to discussing the poster papers, Symposium attendees toured the Museum.  Figures 7-12  show some of the attendees enjoying the evening.<P>

<B>1.  Summary.</B>  ONRs new NICOP attempts to foster long term collaborative relationships between US and international scientists.  This trip was to introduce the new program to one of the major participants in the previous SOP.  The report details conversations at several Ukrainian state offices.  Dorman concludes that the most mutually profitable interactions will continue to be with individual scientists on specific projects of mutual interest.<P>

<B>2.  Introduction.</B>  Drs. Craig Dorman and Igor Vodyanoy visited Kiev, Ukraine from 24-26 July 1996 to introduce ONRs new Naval International Cooperative Opportunities in Science and Technology Program (NICOP).  The visit was arranged by the Ukrainian Office of International Projects (UOIP), which was established and supported by the EC to coordinate their analyses of the effects of the Chernobyl disaster; although that program is over, the UOIP Secretariat remains operative and assists in the coordination of Ukranian R&D with both NIS and western nations.  In addition to the primary purpose of the visit, presentation of NICOP to the State Committee on Science, Technology, and Industrial Policy, the meetings focused on Ukranian environmental and marine programs (because of Dormans background and Navy interests).  All conversations were conducted through interpreters; the comments below portray Dormans understanding of the major points discussed.<P>

<B>3.  State Committee on Science, Technique and Industrial Policy.</B>  We met with the Deputy Chairman Dr. Victor Svizhenko, and the Chief of the General Department of Critical Technology and Conversion, Dr Anatoly Maximov.  The Committee was formed after independence, in 1991.  Since S&T previously had been governed from Moscow via the Russian Academy and its main Institutes there, the Committees first responsibility was to formulate Ukrainian national S&T policy, and coordinate among the Ukrainian national academies (Ukrainian National Academy of Science and four special disciplinary academies) and the various Ministries and agencies.  At the time of our visit, the President had approved upgrading the committees status to that of a Ministry.  When this occurs the National Agency of Marine Research and Technologies will join it as a Department (but see below; this Agency is fighting absorption); the National Aerospace Agency however will remain separate.<P>

In addition to its policy and coordination responsibilities, the Committee administers funding of S&T.  There are line items in the State budget for the base funding of the Academies and Institutes (of which there are some 1400, about 900 of which are industrial and about 150 military).  In addition, there are two competitive grant programs which make awards to individual investigators irrespective of their organizational affiliation; these supplement the institutional block budgets.  The Directorate of Science administers the applied science program.  It has seven primary areas, confirmed by the Supreme Soviet: Health Protection, Environmental Protection, Agriculture, Materials, Energy, Information Systems, and Communications.  Special national soviets (expert committees) define priorities, and the "Expertise Directorate" forms and coordinates review panels to evaluate the proposals.  There are some 68 individual programs, and about 5000 projects; the average award is enough to support 3 researchers.  The Directorate of Basic Research administers a similar program, divided along standard disciplinary lines.  It supports about 1000 projects per year (NB: EOARD has been attempting to have a list of about 8000 Ukrainian researchers and 5000 proposal titles posted on the web; the site URL will be www.fonon.kiev.ua).<P>

Overall, funding for the academies and Institutes is very low.  The ones we visited and discussed in Kiev all are closed every Friday; and salaries are so low that the researchers all need additional jobs just to survive.  Dr Svizhenko stated that the competitive applied science and basic research programs are much too broad, with too many projects.  They want to focus these efforts (details not provided), and concentrate on areas where the Ukraine was considered world class.  Such areas include materials and welding, remotely controlled coal mining, agriculture, devices for cleaning soil and water, and image processing.  <P>

Other elements of the State Committee include:<BR>
	<DIR>The Legislative Directorate is responsible for developing laws on scientific activity, IPR, etc.</DIR>
	<DIR>The Industrial Policy Directorate is a new organization "trying to find its place", formed from portions of the Ministries of Economics and various different industries, each of which has its own policies.  This Directorate is intended to coordinate industrial policy among the other ministries; exactly how it will function, and how effective it will be, seems unclear.</DIR>
	<DIR>The Directorate of International Relations oversees the governments agreements with some 30 nations and international bodies (individual institutions are also permitted to have bilateral arrangements with counterparts).  President Kuchma recently led an unsuccessful effort to get the FSU nations to agree on a "Single Scientific Space"; in spite of the failure of this proposal the Ukraine still maintains close contacts with the other NIS institutions and academies.</DIR>
	<DIR>The Directorate of Special Works, or General Department of Critical Technology and Conversion, maintains the ties to MoD and assists in the conversion of military industry (especially those aspects associated with weapons of mass destruction).  We were told that the main directions of the program for defense conversion and dual use have been set, and the criteria for selection of critical technologies established.  An advisory commission will soon make the decisions on which parts of the infrastructure to continue to support to meet MoD needs, and which portions to convert. As noted above, there are some 150-200 military-industrial research institutions, although the principal Soviet Military Research Institutions were all in Russia.  In addition there are 32 military academies for education of specialists; many of will these be converted into research centers to establish an indigenous capability to develop military technology.  They have a similar problem with the research fleet; they inherited over 70 ships, few of which they can use.  Some are in commercial service; others are just laid up.</DIR>

We described NICOP and our emphasis on collaborative research.  Dr. Svizhenko indicated that the Institutes were also very interested in undertaking contract research, and that much data and information (e.g. the annual list of proposals) was available and for sale.<P>

<B>4.  Environmental Programs</B><P>

	<B>a. Ministry of Environmental Protection and Nuclear Safety.</B>  We met with Anna Vlasova, Assistant to First Deputy Minister Vasyl Vasylchenko.  The Ministry is about 5 years old, and was merged into its present form in late 1994.  The ministry is responsible for developing and enforcing regulations regarding nuclear safety and ecology, for associated research in five institutions, and for assessments of the state of the environment. We were given a copy of the 1994 State of the Environment report; the 1995 report, and associated reports on the Black Sea (which we saw) and nuclear safety (a copy is available at the US Embassy) were not published due to lack of funds.  The data however could be made available; a "legalized consulting group" could be formed to access it. <BR>
	The Ministry has a staff of about 2000; some 300 in Kiev, and the rest at the research institutions and the 27 regional centers which are responsible for enforcement and regulation and which operate the analytic labs which conduct the annual environmental assessments.  The ministry maintains close relations with the State Committee on S&T through its annual competitions; it supports its own science programs with a fund derived from fines for violation of environmental regulations.  There is also much international support, e.g. for nuclear protection and the Danube and Black Sea programs; but the Ministry finds it hard to assess the impact of these efforts, or even coordinate them effectively, since such support goes directly to the individual institutes.<BR>
	Discussions and the 1994 report make clear that ecology and nuclear safety are major national concerns; the assessments are realistic, and generally pessimistic.  Years of industrial, mining, and agricultural exploitation with virtually no cleanup or concern have resulted in contamination of soils, ground water, rivers, forests, harbors and coasts.  The aftermath of Chernobyl lingers, and there are significant problems with destruction of weapons and silos.  Sevastopol is a major problem due to pollution from naval ships.  There are many such "mini-catastrophes" associated with military and industrial activity.  Pollution is lower today than in former periods, but only because industries are not working because of the economic situation.  A new source of problems is small businesses, which rise and die rapidly and pay little attention to the regulations.  The Ukraine has a sizable and growing set of codes, laws and regulations governing safety and environmental protection, but it a hard uphill battle even to prevent further deterioration.<P>

	<B>b.  National Agency of Marine Research and Technology (NAMRT).</B>  NAMRT was organized in 1993 as a separate state executive, management, and policy agency under the Vice Prime Minister.  As noted above, the State Committee on S&T expects it to become a department under the new Ministry; but the Agency representatives we met (Dr A. Ischenko, First Deputy Director; and Dr I. Skopichenko, Head of the Scientific Organizational Department), expressed their belief that it would instead become a State Committee.<BR>
	Its responsibilities include hydrography (assumed from the Navy; the hydrographers apparently still are naval officers) and the development of a national mapping and charting capability; development of policy recommendations for and coordination of state activity in marine research and use of marine resources, including licensing of research vessels and of resource use in the Black and Azov Seas; official representation in international maritime and marine organizations; coordination of the Antarctic research program including the operation and annual resupply of the Vernadsky Station (competitively acquired from the UK); and development and execution of the "National Program on Research and Use of Resources of the Azov and Black Seas and other regions of the world ocean". <BR>
	Elements of the "National Program" were initially set up by Moscow and spread through various ministries; responsibility for focusing these activities and developing them into a true Program was concentrated in the Agency when it was created in 1993.  The Program - initially involving some 400 "problems" (now about 250) and 40000 participants  was implemented by many different universities, institutes, etc., competitively selected at the start in 1993; if there is more funding, there will be another competition.  It is an applied R&D program, oriented to the development of industrial capability.  It consists of eight "State Programs" (fish farming; non-living resources, i.e. minerals, oil and gas; Fleet and Transport; Recreation; Sea Ecology; Hydrography; the Antarctic Region; and "Poseidon"), and five "Aim-oriented Complex Projects" (Marine Sciences; Strategic Management,; Monitoring; Informatics; and Intellect).  Each of these programs has several major projects (list available); together, and taken at face value, they represent a truly comprehensive effort to develop a modern marine based economy with world wide scope, tightly coordinated by this central agency.  There were major studies leading up to this program, discussing how to make the Ukraine a major seafaring nation; and this is one of five "National Programs" at the Presidential level.  What was not described was funding and progress.  <BR>
Among the various topics we discussed were:<BR>
 The scientific fleet, previously used worldwide by all 
the USSR, had 73 vessels.  Most are now used commercially.  The agency operates one large research vessel (Kiev, used for Antarctic resupply) and several river/coastal vessels; there is one research vessel active in Sevastopol (at MHI, see below) and one in Odessa.  Although these ships may belong to the Academy or institutes, the Agency is the licensing authority.  They also authorize research; the Foreign Ministry turns to the Agency for review of applications for research in Ukrainian waters.
 The fishing fleet has significant economic problems due 
to the doubling of fuel costs.  There is a large Krill fleet, but it sells its catch elsewhere to generate hard currency.  There are 700 km of mollusk farms along the Crimea, but no processing capability and no capital to develop one.  The Black Sea is recovering a bit as industry slows.  However the problem with Black Sea fishing is not depletion of stocks or the environment, but economics.(???)
 The scientific center in Guinea, built in 1973, was 
operated by the Ukraine until 1988.  Guinea then manned it until 1993, when Russia gave it to Guinea as a gift.  It is now in bad shape and Guinea has recently applied for assistance in fixing it and restarting scientific measurements.
 Ukraine is an associate member of the IHO.  They are 
interested in assistance with chart production.  They have the capability to electronically collect hydrographic data (there are 4 hydrographic ships and 28 boats), but not for cartography and chart printing.<P>

	<B>c.  National Marine Program.</B>  We met with Dr. V. Eremeev, Director, Marine Hydrophysics Institute (MHI), Sevastopol, and Dr E. Nikiforovich, Department Head at the Institute of Hydromechanics.  Our host for this meeting was Prof. Peter Shpak, Director of the Institute of Geological Studies. Scince it was Friday, the Institute was otherwise closed; but Prof Shpak very kindly provided a meeting room and hosted lunch in the Chinese restaurant which rents the Institutes ground floor.<BR>
	There are several ongoing international Black Sea programs, sponsored by NATO, the World Bank, GEF, and similar organizations.  Ukrainian marine scientists have participated in these.  At the same time, as noted above, the environmental and ecological conditions continue to deteriorate.  To quote the (translation of the) proposal prepared by Dr Eremeev and his colleagues, "Currently in Ukraine the volume of national production fell by half.  At the same time the national potential or natural resources in our country are being exhausted due to irrational management, basically non-controlled non-regulated exploitation of natural resources, and clear orientation of the market toward exporting of natural resources.  Pollution and degradation of the environment increase significantly, quality of living worsens, vital functions and activities of human life decrease.  All of the above led to significant "ecological" national losses, reaching almost 40% of current gross national product.  This can be estimated at the very least as being no less than $20-30 billion per year...Among the ecologically vulnerable and the most valuable are the southern regions of Ukraine: coastal areas of Black Sea and Azov Sea with concentration of population, ports, industrial and agricultural organizations.  In the recent past this area possessed unique recreation potential and rich natural produce resources."<BR>
	To address these problems, and to derive maximum benefit from the international work in the Black Sea, (again quoting from the proposal translation) "by initiative of employees of a range of leading Institutes of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine a proposal of Interstate Programme has been developed.  This programme is aimed on wide ranging and quick solution to most painful ecological problems on the coast of cross-border national reservoirs.  ...In particular, this Programme is dedicated to the following:  R&D and science based implementation within the short time frame of specific practical measures for protection of contact zone "land-sea" from pollution; rehabilitation of natural potential; optimization of land user structure; healthy improvement of the environment populated by people; rehabilitation of natural life-supporting systems."<BR>
	The proposal estimates the cost of the first three years of the program (scientific research and development of methods and technologies) at $14.5M, with additional costs for implementation.  Proposed participants include senior scientists and support staff at the Marine Institute of Hydrodynamics, the Institute of Biology of the Southern Seas in Sevastopol and its Odessa affiliate, the Institute of Hydromechanics, Institute of Geology, Institute of Economics, Ukrainian Center of Sea Ecology, Southern Science and Research Institute of Fishing Industry and Oceanography, Department of Sea Geology and Sediment Ore Formation of the Central Science Museum of Nature Studies, Odessa Institute of Hydrometeorology, and the State Committee for S&T.  Ukranian and English versions of the proposal are available.<P>

<B>5.  Comment.</B>  There was widespread recognition among all those we talked to, of the major problems facing the Ukraine: the environment and economy are both a mess, and the scientific infrastructure is deteriorating.  At issue are the appropriate course of action, and whos in charge.  If the small sampling we observed is any indication, it will be some time before rational progress is made.  The State Committee (Ministry?) of Science, Technology and Industrial Policy has some extremely tough choices to make if it is to rationalize the infrastructure and save the best portions.  Its charter and authorities seem somewhat unclear; the reluctance of the Marine Agency to accept its proposed new status and the tenuous description of the Industrial Policy Directorate suggest that there will be considerable bureaucratic infighting for some time to come.  I believe it unlikely that the necessary draconian decisions can be made and executed under such conditions.<BR>  
	The grandiose nature of NAMRTs "National Program" is reminiscent of Soviet five-year plans.  There was no indication that virtually any of it has been or will be effectively accomplished.  The Academy Institutions, with their own National Marine Program proposal, obviously are charting a different course.  Neither group mentioned, let alone discussed, the other with us, although our agenda was openly available.  In addition, the academicians Proposal in its present form is basically an outline, with little detailed budgetary breakdown or explicit work statements.  <BR>
	We did see evidence of some extremely good science, and of considerable initiative on the part of individuals and organizations.  There does not however appear to be a coherent national policy or rational program in the areas we were exposed to.  This makes it difficult for us to interact with Ukrainian colleagues at other than an individual project level, which may benefit both parties intellectually but does little to improve their national situation or to support the retention of a viable S&T infrastructure.<P>

<B>1.  Summary and Appraisal</B><P>
MARIS - the "Maritime Information Society" - is one of 11 pilot projects adopted by the G7 in June 95, to address the impact of, and adjustments to, the revolution in information technology.  The title comes from the European approach to IT: "Information Society", with an emphasis on people and social/industrial adjustment to technology; the US simply talks about the "Information Superhighway", with the focus on the infrastructure.  The EU and Canada have the lead for MARIS.  This meeting in Dublin (24Sep) was one of several around Europe to further develop the concept, identify opportunities for joint projects, and expose local (in this case Irish) IT and Marine industries to the opportunities.<P>
Following an address by DGIII (Industry) Commissioner M Bangemann on EUs approach to the "Information Society", EC reps gave overviews and chaired workshops on the 4 MARIS subprojects: MARVEL (ship owner, builder, supplier common global network), MARSOURCE (fisheries network for resource preservation and marketing), MARTRANS (port logistics network for real time info on cargo and carriers), and SAFEMAR (ship reporting/tracking and ECDIS).  Canada, Japan and the US also gave their perspectives on this G7 Head of State approved initiative.<P>
The EC has funded and coordinated many dynamic projects under the umbrella of MARIS, focusing on industrial and societal issues.  It is actively soliciting and supporting research and industrial participation in MARIS.  Canada has no single source of MARIS funding, but reported a few related projects, mostly under SAFEMAR.  Japan established a national forum to develop a consensus on what theyre willing to share and how to approach the issue; they suggest a global maritime "intranet" (so one searches using a browser vice requiring standardized formats) keyed to visual presentation of information for "intuitive communication" (e.g., animation to depict weather and wave forecasts and their impact on the consumer at sea).  The US reported that we essentially have done nothing identifiable as MARIS; we agreed to the concept at the Presidential level, but that has not been translated into programmatics or even coordination (although there are of course many relevant efforts underway at a variety of agencies and industries).<P>
The differences between the US and EU (and Japanese) approaches to this G7 initiative are palpable: first, we view the basic IT issue from fundamentally different viewpoints; second, the EC has leaped on this opportunity to advance European maritime potential and tie this initiative in with their Framework etc programmes via bottoms-up participation, and Japan developed a consensus national approach, while the US - for whatever reason - has virtually ignored it.  Equally interesting, no one seemed surprised at the US attitude.  Europeans are looking after their interests and pushing opportunities to improve safety and competitiveness of their industry, especially for SMEs, and if we dont want to (in one of the few areas where, via G7, we have an opportunity to engage closely with the EC), well thats just fine.  American maritime industry can just fend for itself, by itself.<P>

<B>2.  EU views of "Information Society"</B><P>
This well-practiced address was delivered by Martin Bangemann, Commissioner for Industrial Affairs, Information Technologies, and Telecommunications (DGIII).  
The G7 interest in IT and other industrial affairs is global.  However each participant looks for their place in the global society, and Europeans must decide what part of the play must be theirs.  Its important therefore to define the European approach to IT.  In the US, the focus is on the "Information Highway", the infrastructure.  In Europe however it is on the "Information Society", i.e. beyond simply the technology, regulatory framework and infrastructure, to encompass the people who must live with and use the technology.  The EC has thus established an "Information Society Forum" to get all impacted groups involved in the discussion, to avoid splits and the cultural clash of haves and have-nots.<P>
The global growth of IT will have a significant impact on jobs; Ireland is a good example.  The older telecommunications monopolies will initially lose jobs as they are broken through competitiveness, but even they will regrow after restructuring, through the same competitive forces.  This leads now to much concern and fear, and thus it is important to show the utility of the new technologies, both directly and in terms of their "virtual value"; working methods and life styles may change, but this will not reorder the social structure.  As we go through this inevitable transition we must convince the non-believers.  Thus in the EU, and within the Framework of G7, we work to improve user awareness, accelerate development, stimulate new value added services and products in the interest of the consumer, and support R&D that leads to targeted investment.<P>
	There are 4 pillars to the EU strategy within this global effort:  <P>
<OL>
<LI>Improve the business environment (through liberalization).  This means destroy the monopolies (state or not) and therefore allow private investment to flow into the field.  Competition, deregulation, and pilot projects are aspects of this process. 
<LI>Invest in the future.  Here the media plays a vital cultural role, but practicalities also are essential: industries, especially SMEs, must be able to use the technology and this means education and training so that individuals and firms become "consumers of the possibilities" rather than just of entertainment.
<LI>People at the Center. Social questions are at the heart of the Information Society.  There is concern with isolation and invasion of privacy, where it should be just the opposite.  IT can improve access, protect consumer interests, and ensure cultural diversity.  We must also deal with the "computer homeless", those who grew up without the technology and are divorced from the changes. 
<LI>Meeting the Global Challenge.  We must define anti-protectionist global rules.  This is hard for those who are ahead and are challenged.  The US is the prime example, as demonstrated in WTO negotiations; the Americans are all for openness, except until their lead is threatened.  LEOS is a case in point; it must be open access, or there must be 2-3 competing systems.  Europe insists on openness and competition; its restrictions are lower that those of others.  It is also essential to help the developing world participate.
</OL>
For these reasons Europe supported the pilot projects at the Feb95 G7 Brussels conference; and the EU is pleased the G7 agreed. The 11 projects agreed to, and encouraged by the Heads of State at their Summit in Halifax in Jun95 include a Global Inventory (led by the EU and Japan), Global Health Care (EU/France/Germany/Italy), the Global Marketplace for SMEs (since economy of scale no longer rules in the Information Society), and the topic of this workshop, the Maritime Information Society, which from the EU perspective expands upon the preexisting Maritime Industrial Forum and addresses the interface of maritime industrial policy and IT policy.<P>
Like the other pilots, MARIS is user driven, builds on existing systems (e.g., GPS), has an open framework that seeks to integrate all maritime players, and fosters "defacto implemented standards" derived by common usage.  Its overall objective, like the other pilots, is to show the advantage of a global information system through specific applications.  The timetable involves stocktaking in 1995, development of prospects for international cooperation (as at this conference) in 1996, concrete results in 97, and presentation of results at EXPO98 in Lisbon.<P>
	Within the EC there is a manager, reporting to the Commissioner, for each of the subprojects.   There is no identified G7 budget for the project, but the European Parliament has backed Information Society activities.  Therefore the issue in Europe is ideas, not money.<P>
	Ireland is like an India in the EU in terms of its competitiveness in developing software.  It relies on creativity.  A newcomer, it is not stifled by past structures and can make rapid progress in the fresh spirit of competition that characterizes the best in European innovation. <P>

<B>3.  MARSOURCE in the EU</B><P>
	This subproject seeks to link oceanographic, fisheries, and research data bases of the EU, various nations, and several international organizations such as the ICES and FAO to improve transparency in fisheries, help preserve stocks, and improve both sea-catch marketing efficiency and the availability of aquaculture products.  Exemplary data will include resource information (e.g. total allowable catches, fisheries boundaries, member state catches), markets (prices, port accessibility and services), trade (export/import data by product, quantity, value, etc), fleet composition, aquaculture production and problems, and research programs.  One example of a product is an electronic marketing system permitting remote auctions and buying while the ships are still at sea.<P>
The workshop report noted that the Irish fishermen (not dissimilar to many others) were characterized by a poorly organized market structure, low income, no national strategy, and locked-in quotas.  There are two major computerized selling companies in Europe; the technology is not just available but implemented, the issue is the will to use it.  Difficulties include the large amount of "black" fish on the market that never get into the statistics, the short term nature of the catch (vice farming) trade which doesnt let computerized auctions stabilize prices the way futures markets do, the large number of SMEs involved and their independence, and the fact that fishermen at sea wont disclose where they are (or were) lest others flock to their area.  Fishermen themselves need to become involved to a greater extent, perhaps with informal or regional programs in addition to the European approach.<P>

<B>4.  MARTRANS & SAFEMAR in the EU</B><P>
MARTRANS seeks to develop an Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) System to improve efficiency, customer service, and logistics management in multi-modal transport.  The basic concept within the EC is to build up Port Community EDI Systems in local regions, automate the ports not already automated, employ "smart cards" and GPS for information on carriers and their cargo, and then globally interconnect the community systems and their users (using translators or service providers for interfaces between local communities).  Data on port conditions and berthing availability, repair needs to be matched with parts/services availability, and vessels and their cargo would speed throughflow and reduce bottlenecks.  High among the objectives is simplification of the currently complex manifest and customs systems. SAFEMARs objectives are oriented to hazard reduction, but the two major projects - a Vessel Traffic Management Information System and ECDIS - also interface well with MARTRANS.  <P>
	The workshop session, which by far had the largest of the three, featured a set of presentations on cost, logistic and safety benefits, and ongoing implementation projects. One of the largest projects appears to be MARNET which interconnects the Mediterranean ports, specifically focusing on Marseille, Piraeus, Genoa and Valencia, but also includes New York/New Jersey (This was the only mention of participation outside the EU).  An example from the airlines industry described how an Irish Company, Cargo Community Systems Ltd. links carriers and forwarders in the Icarus system and has recently interconnected with TDNI to tie in much of North America.<P>
	The rapporteur concluded from the discussions that the technology is available, and that there is widespread recognition of and agreement on the benefits.  Ports should be the focal points for local community systems, and the approach must be intermodal, with much to be gained for Short Sea Shipping in Europe.  Large companies have made major investments in EDI.  The problem is to interconnect them (they are reluctant because their systems provide competitive advantage) and extend the capabilities to unautomated smaller ports and SMEs.  Other barriers include lack of trading partners with EDI (e.g. SME suppliers, forwarders, carriers), the variety of in-place systems, the great diversity of customs procedures, and dislearning old ways.<P>

<B>5.  MARVEL in the EU</B><P>
MARVEL seeks to create a "virtual enterprise linkage" in support of modern shipbuilding and repair and equipment manufacturing industries, that more and more rely on out-sourcing and work-sharing.  The industrial challenges include increasing international competition and excess capacity, a move to custom tailored ships, the need to optimize the production processes, and the dispersed nature of resources in the global market combined with JIT techniques.  European industry has already formed a consortium (MARVELOUS: Maritime Virtual Enterprise Limited - Open User Syndicate) that gets the competitors around one table to define user needs including design and manufacturing process changes and IT requirements.  This sub-project is of great interest to ONR since it parallels a Navy effort to address the establishment of an international electronic communications network, and ONREur will host a workshop later this month to start to coordinate efforts between Europe and the US (a similar workshop will be held in Japan).  This will be chaired and reported by my colleague Howard Bunch of this office.<P>

<B>6.  An Irish Proposal:  Maritime tourism and leisure</B><P>
	Tourism is a very big business - globally it employs 204 million people, 10.6% of the worlds workforce; it accounts for some $3.4 Trillion annually, about 10.2% of global GNP.  In Europe it accounts for 5.5% of GDP, and in Ireland 7%.  It will probably by the largest single business sector by 2000.  Most tourism is coastal.  In Europe there are some 10 million pleasure boats, 9 million wind surfers; marine mammal watching, sea angling, scuba diving and pleasure cruises, to cite just a few examples, are all multi-billion dollar industries.  Tourism promotes social and economic cohesion; it is labor intensive and dominated by SMEs.  It is based on dynamic use of natural resources, requiring and promoting a high quality environment.  IT can not only provide virtual experiences and promote tourism, but reduce uncertainty in planning (weather, animal sightings, fish locations), improve quality and customer appeal of services (advance bookings, virtual pre-tours, smart cards for entry and departure to marinas) and promote environmental quality through ecotourism and interactive programming.  Ireland, with a large and growing tourist industry, will propose to the Coordinating Committee the addition of MARTOUR as a fifth MARIS subproject.  Ms Yvonne Shields of the Irish Marine Institute (see separate report) made a fascinating and compelling case for this initiative.<P>

<B>7.  Canadian, Japanese, and US Positions</B><P>
	Canada is the co-chair, with the EU, of MARIS.  Richard MacDougal of the Canadian Hydrographic Service/DFO reported that Canada has not established a separate funding stream for the project, but that each separate project is funded on merit and coordination is accomplished through one on one contact. Among the Canadian projects are: <P>
1) The ECDIS (Electronic Chart Display and Information System) demo program, a 4 year $10M effort that started in 1992 to demonstrate viability, test standards, and identify required legislation.  The USCG and NOS were participants.  The project involved 49 vessels and 4 training institutes, logged 14000 sea days on 500 users and produced 360 electronic navigation charts.  Legislation per se does not appear to be a big issue; the biggest concern is updating.  This is now addressed in the new standards, and Canada is testing a commercial service to support dockside updating.<P>
2) INNAV, the Information System for Marine Navigation.  The Canadian Coast Guard is replacing its shore based traffic control system.  It will include dissemination of real time data (e.g. tides and currents) and chart data, and will extend to an international link for the exchange of vessel data.  They are also introducing an automatic vessel ID system, piloted on the St Lawrence to decrease the reliance on shore based control, and with 25 vessels (15 in the Pacific, 10 in the Atlantic) for Fisheries Management.<P>
3) Marine Geomatics: This R&D project will be designed to acquire, process, and manage data to describe the marine environment; it will develop an "information seaway": to extend the information highway to the maritime community.  The objective is to design the system so that the linkages are transparent to the user.<P>
4) A Canadian company is involved in a US project to develop a standard ship safety record, remotely accessible, to assist with inspection.  In addition, the US and Canada have agreed to support differential GPS; discrepancies between GPS and older chart positions will lead to the need for a "chartnet" type approach to collaborative production and dissemination of chart data.<P>
5) In MARTRANS, there is a container tracking project at Montreal; however the major terminal operation is not yet convinced of its value.  And in MARSOURCE, although there are no specific projects yet, Canada sees the major challenge to be stock estimation, and has as a goal the coordination of acoustic and trawl samples, including the development of acoustic techniques for differentiating among species.<P>
	Japan has assigned responsibility for coordination of MARIS overall, and for SAFEMAR, MARVEL and MARSOURCE, to the Ministry of Transport; The Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications is responsible for MARTRANS.  Japan established an "Advanced Maritime Transportation Management Committee" with members from government and industry, suppliers and users, to identify needs and approaches.  Rather than define the project scope narrowly, Japan chose to look across maritime industry to discuss what and how stakeholders would be willing to share.  They envision the goal as a seamless global community that includes ships, operators, and other components of the maritime industrial community.  Concepts include a maritime "intranet" with browser capability that stresses visual presentation of information, and uses tools such as java and aplets to move both data and the programs required to interpret and apply it.  This approach is preferable to standardization because of the multiplicity of systems and users.  They are now considering details such as the information sharing phase and procedures to communicate using visualization techniques to make the date more intuitively useful and to transcend language differences so that the system can be in fact global (e.g., not many Japanese fishermen read French...).<P>
	The US representative received this task only last week; the previous point of contact (who was in MARAD) has moved.  The US has much potential to contribute to MARIS; there are many ongoing projects that relate well to the objectives, and there are US participants in many of the projects described by the EC and Canada.  However the intent to coordinate efforts under the MARIS umbrella has not transitioned to the working level, and the US has as yet no projects identified as MARIS   The representative will attempt to identify offices and individuals for the various subprojects, and coordinate with the EC representatives to tie in better with the ongoing efforts.  An example is MARVEL, via the planned ONREur workshop.<P>

<B>1.  Summary</B><BR>
Universities are the center of Irish S&T.  The nation, and the Universities themselves, are avidly directing research efforts toward innovation and linkages to the booming enterprise sector.  The EU has been a major source for S&T support, and leading researchers have close collaborations throughout the continent as well as with Irish companies.  This newsletter describes the various EC, federal, and local mechanisms employed to successfully couple S&T to innovation in Ireland, and gives examples in materials, optoelectronics, biotechnology, and environmental sciences from visits to Trinity College Dublin and University College Gallway.  <P>

<B>2.  Overall Impressions</B><BR>
	Ireland has a booming economy.  The traditional base, agribusiness, thrives.  Tourism flourishes.  Recent extensions into technologically based sectors are based largely on relatively cheap but well educated labor.  At the 24 Sept MARIS meeting (<A HREF="http://www.ehis.navy.mil/cdnews7.htm">Newsletter #7</A>) the EC Commissioner for Industry compared Ireland to India in terms of the growth of its cottage IT industry.  R&D at the many excellent Universities is directly oriented to creation of jobs and development of industrial potential.  Ireland also is clearly focused on Brussels; the current Irish Presidency of the EC merely highlights the close linkages (indeed dependency in S&T) that have developed over the few years since Irish entry.  The ties to Irish America remain strong, but the real action - economically and intellectually - is more and more with the continent.<BR>
	Ireland has retained its neutrality, and is not a member of any military or security alliance.  This stance becomes more problematic with its EU membership, given evolving European visions of their collective security responsibilities.  Neutrality and Irelands rich history of participation in UN peacekeeping have however shaped the nature of Irish Defense Forces (IDF), and both recent and ongoing reviews sponsored by the governments Efficiency Audit group (and conducted by Price Waterhouse) suggest the need for change.  The Army, which has 11K of the total IDF 13K personnel, is now looking forward and considering the skills and equipment it may need for participation in coalitions.  Air Force and Navy, about 1K strong each, both have day to day missions and thus are operationally proficient, if in need of upgrading.  The 7-ship Navy in particular is extremely busy given the demands of fisheries protection in Irelands 132K km2 fisheries area, plus the growing concern with drug transshipment.<BR>
	The Universities are going through a period of change.  About 2 years ago, student fees for "3rd level education" was abolished in the interests of equity.  This eliminated about 30% of their income, which they are seeking to make up through other sources and activities, such as research.  They have been greatly helped by EC "structural funds" (via STRIDE, S&T for Regional Innovation and Development) as a new and underdeveloped member of the EU (though this is now over), and are hungrily pursuing industrial, federal, and philanthropic support with, at least at the locations I visited, quite good success.  Some 40% or more of research funds now come from the various EC programmes, so the Brussels orientation is both clear and effective.<BR>
On the day of my visit the new President of the University of Gallway and his academic council were to meet with counterparts from the other national Universities to discuss proposed structural changes that would increase campus autonomy.  This should enhance their ability to independently pursue R&D and educational agendas (but like all such proposals has some faculty opposition).  Another interesting characteristic of the Irish "3rd level" sector is that the Universities do not select their own students; rather it works the other way around.  Students take a single exam at the end of high school, and choose their school and department; those with the highest grades get the first choices.  This obviously puts a heavy premium on reputation for quality, and for the top universities insures excellent input and low dropout rates.  It also means of course that opportunities are rationed by the number of available places, that the student bodies are almost totally Irish, and that faculty (as at Galway) often carry horrendous teaching loads.<BR>
	Since I focused during this trip on specific projects and institutions, I dont yet have a good grasp of Irish S&T policy and the organizations and mechanisms for its management.  Certain aspects of the system however came through clearly:
<UL>
<LI>Ireland has traditionally paid little attention to S&T; it has not been part of the national self image (farming, literature and the arts).  However following the publication of the governments Science, Technology and Innovation Advisory Council (STIAC) report in March 95, and the appointment of Pat Rabbitte as Minister for Commerce, Science, and Technology, S&T has received much more emphasis and had better budgetary success.  In the Ministers words (from his message in the 1996 Yearbook, The Irish Scientist), "Allocation of the Budget funds is being guided by a firm belief in the need to create closer links between the colleges and the enterprise sector...(S&T) are central to economic and social development, to competitiveness and the building of a better life for all.  The purpose must be to achieve sustainable full employment and an improved quality of life for all of our citizens".  This clearly links S&T with innovation and ties it to the industrial economy.
<LI>Much effort is being devoted to "awareness", nationally and internationally. Foras is devoting 250K (1 ~ $1.65 when I visited) to awareness in 96; it is one of the main objectives of the Marine Institute and its sister statutory, semi-state bodies.  The objectives of the awareness campaign are to make S&T part of the national culture, and to sell University-based research to industry in Ireland and overseas, and to the EC.
<LI>Funding while remaining low has increased significantly: 3.3M in 1996 for applied and strategic research (up 700K); plus 1M for what we would call tech transfer and SME encouragement.  Basic research doubled from 94 to 2M in 96; and PhD student grants were doubled (though at ~$4K/yr they remain so low that outside support is essential to avoid starvation).  This is nowhere near enough to sustain the extant research program, hence the pressure for industrial involvement and even more the decision in the Universities to "focus on the Brussels route", where they have had outstanding success.
<LI>The Universities are clearly acknowledged as the centers of Irish S&T and innovation. A variety of structural programmes have been established to help develop and market their research capabilities.  These include seven "Programmes in Advanced Technology" (PATs) which are University centered research institutes managed by Forbairt (the State Agency responsible for science, technology, and the development of the indigenous industrial sector), staffed largely by contract researchers but with heavy participation by the academics, graduate students, and post-docs.  The PATs start with nearly total government funding, and are expected to quickly become almost totally self-supporting.  Their objective is technology development and transfer to industry, and there have been several successful privatized spin-offs. I visited two of the five Centres of "Bioresearch Ireland" -- Pharmaceutical Biotechnology at Trinity College Dublin (TCD) and Diagnostics at University College Galway (UCG) -- as well as the Metals Center of Materials Ireland (TCD) and the CIM Applications Center Advanced Manufacturing Technology Ireland (UCG) and was very impressed with their research, their products, and their ability to attract outside investment.  This industry-University-Government partnership seems to be working extremely well for Ireland. (POCs for the 7 PATs are listed in Paragraph 6, Contacts) 
<LI>In addition to the nationally coordinated programmes, each University has an industrial liaison or innovation department that tailors programmes to their specific needs.  TCDs program, active and innovative, is described below.  And, they advertise.  See Para 6 for university contacts and information on two very useful publications.
<LI>The border with Northern Ireland is transparent for S&T.  On ministerial, academic/research institution and individual researcher levels, there are very close collaborative ties.</UL><BR>
	The bottom line is that Ireland , like much of the rest of Europe, sees academic S&T and innovation as an intrinsic and essential aspect of their national well being.  And as the IDF moves to modernization, it can be anticipated that the Ministry of Defense will take advantage of the excellent structural base being established by the Universities in conjunction with industry and the Ministry of Commerce.<P>

<B>3.  Marine Institute</B><BR>
	The Marine Institute was founded in 1993 to "support and promote the sustainable development of Irelands marine resource, to define the contribution it can make to the Irish economy and to propose and where appropriate implement the necessary programmes and measures to ensure that this development potential is realized".  In practice it promotes awareness of marine issues, provides a channel for marine SMEs and research, and represents Irish interests at international scientific fora (e.g. it cosponsored the MARIS conference with the EU; the Chief Executive is the Irish representative to MAST), recommends policy, and manages selected national programs and organizations including the Fisheries Research Center (70 people, headquarters in  Abbotstown), the Irish Marine Data Center (12 personnel, collocated with the Institutes 8 staff in Dublin), and the 21m research vessel Lough Beltra (with a new 31m multipurpose ship under construction).  It also manages the marine R&D program to promote commercial growth, with 27 active projects and about 1.5-2M/year, and promotes and coordinates Irish competition for EC marine projects.  <BR>
	The Institute is a semi-state, "statutory body". The Chief Executive, Dr. Peter Heffernan (who returned to take the job from a tenured position at the University of Georgia), reports to a Board appointed by the Minister of the Marine; the Minister holds a second portfolio as Minister of Defense, and the Institute has a formal liaison mechanism with the Navy.  It also has signed a "Joint Statement" with NOAA to pursue "Collaboration in the Programmes of Marine Research and Technology Development, Sustainable Development, Coastal Zone Management, and Marine Coastal Protected Areas"; and Dr Heffernan has coordinated with NSF geosciences and international program offices to facilitate a workshop between Irish and US marine scientists. <BR>
	Irelands marine resources are quite large, but underdeveloped.  This is a major contrast to the multi-billion dollar agribusiness that is a more central part of the national heritage.  With 16% of EU waters, Ireland has only 3-4% of the fisheries allocation.  The fishermen are disgruntled but fragmented, with 5 different representative organizations.  95% of the marine companies are small, and lack in-house innovation capability.  Marine territory and  resources have yet to be inventoried; the Institute (with EC support) recently completed a GLORIA reconnaissance of 20% of Irelands offshore area; but there is no national hydrographic service and 90% of Irish waters havent been surveyed since the 1800s.  Marine aquaculture got off to an unregulated start and has not flourished, while having some adverse impacts on wild catch.  The small seaweed industry is just starting to coordinate and develop. Other undeveloped opportunities are in deep water oil, deep water aquaculture, and tourism.  As with S&T in general, the Irish Marine potential is excellent;  but the Institute has its work cut out for it.<BR>
	The small staff of the Irish Marine Data Center has done an excellent job of coordinating national capacity in quite a short time.  A highlight of MARIS was the display of their interactive 3D fly-thru hydrography visualization, based on all available data including the recent GLORIA survey.  As I understand the plans, it will become the basis for an Irish GIS that incorporates other oceanographic data bases.  They also have produced an "Extended EDMED" for Ireland, a metadata directory of over 300 data sets; "CRUISEMAN", a computer application for logging underway data on the national research vessel; and the EROS 2000 database from 8 research cruises in the western Med as part of the European Rivers and Ocean Systems 2000 Project.  Work is underway on compilation of temperature data, extension of the bathymetric and geological data sets, development of the BIOMAR pubs data base with TCD, and a guideline on electronic data publishing.
	Although not part of the Institute, I was briefed on the Hydraulics & Maritime Research Center at the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering Dept, University College Cork (UCC).  With STRIDE assistance it has upgraded its facilities, and has several well equipped wave basins and tanks.  HMRC with the Coastal Resource Center and Aquaculture Development Center is part of UCCs Coastal Zone Institute.  HMRC projects range from offshore engineering to harbor and coastal protection ad engineering, and associated wave and sediment processes. <P>

<B>4.  Trinity College, University of Dublin (TCD)</B><BR>
	<B>a.  Research and Innovation Programs:</B> TCD is the oldest (founded 1592) and best known of the Irish Universities.  It has 6 faculties and nearly 70 departments. It is the top choice of students; thus of the 11K students (2K postgraduate) from 68 countries, 95% are Irish.  It is also Irelands foremost research institution, with over 830 research accounts and 1995 annual research income over 12M.<BR>
My visit to Trinity was hosted by the new Dean of Research (a 3-year post filled by a faculty member), Prof John Hegarty, and Dr Eoin ONeill and Ms Doris Alexander of the Industrial Services Office.  It featured an introductory description of TCDs approach to research and innovation, and seven presentations by faculty on their Departments and Centers research in materials, computer science, optics, pharmaceuticals, environmental science and zoology.  I have passed the detailed information they provided to my colleagues in the appropriate disciplines, and summarize the major points here.<BR>
	TCD has had an innovation office for over 10 years, and treats innovation as a major source of support for students, faculty and the College.  TCD is owned by the "Fellows" of the College, and thus has somewhat more flexibility than the National Universities; it does however get students and national funding by the same procedures. The Dean of Research (who had seven years experience at Bell Labs, Murray Hill and U. Wisconsin, and directs the TCD Centre of the PAT "Optronics Ireland") recommends policy and chairs the Business and Industry Committee that makes decisions on new projects.  The Innovation Services Office helps with marketing, arranges contracts and major projects, stimulates and supports new ventures.<BR>
 In addition to the PATs (described above and see Para 6 for a listing), TCD promotes on-campus research with technological and marketing services, incubator space, venture capital, and well defined IPR procedures and support via the Innovation Services offices.  Among the successful procedures are the following.
<UL>
<LI>Federal and EC grants. TCD ranks highest in national awards.  It also brings in about 40% of its research funding from the EC (~4M/yr, plus about 4m of structural funds via STRIDE etc); TCD researchers are involved in nearly 200 EU active projects, and head about 50 EU research consortia.
<LI>Campus Companies.  Staff and faculty of TCD can lease space to set up legally separate entities on campus; TCD takes a 15% equity share in these ventures, and plows the profits back into research.  Some very successful ventures have subsequently been sold and have expanded and moved off campus.  An example is Iona Technologies, opened in 1991 as a campus company with 2 employees; in 1994 SUNSOFT acquired a 20% interest and it now employs over 20 professionals in Dublin.
<LI>Industrial Labs on campus.  There now are 5.  The largest is Elan Corporations (drug delivery; first nicotine transdermal patch) commercial research lab with 35 employees.  Another example is Hitachis software lab with 13 Irish graduates (there is a sister lab at Cambridge University); its major discovery, in collaboration with Prof Hegarty, is an "artificial retina".
</UL><BR>
	During lunch Prof Hegarty mentioned that the next steps for research will expand the campus company program outside the walls, and seek to develop links to larger industries.  Other initiatives include collaboration with the University of Belfast in parallel computing, and use of expertise in social sciences to attack social problems.<BR>
	<B>b.  Examples:</B><BR>
	Prof. JMD Coey heads the Physics Departments "Magnetism and Superconductivity Research Group" which includes two postdocs and about 10 graduate students.  Prof Coey and Dr James Cullen of NSWC, who is spending a year at TCD under a Fulbright fellowship, won one of the initial NICOP awards for a three year project to examine new approaches to increasing the energy storage capacity of advanced permanent magnets.  Prof Coey also is Chief Coordinator of the 1985-95 EC program "Concerted European Action on Magnets", a BRITE/EURAM programme to improve cooperation among a hundred industrial labs and research institutions; has recently established the "Oxide Spin Electronics Network" with 8 partners and 1.9M funding for postdocs over the next 4 years; and runs his own small campus company, "Magnetic Solutions" which produces specialty permanent magnets.<BR>
	Dr Mark Costello, a Research and Teaching Fellow, described the TCD program in environmental sciences.  The University offers both a BA and a MSc in Environmental Sciences. The Natural Resources Development Center headed by Prof Adrian Phillips has a staff of 3 research fellows and 6 research assistants.  Its R&D activities focus on Rural Development, Tourism & Environmental Management, and GIS and Database Development.  A major project for the last few years has been a survey of marine life in Ireland as part of EU BioMar.  There is growing interest in ecotoxicology<BR>
	Mr Seamus OHara, Commercial Manager of the National Pharmaceutical Biotechnology Centre (NPBC), described the PAT structure and his centre, one of 5 in Bioresearch Ireland.  Of the total 6.5M operating budget, federal support is stabilized at around 2.2M, with the rest from licensing, industry, and the EC.  NPBC is headed by Prof D.C. Williams (50% of his time) and operates as a "virtual" center; projects are carried out in Departmental labs, with Centre employees acting as technical staff under day-to-day supervision of the academics.  NPBC product areas include vaccines for animals and man, inflammation, neurobiology (antidepressants, neurodegeneration), drug development and molecular biology.  <BR>
	Dr Julian Reynolds, Senior Lecturer in Biology, described the interests of the Zoology Department.  His own research is in freshwater ecology, including turloughs (small seasonal lakes).  The Department is headed by Prof Barry Roberts (vertebrate neurobiology; fish spinal cord injury and repair), has 7 full time and 3 part time academic staff, 25 graduate students, and about 20 undergraduates per year.  The 5 research groups include Freshwater Ecology, Marine Biology, Wildlife Ecology, Parasitology and Neurobiology and Behavior.  Ecological problems of current interest include aquaculture (Irelands small salmonoid industry is poorly regulated and has not only had significant problems but has adversely impacted wild stocks), declining wildlife populations and an growing grey (N American) squirrel population (which displaces the native species).<BR>
	The Chemistry Department has 16 academic and 14 technical staff; for research, they are supplemented by two emeritus fellows and over 50 postdocs and postgraduate students.  Four academics, headed by Prof Jim Greer who holds the Hitachi chair, are involved in computational chemistry.  Prof John Cornish, who gave the Department overview, studies matter transport in solids; more specifically, diffusion of ionic species in polymeric materials and simulation of the defect processes involved, matter transport in corrosion processes in turbine blades, and passive and electrically stimulated transdermal delivery of drug molecules.  Both internally and through its association with Materials Ireland and the Hewlett-Packard and Hitachi labs, the Department is extremely well equipped for most aspects of chemistry. <BR>
	Prof Werner Blau of the Physics Department, like Prof Coey, has a number of avenues through which he pursues research.  The first is his Photonics Materials Group, an "interdisciplinary team (of about 30) to develop new materials and their applications by molecular engineering".  Recent areas of activity, primarily supported by the EU, include blue polymer lasers, ultrafast switching for telecommunications, third-order nonlinear optical materials and effects, and fullerenes and carbon nanotubes. Second is a campus company, HORCOM Ltd that sells materials and devices.  Third is the Polymer Research Unit of the PAT Materials Ireland, which he directs.  Full time professional staff from the centre work with academics throughout the college on industrial projects in polymer research, product development and quality control, with an emphasis on applications for electronic devices. <BR>
	Prof John Byrne is Head of the Dept of Chemistry.  This large and diverse Dept has 34 academics.  It offers specialist (third level engineering) degrees in basic computer engineering and linguistics & natural languages, a multimedia MSc course, and three evening degrees oriented to business.  There are about a hundred research (graduate) students.  Most research funding is from the EU via ESPRIT ands ACTS(~1M/yr), with an emphasis on distributed computing.  There are large groups in knowledge and data engineering, AI and computer vision, computer architectures for fault tolerant systems, and formal methods.  The Machine Vision Centre is run jointly with the Department of Microelectronics and EE as part of the Manufacturing Technology PAT; and Dept personnel are active in four Campus Companies: Ieunet (email and internet access), IONA (distributed programming tools; now off campus, see above), Tolsys (hw/sw products) and Digital Media Technologies (from the Software PAT; commercial multimedia systems).<BR>
	In addition to being Dean of Research and a Prof in the Physics Dept (Physics Dept research is concentrated in optics and  condensed matter physics, with activity in computation physics and radioactivity), John Hegarty heads the TCD research centre of Optronics Ireland.  This centre does basic through applied research in physics and applications of laser diodes, high speed nonlinear and electrooptic properties of semiconductor quantum wells, high speed optical switching, optoelectronic computing, microcavity LED physics and blue light emission from II-VI laser media.  <P>

<B>5.  University College Galway</B><BR>
UCG opened in 1849.  It has faculties of arts, Celtic Studies, commerce, engineering, medicine and science.  UCG has some 800 staff and over 6500 students.  Like TCD, it relies heavily on the EU for research support and has a variety of active innovation and commercial/industrial liaison ventures.  It is however part of the national university system and therefore doesnt have quite the degree of autonomy as TCD.  I visited the new Martin Ryan Marine Science Institute and the Manufacturing Research Center, and heard also about the National Diagnostics Centre (NDC)of Bioresearch Ireland.<BR>
	The NDC is directed by Prof. James Houghton.  Its themes are DNA diagnostics, molecular biology (especially genetics of salmon and shellfish), immunodiagnostrics, aquatic veterinary services, and genetic services (including a complete equine fertility management system).  This is a large and active PAT centre, with about 50 staff that are active in both research and providing services and consultation to industry and farmers.  Their dedicated facility was constructed with the help EU infrastructure funds, and their external (non-federal) funding is about 85% of annual turnover.  They have a US Army contract on recognition of pathogenic microorganisms.<BR>
	Prof. Brendan Keegan is current Director of the Martin Ryan Marine Science Institute (MRI).  MRIs dedicated, modern 2800m2 teaching and research building was funded by a grant from the Martin Ryan University Foundation and matching support from ECs STRIDE.  It enabled UCG to bring together the marine interests of the Departments of Botany, Microbiology, Oceanography (fully housed in MRI and headed by Prof Michael Orren, a chemical oceanographer), Physics and Zoology, which are reinforced by participants from Applied Geophysics, Biochemistry, Geology and Engineering.  Galway has ready access to the shelf and deep ocean, and a wide range of habitats, most still in near-pristine condition.  MRI operates its own research vessel, the recently refurbished trawler 45 r.v. Conamara.  It offers a Marine Science BS with an intake of about 20/year, and has over 50 graduate students and 8 postdocs (in addition to the 9 academics and 16 research assistants) .  There are two field stations, one at Mast Head (see below) for meteorology and the Shellfish Research Lab at Carna (aquaculture support, including restocking lobster, and developing abalone and sea urchin industries).<BR>
	MRI faculty and staff do about 1M of contract research per year.  Topics include marine algae, microbiology, estuarine and marine zoology, and physical and chemical oceanography (trace metals).  A "limited by guarantee" company, Marine Resources International, Ltd. (MRI Ltd), is wholly owned by the University to deal directly with private sector enterprise; and Marine Research (Ireland) Consultants provides a "one-stop-shop" consortium of MRI/UCG personnel together with specialists from 10 private companies for marine and estuarine environmental assessments and similar services.  MRI also helped form and now houses the Irish Seaweed Industry Organization that is helping some 17 SMEs expand their business and improve the quality and consistency or their products.  Other initiatives include a spin-off SME (Sea Sense ltd), calibration and analytical services, and a range of joint projects to stimulate Irish marine industry.<BR>
	Atmospheric research, considered part of MRIs activities, is conducted by three members of the Department of Experimental Physics (Profs Tom OConnor, Egan ORodaighe, and Jerald Jennings who briefed me).  Their principal expertise is in trace gases, aerosols, and cloud physics.  In 1986 their field station at Mace Head became one of the five global sites for the Global Atmospheric Gases Experiment (GAGE).  Mast Head now boasts very well equipped labs and a 20m sampling tower; the site has a 120 clean sector of open access to the Atlantic, making it ideal for background aerosol and trace gas measurements.  <BR>
	The UCG Manufacturing Research Center, much like MRI, is an umbrella organization to coordinate the variety of individual manufacturing research units from several departments: Computer Integrated Manufacturing Research Unit (CIMRU, see below); Thermal Engineering Research Unit, Composite Research Unit (CRU, see below), Digital Signal Processing Research Unit, Aerospace Research Unit (see below), National Centre for Laser Applications, Power Electronics Research Centre, and Sensor Applications Research Unit.  <BR>
	Prof John Eaton directs the 10 member Aerospace Research Unit.  Their work is principally in fluid dynamics, particularly active laminar flow control, prediction of wing tip vortices, flow field mapping at very high resolution, and prediction of acoustic fields for arbitrary shapes and multiple sources.  This units work is all EC funded, and they collaborate with over 120 different EU organizations.<BR>
	Prof Conchur OBraidaigh Directs CRU, which won first-round NICOP support for a project with NSWC, NRL and the University of Delaware to integrate fabric reinforced thermoplastics into the Glass Mat Thermoplastic (GMT) molding process.  In addition to Prof OBraidaigh, CRU has 2 Associate Directors and 125 full time research assistants who are working on MEngScs and PhDs.  Their research is in the areas of polymeric and metal matrix composites, heat transfer, and the design and analysis of offshore structures.<BR>
	CIMRU, directed by Prof Jim Brown (I was briefed by Dr David OSullivan, College Lecturer and Research Manager), has a staff of about 35 and an annual turnover of ~250K.  Its strengths are in logistics and production planning control (production management systems), bench marking and strategic planning, quality assurance, and business process reengineering.  Like the others, it is largely EU supported and has strong collaborations throughout Europe. <P>

This section is more extensive than in many of these reports, representing the efforts of Irish researchers to make their abilities known nationally and internationally.  Two basic sources include:
The Irish Scientist Yearbook, published by SAMTOM Limited, 17 Pine Lawn, Newtownpark Ave, Blackrock, County Dublin, editor Dr Charles Mollan; (+353-1)-298-6186 fax -7970, email cmol@iol.ie.  PATs, organizations, and individual entrepreneurs "advertise" in this glossy document, and it gives a good overview of the range of Irish S&T interests.<BR>
A Summary Directory of Research and Development Expertise in Science and Technology in Universities in Ireland was prepared by the Industrial Liaison Offices of the seven University Colleges in the Republic of Ireland.  It gives contact names and numbers, a list of specialist centers in the Universities, and an alphabetical list of 2500 areas of expertise where University researchers are willing to wqork with industry, keyed by College.

<B>1.  Summary</B><BR>
	<DD>The US Department of Defense has been tasked by both Congress and the President to rationalize the RDT&E infrastructure of its Military Departments.  A well accepted process in responding to such challenges is benchmarking.  The UK, for over 16 years, has been implementing a policy of public devolvement and rationalization.  In the expectation that we have something to learn from their experience, a DoD delegation spent a week visiting with those involved.  The delegation focused on the Defence Evaluation and Research Agency of the Ministry of Defense, but also looked at civil Public Sector Research Establishments because in both countries security relies on the total national intellectual infrastructure.  This report tries to depict what we learned: not just the rationalization process and its results, but the national policy environment that both inspired and enabled the very remarkable changes that have been accomplished.  The report should be worth reading for those involved with the DoD process, if only as background for further assessment of our options.<P>

<B>2. Motivation for Visit and Report</B><BR>
	<DD>The US government has undertaken many initiatives to improve the effectiveness of federal agencies and their political and civil service employees.  While there have been improvements, some practices and organizations have been tough to crack.  A case in point occurred during DoDs 1995 Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC 95) process.  In spite of explicit direction by the Secretary to the Military Departments to take advantage of opportunities for cross-service integration while reducing lab and test and evaluation (T&E) infrastructure in BRAC 95, virtually no cross-servicing resulted.<BR>
	<DD>Subsequently, DoD received both Presidential and Congressional direction to reevaluate opportunities for better utilization of its lab and T&E infrastructure.  DoD responded with a plan entitled <I>Vision 21</I>,  which "will rest on three implementing and integrating pillars: <B>Reduction</B>, <B>Restructuring</B> (intra-service and cross-service) and <B>Revitalization</B> to attain a modern, efficient and effective laboratory and T&E environment with focus on the costs of facilities and infrastructure"<I><A HREF="cdnews9.htm#1">(1)</A></I> .<BR>
	<DD>As part of its process, the Vision 21 Study Team is conducting case studies of reduction, restructuring and revitalization by other organizations.  The UK Ministry of Defenses (MOD) Defense Evaluation and Research Agency (DERA) has a reputation for having successfully accomplished a major change<I><A HREF="cdnews9.htm#2">(2)</A></I> , so a contingent of the Study Team (Appendix A) visited the UK during the week of 6 October 1996 to learn in more detail about DERAs experience<I><A HREF="cdnews9.htm#3">(3)</A></I> . The DoD group also visited the UK Office of Science and Technology (OST) of the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI), and the Southampton Oceanography Center (SOC), to learn about similar change in the civil sector (Itinerary @ Appendix B).<BR>
	<DD>The author helped coordinate the visit, and accompanied the DoD delegation.  This report is based on the weeks discussions. It provides background information about lab/T&E restructuring actions in the UK.  Although it includes some discussion of the differences between US and UK situations, it is solely the responsibility of the Vision 21 Team to determine which if any portions of the UK experience are relevant to their task.<P>

<B>3.  Background: The Policy Setting for Change</B><BR>
	<DD>DERA is a drastically, indeed fundamentally different organization than the establishments it has replaced.  It continues to change.  When asked "whats next", its Chief Executive John Chisholm stated that he had never run an organization that hadnt changed at least yearly.  SOC likewise is a vastly different organization than its major predecessor, IOC Wormley.  It too is planned to evolve.  To understand the nature and degree of such continuous change in UK labs both past and future, its necessary to consider the environment than has not just enabled but inspired it.<BR>
	<DD>The restructuring process described here began with the 1979 change of government, when the Conservatives gained a majority and Lady Margaret Thatcher became Prime Minister.  The process has continued with essentially the same philosophy under Mr. John Major, who replaced Lady Thatcher as PM in 1990.  Summarized oversimplistically, that philosophy is that public sector enterprises work poorly and private sector ones work well; and that "civil servants are sulky and risk averse" (to quote one or our speakers).  Thus, the public sector needs to operate much more like the private sector.  Simplistic as this may be, it has been and remains consistently and thoroughly applied, to all government sectors and activities.  For example in the ongoing "Prior Options" reviews of civil sector research labs the choices are, in clear priority order, 1) for the public sector to stop performing the service altogether and abolish the agency performing it; 2) to the degree the service must be provided, to privatize it; 3) where this is not feasible, to contract out as much of the activity as possible; and then and only then, 4) to improve the efficiency of the inescapable minimum that the government must retain.<BR>
	<DD>Although in retrospect the social and structural changes introduced over the last 16 years of Tory rule have been sweeping, the process took much time, was orchestrated in a series of paced steps, and in some cases suffered failures or setbacks that required reassessment and several tries to get it right.  And as in the US, some sectors have been more successful than others in resisting change, while others have embraced it.<BR>
	<DD>Perhaps the first major Tory impact directly on the Civil Service came in 1982, with the Financial Management Initiative.  FMI had the intent of placing responsibility on individuals, and giving them the means to carry it out.  It introduced two new "systems".  A Top Management System forced managers at all levels to take clear decisions regarding the direction of activities in a department by translating strategic objectives down through line management as personal objectives.  A parallel Budgeting System delegated financial responsibility to specified levels of authority in the hierarchy, giving managers some control over how they spent their allocated funds.  These two systems were accompanied by manpower cuts (20% reduction of civil service between 1979 and 1987), and introduction of controls on running costs in 1985-86.  Manpower controls were lifted in favor of cost controls in 1988.<BR>
	<DD>A scrutiny of progress in 1988 found that changes since 79 had "been important in beginning to shift the focus of attention away from process and toward results...the new systems are demonstrating how far attitudes and institutions have to change if the real benefits of management reforms, in the form of improvement in the way government delivers its services, are to come through...radical change in the freedom to manage is needed urgently if substantially better results are to be achieved."<I><A HREF="cdnews9.htm#4">(4)</A></I>   In essence, change brought about by FMI was merely procedural, not cultural.  <BR>
	<DD>The report of this scrutiny, <I>Improving Management in Government: The Next Steps</I>, identified 5 main issues: lack of clear and accountable management responsibility and the confidence that goes with it; need for greater precision about expected results of people and organizations; need to focus attention on outputs; the handicap of a uniform system in an organization the size and diversity of the Civil Service; and the need for sustained pressure for improvement.  Three priorities to begin the process of change were established.  These apply equally to all aspects of government:
<UL>
<LI>organize the work of each department to <U>focus on the job to be done</U>: systems and structures must enhance the effective delivery of <B>policies and services</B>; 
<LI>department management must ensure their staff have <U>relevant experience and skills</U> to do the tasks required by effective government; and 
<LI>real and sustained <U>pressure for continuous improvement</U> in the value for money obtained in the delivery of <B>policies and services</B>.
</UL>
	<DD>It is worth considering the findings and recommen-dations of this seminal report in some detail, since they are central to the make-up and operations of DERA (DERA is a "New Steps Agency within Government"<I><A HREF="cdnews9.htm#5">(5)</A></I> ) and other research labs, and to their core feature of continuous improvement and change.  They also constitute some of the more important findings for the US DoD delegation to consider, for they establish the policy framework and political consensus without which DERAs organizational, philosophical, and operational changes could not have occurred.<BR>
	<DD>The basis for structural change, as stated repeatedly in the Next Steps priorities, is that government departments have two quite separate functions: <B>policy and service</B>: "Departments have two main functions - ministerial support including policy development and evaluation, and managing or influencing the delivery of government service"<I><A HREF="cdnews9.htm#6">(6)</A></I> . The skills for these two very different tasks, and the nature of the organizations that perform them, likewise should be differentiated and separated.  Traditionally Departments focus on policy, to the detriment of service.  If the functions are properly separated and managed they can both be performed better.  "Clearly, Ministers have to be wholly responsible for policy"(para 23).  However, they neither can nor should have the detailed knowledge about daily operations needed to execute such policy.<BR>
	<DD>Therefore, "We recommend that <B>agencies</B> should be established to carry out the executive functions of government within a policy and resources framework set by a department"(para 19).  Here the term <B>agency</B> means any executive unit that delivers a service for government, whether it is part of public service or outside government<I><A HREF="cdnews9.htm#7">(7)</A></I> .<BR>
	<DD>There are a couple key aspects of implementation that make this approach work.  The first is, "the choice and definition of suitable agencies is primarily for Ministers and senior management to decide"(para19).  Agencies can be in or out of government, closely tied to or at arms length from the department, large or small; whatever works.  The second is the concept of a <B>framework</B>, which is a formal written understanding, negotiated between the agency and the Department, that spells out in detail how the agency is to operate. An agency's Framework Document "sets out the policy, budget, specific targets and the results to be achieved.  It must also specify how politically sensitive issues are to be dealt with and the extent of the delegated authority of management.  The management of the agency must be held rigorously to account by their department for the results they achieve" (para 20).  Frameworks are updated as part of formal annual reviews, or when changes in agency constitution and missions occur (e.g., DERA operates under the third edition of its Framework: the first was negotiated when it was established as DRA in 1991; the second when it became a "Trading Fund" in 1993; and the third when it was assigned other functions and became DERA in 1995).<BR>
	<DD>The Next Steps first priority is to "focus on the job to be done": "The main strategic control must lie with the Minister and Permanent Secretary.  But once the policy objectives and budgets within the framework are set, the management of the agency should then have as much independence as possible in deciding how those objectives are met...provided management is operating within the strategic direction set by Ministers, it must be left as free as possible to manage within that framework" (para 21).<BR>
	<DD>Because this represented a very new way of doing the governments business, "The Next Steps" dwells at length on shared responsibility for the service function, particularly in terms of accountability to Ministers and Parliament on operational matters.  Some quotes are appropriate: "...when individuals had to answer personally to Parliament, their sense of personal responsibility was strengthened...if the concept of agencies developed in this report is to succeed, some extension of this pattern of accountability is likely to be necessary.   The precise form of accountability for each agency would need to be established as part of drawing up the framework...It is axiomatic that Ministers should remain fully and clearly accountable for policy.  For agencies which are government departments or parts of departments ultimate accountability for operations must also remain with Ministers.  What is needed is the establishment of a convention that heads of executive agencies would have delegated authority from their ministers for operations of the agencies within the framework of policy directives and resource allocations prescribed by ministers (indeed, as described below in more detail, the DERA Chief Executive has a personal letter of authority from his Permanent Undersecretary, that supplements the agency Framework).  Heads of agencies would be accountable to Ministers for the operations of their agencies, but could be called...to give evidence to Select Committees as to the manner in which their delegated authority had been used and their functions discharged within that authority."  <BR>
	<DD>Agency Chief Executives are held fully responsible for the day to day decisions involving the public services they provide.  This is not a new concept either in the UK or the US; the departure from the past is mutual acceptance by Parliament, the Ministers, and agency heads that operations will be conducted in accordance with the framework, and that the managers are fully free to manage as they and only they deem best within its policy and fiscal guidelines.<BR>
	<DD>Once the job is defined and properly organized, the objective must be to provide appropriate skills to do it, within an environment of sustained improvement.  The Next Steps emphasizes that the managerial skills to run agencies and deliver services are not those traditionally rewarded or developed in government; "hitherto relatively few civil servants will have had an opportunity to learn or exhibit these skills" (para 35). Training, secondment, promotion of younger people and skill importation would be needed both to get started correctly, and to built the skills needed in the new culture (this will be clearly apparent in DERA, as discussed below).  And finally, there must be pressure from the top, starting with the Prime Minister and Head of Civil Service, "sustained by understanding and support from Parliament" (para 38), for continuous improvement; but "The Civil Service must own the changes as they evolve"(para 39).<BR>
	<DD>In summary, "The aim should be to establish a quite different way of conducting the business of government.  The central Civil Service should consist of a relatively small core engaged in the function of servicing Ministers and managing departments, who will be the sponsors of particular government policies and services.  Responding to these departments will be a range of agencies employing their own staff, who may or may not have the status of Crown servants, and concentrating on the delivery of their particular service, with clearly defined responsibility between the Secretary of State and the Permanent Secretary on one hand and the Chairman or Chief Executive of the agencies on the other.  Both Departments and their agencies should have a more open and simplified structure"(para 44).<BR>
	<DD>One of the interesting aspects of this policy is that it works, well and widely.  It has led to a great range of innovative solutions to providing services, from literally floating government establishments on the stock market, to abolishing them, selling them (sometimes with a negative price), mingling them with other institutions, and completely reducing, restructuring and revitalizing them.  There has of course been some pain in the change; but the overall result has been dramatically improved quality, responsiveness, and facilities, at much reduced cost.<BR>
	<DD>"The Next Steps" have played out in many different ways in many different sectors.  From driving licenses to prisons, from trains to agriculture, the face of British public service has changed irreversibly.  The DoD contingent examined this process in some detail for two examples: DERA for Defense RDT&E (the closest parallel to the problem they are grappling with in the US), and civil sector research labs, which in both countries form a significant part of the national intellectual infrastructure which must be efficiently harnessed in the interests of national security.<BR>
	<DD>This paper first will discuss the MOD experience, then describe the civil sector process and its impact on some institutions of interest to DRA's Sea Sector.  When looking for useful models for the US situation in these cases it is essential to recall that all the changes, in both military and civil sectors, have been fully consistent with the prevailing political philosophy and have had the strong backing of both Parliament and the Ministers.  Political consensus and policy direction are essential stimulants to the cultural change of large government organizations.<P>

<B>4.  The MOD Experience: Defence Evaluation and Research 
Agency (DERA)</B><P>

	<B>a. General Description: What is it?</B><BR>
	<DD>DERA today "brings together in one agency the core of the Ministry of Defenses non-nuclear scientific and technical assets.  Launched (in its present form) in April 1995, and forming the largest single research organization of its kind in Western Europe, DERA offers a unique range of services, from the highest level of operational studies and analyses, through the various categories of basic and applied research, to consultancy-type advice on the procurement process and the test and evaluation of specific equipment, in both the development phase and during actual operations"<I><A HREF="cdnews9.htm#8">(8)</A></I> .  DERA "is a Next Steps Agency within government, established ... to operate as a Trading Fund.  It is owned by the Secretary of State for Defense.  It is required to operate in a commercial manner with predetermined performance targets, and is financed by income earned from its customers"<I><A HREF="cdnews9.htm#9">(9)</A></I> .  Its annual turnover (95/96) is just over 1B (90% from MOD customers), and its staff numbers around 14,400.<I><A HREF="cdnews9.htm#10">(10)</A></I> <BR>
	<DD>The defining feature of the Agency is that it operates as a <B>Trading Fund</B>.  A Trading Fund obtains all of its income from customers and must meet all of its costs, including salaries, out of income earned.  DERA is like a private company in that it owns its own property (or rents it), pays for all externally provided services (including all costs of any military personnel assigned to it; and it pays Value Added Tax or VAT), charges for all the services it provides (its prices include VAT), and prepares its accounts on an accrual basis.  The Chief Executive has significant (but not total) management freedom to control costs and set corporate strategy; responsibilities and accountability are set out in the Framework Document and in a delegation letter to the Chief Executive from the Permanent Undersecretary.  The Trading Fund (but not its government customers) is free from annuallity; and within the fund, money is simply money, i.e. there are no restrictions into categories.  Performance targets are set by the Minister and include items such as Return on Capital Employed and rates.  The customers control the money and state requirements, DERA costs and proposes activities, the customers prioritize spending, and DERA responds to their choice.  DERA then performs to contract.<BR>
	<DD>DERAs mission ("Aim") is to "provide independent, high quality, efficient and cost-effective S&T services to its customers"<I><A HREF="cdnews9.htm#11">(11)</A></I> ..  Because its primary product is advice, internal metrics and modes of operation are similar to those of a consulting company.  DERA exists primarily to serve MOD customers, but it is encouraged to seek work on commercial terms with other Government departments, with industry, and with other Governments, and to exploit the wealth-creation potential of the capabilities and facilities required for defense purposes<I><A HREF="cdnews9.htm#12">(12)</A></I>.<BR>
	<DD>DERA has four operational or product Divisions (POCs are listed in Paragraph 6, Contacts): the Defense Research Agency (DRA, 683M 95/96 Budget, 6793 persons. DRA in turn has seven sectors, described further below), the Defense Test and Evaluation Organization (DTEO, 281M, 3575 staff), Protection and Life Sciences Division (PLSD, 100, 1203 staff), and the Center for Defence Analysis (CDA, 68M, 676 staff).  There is also a Support Services Division (22M, 1802) which is in the process of privatization, a Central staff (17M, 153), and some smaller units (17M, 212).<BR>
	<DD>DERA in its current form really started with the establishment of the Defense Research Agency, DRA, in 1991.  Most of DERAs policies and procedures therefore were developed to manage the S&T remit of DRA.  The other components were added at the start of last fiscal year, 1 April 1995.  They thus have not changed as drastically as have the DRA sectors, but the process will be faster for them since there is now a model and a corporate culture within which they must fit.  Most of the discussion below centers around the DRA experience, since most of the lessons-learned stem from its evolution. <BR>
	<DD>Because the rationale for the DoD visit was to look at aspects of the change process that might provide lessons for Visions 21, it is worth mentioning at this point a few of the basic differences between UK and US systems, and DERA and DoD lab/Center functions, at this point (others will come out during the discussion that follows). <BR>
	<DD>First, Parliament exercises much less direct control over the details of defense spending than does the US Congress.  As opposed to our thousands of line items, funding is allocated to MOD in three basic lumps: salaries, capital, and everything else.  Thus how much gets spent on S&T, training, operations, procurement of specific items, etc, is up to the Ministry.  There are budget battles, of course, but by and large they occur within the Ministry.  The Ministry also is free to reorganize as it sees fit to perform its function, i.e., it can form agencies and change them<I><A HREF="cdnews9.htm#13">(13)</A></I> .  There is also a considerable degree less "local" pressure exerted by MPs than by US Representatives and Senators; they can ask questions and bring pressure to bear on Ministers, but not to the same extent as in the US.<BR>
	<DD>Second, MOD is truly "Purple" when it comes to requirements and acquisition.  Thus DERAs customer is MOD, not the individual services.  The specific customers for its work packages are in the three main sectors of the MOD: The Deputy Chief of Defense Staff (Systems) (DCDS(S)) under the VCDS; the Chief Scientific Advisor (CSA) under the Permanent Undersecretary; and the various Program Directors under the Chief of Defense Procurement (CDP).  And the Chief Executive is personally responsible directly to the Secretary of State for Defense, who is both owner and customer, for the effective and efficient management of the Agency and for achieving its aim, objectives, and targets.  <BR>
	<DD>Third, DERAs work differs substantially from that performed by DoD Laboratories and Centers.  MOD has no charter for fundamental research; that is managed by the Research Councils, through their institutes and the universities.  Further, virtually all engineering development and in-service engineering is performed by industry and through the services.  Thus DRAs job (and PLSDs in its sphere) is to develop or acquire military technology, advise MOD on its use, and transfer it to the industry that designs and builds the systems.  It essentially does only what would be termed 6.2 and 6.3 in the US.  DoD labs and centers in contrast provide full life-cycle support (6.1 through 6.6 plus ISE) to their Services (albeit differently in each Service).  DTEOs remit is to provide the facilities and services required by the Armed Forces and industry to support development, pre-production, and in-service proving phases.  In this sense it is somewhat parallel to the DoD Major Range and Test Facility Base, but with less interface with DRA than the MRTFB has with DoD labs simply because of DRAs focus on the early aspects of S&T, vice in depth involvement with weapon systems per se.<BR>
	<DD>Finally, of course, DERA as a Trading Fund has a fundamentally different relationship to MOD than the DoD labs to their Military Departments.  DERA is a contractor and must make a profit, albeit a with a trusted partner arrangement with its owner-customer.  And DERA as an Agency has a broader mandate to work for and with other customers, and much more control over its facilities and processes, within the bounds of its Framework Document.  It can work for other customers, indeed for other countries, and retain commercial profits in its venture capital fund.  It can buy or dispose of property, invest and earn interest, reorganize, reskill, and grow or shrink as the market demands.  As noted above, money once inside is simply money; DERA is not annualized, and its financial procedures and accounting systems bear no resemblance to those of its owner.  It is precisely these differences that are of most interest to the current study, but they must be considered with full recognition of the other fundamental differences between national governments, departmental charters, and assigned tasks.<P>

	<B>b.  Establishment and Evolution of DERA: How and why did it get to be this way?</B><BR>
	<DD>The dictates of "The Next Steps" are obviously a considerable deviation from traditional military Chain of Command mentality.  Not surprisingly MOD initially had difficulty understanding the concepts of agencies and frameworks, customer-supplier relationships, etc., and their applicability to Defence.  In considering how to respond to this initiative of the Prime Minister, however, it turned out that there was, in the works of one of our speakers, one "juicy candidate" for drastic reform: research.<BR>
	<DD>Research at the time was the province of the four Defence Research Establishments:  the Royal Aerospace Establishment (RAE, Air Force), Royal Armaments R&D Establishment (RARDE, Army), Admiralty Research Establishment (ARE, Navy), and Royal Signals and Radar Establishment (RSRE).  Over the years their role had devolved from that of arsenals, i.e. research, engineering and production, to research only; but their infrastructure and attitudes had not shifted accordingly.  As DCDS(S) VADM John Dunt put it, there were some who thought the Armed Forces existed to support the DREs.  They were perceived as baronial fiefdoms, financial black holes, that had no sense of responsiveness to the customer.  Their budgets were based on their view of their needs to do what they wanted.  And as Defence funding dropped at the end of the Cold War, they were rapidly becoming unaffordable.<BR>
	<DD>In early 1989, after considerable discussion and study, MOD made the decision to combine the DREs into a Next Steps Agency.  There was pressure from the Prime Minister and others to privatize the agency, but MOD argued successfully that it needed an independent "trusted advisor", and ultimately the government opted for a Trading Fund agency owned by the MOD.  Nigel Hughes, Director of RSRE, was made Chief Executive Designate, and David Tyte was assigned as Technical Director and charged first to determine what went into the new agency, and then to achieve technical rationalization among the establishments. (Tyte states the first was easy, the second impossible under the conditions).<BR>
	<DD>Although the new Agency stood up as DRA on 1 April 1991, it was soon apparent that in fact little had changed, nor was likely to. The DRE Directors were all still very powerful.  Hughes had no real authority and was expected to continue to work through normal MOD procedures, which meant that he got stopped at every turn by vast numbers of people who thought they were in charge of one or another aspect or the operation.  By mid-91 it was apparent that something more radical was necessary, and that the magnitude of change needed could not be brought about by an insider.<BR>
	<DD>The real change process thus began with the selection, through open competition, of an "outsider" from industry to take charge of the new agency, and the negotiation with him of the terms and conditions for his position.  John Chisholm, the new Chief Executive appointed in September 1991, had a history of change management in industry.  As important as his experience, however, were the terms under which he agreed to take the post.  First, he reported directly to the Minister (who selected him), eliminating all layers and naysayers.  Through both the Framework and his personal letter of delegation, he had clear and unquestioned authority to run the Agency as he saw fit; he was not constrained by consensus.  There was a clear understanding that he was to transform the agency and run it as a Trading Fund that would remain in MOD.  And as Chisholm himself notes, the most important condition (but the hardest to negotiate), was that he was allowed to choose his own team.<BR>
	<DD>On Friday 13 September 1991, Chisholm assembled 76 top DRA employees to a closed door meeting, announced his team, and sent the remaining third of them back to MOD.  He made it clear from the start who was in charge, and that change for sure was going to happen (Pick a fight and win it).<BR>
	<DD>The immediate task was to make the new organization financially viable.  Many in MOD expected it to fail, and were clearly willing to live without it.  At best, as a Trading Fund it would have to compete with industry for its work, and the Defence research budget was declining rapidly.  Noncompetitive elements would simply go out of business.  As Chisholm says, to motivate change you need a crisis - real or manufactured.  For DRA, the crisis was that "they took the money away".  <BR>
	<DD>To effectively and quickly turn a proud old civil service organization into a competitive modern company requires change not only of culture, but of almost all business processes.  An accrual based financial system had to be developed, and managers had to be trained how to control true costs, not just cash flow.  MOD had to learn to act like a customer, and to not get what it wouldnt pay for.  A new pay for performance approach was needed to motivate staff to achieve targets.  The "learned helplessness" of the civil service had to be defeated.  There was to be no new money to effect the changes. And, Chisholm concluded after analysis, to make DRA a viable Trading Fund he had to take 90M per year (60%) out of running costs, while still producing quality technical product for the customer.  He planned to take the full reduction out of support infrastructure without hitting scientific capability.<BR>
	<DD>I will discuss some of the processes and the new procedures which appear to be relevant to the US situation in more detail below.  But in outline form, the major moves imposed by Chisholm and his team were as follows:
<UL>
<LI>The old Establishment structure was abolished, both to break down historic loyalties and to permit the new organization to develop along business lines.  DRA was reformed into seven sectors.  Three are environmental (Sea, Air, and Land), retaining the necessary specialties demanded by the different platforms and keeping ties to traditional customers.  Two sectors, Weapon Systems and Command and Information Systems, support the environmental sectors directly, and two others - the Structural Materials Centre and Electronics - provide enabling military technologies.
<LI>Each Sector was tasked to function as a "profit-making" business, with metrics for Key Targets.  All the metrics and Targets were on finance and efficiency.  Forcing the Sectors, and within them Profit Centers, to figure out how to survive motivated cultural change.  Subsequently, ideas on how to improve efficiency bubbled up.  
<LI>Financial managers were hired from industry (civil service accountants simply could not adapt to commercial practices) and an accrual-based commercial accounting system was imposed.  Managers were trained to think in the new terms, and DRA "practiced" trading starting in April 1992, getting a years experience before it officially became a Trading Fund on 1 April 1993.  Because DRA would become the owner of its land at that point, a process called "Business Use Valuation" was established to put a manageable value (i.e. one that wouldnt too adversely affect rates) <I>(John Chisholm comment: not correct; Represent the real cost of investments; a rational provider would not reinvest in the same asset)</I> on assets that, while they existed and were being used, would not meet strict investment appraisal rules were they to come up for replacement.
<LI>Personnel reductions concentrated on support staff.  Essentially no scientists were riffed (of course many opted out) in the drawdown from around 12000 to about 8500 employees.  Of the 90M per year reduction required to make DRA viable as a Trading Fund, 60M came from rationalizing (eliminating and consolidating) support staff (e.g., all the workshops were closed).  The added redundancy costs (some 50M) of "managed exits" were handled centrally, to relieve the sectors from adverse impact on their financial targets.  A "pay for worth" system of set objectives and measured performance was established; managers are judged (and paid) on their performance to targets, and the targets are raised each year.
<LI>MOD agreed to let DRA identify which sites (there were 54 at the start) it wanted to "own" when it started trading, and to keep all property DRA did not want to retain (DRA would pay rent on property to be vacated in less than five years).  David Tyte, who through long experience but especially through his work with Nigel Hughes was very familiar with the entire organization, was appointed Director of Rationalization.  Tyte developed multiple options for each site; the goal was to identify the closures and moves needed to generate the additional 30M per year infrastructure running cost savings required to make the organization viable.  These were ordered in terms of "best buys".  The cost of new construction to facilitate the consolidation (14 sites were vacated and many others changed considerably) was approximately 200M (+VAT).  The Minister  agreed to provide DRA these funds from the 10-year rolling capital improvement budget of the old DREs.  I.e., it effectively cost the customer "nothing" but what he would have paid anyway for capital improvements under the old system; the money just was provided up-front, and DERA was permitted to employ it as it saw fit, rather than following the old bottoms-up plans.  DRA now has 3 Core sites (Malvern, Ft Halstead and Farnborough - the beautiful new facility there opened just days before our visit), 6 "Specific Business Sites", 3 Convenience Sites, and 23 Facility sites.  Site rationalization will be a central issue for Visions 21, so more details as provided by David Tyte are at Appendix C.
<LI>DRA took a loan from the Treasury of 450M to cover its first 6 months of trading (i.e., to cover operations until invoices could be submitted and paid and income could be accrued).  It is required to generate "profit" to pay off the 25-year loan and the 6% interest; the profit comes from the 7% fee on its "contracts", as well as efficiency improvements over target.
</UL>
	<DD>Not everything went smoothly, of course.  Considerable hurt was involved in changing the attitudes of civil servants who had dedicated their lives to the Forces and had, after all, excellent technical reputations.  The initial accounting system proved too fancy and had to be replaced.  Much effort was expended in "process" studies and analyses, not all of it productive.  Communication to the far flung staff proved difficult and imperfect.  And the very tight focus on efficiency and conversion inevitably detracted from "softer" improvements.  But at the bottom line, where it mattered the most, the changes had the intended effect.  DRA not only survived but surpassed its targets, to the considerable surprise of many in MOD.<BR>
	<DD>DRA officially became a Trading Fund as planned on 1 April 1993.  Over the next two years it continued to improve its efficiency, and evolved in its relationships with both customers and industry.  Perhaps the best indicator of its success was the decision to add other organizations to it, in lieu of setting them up as independent agencies.  The former Chemical and Biological Defence Establishment, the Defence Operational Analysis Centre, and the Directorate General of Test and Evaluation were thus joined with DRA to form DERA on 1 April 1995.  They have now completed the transition into trading and have adopted DRA practices and procedures, and the question for the future is how to further rationalize the total organization.<P>

	<B>c.  Managing the Changes</B><BR>
	<DD>As noted earlier, the concept of continuous improvement is the third basic priority of The Next Steps.  DRA, and new DERA, use a Total Quality construct to guide their continuous improvement process, and employ a cyclical management approach of Planning (coupled to communication), Devising Processes (followed by building systems), and Measurement (with resulting rewards).  John Mabberley, Managing Director of DRA and a key mover in the entire restructuring process, uses a viewgraph that says:
<UL>
<LI>learned helplessness in the civil service can be defeated - give managers down through the organization the right freedom and incentives
<LI>being exposed to business failure provides a reason to manage properly; it becomes a habit
<LI>objective is to manage tasks through efficient value-added processes rather than mindless bureaucratic procedures
<LI>support changes in process with proper systems
<LI>measure and measure ... and measure again
</UL>
	<DD>DRA views its changes as taking place in phases. The initial phase (Total Quality 1 or TQ1) was what Chisholm imposed at the onset to make the organization viable in the short term.  The focus was on what had to be put right to survive.  It was characterized by an attitude of crisis, and was totally command driven.  The priority was first to change processes, followed by communications and training. Consensus was immaterial, "softer" issues delayed.  <BR>
	<DD>The first corporate plan had just three priorities: efficiency, customers, and total quality (ISO 9001 certification and pursuit of the European Quality Award).  Metrics were all focused on finance and efficiency.  Key efficiency metrics were (and still are) Utilization (% of direct staff paid hours delivered to customers; 70% for DRA and 59% for DERA as an entity for 95/6), teeth-to-tail (ratio of direct staff doing work for customers to indirect staff), mark-up (proportional increase between salary cost of direct effort and price charged for that effort, now about +1.74), and rates.  These metrics exert strong discipline on management, and have had the effect of rapidly exposing costs and driving them down.  In 2 years, running costs went from over 220M to under 100M, far exceeding the 90M Chisholm calculated was essential for survival.<BR>
	<DD>The cost reductions let the organization exceed its performance against budget, thus its forecast profits and targeted Return on Capital Employed (ROCE; for 95/6, profit was 33M ahead of budget due to higher than expected income coupled with faster reduction in costs, yielding 9.2% ROCE vs a target of 4.7%). DRA proudly displays its statistics in any of the efficiency and finance meetrics, as well the significant improvement in milestone delivery, performance against annual plans, and satisfaction of its customers (from annual surveys conducted since 1991)<I><A HREF="cdnews9.htm#14">(14)</A></I>.  <BR>
	<DD>The discipline of the metrics - and their tie to senior managers performance contracts - has motivated DRAs sectors, and now the other DERA organizations, to maximize the work for their customers and minimize costs.  The managers we talked to all were keenly aware of their metrics (particularly utilization) and clearly viewed their job as running their sectors as profitable businesses.  And the customers we talked to at MOD - the Chief Scientific Advisor Sir David Davies, DCDS(S) VADM John Dunt, and Director of Corporate Research Mike Markin, all expressed satisfaction with DERA performance and appreciation for the effectiveness of the basic customer-supplier relationship that has developed in such a short period.  They had concerns, but not with the way the business was run internally, with DERA as their key technical performer and advisor, or with DERAs competitiveness.  For DRA at least, "TQ1" has established a firm foundation and a financially viable organization.<BR>
	<DD>DRA is now well into its second change phase, TQ2 (DTEOs programme is termed DTEO 2000, reflecting its later start and the need for additional rationalization).  To be lasting, the changes from the crisis period have to involve the entire staff and be based on a shared vision of the future.  The focus is on effectiveness, on "what we want to be" vice "what we have to do".  Mabberley notes that this phase addresses the "softer" issues with common objectives, behavior and values.  It is based on consensus, not command.  It will be implemented by small teams, not imposed from headquarters.  It addresses a few easily agreed-upon themes, and should result in long term changes.  Like TQ1 however it involves much measurement, and the metrics will continue to include at the top those of finance and efficiency.  <BR>
	<DD>For TQ2, DRA sectors have identified four major themes: Customers, People, Science, and Business.  Each theme has a "sponsor", who is either a Sector Director or a senior manager, and a full time manager.  For each theme there are goals (a total of 14).  Focus groups have identified action items and issues, prioritized the "Best Few", and for each sector established action plans that are incorporated into the annual Business Plans, and lead to new processes and measurements.  Together, the sectors have identified 8 core issues (management in projects; account management; external impact; values and behaviors, roles and competencies, training, careers and status, and developing our knowledge) that get fed back to corporate level working groups.  <BR>
	<DD>TQ efforts are coupled to performance measurement at the corporate level under the DERA Technical and Quality Director, Adrian Meers.  In addition to the metrics and customer survey described earlier, the technical evaluation and improvement process includes sector-level use of the UK Quality Award model (which has a scoring system similar to the Baldridge Award), a 26-factor Technical Assessment at the "team" level that employs self-assessment plus external and internal auditors, and process benchmarking.  A new assessment challenge for DERA is "added value", or technology transfer and exploitation.  On the efficiency side, in addition to the metrics DERA employs "market testing", effectively competing internal units against external service providers when additional privatization or commercialization is feasible.<BR>
	<DD>When discussing change, John Mabberley notes that perhaps the most far reaching reform has been in project management.  The 7 Sectors are organized into 60 Profit Centers.  A matrix approach is used within these Centers.  Each project is led by an individual uniquely responsible for its delivery:  <B>Project Managers</B> obtain the staff they need from Resource Managers (people owners); <B>Resource Managers</B> are responsible for developing the talents and skills of their people, for "selling" them to project managers, and for rating them<I><A HREF="cdnews9.htm#15">(15)</A></I>.  Resource Managers typically are responsible for about 40 people, and charge about half their time to this role (10% + 1%/person).<BR>
	<DD>Project teams are multi-disciplinary, and Project Managers can draw their team members from any sector or centre;  members are chosen for their skills and contributions, not their role or grade, and they come and go from projects as they are needed.  In addition there are Technical Consultants who provide technical support to projects and staff skill development, and network to develop technical strategies.  Individuals can serve as both Product or Resource Manager and as Technical consultants, but never as both Project and Resource manager simultaneously.  Sectors also have Account Managers to facilitate the interface with customers.  This DERA management procedure seems fully consistent with front line US practices, including those in some of the most innovative DoD labs.<BR>
	<DD>TQ2 is well underway, but still has a long way to go.  The new metrics are just being added, and the "few best actions" are at the front end of implementation.  Already however there is talk of Phase 3 - continuous improvement of quality through benchmarking, working smarter rather than harder.<BR>
	<DD>As noted above, the new arrivals-DTEO, CDA and PLSD-are somewhat behind DRA, but are catching up quickly.  They are subject to the same management philosophy and metrics as DRA, and indeed most of the senior managers (including 3 of the 4 Sector Directors) have come from DRA and thus understand and have experience with the corporate approach.  Of these organizations, DTEO was of most interest to the DoD group because of its T&E responsibilities and make-up.  DTEO started trading in April 95, and rapidly achieved the 20% or so efficiency improvements associated with dismantling of input controls and transition to fiscal and managerial accountability.  Not surprisingly, however, some parts of DTEO - especially some land test sites - are showing signs of non-viability.<BR>
	<DD>Just like DRA at the start, DTEO has an excessive number of sites (40).  Everyone we talked to agreed that some rationalization will be needed, although difficult.  The methodology will be similar to that for DRA, but there are some significant complicating differences.  The sites are scattered all across Scotland, England, and Wales, as opposed to the labs which were largely concentrated in southern England.  DERA essentially owns them all, as opposed to the "walk-away" provisions which applied to many DRA sites; and many are contaminated or of little commercial interest.  Many sites are in remote locations and offer the only, or the best, employment in their areas; thus considerable interest from MPs can be expected.  As opposed to research where there were potentially viable alternate performers in industry and academia (and commercial potential for the Agency), most T&E sites are pretty uniquely military, and also have capabilities which MOD may be reluctant to jeopardize.  There is full recognition that rationalization can not proceed purely on an economic basis, and that DERA must consult carefully and thoroughly with the Minister and MOD customers prior to any closures.<BR>
	<DD>DERA and DTEO managers were naturally very sketchy about their plans for T&E site rationalization.  Some parts of the process have already started however.  One example we saw involved transfer of responsibility and assets from DRA to DTEO.  DRAs Air Fleet Department, after reduction and reorganization, was moved in 1994 to Boscombe Down, headquarters of the DTEO Aircraft T&E Sector.  It now will simply move into that sector and sell its services to DRA.  There is also the possibility of a redefinition of the DTEO sectors, for example to create a separate Range Sector.  DERA managers and customers both expressed great concern that the MOD retain its necessary "capabilities"; but there is a clear expectation that some ranges and other sites will have to be shed, and there is considerable discussion with European allies (especially France and Germany) and to a lesser degree with the US, about opportunities for interdependence and sharing.<BR>
	<DD>Rationalization of the T&E structure is clearly recognized as a difficult problem, with shared customer-supplier responsibilities.  From DERAs perspective, it does not operate here in a completely free market.  The approach will be for DTEO to continue to improve its efficiency and thus drive down overall costs, to examine in detail a variety of options, and to clearly state to MOD the essential costs for the different key capabilities.  MOD will then have to decide what it is willing to pay for, recognizing that there will be a potentially significant impact on how much research it can afford.  <BR>
	<DD>Here it is worth noting again some significant differences between the UK and US situations.  DERA has been forced to rationalize research and T&E separately and serially.  DoD has the opportunity to rationalize them together, in parallel.  Even given the greater distinction between the functions of DRA and DTEO in the UK than between labs and the MRTFB in the US, there undoubtedly would have been advantageous options that would have emerged from consideration of them together.  Some of this may still be possible, particularly if DERA chooses (as it is free to do and already has done to a degree) to reallocate tasks among its units at both the Division and the Sector level - i.e. to reorganize to gain even greater total efficiency in the interest of its customer.  But the range of options might have been considerably greater if the full scope of todays DERA was considered at the onset. The opportunity to consider RDT&E as an entity is a major advantage for the US, particularly when there are opportunities for inter-service interdependence.<BR>
	<DD>One additional major change was in process during our visit: privatization of the Support Services Division (Financial Services, Site Services, Information Services).  This is the portion of DERA that was most severely affected by the downsizing.  Although little was said about the details of the privatization process, DERA management clearly believes it can obtain better support from the marketplace than from an internal organization, and also that Support Services itself should benefit from an opportunity to sell to a larger community.<P>

	<B>d.  Issues </B><BR>
	<DD>During DERAs transition into a thriving Trading Fund Agency, both it and its owner/customer have had to make many basic decisions about their relationships with each other and with other entities. These decisions have changed with time, as both supplier and customer have adjusted to their new roles.  <BR>
	<DD>A primary example is <B>competition</B>.  An the onset, MOD clearly intended to compete much of DRAs work.  "Market testing" competition was in fact tried; but because of DERAs economy of scale and rapid progress in cost reduction, it easily won the initial competitions and thus both potential competitors and customers lost interest.  Now there is a focus on "competitiveness" rather than the process, with internal benchmarking and market testing to maintain a focus on rates and prices.  <BR>
	<DD>The customers we spoke to were all complacent about placing their work directly with DERA, and in fact with having DERA manage "secondary competition" for the out-sourced work (about 700M of its 1B+ turnover is spent in industry - 200M on research, 300M on support services, and 200M on goods and materials).  VADM Dunt noted that he would have to have a significantly larger staff to manage direct competition for the Applied Research Program (about 60% of DERAs research funding), and DERA manages virtually the entire 160M Corporate Research Program.  CRP's Director Mike Markin stated that having set the organization up to support MOD, it should be the repository of UK Defence technology.  Therefore the corporate program is done with and through DERA.  At the same time industry must be healthy, so he "urges" DERA to place about a third of the funds outside.  <BR>
	<DD>The sole-source relationship is not without serious problems.  The major concerns we heard from customers include the quality of research DERA outsources (industry still registers "more than the odd complaint" to quote the CSA), the limited range of approaches to a problem likely to be examined by a monopolistic supplier with in-house capability and thus inevitable technological bias<I><A HREF="cdnews9.htm#16">(16)</A></I>, and the effectiveness of the technology transfer process in both directions between industry, universities and DERA.  MOD may need a trusted advisor, but by making DERA the filter for all S&T MOD has restricted its open access to the range of options and opinions that may need be considered in modern warfare.  Unless these three concerns are managed properly over time, their effects on both customer-supplier relationships and warfighting could have a serious adverse impact on MOD.  We have similar problems in the US, which must be addressed by Visions 21.<BR>
	<DD>A second aspect of competition is DERAs <B>relationship with industry</B>.  This has even somewhat more problematic to date, and seems not yet to have been fully resolved.  DERA of course is encouraged by its framework to exploit its capabilities for wealth generation<I><A HREF="cdnews9.htm#17">(17)</A></I> , and to seek outside work that does not conflict with its responsibilities to MOD.  The balance however is delicate, since one of DERAs main tasks is to pass its technology on to the industry that will develop and built systems.  Its tough to both compete and partner, and the balance seems still not quite right.  There is little real head-to-head competition, but many aspects of perceived competition.  Among them is DERAs rate structure, which is heavily influenced by its valuation procedures <I> (John Chisholm comment: <U>not</U> true again; business use valuation indicates our decision not to invest in like facilities)  </I>, its desire to keep mark-up low in behalf of its customers' interests, and its very limited interest in profit (beyond what is is required to make to repay the loan and support new capabilities).  The Framework requires that DERAs programme compare in value for money terms with comparable work in industry.  But DERA is not truly in the open marketplace and must consciously control its rates to not undercut industry, particularly when it does enter the competitive marketplace.<I> (John Chisholm comment: issue is more that DERA scale gives it an economic advantage that is sometimes threatening to industry).  </I><BR>
	<DD>The Structural Materials Centre, for example, is viewed as a threat to industrial labs working in similar areas.  It has actually grown during the rationalization process, although it has just now relocated into its new state of the art facility.  SMC already is Europes largest materials research and technology organization.  The Director John Morton clearly intends to bring academics and industrial researchers into the lab and to develop and deploy world class programs.  He views SMC as a Dual Use Technology Centre, and is very active in EC supported as well as purely UK programs (approximately 25% of SMC income is non-MOD).  It would be hard not to perceive such a dynamic, rapidly growing, and well supported organization with a monololistic relationship with a one of the largest customers as a threat if you were in the same business.<BR>
	<DD>Although it is hard to generalize and we didnt have an opportunity to interact with industry, it appears that at the moment DERA s has established a reasonable if tenuous relationship with industry.  The early views of direct competition both with and against industry are gone, and DERA does see itself more as a trusted consultancy to MOD and thus a key partner and input to the primes in UK Defense industry who do the engineering development and production.  It is undoubtedly more problematic to 2nd and 3rd tier suppliers, and to industrial research labs, than to major primes.  One interesting aspect of the relationship is that DERA does not take patents on the technologies it develops for MOD (it does for items it takes commercial), but rather just passes the invention to industry for incorporation into weapon systems.  If industry chooses to commercially exploit such inventions, more power to them.  <I> (John Chisholm comment: Wrong. DERA retains IPR of own inventions and permits contractors to keep IPR of their inventions under contract to DERA, but reserves free use rights to MOD).  </I>This seems much looser and potentially more problematic than US CRDA and other IPR practices.<BR>
	<DD>Another area that needs further development is the <B>owner/customer-supplier relationship</B>.  The CSA commented that the owner role has not been thoroughly thought out.  DERA has therefore evolved its own policies.  The Framework and Delegation letter, clear as they are, cant and dont cover all issues.  There is much room for interpretation.  Close rapport and mutual trust between the Chief Executive and the Minister are required to maintain the balance defined by the Framework.  There have been examples in other UK Agencies where this has broken down badly, with damaging results to both individuals and institutions.<BR>
	<DD>People move back and forth between MOD and DERA without officially changing their employer, and thus must be both customer and owner.  For example Mike Markin himself is a DERA employee, and a large percentage of his and VADM Dunts staffs are from DERA.  The fox is truly in the hen house, particularly given the (self-reinforcing?) monopolistic relationship.  This arrangement seems clearly in conflict with the basic government policy of separation of executive and supplier jobs. However such issues of individual, vice institutional, conflict of interest seem much less problematic in the UK MOD than they would be in the US.  <BR>
	<DD>At the heart of their system is faith in the integrity of the civil service.  John Mabberley emphasized that integrity was one of the best things the DRE employees brought to DRA.  Part of this stems from a much lower level of inter-service rivalry, most of it is historic and social.  Certainly there are parochial interests, and UK politics is noted for its heated rhetoric and scandals.  But there is a sense of honor and respectability in being a professional Servant of the Crown that is absent in American life.  Consequently there is much less need for detailed regulations and lawyers.  DoD would want, and Congress would certainly insist upon, much more surgical and formal separation of responsibilities than pertains in MOD.<BR>
	<DD>In addition to their greater reliance upon individual integrity, the British are more willing than the Americans to put someone in charge and let him succeed or fail.  We try to build error-free systems, thus stifling initiative.  They are much less risk averse, more willing to set out on a course founded on policy and let the details evolve within a framework (The EU is perhaps the grandest example of this).  We like everything nailed down at the onset.  They are willing to take several runs at a problem, to learn from mistakes and try again.  We construct rules to prevent similar failures.  Such issues of character and style are subtle but pervasive, and must be considered when trying to extract lessons from the UK restructuring process.<BR>
	<DD>Customer-supplier relationships will continue to evolve under the broader DERA. PLSD will likely be similar to DRA.  DTEO and CDA are somewhat more problematic.  As already mentioned, DTEO operates in an even less open market sector than does DRA.  Both customers and suppliers acknowledge shared responsibility (and blame?) for the coming rationalization, and recognize that the processes and rigorous efficiency regime of DRA are appropriate for DTEO.  Thus on balance it was more logical to combine them than to form a separate agency.  The case for rolling up into DERA the variety of analysis organizations that make up CDA was less clear.  CDA plays a central interface role in MOD among policy, operations, and procurement, so among other things it has a significantly different customer base.  The only real benefit is efficiency, and this is unlikely to be dramatic in an analysis house. <I>(John Chisholm comment: Not a well informed comment.  CDA customers are mostly the same as DRAs, and CDA depends on DRA for performance level modeling. It has had more credibility since it has been together in the agency.</I>  N.b., after visiting CDA, the author agrees with this comment).<BR>
	<DD>DERA clearly recognizes that it needs to be more proactive in customer relations.  Customers are one of the four themes in DRA's TQ2, and the objectives are to be/have:
<UL>
<LI>MODs first choice for S&T advice
<LI>a successful supplier in Defence related civil markets
<LI>a commitment to understanding & satisfying customer needs, and
<LI>highly valued products and services.
</UL>
	<DD>The customers we talked to all expressed concern that DERA at the start didnt pay enough attention to the customers approach and psychology.  As in its internal crisis oriented drive for viability, DERA ignored the softer issues in dealing with MOD.  Now that satisfaction with performance is up, relationships can mature.  There will be natural tensions.  Many MOD customers, especially in the applied research side (60% of the business) can be expected to want more control over the nature of the work.  On the other hand, DRA clearly would like broader work packages and interaction restricted to higher levels<I><A HREF="cdnews9.htm#18">(18)</A></I>.  There are clear US parallels here, with our constant struggle between "requirements" and "solutions" and who is responsible for what (e.g. between OPNAV and the SYSCOMs, OP-91 & ONR, to use a Navy example).  <BR>
	<DD>In DERAs case, there also is a need to balance responsibility in setting and controlling rates, to simultaneously maximize the amount of work produced for available funds, and to protect long term capability which costs money.  The customer could be ignored during the period of crisis and when rates were tumbling dramatically as a result of rationalization and introduction of Trading. Part of consensus development for long term stability must address better realization on both sides of the implications of customer demands and supplier interests.  US experience has shown that its sometimes harder to manage during a period of stability when adjustments are made on the margin, than during crisis where change is wholesale.  DERA has a detailed business model it employs as part of its Corporate Planning Process<I><A HREF="cdnews9.htm#19">(19)</A></I>  to help address such issues.<BR>
	<DD>On the civil sector side, DERA intends to invest significantly to grow its business infrastructure and develop a sales and marketing staff.  Defense funding will continue to fall, if not as precipitously as during the last few years, and there is some concern that difficulties in rationalizing DTEO could adversely affect MOD funds available for research.  The intent is to provide a buffer, ie to have a business staff large and capable enough to move rapidly into commercial work if necessary to save critical facilities and skills.  It is probable that much of the business marketing effort will focus on other European nations and UK departments.<I><A HREF="cdnews9.htm#20">(20)</A></I> <BR>
	<DD>Another problematic issue mentioned in most of our discussions is profit.  The formal financial target imposed on DERA by the Trading Fund is an average 6% per year Return on Capital Employed, to pay off its start-up loan (DERA is authorized an indebtedness against "MOD Votes" of 400M).  As noted above, DERA has consistently, almost embarrassingly, exceeded this target.  The Terms of Business Agreement under which MOD and DERA agree on work and price includes a fixed fee.  Thus excess "profit" parallels efficiency improvements above target.  DERA can by agreement with the Minister retain surplus above immediate needs in the business, and earn interest on its accounts. However, excess profit ultimately returns to the Treasury so the question becomes one of proper management and investment for long term stability while maintaining competitive rates.  Sector and Division managers obviously would like to retain control of some of their individual profit, but recognize the need for balance across the entire Agency, particularly during DTEO rationalization.  <BR>
	<DD>In addition to its flexibility with the operating surplus from its government business, DERA "is permitted to invest through its Enterprise Fund the net proceeds from its license and royalty income in projects that will yield benefits, albeit in the longer term, to both the MOD and DERA and that are likely to have dual-use potential"<I><A HREF="cdnews9.htm#21">(21)</A></I> .  Enterprise Fund revenues from existing patents currently run about 15M/year, mostly from liquid crystal displays.  This money is essentially treated as venture capital, to enable the Agency to move into new business.  It will support the development of the business infrastructure mentioned above.  There are some restrictions on use of these funds; for example, DERA is not allowed to take an equity interest in a private company (this seemed to have been a surprise that they will try to reverse).<BR>
	<DD>Much of what DERA has been able to accomplish is because it has designed and implemented its own <B>personnel system</B>.  Staff remain in the civil service, and many are in (and officially encouraged to join) trade unions.  However, Chisholm has been given adequate authority within the basic regulations and Framework, and in his personal delegation letter from the Permanent Undersecretary<I><A HREF="cdnews9.htm#22">(22)</A></I>, to be able to make quite major changes and thus motivate behavior.  As with so much of what DERA has been able to do, the policy basis for change goes back to The Next Steps, in this case to its recognition of the handicap of a totally uniform civil service system.  <BR>
	<DD>Many of the personnel changes have been alluded to above: pay for performance (including 20-25% of compensation at risk for senior managers), the Resource Manager-Project Manager system in Profit Centers, short-term employment contracts, centralized management of exit and redundancy costs during the major drawdown, and the willingness to pay the necessary costs of redundancies as the price of financial viability and proper manpower balance<I><A HREF="cdnews9.htm#23">(23)</A></I>.  And as stressed earlier, the Chief Executives ability at the onset to select his own top team and send those he didnt want back to MOD.  With these changes, the Human Resource function has also changed, to setting policy vice policing.  Authorities have been passed down to the Divisions and sectors, and with them many of the (few) remaining HR staff.  As with financial and managerial matters, the procedure is to motivate desired behavior and provide managers the tools to effect change.<BR>
	<DD>DERAs success in developing and implementing an effective personnel system within the civil service (albeit it has taken time) is a stark contrast to the lack of success DoD labs have had in getting permission to implement many of the most needed changes as part of their reinvention program.  While there are significant differences in the US and UK civil services and in the details of implementation, the basic approach of tailoring the personnel system to the needs of an institution and the nature of its employees and work is worth emulating.<BR>
	<DD>Finally, the transition from DRA to DERA, the plans to devolve the Support Services Sector, concerns with the monopolistic relationship, and the development of DRAs commercial interests keep alive the fundamental issue with which the UK civil sector continues to grapple, as described below: <B>ownership</B>.  The Government (at least the current government) retains the strong belief that services are best provided by the private sector.  An essential element of competition and value for money is impartiality of the customer to the source of the service; this impartiality can not occur when the customer is the owner.  This must be balanced by the need for a trusted partner and in-house capability, and so far that argument has prevailed in MOD.  However DERA itself seems to have decided that it is both appropriate and feasible to privatize a substantial aspect of its operations.  It is reasonable to expect that in future reviews, similar decisions by either DERA or the MOD may extend to other parts of the organization.  The message is clear: plan for continuous change.<P>

<B>5.  The Civil Sector Experience</B><P>

	<B>a.  Background</B><BR>
	<DD>Not surprisingly, the DERA experience - essentially the rationalization of a set of closely related organizations in a single Ministry - has been much more coherent than that in the civil sector.  While by far the largest "Public Sector Research Establishment" (PSRE), DERA is less dispersed and disparate than "everything else".  There have been some notable individual successes in the civil sector. Indeed most of the PSREs have become New Steps Agencies, and many have been privatized or otherwise significantly changed in line with the basic policy of separating policy and service.  The problems, such as they have been, have occurred in trying to identify an overall solution that harnesses the full set of 50+ PSREs in effective support of national S&T policy, which itself has changed.  Some background is necessary before discussing the process.<BR>
	<DD>The total UK annual R&D expenditure is roughly 14B, split 9B industry and 5B government.  There are different ways of categorizing the government expenditures, but basically about 2B is Defense and the rest civil sector.  The civil support comes from three sources: the Education Departments and their Higher Education Funding Councils (separate in England, Scotland, and Wales) sustain basic research at universities at about the 1B level through their general support of research alongside teaching.  The universities themselves essentially decide how to allocate these funds<I><A HREF="cdnews9.htm#24">(24)</A></I>.  Another 1B is distributed by the six Research Councils (RCs).  Their mission is to promote and support basic, strategic and applied research and related post-graduate training in their disciplinary sectors<I><A HREF="cdnews9.htm#25">(25)</A></I>.  The RCs accomplish this both directly through their own PSREs (about 20 that are still under review to determine their future status, plus others that have been privatized to a degree like SOC, discussed below.  The PSREs directly receive about 25% of RC funds), and through competitive awards to the PSREs, to private sector establishments of various types (some of which were PSREs), to universities and industry.  Other Departments likewise support S&T at about the 1B level, again to their PSREs (about 30 establishments and 2/3 of the funds, with the same caveats that apply to the RCs) and competitively with other performers.  At issue for this study are the policies and processes whereby the government has already significantly reduced the number of PSREs, the "Prior Options" reviews by which it is looking in detail at 37 PSREs this year, the nature of some of the solutions, and the impact on Defence.<P>

	<B>b.  S&T Policy: Realizing our Potential</B><I><A HREF="cdnews9.htm#26">(26)</A></I><BR> 
	<DD>Following the election of 1992, the Prime Minister created, for the first time in 30 years, a Cabinet level Ministry with responsibility for formulating science and technology policy.  The Office of Science and Technology (OST) was established under him , combining elements of the former Department of Education and Science and the Cabinet Office<I><A HREF="cdnews9.htm#27">(27)</A></I>.  The tasks of the Minister of Public Service and Science, the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, were to develop a White Paper laying out the Government's policy and strategy for S&T, and to prepare for its execution.<BR>
	<DD>Preparation of the White Paper involved a wide set of consultations.  A major study commissioned in 1992 was "Review of Allocation, Management and Use of Government Expenditure on S&T", led by Sir Peter Levene, the PM's Advisor on Efficiency and Effectiveness, and Prof. W.D.P. Stewart, the Chief Scientific Advisor of OST.  It was essentially a scrutiny of progress since The Next Steps.  It looked at objectives and priority setting, mechanisms for obtaining value for money, customer-contractor relationships, and steps to develop internal markets for government S&T expenditures.  <BR>
	<DD>R&D spending at the time was about 5.2B, down overall 17% since its peak in 85/86; however RC funding during this period had increased by 11%.  Spending was 25% basic research, 34% applied, and 35% experimental development; cut another way, 50% supported government services, especially defense, 25% advancement of the knowledge and science base, and 10-20% technology and industrial development.  The Levene-Stewart report concluded that this allocation was not optimal from the standpoint of the government as a whole, particularly since S&T can make such an important contribution to economic growth.  <BR>
	<DD>The report expressed three areas of concern, and made specific recommendations.  First, there was a need for a statement of government objectives and priorities for S&T (the White Paper), and a means of influencing departmental plans in line with them.  OST's role however should be scrutiny and influence, not direction.  Second, that portion of S&T spending directed toward wealth generation, should have active industrial involvement and often involve shared funding.  Third, Departments should annually publish policies and statistics of their compliance, so that everyone was aware of both intent and progress.<BR>
	<DD>Levene-Stewart reemphasized that the <B>customer-supplier relationship</B> is central to the efficiency and effectiveness of governments S&T expenditures.  Value for money is best when customers act on the basis of clear objectives, with a freedom of choice of suppliers (the situation is not the same for purely curiosity-driven research, but it does apply to all other aspects of S&T).  Departments were doing inadequate competitive tendering, and RCs needed redefined missions fully reflective of government objectives and priorities.  Although there had been progress toward formation of Next Steps Agencies, there were serious impediments to market development because customer-owners were shielding in-house suppliers.  To separate procurement and ownership of S&T, the report recommended consolidation of ownership of all civil PSREs in one (or a few) Civil Research Agency, reconsideration of privatization, implementation of incentives for widening the markets to the private sector, and closer PSRC-industry relationships.  DRA, while remaining separate and staying within MOD, should become more involved with civil markets and realize its commercial potential.<BR>
	<DD>The Government White Paper that resulted from the study and consultation process reflected and in fact expanded upon the findings, philosophy, and overall recommendations of the Levene-Stewart report.  It however did not adopt the specific recommendation for a centralized Civil Research Agency; rather, it reaffirmed the customer contractor principle in applied R&D, and called for a further scrutiny of best structures to respond to the policies and procedures it promulgated.<BR>
	<DD>The White Paper, <B>Realizing our Potential</B>, has had a far reaching impact on S&T in the UK.  Its policies are followed in practice.  Its organizational and procedural rearrangements have changed the way S&T is planned and conducted.  It is well known and widely quoted.  Because the UK S&T policy applies to military as well as civilian research, it is worth exploring some of its most significant aspects before examining its specific impact on PSRE restructuring.<BR>
	<DD>Simply stated, the UK S&T policy is that government funded S&T is to be directed to <B>wealth generation</B> and <B>quality of life</B>.  "...Science needs Government and public funds.  The decision for Government, when it funds science, as it must, is to judge where to place the balance between the freedom of researchers to follow their own instincts and curiosity, and the guidance of large sums of public money towards achieving wider benefits, above all the generation of national prosperity and the improvement of the quality of life."<I><A HREF="cdnews9.htm#28">(28)</A></I>   "Finding this balance is not a simple task..." but a common theme in the consultations was "the importance of maintaining and improving the UKs scientific and engineering excellence and skills and their application to national wealth creation."<BR>
	<DD>The White paper concluded "we are, as a nation, potentially very strong in science and technology...this strength...will not be properly applied unless efforts are made to break down barriers ...steps should be taken which ... harness that strength in science and engineering to the creation of wealth in the United Kingdom by bringing it into closer and more systematic contact with those responsible for industrial and commercial decisions...The Government will continue to allocate public resources to science and engineering on the scale necessary to finance the policies in this White Paper."<I><A HREF="cdnews9.htm#29">(29)</A></I> <BR>
	<DD>"The Governments strategy is to improve the nations competitiveness and quality of life by maintaining the excellence of science, engineering and technology in the United Kingdom" by strengthening partnerships between the S&T community and industry, supporting the scientific and engineering base, contributing to international - particularly European - research, promoting understanding, and ensuring the efficiency and effectiveness of Government-funded effort.<I><A HREF="cdnews9.htm#30">(30)</A></I> <BR>
	The White Paper directed a number of specific organizational and procedural changes:
<UL>
<LI>Direction, balance and content of the government funded S&T programme would be guided by results of a <B>Technology Foresight Programme</B>.  Foresight assessments, jointly conducted by industry and the scientific and engineering communities, would identify those technologies of most importance to the countrys economy, based on trends in research and the strength of the UK research team (science push), and emerging economic developments and the current or potential availability of firms that could appropriate research outcomes to seize market opportunities (demand pull).
<LI>Drawing upon the Technology Foresight assessments, and with contributions from all government departments, OST would annually publish a "Forward Look" that sets strategic objectives over a 5-10 year perspective, and gives a clear and up to date statement of government strategy to industrial and research communities.  It covers gaps and imbalances in the training and research programme; the balance between civil and defence efforts, between the Departmental and RC/HERF programs, and between domestic and international research; a comparison with principal competitors; and the scope for greater collaboration and synergy among the public and private S&T communities.
<LI>The RCs were reorganized (see footnote 25) and their membership streamlined.  The missions were "reformulated to make explicit their commitment to wealth creation and the quality of life".  Each would be headed by a part time Chairman (from industry) and a full time Chief Executive.  Oversight would be exercised by a Director-General of the RCs in OST.
<LI>A new Council for S&T, chaired by the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, would advise Ministers via the Cabinet Committee on S&T, on the balance and direction of government funded S&T.  It would "bring together customers of publicly funded research, industrialists, academics and business men and women as well as the Chief Scientists (or equivalents) of the Government Departments most directly involved.  It will be an important forum of largely independent members."<I><A HREF="cdnews9.htm#31">(31)</A></I> 
<LI>Each Department was given an explicit S&T mission statement.  Government negotiating positions on international S&T programmes will be better coordinated, with particular attention to the EU.  Postgraduate training to better meet the needs of employers would focus on the MSc as the normal initial post-graduate degree in science, engineering and technology.
<LI>The <B>customer-contractor principle</B> "will be maintained and strengthened.  The Government believes that many of the services currently provided by Government research establishments could be carried out in the private sector, and that privatization is a realistic prospect for a number of establishments.  There will be a further scrutiny of the best organizational and management structures"<I><A HREF="cdnews9.htm#32">(32)</A></I> .
</UL>
	<DD>"Government cannot, and will not attempt to, remove from industry its responsibility for investing in innovation and bringing new products to market.  Nonetheless, it is the fundamental theme of this White Paper that a closer partnership and better diffusion of ideas between the science and engineering communities, industry, the financial sector and Government are needed as part of the crucial effort to improve our <B>national competitiveness</B> and <B>quality of life</B>.  We have the talents; now we need fully to realize our potential."<I><A HREF="cdnews9.htm#33">(33)</A></I> <BR>
	<DD>Realizing our Potential forced a major change in how S&T is funded and conducted in the UK.  Its measures have not all been equally successful (e.g. the Technology Foresights are of uneven quality across sectors), and as can be imagined it caused considerable initial consternation among the academics (although they were vastly relieved at the commitment for continued funding).  However it is now perfectly clear to one and all in the UK why the nation supports S&T, and what approach one has to take to get proposals funded.  As opposed to the US where we have no national consensus or policy on S&T and all decisions are pragmatic, in the UK decisions on funding, organization and management are soundly founded on clear and consistent policy.  One can agree or disagree with the policy itself; but it has been consistently and thoroughly applied, and by and large has been well accepted and effective.  I have stressed it at some length here because in looking for lessons the that US can extract from examination of organizational rationalization in the UK, it is essential to understand that all of the individual changes, in the civil PSREs as well as in MOD and DERA, have been clearly guided by policy and national consensus.<BR>
	<DD>The scrutiny required by the White Paper was conducted by the Governments Efficiency Unit<I><A HREF="cdnews9.htm#34">(34)</A></I>.  Its report, "Multi-Departmental Scrutiny of Public Sector Research Establishments" was published in June 1994.  The terms of reference were to identify PSREs where early privatization was feasible and desirable, and where not to identify the potential for rationalization; and to consider changes to current ownership and funding arrangements.  The objective was to obtain best value for money.  The scrutiny looked at 50 PSREs from both departments and the RCs.  They were very diverse in size, mission, and business culture, but all were supported by federal money.  <BR>
	<DD>The scrutiny found little scope for immediate privatization, partly because the Ministries had already picked the low hanging fruit.  Two establishments actually privatized during the study.  It did, as expected, find scope for greater play of market forces, and made a number of procedural recommendations to improve coordination and customer-contractor relationships.<BR>
	<DD>On the issue of overall organization structure it noted, like the Levene-Stewart study, that of all the possible coordination and efficiency mechanisms, the most powerful is lumping the PSREs under one Chief Executive.  It recommended two consolidation models for further study: four market sector groups (Marine Resources and Environment; Non-marine Environment; Biotechnology and Biological Sciences; and Food and Agriculture), and two geographical groups (Scotland, and England & Wales).  This, we were told, created a huge controversy; virtually no one liked either suggestion (with the possible exception of Sir Peter Levene, the head of the Efficiency Unit which ran the scrutiny).  This was the first government efficiency scrutiny not implemented.<BR>
	<DD>The lesson learned from the two failed tries was that the PSREs were simply too diverse to tackle by an external review in general terms.  Neither of the scrutinies adequately recognized the differences, among both customers (very different Ministries plus very different RCs) and suppliers.  The RCs and Ministries had themselves to get involved and own the answers if there was to be progress.  The Government response to the scrutiny<I><A HREF="cdnews9.htm#35">(35)</A></I>  therefore, while reiterating the commitment to best value for money and accepting many of the procedural recommendations, "decided not to proceed with the...specific proposals to group establishments...nor to seek rationalisation through the mechanism of appointing new Directors of Rationalisation".<BR>
	<DD>Instead, the Government elected to "build on the existing prior options process"<I><A HREF="cdnews9.htm#36">(36)</A></I> .  This is a well established UK process to take a zero-base look at an establishment.  The <B>Prior Options Reviews</B> consider each organization in detail, taking Technology Foresight findings of future roles and requirements into account.  They are conducted by the parent Department or RC but with at least one independent member, and are overseen by a steering committee that represents other public sector interests and customers.  They are publicly announced and comments are solicited from the scientific community, other potential suppliers of the service, etc.  The findings are considered by the Ministers collectively to ensure coordination across Departments.<BR>
	<DD>In order to consider the functions of each establishment in the context of others working in similar fields across the public sectors, the current set of Reviews are being conducted in three tranches, with a common steering committee for related PSREs.  The first tranche, which reported in March 1996, looked at 18 establishments in four sectors (2 Fisheries, 11 Agriculture/Plant Science, 4 Physical Sciences, and 1 Police Science).  The second, which reported in July, looked at 9 establishments in 2 sectors (6 in Animal Science and 3 in Marine and non-marine Environment, although 2 of these 3 have several labs lumped into Centres).  The third, to report in December, will look at 10 in 2 sectors (3 in Food and Nutrition, 7 in Health).<BR>
	<DD>As noted earlier, there is a clear priority order of options to be considered by the Reviews. If possible, abolish the function.  If thats impossible, privatize the establishment. If that isnt feasible, contract out some or all of the work.  Finally, rationalize whats left.  Thus the review proceeds on the basis of "Key Questions:
<UL>
<LI>Is the Function Needed?
<LI>Must the Public Sector be Responsible for Function?
<LI>Must the Public Sector Provide the Function Itself?
<LI>What is the scope for Rationalisation?
<LI>How will the Function be Managed?
</UL>
	<DD>The guideline paper for the Reviews provides specific detailed criteria for privatization, dealing with both appropriateness and feasibility.  This is a very deliberate, intensive process designed to examine all aspects of the service and its provider, and whenever possible to move functions into the private sector.  Because this approach might be instructive for looking at US government labs, some of the suggested questions related to privatization are quoted in Appendix D.  <BR>
	<DD>While it is too early to judge the success of this focused set of Prior Options Reviews, the third try to deal conclusively with the entire set of PSREs, I have seen the results for 13 of the first tranche: three were recommended to become new "Next Steps" Executive Agencies; three will retain their Executive Agency status, but with management or financial accounting changes; one will be examined further for consolidation with related establishments; and six were recommended for further study toward "full independence from the public sector", i.e. privatisation.  If this is any indication of the overall outcome, the Prior Options Reviews will be a success, at least from the perspective of thorough implementation of the government policy.  And of course Prior Option Reviews are conducted every five years, so there will be additional opportunities for institutional change.  Perseverance pays.<P>

	<B>c.  An example: NERC and two of its PSREs</B><BR>
	<DD>To obtain a feel for the impact of Realizing our Potential and rationalization on a civil PSRE and its customer, the DoD delegation visited Southampton Oceanography Center (SOC).  We met there with the Secretary of the Board of the National Environmental Research Council (NERC; Christopher West), the Director (Prof John Shepherd) and staff of SOC and the Vice Chancellor of the University of Southampton (which operates SOC jointly with NERC), the Director (Dr Brian McCartney) of Proudman Oceanographic Laboratory (which as part of NERC's Center for Coastal and Marine Sciences [CCMS] is in the second tranche of the current round of Prior Option Reviews), and the Executive Secretary (Capt Alex Morrice) and members of the Management Group of CAROS, Cooperative Arrangements for Research in Ocean Sciences. CAROS responds to the requirement of the White Paper that RCs form "concordats" with Departments to coordinate their research programmes (here, NERC & MOD).<BR>
	<DD>NERC was established in 1965.  Prior to the White Paper it had three Science Directorates: Marine & Atmosphere, Earth, and Terrestrial & Freshwater.  Each was headed by a powerful scientist that wielded considerable influence over the direction of S&T in his area and developed a strong sense of community in the universities and centers<I><A HREF="cdnews9.htm#37">(37)</A></I>.  The NERC Directorates in Swindon directly oversaw the operations of some 30 separate sites, coordinated proposal reviews, developed strategies, and pressed initiatives with the government (hence the new 50M facility that SOC now occupies).  This all changed drastically (and the powerful heads of the Directorates returned to their Universities) on 1 April 1994, with the implementation of White Paper reforms.<BR>
	<DD>Today, NERC's Science budget is about 150M; it manages an additional 40M of contract research from various Ministries and the EC.  The three Directorates have been replaced by a single S&T Directorate which reports to the Chief Executive.  The Chief Executive in turn reports to the Chairman of the NERC Council.  The Council has 12 independent members from academia and industry, plus appointees from interested government departments.  It votes on the apportionment of funds among programs and funding mechanisms.  The Chief Executive also oversees the operation of NERC's 8 University Units<I><A HREF="cdnews9.htm#38">(38)</A></I>  and five PSRE institutes (the British Antarctic Survey, the British Geological Survey, SOC [jointly with the University], the Centre for Coastal and Marine Science [3 labs], and the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology [4 Institutes and some 20+ sites]). The NERC PSREs all operate as Non-Departmental Public Bodies.<BR>
	<DD>NERC's overall strategy document, published per dictate of the White Paper, is entitled "Environmental Directions".  It is based on extensive consultations with its scientific and user communities, and has three major components: Key Challenges identified by the scientists<I><A HREF="cdnews9.htm#39">(39)</A></I> ; Environmental Foresight Topics distilled by Technology Foresight Implementation Group from the reports of the 15 panels of the programme<I><A HREF="cdnews9.htm#40">(40)</A></I>; and six principal Environmental and Natural Resource Issues which link them: biodiversity, environmental risks and hazards, global change, natural resources, pollution, and waste.  This document is intended to meet the White Paper's charge to clearly spell out long range directions and communicate them to the public and the communities that perform and use NERCs services.  It also provides programmatic guidance.<BR>
	<DD>Six S&T Boards (Atmospheric, Earth, Earth Observation, Marine, Polar, and Terrestrial & Freshwater), each with both independent (academic and industry) and Council members, report to the Council and advise on new initiatives.  They develop the programmatic and apportionment guidance upon which the Council votes, and which the Directorate of S&T executes.  They are particularly influential because they review bids for new thematic programmes, which they judge for both science quality and relevance, and review the Core Strategic Programme which is executed by the NERC Surveys, Centres, and University Units.  With the Chief Executive, they effectively set the agenda for UK environmental S&T.<BR>
	<DD>Under the Director of S&T, who reports to the Chief Executive, the director of the Technology Interactions Section maintains linkage with users and customers.  The director of Scientific Services manages the infrastructure (ships, special facilities and labs) that is made available without charge to any researcher supported by NERC.  In addition to the Core Strategic (PSRE) and Infrastructure programmes (respectively 24% and 38% of the 1996/7 budget), two competitive programmes or funding modes are executed by the director of the Awards and Training Section.  Non-Thematic research (20%; previously called responsive mode) is curiosity-driven, and only UK universities and academic analogues are eligible.  Proposals are reviewed by six referees, and then ranked by the five disciplinary Research Grants and Training Awards committees<I><A HREF="cdnews9.htm#41">(41)</A></I>, made up of members of both academic and user communities.  Funding mechanisms include research grants, studentships and fellowships.  Thematic programs (18%; formerly directed mode) last up to five years, and address basic, strategic or applied issues that have been approved by the Boards.  Individual projects within a thematic programme are subjected to peer review and assessed by a Steering Committee.  Anyone can bid for a thematic programme and its projects, although those that rank highest usually have a large number of participants.  Overall, the split of NERC's science expenditure (141.6M in 1994/5) is about 53% Centre/Survey and 47% university.<BR>
	<DD>The main themes of government policy are clearly evident in NERC's make-up and programmes: open consultation and communication, separation between customer and supplier plus competition for services, and extensive industrial involvement.  The scientists booth in the Centres and the Universities are well aware that for their proposals to succeed, they must address the relevance of the work to wealth generation or quality of life.  And since wealth generation is at times a bit of a stretch for many of the interests of the environmental community, NERC itself has to fight just to retain level funding.<BR>
	<DD>SOC was NERC's first venture into rationalization.  The process actually began long before the RC reorganization, responding to an earlier House of Lords Select Committee report that recommended government labs be more closely associated with Universities.  A small team with long term drive and vision, headed by one of the powerful NERC Directors, ultimately convinced the government to provide the funding (nearly 50M, 3/4 via NERC and 1/4 via the Higher Education Funding Council) needed to relocate the previous deep-ocean research labs (which were inland), the national research vessels (which were berthed in Wales), and parts of the University of Southampton to a magnificent new purpose-built facility<I><A HREF="cdnews9.htm#42">(42)</A></I>  right on the docks at Southampton.  Southampton was selected as the site for the Center both because of its location and because its Oceanography Department had the highest rating in the national Research Assessment Exercise.<BR>
	<DD>SOC is an interesting amalgam.  Within the single new building which houses 450 staff and students are the Research Vessel Services, four NERC divisions (Ocean circulation, Ocean Technology, Ocean Processes, and Seafloor Processes), and two University Departments (Oceanography and Geology).  A third University Department of the Center, Marine Technology, remains on the main campus within the Faculty of Engineering.  At issue is how to integrate all of this into a world class oceanographic center.<BR>
	<DD>SOC provides some interesting contrasts to DERA.  First, it was not driven by the need to cut costs.  Indeed our hosts indicated that it could not be justified on the basis of cost, rather the objective was to improve the national capability to do the science, and SOC was an example of paying full costs to "do it right".<I><A HREF="cdnews9.htm#43">(43)</A></I>.  Second, perhaps as befits its more academic nature, there is no sense of "crisis", real or created.  Rather than make a force fit between the two very different cultures of NERC and the University, the decision was to move first and then manage integration by "persuading people of the advantages".  <BR>
	<DD>The NERC employees that moved to SOC remain civil servants, and the University employees likewise retain their status.  The balance will change over time, since all new hires will be University employees (thus this is a slow but sure form of privatization).  Likewise all SOC funds (except NERC salaries) and handled by the University.  The Director, who was selected from outside any of the involved organizations, has a full time appointment at the University, and a 5-year appointment as Director.  Some 40 senior NERC staff have adjunct status with the University, and are involved in teaching and mentoring graduate students.  In fact the unspoken expectation seems to be that it is the students that will themselves be the major catalyst for integration.<BR>
	<DD>Obviously, not all the staff are fully pleased with the situation.  There are NERC/University differences in the nature of the work (academic vs core/strategic).  NERC salaries are about 20% above those of the University.  However the University staff can consult and do outside work.  The Director commented that the advantages of integration are clearer for the researchers (e.g. students, magnificent new facilities, waterside location, etc) than for the academics, and that the scientists of both types are more sanguine than the technicians.  Overall there is high chance of success due to the parallel interests of NERC and the University, and to the quality of the staff and facilities.  Ultimately of course, SOC will become fully a University institution as NERC staff are replaced.  At issue is the speed and effectiveness of the integration.  As opposed to the forced conversion of DERA, this will occur at SOC by removing impediments and creating incentives.<BR>
	<DD>Although SOC escaped a Prior Options Review because of its integration with the University, the other NERC Centres (with the exception of the British Antarctic Survey) have just completed them and are awaiting the outcome.  We talked with Dr Brian McCartney of the Proudman Oceanographic Lab, (staff about 100) one of the three that make up the dispersed Centre for Coastal and Marine Studies<I><A HREF="cdnews9.htm#44">(44)</A></I>.  The Review Group which considered CCMS had 3 members from NERC Council and Boards, and about 10 others from the private sector and other agencies.  There were no local members.  The input comprised statistics of the operation, CCMSs statement of their view, NERCs view (which CCMS has not seen), and solicited comments from colleagues and from users such as MOD, DERA, and the British Meteorology Office.  DERA for example contracts with CCMS for their operational coastal model, and benefits from direct and focused interaction with the researchers and modelers.<BR>
	<DD>Dr McCartney noted that the report, delivered to the Minister 2 October, remains confidential until the decision is made.  He believes the review will conclude that the work is essential to the nation.  He expects one of three options: a trade sale, a non-competitive sale (management buy-out), or enhanced-status quo with the Centre operating at greater arms length and with different funding arrangements.  He noted that reviewing the Centre as a whole rather that by individual lab made it difficult to look an SOC-like University option, because of the labs' geographic dispersion.  He expressed the concern that privatization has the danger of focusing the lab more on survival than science, and that some PSREs which had gone that route had become essentially "beltway bandits".<BR>
	<DD>Both CCMS and SOC do considerable work for MOD, through DERA.  Oceanography is a core concern of Navys, and DERA lost some of its internal expertise during the rationalization.  While it still has oceanographers in its mine, sonar, underwater weapon and hydrodynamic sections, therefore, it needs to rely on the NERC Centres and to a degree on universities for much of its S&T; the "UK OPMOD" work at CCMS is a good example. <BR> 
	<DD>Work had started on a NERC-MOD MOU in Ocean Science and Technology even before the White Paper.  It was recognized that in spite of best intentions, and roughly 50M NERC and 80M MOD in parallel areas, liaison based purely on personal contacts suffered from lack of continuity and security barriers.  This early effort enabled NERC and MOD to formally establish the "concordat" suggested by the White Paper in December 1994.  The resultant CAROS is cochaired by the NERC Executive Director and the MOD Deputy Chief Scientist (Research and Technology).  NERC members of its Management Group have been cleared to the SECRET level to allow free discussion of MOD priorities and plans.  Most activity however is conducted by unclassified working groups, which deal with issues such as ship time, coupled models, and rapid environmental assessment.<BR>
	<DD>The basic procedure by which interests are combined is to expose the Centres' NERC proposals to DERA early in the process.  DERA can then both influence the proposal, and plan its work to complement that of the scientists without security difficulties.  The quid pro quo is MOD advocacy of the project with NERC Council.  Examples include dynamic studies in the Straits of Hormuz, aspects of the coastal LOIS program, and upcoming studies of shelf-break dynamics NW of Scotland.  DERA, especially the DRA Sea Sector, also contracts directly with the Centres for specific research.<BR>
	<DD>The scientists commented that DERA was good to work with and helped to manage the interface.  As a result MOD was clearly a more intelligent customer than the other Departments.  This relationship between the military and civil sectors thus seems to be effective for both parties.  In part the relationship is based on trust that DERA will rely on the civil PSREs rather than attempt to compete with them or duplicate their skills, but the presence of a formal mechanism with an Executive Secretary (paid for by NERC) and senior attention to the cooperation helps maintain the momentum and facilitate long range planning for both parties.  It is particularly important for DERA in helping decide what minimum set of skills and facilities it need retain.<P>

<B>6.  Observations</B><BR>
	<DD>The UK lab rationalization experience has been quite successful from the perspective of those in Government that made it happen.  It also has been quite fast, considering the magnitude of the changes.  Executive offices in Ministries, and service providers in Agencies, PSREs of other types, and in industry, have attitudes and processes that are drastically different from what they were less than five years ago.  Even in academia there is a clear understanding of customer-supplier relationships, and of the rationale for publicly funded S&T be it civilian or military: wealth generation and quality of life.<BR>
	<DD>The restructuring process has proceeded differently both in practice and in style in civil and military sectors (and in other parts of the government's work besides S&T), but in all cases it is underpinned by consistent policy regarding the responsibilities of government and how they should be carried out.  The Visions 21 Team will have to determine which if any of the steps taken in the UK can be transported across the Atlantic.  What this paper has tried to point out is that in addition to the thousands of specific decisions regarding business practices, personnel, policies, financial schemes, site closures, etc., there are some very general principles that must guide successful rationalization.  It the UK these have been:
<UL><B>
<LI>Consistent policy and pressure from the top
<LI>Clear separation and delineation of responsibilities
<LI>Perseverance and willingness to learn and keep trying
<LI>Trust in individuals and organizations
<LI>Participation of the private sector</B>
</UL>
	<DD>At issue is the set of central guiding principles that will enable a similarly successful rationalization in the US.<P>

 <B>Appendix C: DRA Site Rationalization</B><BR>
	<DD>Like most of the rest of DRAs changes, site rationalization was driven by the need to quickly establish financial viability.  David Tyte who directed the process starts his brief by noting that there were too many sites, too many buildings, the buildings were old and in poor repair, too many workshops and stores and too much stock, too many computer bureaus, too much transport, too many separate support units, and the market was declining.  Even with the best of will, the input-driven system kept things because it didnt know what else to do with them, and added things without any recognition of true costs. DERA had to rationalize on essential sites, and completely restructure the support services.<BR>
	<DD>John Chisholm chose Tyte for the first of these two major tasks.  Tyte had 30 years experience in MOD both in the DREs and in London, and more importantly had been Nigel Hughes TD for the initial phases of establishing the agency.  Thus he had a broad knowledge of the sites.  Tyte in turn was allowed to choose his own team and develop his own process.  The chain of command was kept short: one individual was responsible for the analysis of each site.  He made recommendations to Tyte and Tyte made his to the Chief Executive who made the decisions (subject only to Ministerial approval).  No consensus and certainly no say by the site.<BR>
	<DD>The target for site reduction was based on an assessment of the infrastructure costs that had to be eliminated to achieve competitive pricing at the expected reduced level of income: 90M/year, over 60% of then-current levels.  The reductions had to be taken while retaining the capability to deliver product.  Other objectives included minimizing disruption and moves (the UK housing market is "arthritic"), minimizing the costs and the capital employed (everything had to be done "within the envelope", i.e. without any extra funds), maintaining robustness against future change, contributing to greater flexibility and technology rationalization, and releasing valuable land back to MOD. <BR>
	<DD>The resulting criteria for site selection were efficiency (overhead costs), investment (reprovision, relocation, and redundancy), land release value, and less quantifiable program continuity, technology rationalization, and flexibility.  These had to be considered in terms of the new Sector arrangement, which replaced and shifted functions among the previous DREs (and which itself was in constant flux).  Tyte notes that the most agonizing was Structural Materials since each of the old establishments had materials groups.  The basic strategy was to retain "core" sites that were too expensive to move because of staff numbers or facilities, to retain small sites essential to provide key capabilities<I><A HREF="cdnews9.htm#45">(45)</A></I>, to fill up the retained large sites, and to release land with a high sales value.<BR>  
	<DD>One of the initial issues to be settled with MOD was what to do with the land DERA vacated.  The choices were for DERA to take ownership of all the property of the DREs and sell off what it vacated, using the funds earned to pay for the rationalization costs; or for DERA to identify what it wanted in the long term and return the vacated property to MOD, paying rent in the interim, and to separately fund redundancies.  Tyte notes that "it was an interesting debate that we got out of very lightly".  At the time there was a big property boom.  MOD has sold some properties to British Aerospace, who in turn made a killing by selling some of it off for housing.  MOD certainly didnt want DERA to get away with the same thing, so it said it would take all the property back.  At which point, the bottom fell out of the housing market, and MOD is stuck with a disposal problem.  Of course DERA is now responsible for all DRA property it has retained, plus that obtained with DTOE; but it is absolved from responsibility for cleanup of pre-existing contamination.<BR>
	<DD>The process Tyte and his team followed was to draw up a list of options for each site (based on personal knowledge), and to look at the cost of each over a 20-25 year time frame.  These of course had to be looked at in combinations, and some compromises were made because of employment and housing considerations in an area.  In addition they managed to put some "hard cases" aside into the T&E organization; those have now come back, but as Tyte notes they now know how to do this job.  Tyte also notes that one reason the DRA job was somewhat easier that DTOEs will be is that most of the sites are in England, in areas where there are other employment opportunities.  The process will be more emotional in isolated areas.  Combined options were arranged in terms of "best buys" based on running cost savings, disposal proceeds and reconstruction costs, to put together a total package that met the initial objectives.  When the decision had been made, they "consulted" with the affected trade unions who had the right to ask hard questions about the economics of the move; DRA obviously had to have a good case.  The unions could either accept DERAs rationale or request assistance of their MPs.  They in turn could attempt to persuade the Minister he had made a poor decision.  MPs also were sent a letter with a copy of the consultative document.  And of course there was considerable personal discussion of Tyte and the Chief Executive with both MOD leadership and MPs.  But basically the decision was that of the Chief Executive with the approval of the Minister.<BR>
	<DD>That left the issue of paying for the costs of the necessary moves and new construction.  The price tag was calculated at about 200M (plus VAT), but the Chief Executive was able to show MOD where to get the money. He also could go around the programmers and naysayers to the Minister to get the ok.  Basically, MOD runs a 10-year rolling budget for capital improvements.  Requests have to go in for improvements 10 years ahead, and once approved it could not be changed.  Chisholm simply arranged to get this money up front to use for the rationalization.<BR>
	<DD>The rest has "simply" been execution, most of which has occurred on schedule and cost. The timetable is instructive:<BR>
Approval for rationalization studies ... Nov 91<BR>
Ministerial & Treasury approval for Programme ... Dec 92<BR>
Project Manager appointed ... May 93<BR>
MOD & Treasury Approvals for Major Construction <BR>
Submitted ... Oct 93<BR>
  Approved ... Dec 93<BR>
Work Contract Placed<BR>
  Minor Sites (DRA delegation<I><A HREF="cdnews9.htm#46">(46)</A></I> ) ... Jun 92-Oct 93<BR>
  Major Sites ... Nov 93-Aug 94<BR>
Moves Completed<BR>
  Minor Sites ... Oct 92-Dec 94<BR>
  Major Sites ... Aug 94-Mar 97<BR>
This speaks to taut management and quality execution.<BR>
	<DD>Tyte did note some weak spots of the process:
<UL>
<LI>Users and senior managers didnt believe it would happen, and were too "busy elsewhere" when needed 
<LI>The organization was changing rapidly, leading to specification changes in the buildings
<LI>DRA was initially dubious about survival and undersized.  Now theyre already over capacity.
<LI>They shouldnt have refurbished any buildings.  Savings are illusory, headaches immense.  Knock em down and rebuild.

		<DD>Privatisation criteria can usefully be classified under two headings:<BR>
- those largely associated with <B>appropriateness</B> (whether there are powerful reasons for continued provision by the public sector, irrespective of the saleability of the operations); and<BR>
- those largely associated with <B>feasibility</B> (whether the operation can in practice be packaged for a successful sale).<BR>
	<DD>In most cases there are conflicting objectives, and the appropriate balance between objectives has to be determined.  For example, private sector provision may be deemed to be appropriate but privatisation may be too expensive to be in taxpayers' interests. (For those who like to think in these terms, this issue can be expressed as a question of the <B>relative weights</B> to be attached to privatisation criteria in any particular case.)<BR>
		<DD>In addition, when assessing feasibility, it is rarely the case that a simple "yes or no" answer to a question can be said to make privatisation either feasible or impossible; there is a spectrum of degrees of difficulty which has to be judged according to the perceived acceptability of risk. (Again, for those who think in these terms, the issue here is that of the scoring of an option against a criterion.)<BR>
		<DD>Different judgements against the privatisation criteria can also be made for different methods of privatisation.  Indeed, many of the criteria for assessing whether a body should be privatised are of equal importance for assessing how a body should be privatised.<BR>
		<DD>For the purposes of the present exercise, the focus should probably be on appropriateness criteria, together with any obvious show-stoppers on the feasibility side. A feasibility exercise is needed to complete the evaluation in detail.<P>

<U>Horizon and Scope</U><BR>
		<DD>In making their assessments, Ministers will need to consider not only how the criteria apply at present, but how they are likely to apply in the medium term.<BR>
		<DD>Strictly, privatisation criteria should be applied to the public sector research establishment as a whole and to its constituent parts.  It will be reasonable to ask Departments to consider separately the key activities within each body.<BR>
		<DD>One possible framework for setting out the assessment against privatisation criteria is a matrix.  Using the framework, the criteria are in rows, and a range of status options, (privatisation, contractorisation,   etc) are columns.  The evaluation cells can either be filled in by a descriptive comment or by a summary score.<P>

<U>Appropriateness criteria</U><BR>
		<DD>In considering appropriateness, the presumption is to privatise: in other words, there is a need to turn the question around, so that it represents a judgement as to the appropriateness of keeping the body in the public sector.  It is not just a question of whether the public sector matches the performance of the private sector, nor is the	 issue purely one of saving money.  Activities which can appropriately be carried out in the private sector, should be.  This allows the public sector to concentrate on its key objectives and helps reduce the size of the public sector.<BR>
		<DD>So the question is whether there are any special reasons (for example, national policy concerns or a failure in the operation of existing markets) for keeping the activity in the public sector.<BR>
		<DD>These reasons might arise as answers to the following sorts of questions:<BR>
- Is the service provided fundamental to the operations of the public sector?  If so, the prospects for secure, competitive supplies of the service will have to be considered.<BR>
- Would privatisation impact on the way in which the Secretary of State carries out statutory duties? if so, the case for reviewing those statutory duties and alternative ways of fulfilling them would have to be considered.  The Deregulation and Contracting Out Act 1994 makes possible the use of private sector contractors in delivering a wide range of statutory services.<BR>
- Are there other special policy reasons for keeping the service in the public sector (eg defence implications, security implications, a need for independence from particular suppliers, etc) ? Could these be secured in the private sector?<BR>
- Are there special policy objectives which need to be taken into account (eg perceived issues of public confidence, the effect of disruption on other parts of the public sector, the impact on staff and management, the cost to the taxpayer)?<BR>
- Are the functions concerned already being provided on a competitive basis by other suppliers?  If so, it will be more difficult to make a case for retaining the function in the public sector.<BR>
- Would privatisation of the service produce an actual or effective monopoly or give the privatised body an unfair competitive advantage over other service providers?  If so it will be necessary to consider how the privatised body could be regulated.<BR>
- Does the business provide services which are beneficial to clients, but which they would not, in practice, purchase (either because of a lack of information or because no one client would pay the full cost of providing the service and there is no mechanism for them buying the service jointly)? if so, there may be an argument for the public sector ensuring the service is provided, though not necessarily for delivery by the public sector.<BR>
- Does the service have benefits to the economy which are not reflected in the operations of the market (eg environmental benefits, social benefits)?  If so, the most effective and efficient manner of achieving the desired result would have to be investigated.  There may be a case for either provision or subsidy from the public sector.<BR>
- Would the services if privatised be provided in a <I>less</I> efficient manner (because of a lack of information, the loss of a network, the loss of a natural monopoly, the scale of the investment involved, etc)?  If so, there would be a need to consider whether there are ways of addressing these problems.<P>

<U>Feasibility criteria</U><BR>
		<DD>The feasibility criteria consider both whether the body is in a state where it could, in principle, be sold and whether there would be any interest in buying it, funding its acquisition or contracting to provide its services.<BR>
		<DD>There is a need to consider both the current position and the possibility of changes (whether deliberately instigated as a result of the review or because of external events such as changes in the market) in the coming years.  In the same way, there is a need to consider both whether there might be interest in acquiring the business now and whether there might be interest in the future (possibly after some changes have been made to it).  Timing is therefore a crucial issue.<BR>
		<DD>A number of generic feasibility criteria are listed below.  The questions have been phrased in terms of a trade sale, but, with minor amendment, are in general equally applicable to other forms of privatisation.<BR>
- Does the business make a profit at present?  If not, can a route to financial viability be developed either as a stand-alone entity or as part of a larger organisation?<BR>
- Could performance be improved by removing public sector restrictions eg more flexible employment practices, access to new markets, raising new finance and an injection of private sector management?<BR>
- Is the business in a stable state?<BR>
- Is the business large enough to be self-standing or of interest to potential purchasers?<BR>
- Does the business represent a market opportunity for new owners?<BR>
- If required (either as a result of an assessment against the appropriateness criteria or because of an assessment of the interests of the market) , are the various business units separable?<BR>
- Are the contracts which the business has with its clients of a type which would be appropriate between a private sector provider and its clients?<BR>
- Are the financial and management information systems of the business appropriate to the needs (including audit requirements) of a private sector business?<BR>
- Would the financial and management information systems of the business allow a potential purchaser to review the past performance of the business on a commercial basis?<BR>
- What would be the transitional effects on the business and its customers of a privatisation?<BR>
- What would be the proceeds of privatisation?<BR>
- What would be the costs of the privatisation process; reorganisation; restructuring the balance sheet?<BR>
- How long would privatisation take?<BR>
- Does the business have a secure revenue stream?  Does it rely on one customer or many?<P>

<U>Existing guidance on identifying privatisation candidates</U><BR>
		<DD>The Treasury booklet <B>"Privatisation of Central Government Activities, Guidance for Departments"</B> states that:<BR>
(i) "Activities which may be suitable candidates for privatisation include those already established on a customer/supplier relationship with departmental or agency headquarters; those that do not contribute directly to the Department's or agency's central objectives; and those already performed under contract by the private sector." (paragraph 1.4)<BR>
(ii) "...Ministers may decide that parts of an activity should remain in government control for operational, statutory or market reasons." (paragraph 2.1)<BR>
		<DD>The <B>Next Steps Team</B> issues guidance on the conduct of Prior options reviews of executive agencies.<BR>
		<DD>The <B>Continuity and Change</B> White Paper (paragraph 2.25) lists the key questions as:<BR>
- Does the job need to be done at all?<BR>
- If the activity must be carried out, does the government have to be responsible for it" Since 1979 the government has pursued a consistent policy of transferring organisations which no longer need to be owned by government to the private sector.<BR>
- Where the government needs to remain responsible for an activity, does the government have to carry out the task itself?<BR>
- Where the job must be carried out within government is the organisation properly structured and focused on the job to be done?<P><HR><P>

The numbers quoted in this report can be confusing.  They will not match or add up and are not consistent.  The reason is simple: I have tried to repeat what I heard, and people used different accounting systems and different years, and most importantly had different perspectives on how to show numbers.  Measurement is critical to the UK system, but part of the game is what you measure, how you treat the data, and how you display it.  Neither the DoD group through some quite penetrating questions, nor I, have been able to gain a picture that would satisfy an auditor.  Nor was that the intent.  Thus every number is simply a ROM estimate based on the author's interpretation, and the accountants if any in the audience ane cordially invited to sort it out over here for themselves.  After a final review, I have convinced myself that the ROMs are not contradictory and probably display a reasonable first order estimate of reality, at least to within an order of magnitude.<BR>

<I><A NAME="12">(12)</A></I>  Generation of wealth and quality of life are the two key reasons for public support of S&T in the UK.  The nations science policy is laid out in the May 1993 White Paper "Realizing our Potential: A Strategy for Science, Engineering and Technology", prepared by the Office of Science and Technology.  This is discussed further in Para 5b; the key point here is that MOD and DERA are expected to coordinate with and support the civil sector.<BR>
<I><A NAME="13">(13)</A></I> "Secondary" legislation is needed to get an "affirmative order" for a specific Trading Fund, but "primary" legislation was not required for any of the changes that created DERA or other New Steps Agencies.<BR>
<I><A NAME="14">(14)</A></I> DERA managers and customers alike raved about the improvements.  The only caveat is that while bragging about productivity they also occasionally spoke of "quality of research".  Everyone waffled when pressed on how this was measured, and essentially stated that it was impossible at this point to judge what all the changes are likely to produce in the long run.  People have been working long and hard because to do otherwise would have had disastrous consequences during the "crisis".  This gets a bit old after a while, and presents a qualitative and quantitative challenge to the current and next TQ phases, when those that have "stuck it out" have every expectation of being able to live normal working lives.<BR>
<I><A NAME="15">(15)</A></I> Ratings are done with input from project managers. The rating scheme assigns up to 20 marks: 10 for current performance, 5 for track record, and 5 for demand for the individuals services<BR>
<I><A NAME="16">(16)</A></I> This concern was expressed most strongly in a later conversation between the author and Chris Fallows, Director of the Navy portion of the Applied Research Program.  The topic under discussion was ASW.  Those familiar with the history of US ASW RDT&E over the last 20 years will recognize the problems that can arise from perceptions of biased approaches to warfighting challenges.<BR>
<I><A NAME="17">(17)</A></I> This derives from the 1993 White Paper on S&T policy, discussed in more detail in Para 5b<BR>
<I><A NAME="18">(18)</A></I> DCDS(S) formulates and sponsors the entire future equipage programme for MOD, and its underpinning research base.  He is responsible for the Applied Research Program (@450M).  Of his staff of about 500, 150 are involved full time in managing research (most of them are seconded from DERA). The ARP is divided into about 50 Packages, each of which is closely monitored by a customer team at MOD.  The Corporate Research Programme under Mike Markin runs @ 160M/year.  It is managed by a staff of 10, with a "light touch" and a trusted partner relationship.  CRP has 11 technical groups, and each has three parts: Targeted Research (20%) where MOD states both what is wanted and when; Underpinning Research (35-40%) where MOD defines what technology needs to provide and DERA interprets how to get there; and Innovative Research, where DERA is simply told to be innovative.  As noted above, DERA places out about 1/3 of the CRP, mostly with industry.  Coupling to basic research, which is supported by the Research Councils, occurs in part through a Joint Grant process to which CRP and the RCs each subscribe 5M.  Additional connection mechanisms, for which ocean science is a good example, are discussed in Para 5c.<BR>
<I><A NAME="19">(19)</A></I>  The Framework requires DERA to each year prepare a five year Corporate Plan (submitted in September for approval by the end of November) and an annual Business plan (mid-February, approved by the start of the fiscal year, 1 April).  The Corporate plan sets out strategic objectives and means of meeting them, including projected organizational changes, rationalizations, and major investments.  The Business Plan includes Key Targets in the areas of financial performance, efficiency improvements, and quality of service. These are negotiated between the Secretary of State and the Chief Executive, announced to Parliament, and form the basis for assessment of DERAs and the Chief Executives performance.  John Mabberly indicated that MOD wanted a 1.5% rate reduction for the coming year, and they were running the busines model to evaluate 8 options to achieve it.<BR>
<I><A NAME="20">(20)</A></I> Work for other nations may be part of bi- or multi-lateral weapon system developments, or direct contracts for military or civil RDT&E.  The EC is unlikely to be a major DERA customer because as a body it supports strictly civil sector research, and is reluctant even to use the term dual use because of the military implications.  Elements of DRA participate - SRC is involved in a dozen EC projects - but "purely" for commercial applications.  The UK has a Cabinet-driven Dual Use Links program between MOD and the Department of Trade and Industry. The proposed mechanism, which provides that each participating ministry fund projects of mutual interest via their own channels but within the umbrella of an overall program, is currently at the EC for review of its IPR and competitive provisions.<BR>
<I><A NAME="21">(21)</A></I>  Op cit 5, para 4.9<BR>
<I><A NAME="22">(22)</A></I>  Paragraph 9.1 states, "Civilian staff in the DERA are MOD civil servants", but DERA operates as a "discrete body" within MOD (ie. different rules). "The Chief Executive will exercise an agreed level of authority on behalf of the Secretary of State...Pay, grading and personnel authorities are vested in the Chief Executive"; and he has permission to request additional authorities if he needs them.  His personal delegation letter addresses his "agreed level" of authority in more detail: "within the standards laid down by the Central Departments for the Civil Service as a whole and within the principles governing the management of the staff throughout the Department", the Chief Executive has authority up to specified (quite senior) grade levels for direct recruitment, complementing, fixed term appointments, within-agency postings, promotion, career development, discipline, pay flexibilities, training, and recruitment/redundancy.  John Chisholm noted that these rules and more importantly the basic civil service standards provide plenty of flexibility for him to accomplish his objectives<BR>
 <I><A NAME="23">(23)</A></I> DRA plans to spend 10M/year for each of the next two years to get its age distribution right.<BR>
<I><A NAME="24">(24)</A></I>  A triannual retrospective review process is used to evaluate the quality of research and teaching, and funding allocations are based on the ratings.  The many interesting aspects of UK university system and this rating process are beyond the scope of this paper.  The key point here is that there is a dual support system for university research, from the Research Councils and the Funding Councils.<BR>
<I><A NAME="25">(25)</A></I>  The 6 RCs are Biotechnology and Biological Sciences, Economic and Social, Engineering and Physical Sciences, Medical, Natural Environment, and Particle Physics and Astronomy.  As distinct from the others, PPARC is devoted almost exclusively to basic science. The major reason to separate it from EPSRC is its reliance on major international facilities (e.g. CERN), and the need to manage international subscriptions to them within the science budget without adversely impacting small science.  In addition to maintaining their PSREs, RCs offer four types of grants: 1)"Responsive-mode", aimed at developing and maintaining underlying capacity in areas of strategic importance. Only universities and academic analogues are eligible. 2) Strategic grants to support specific research aims, open to universities, RE and Ministry PSREs, and non-profits (essentially everyone but industry); 3) LINK grants for pre-competitive collaborative research in specific areas between the public and private sector with 50-50 shared funding; and 4) Contract, for development of technology and software and for information collection, open at market price to all comers.<BR>

One is responsible under the Director General of Research Councils for the RC function.  The other, directed by Mrs Helen Williams who hosted our visit.

<B>1.  Summary</B><BR>
This report basically is a reminder about NATO research funding. Much of our DoD audience may have heard about but not thought much about this programme, since it is on the civilian vice military side of the NATO house, with little connection to DRGs/AGARD (except cross-briefings).  The NATO Science Programme has a nearly 40 year distinguished history of broad based support of inter-Alliance collaborative research.  Its major mechanisms are senior teaching seminars (ASIs) and visits between collaborators.   More recently, it has established priority areas (and several additional mechanisms) for research collaboration with Cooperation Partners (CPs; essentially FWP/FSU nations).  All projects are open to application from any Alliance researcher (including those in federal labs - thus this note); the inter-Alliance programs are hotly competitive, but there are ample opportunities for support of high quality projects with CPs, especially in "S&T Policy".  The program soon will receive scrutiny for NATO relevance, and would benefit from new projects of high alliance impact.  US DoD and DoD-affiliated applicants should keep the US Mission to NATO aware of their interests.<P>

<B>2.  Description</B><P>

"In addition to its well known political and military dimensions, NATO has a "Third Dimension" which seeks to encourage interaction between peoples, to consider some of the challenges facing our modern society and to foster development of S&T.  The NATO Science Programme is a major component of the Third Dimension." (NATO Scientific Affairs Division brochure).  This programme is funded at about $30M/year, approximately 1/3 of NATOs non-military expenditures. <P>

The Programmes support of international scientific cooperation among Alliance members  ("Inter-Alliance") covers virtually any aspect of S&T of interest to member nations.  The principal mechanisms for such support are Advanced Study Institutes (ASIs, intensive high-level teaching meetings), and Collaborative Research Grants (for reciprocal visits of one to four weeks for one or two members of a collaborating team).  NATO also offers Science Fellowships (Basic, Advanced, Senior and Senior Guest, depending on the standing of the participant) for study and research in other NATO nations.  See the NATO Science Programme home page at http://www.nato.int/science for further information.  Virtually anyone from an alliance nation can apply for such support, and the program is typically oversubscribed, with success rates typical of NIH and NSF (20-30% max.).<P>

Within this general category of Inter-Alliance support there is a special Science for Stability program targeted at Greece, Portugal, and Turkey.  It is designed to enhance their S&T capacity through demonstration projects co-funded by the Programme and the participants. Examples include a waste management project in Athens, and several Black Sea programmes that have stemmed from a demo project with Turkey to evaluate fisheries resources. <P>

NATO also has identified a set of five Priority Areas for S&T efforts that involve collaboration between Alliance scientists and their colleagues from Cooperation Partners (CP; all former signatories of the Warsaw Treaty, and the derivative states of the FSU) .  In addition to ASIs and Collaborative Research Grants, projects with CP participants in these areas (primarily but not exclusively) can receive support for Advanced Research Workshops (ARWs, planning meetings to critically assess current knowledge, identify research directions, and promote international working relationships), Expert Visits (consultation be high level specialists), and Linkage Grants (reciprocal short visits for four or five members of research teams over periods of a year or two).  CP-nation scientists are also eligible for limited Science Fellowships for study or research in a NATO country.<P>

The 5 Priority Areas for projects with Cooperation Partners were selected for their relevance to the public perception of NATO. They are:  <BR>
1) Environmental Security (cleanup of the cold war military despoilment legacy), <BR>
2) Disarmament Technology (S&T issues arising from NBC and conventional weapon disarmament and nonproliferation treaties and conventions, and reapplication of skills), <BR>
3) High Technology (which had been nurtured by Defense establishments; the issue now is reapplication.  Topics include IT, biotech, and non-nuclear energy), <BR>
4) S&T Policy (especially laws and regulations supporting the research framework, e.g. IPR, marketing, innovation, tech transfer), and <BR>
5) Computer Networking (at grass roots).  <BR>
Applications for support for programs with Cooperation Partners must originate from an Alliance source; and the funds will be granted to, and managed by, that source (this is an acknowledged weakness; it is difficult to properly transfer funds to participants in some of the CP nations, and this places the responsibility in the hands of scientists who are usually not experienced in such matters).  The success rate for proposals to these programs is much higher than for inter-Alliance ones.  Again, proposals can be submitted by anyone, in government or out, given that they have an appropriate Cooperation Partner co-PI.  The Scientific Affairs Division indicated it is particularly interested in increasing the number of quality proposals that provide advice, exchange, and research in the area of S&T policy, IPR, technology transfer, career mobility, and similar topics.<P>

The programme, and its management by the Science Affairs Division (staff of 20 with 6 scientists.  The Assistant Secretary General for many years has been Jean Marie Cadiou; the Deputy is Paul C. Rambaut) is overseen by two subcommittees of the North Atlantic Council.  This can cause some confusion.  The first is straightforward: the NATO Science Committee, comprised of one representative from each of the 16 NATO nations, has primary oversight responsibility.  It meets yearly to review the nature and quality of the efforts, and determine priorities.  The US representative is Bill Brinkman of AT&T labs; he receives his US policy guidance, including input from the US Mission to NATO, the State Departments Bureau of Oceans, Environment, and Scientific Affairs (OES).  <P>

The second oversight group is the Committee on Challenges of the Modern Society (CCMS), established in 1969 to give the alliance a "social dimension".  Its current major thrust is environmental security, and this is one of the Priority Areas for NATO Science Programme funding to cooperation partners; hence the possibility for confusion.  As opposed to Science Programme funded projects which focus on new knowledge, however, CCMS projects are designed to provide advice to, and interactions between, governments.  The main CCMS mechanism is Pilot Projects, for which funding is totally provided by the participating nations.  The Science Affairs Division arranges for the nations to participate and helps coordinate and oversee the projects under the NATO umbrella (it also supports and arranges seminars and conferences and sponsors a Clearing House for Environmental Technical Information on the web at http://echs.ida.org/).  An exemplary pilot project is "Cross-Border Environmental Problems Emanating from Defense-Related Installations and Activities Phase II", which is concerned with radioactive material dumped in the Kara and Barents Seas, and radioactive runoff from the FSU. Principals are Norway, Germany and the US, and there are several associate nations.  Like the Science Committee, CCMS has one representative from each of the 16 NATO nations.  The US representative is Wendy Grieder of EPA; her State Department guidance is staffed by EUR, with heavy input from DoD. <P>

<B>3.  Discussion</B><P>

DoD lab scientists involvement with NATO research has traditionally been through DRG panels or AGARD.  There has also been considerable DoD interest in CCMS projects.  However, DoD scientists are welcome to compete for participation in virtually all aspects of the NATO science Programme.  Members of this staff and our Air Force and Army colleagues at EOARD and ERO have attended several ARIs and ARWs and found them to very informative and of extremely high quality.  We have also helped cosponsor some or augment attendance to them, through our visit and conference support projects.<P>

Like many S&T programs, the magnitude and relevance of NATOs efforts are being questioned by senior management in view of tighter budgets and other pressing priorities. The programme likely will be subjected to scrutiny over the next year or two, with particular attention to the special Priority Areas for Cooperation Partners.  There are three ways in which interested DoD researchers may be able to help: the first is to participate, either as a PI or as a member of a project team.  The second is to help colleagues from CPs identify NATO collaborators and prepare good proposals (i.e. spread the work and help make connections).  The third is for those who have experience with the programme to let the US Mission to NATO know your views, good or bad; and to inform them of particular interests so that these can be passed to the US representative.  To keep them from being inundated, we at ONREur would be happy to act as a collator of comments.<P>

<B>1.  Summary</B><BR>
Turkey is a staunch ally, a strong NATO partner, and a "Big Emerging Market" with a rapidly growing but volatile economy.  The Turkish Defense Forces remain a highly respected and powerful force for Turkeys secular western orientation.  The Turkish General Staff recognizes the multiple security threats in the region, and plans continued modernization accompanied by expansion of indigenous defense industries through co-production and technology transfer.  Turkey historically has invested very little in R&D, but both defense and commercial trends indicate a significant upswing in the near future; and the Universities, exemplified by the Middle East Technical University (METU), are ready and eager to respond.  One area where Turkey does have a significant world-class scientific capability is oceanography.  Turkish ocean scientists play a leading role in physical and biogeochemical studies of the Eastern Mediterranean and the Black Sea.  The Black Sea is of interest intrinsically, geopolitically, and as a model for both environmental processes and approaches to the remediation of a badly damaged ecosystem.  This newsletter briefly treats this set of issues: defense cooperation and modernization, the Turkish S&T Research Council, METU and its structure for innovation, and METUs Institute of Marine Sciences and the status and plans for Black Sea studies.<P>


<B>2.  Background.</B><BR>
The main purpose of this trip was to get an update on Black Sea oceanographic programs from Prof. Umit Unluata, Director of the Middle East Technical Universitys (METU) Institute of Marine Sciences (IMS); he is a prime mover of many of them.  I also visited the main METU campus in Ankara, the Turkish Science and Technology Research Council (TUBITAK), and the US Embassy (ODC, Commercial Attach, Ambassador).  This report provides my general impressions based on these discussions and on personal observations (mostly for my own benefit, to capture the key points I derived from the visit - corrections from those more knowledgeable would be appreciated), plus a brief description of Black Sea programs and IMS-METU contributions.<P>

Turkey has for decades been a steadfast ally and NATO partner, "at the crossroads of almost every issue of importance to the United States on the Eurasian continent" <I>(1)</I>.  "Turkey remains the southeastern bulwark of NATO.  It is a focal  point for our interests in the Balkans, the Caucasus, the Middle East, and Central Asia.  Turkey has contributed to peace-keeping efforts in Bosnia, continues to maintain the sanctions against Iraq at great economic cost, and fully supports the Middle East Peace Process. " <I>(2)</I><P>

Turkey also is a land of stark contrasts and major challenges.  Compared to my last visit some 20 years ago, the major cities are much more westernized.  The goods available (and the marketing) in the upscale shops of Ankara equal those of western Europe; in some malls I would have been hard pressed to even identify what country I was in had it not been for the language.  Significant sectors of industry flourish.  Roads are vastly improved.  Even the secondary and tertiary roads in Anatolia were in excellent repair, and the major routes are heavily utilized by international truck traffic.  The south-central part of the country through which we drove was intensively cultivated (except in the high mountains), and the cropland and vineyards were well maintained (except for parts of the southern coast where unfinished tourist hotels have encroached on the farmland).  However the smaller villages were if anything in worse shape, and the non-urban population appeared at least no better off than in the mid 70s. Villages appear to have been stuck in a time warp.  Turkey remains rightly famous for the bargain prices of its time-intensive hand made products, and for the value for dollar of tourism, rugs, silver, onyx and similar goods.  Labor is still extremely cheap, and salaries even for the professionals (especially for academics) low. <P>

The contrasts are starting to show at the national level.  While Turkey remains the only secular democracy in a Muslim country, the Islamic factions are on the rise.  The Islamic Welfare (Rafeh) party received the largest vote in the last national election (>20%, nearly double their showing in 91); and Turkish colleagues commented on the active, and apparently successful, political organizing efforts of fundamentalist groups.  The contrasts in clothing (mens and womens), transport (Mercedez-Benz vs donkeys) and womens roles and positions between city and village are patently obvious.  So are the greatly uneven distribution of wealth, the fact that large parts of the economy operate beyond the effective reach of the government, and the centuries of difference in life styles between segments of the population.  <P>

Turkeys challenges are economic, societal, and military. GNP has grown an average of 4.8% per year since 1981 (the highest in OECD).  The private sector is dynamic and expanding rapidly.  Some sectors, e.g. construction, compete effectively world wide. However the legal infrastructure for open participation in the global market (thus foreign investment) is not fully in place.  Inflation remains very high, and growth is extremely variable (e.g., the financial crisis and -6% GNP change in 94).  Overall the economy is dangerously volatile, due in large part to the continued dominance, and poor performance, of the public sector.  Further structural reform (e.g. continued privatization, revamping of the social security system, and expansion of the tax base to sectors which now operate outside it) is known to be needed, but seems politically impossible to implement.  Turkeys economy also has been adversely affected by its support of the sanctions on Iraq, exacerbating the structural deficiencies (oil started to flow again just as we left).  Turkey this year entered the EU Common Market, and the US views Turkey as one of the 10 "Big Emerging Markets"; but lacking significant government reforms that could accelerate growth and temper volatility, short term uncertainties are likely to outweigh long term potential for years to come, and the contrasts are likely to widen, further abetting the rise of fundamentalism and other symptoms of discontent.<P>

While most other NATO nations are decreasing their defense budgets in the continued wake of the Cold War, Turkey perceives its threats and military commitments to be increasing <I>(3)</I>.  Its relationships with nearly all of its neighbors are troubled (e.g. water rights with Syria, the PKK and Kurdish issues with Iraq and Iran, historic enmity with Greece exacerbated by Greek posturing re 12nm limits in the Aegean, not to mention terrorism and drugs internally).  Turkey highly values its  international ties, especially through NATO and the UN, and participates heavily in peacekeeping and other coalition operations.  <P>

Given its perception of the environment in its part of the world, the defense budget -- at 3.5% of GNP and 12% of the federal budget <I>(4)</I> -- will remain high.  Turkey also has reason to question the dependability of its traditional partners.  Special NATO support (e.g. Science for Stability) is drawing to a close as NATO moves to expand to the newly independent states and PfP; Turkey is unlikely to gain desired entry into the EU; and the US - long a staunch ally - has drastically reduced its support since 93 and failed to follow through on commitments <I>(5)</I> <P>

Societally, in addition to the contrasts already mentioned, Turkey continues to grapple with human rights, gender, and environmental issues.  Interestingly, one of the hot topics during my visit was Turkeys new ban on smoking in public buildings.  This seemed to be cause for much comment (where it was known) but little perceptible change.<P>

<B>3. Defense Cooperation & Turkish Military Procurement</B><BR>
The US Office of Defense Cooperation in Ankara is headed by a two star flag officer (currently Air Force MG Huot), and has a staff of about 40 US.  Although part of the rationale for the offices size and the ODCs rank is historical, the ODC serves as the US point of contact for the Turkish General Staff (TGS; still very powerful and prestigious), and assists with coordination of ongoing operations from and within Turkey <I>(6)</I>.  This summary, however, will focus on the military equipment aspects of cooperation (largely via the Defense Cooperation in Armaments, DCA, Program), and Turkish plans for defense modernization.  It is based on discussions with and papers provided by representatives of the ODC and Embassy; I was unable to visit the Turkish Army Brigadier General who heads the R&D section in the Ministry of National Defense because we did not receive TGS clearance in time.<P>

The DCA program is based on the Defense and Economic Cooperation Agreement of March 80, and its Supplementary Agreement No.2, Defense Industrial Cooperation.  "Since 1946, the US has transferred over $13.6 billion in security assistance to Turkey: $7.6 billion as grants, $6.0 billion as loans.  Assistance since 1962 totals over $11 billion, about evenly split between grants and loans.  Total since 1990: $1.4 billion as grants, $1.7 billion in loans" <I>(7)</I>.  Since 1994, however, all security assistance (@ $1.2B) has been in the form of Foreign Military Financing (FMF) treasury rate loans.  <P>

In parallel with the shift in the financial nature of the assistance from grants to preferential to treasury rate loans, the nature of cooperation has shifted from FMS sales and transfer of excess defense articles, to co-production, technology transfer, R&D cooperation, and multi-national initiatives.  Maj Bill Belknap, USA, of the DCA office stated that the keys to cooperation these days are co-production, technology transfer, and sovereignty, i.e. indigenous versions of all equipment.  As a matter of policy offsets are required, and the Turkish defense procurement establishment actively seeks Turkish industry participation in any overseas procurement.  Turkey wants to become not only its own major defense supplier, but also an arms exporter.<P>

In spite of the current strain on DCA efforts due to the delay in transfer of high profile weapons systems (Frigates, Cobras, Mk 82 bombs, Seahawk helos), there are a significant number of ongoing major Security Assistance/DCA programs (F-16 co-production and maintenance, KC-135 Tanker lease, AMRAAM, Pedestal Mounted Stinger, attack helos, ATACMs, Harpoon and Seasparrow missiles, Knox Class FF maintenance, and Frigate modernization and production).  However the US is by no means Turkeys only partner; e.g., Germany has the prime for the MAKO Frigate construction program (and will likely retain this role for the Frigate 2000 program; although as opposed to MAKO where 4 are being built in each country, all of the new class will be constructed at The Turkish Navys shipyard at Goljuk), and Israel recently won a major contract for F4 upgrades.  More significantly, all current US-Turkey co-production programs end by 1999.  The DCA is thus rightly concerned that US firms win new procurement contracts in order for us to remain engaged with this long term ally.  The two biggest near-term prospects are tank modernization (Army is pushing for M1A2 co-production; the Turkish RFI is expected in early 97 for a program worth about $4-5B) and the next generation Frigate (Frigate 2000; $2.4B for a build of 4-6 ships.  US industry was not sent the RFI for the prime - presumably because of the current transfer impasse - but has received the RFI for major subsystems, and Lockheed-Martin is pushing the SPY-1F for the air defense system, the expected major competition being TNOs AFAR).<P>

There are both security and financial reasons for maintaining an active US role in Turkish defense procurements.  The first - interoperability, stability, etc.-- rests on Turkeys pivotal role and geographic position, in the region and in coalition operations.  The second is the size and content of the TGSs long range modernization plan, which calls for expenditures of some $67B between 1995 and 2004, and projects a total spend of about $150B over the next 25-30 years <I>(8)</I>.   At issue however are the ability of Turkey to accomodate TGSs appetite, the lack of priority accorded Turkey as US and NATO focus on PfP as the centerpiece for engagement and stability, and the Ambassadors understandable concern that the US ODC and defense industry not get out ahead of the USs political willingness to commit to major defense sales in the region.<P>

Turkeys process and organization for defense procurement are interesting.  First, they seem do little direct internal R&D outside of defense industry (there are no MND or TGS labs; and the TUBITAK Defense R&D lab only has about 110 people), but rather rely on partners innovations and then competitively procure the most modern available products, insisting on technology transfer.  They are however astute regarding the status of major defense developments abroad, carefully study the options and competitive possibilities before issuing RFIs, and pursue focused product-development R&D in defense industries.<P>

The TGS and the MND each report directly to the Prime Minister (of the two, the TGS is by far the more powerful).  Tactical and technical requirements are developed by the TGS (or by the office of the CNO for the much smaller Navy; presumably similar for the Air Force. There seems to be little effort to generate Joint requirements) and levied on MND.  Based on these, one of several materiel commands (each service has one for spares and services; the "Foreign Procurement Department" of MND does in-country end-item acquisition; and the Undersecretariat for Defense Industry [SSM] handles overseas procurements and joint ventures - more on them below) conducts the actual procurement, starting with an analysis of the investment required and the appropriate course of action.  <P>

After the resulting "investment project" is approved by the Defense Industry Executive Committee (PM, Chief of the TGS, and MND), project groups from the procurement command (often with heavy TGS participation) undertake the actual acquisition.  For non-indigenous items, SSM conducts procurements in two separate stages: "solicitations are released to perspective international and national contractors who present their articles for testing and demonstration and then present their technical, national industrial cooperation and economic proposals (<I>read offsets, co-production, etc</I>). Once a contractor is selected, then negotiations begin for a firm fixed contract <I>(9)</I>".  This is a nicely efficient fly-before-buy approach, and gives SSM and the TGS an in-depth look at what is available as well as the deals they are likely to get, before they ever commit to a tough cost negotiation.<P>

MNDs SSM (Savunma Sanayii Mustesarligi), according to its brochure, was established in 1985 as a "separate legal entity" with the responsibility for "developing the national defense industry, while meeting the modern defense needs of the Turkish Armed Forces".  Its defense industry projects are financed through the Defense Industry Support Fund, "established independently outside the national budget framework", which is funded from shares of various taxes (income, corporate, fuel), surcharges on tobacco and alcohol, and lotteries.  It thus has both a business development and a procurement role; its brochure includes among its missions: conduct feasibility studies and economic evaluations, negotiate and sign contracts and manage production and quality control, develop new capabilities of the national defense industry and integrate and support current capabilities, promote export-oriented joint ventures and bring in state-of-the art technologies, plan weapon system production in both state and private enterprises, and coordinate offsets and exports.  One of its roles is to provide financial support and credits to Turkish defense industries.<P>

The Turkish defense industries themselves have an interesting mix of public and private ownership.  The public side is represented by the "Turkish Armed Forces Foundation", formed from individual Service Foundations in 1987.  The Foundations President is the Minister of National Defense, and its other Trustees are the Deputy Chief of the TGS, the Undersecretary of MND, and the head of SSM.  It is tax exempt, and can accept "donations", for which it awards documents and medals.  From its income it makes allotments to armed forces projects.  <P>

The Turkish Armed Forces Foundation operates as a holding company, and owns both real property (including a marina and a resort [naval training] facility on the Mediterranean), and shares (from less than 1% to almost 98%) of the major Turkish defense industries.  It also is the sole operator of the biannual IDEF, or Defense Industry and Civil Aviation Fairs.  It has a wide range of partnering and shareholding relationships in 17 main industries (and some 25 others): e.g., 97.9% ownership of Havelsan (electronics depot level maintenance and repair), 95 % of Aspilsan (batteries etc), 15% of Roketsan (a government-private consortium that started with the production of the propulsion system for the European Stinger Co-production Program), 86% of Aselsan (radios, C3, EW) and 45% ownership of Tusash (SSM owns the other 55%) that in turn owns 49% of TAI - the airframe and assembly facility for the F-16 co-production (other partners include Lockheed, Turkey 42%, GE International 7%, and the Turkish Armed Forces Foundation directly 1.9%) - and is a co-owner with the Foundation and GE of TEI, which manufactures aircraft engines and components.  <P>

The bottom line of all of this is that directly, and through SSM and the Foundation, the TGS has pretty complete control over Turkish defense requirements, procurement procedures, and production.  The TGS clearly believes that to meet the increase in threats it is necessary to develop defense industrial capacity; and that "defense industries, inherent to their structure, would need continuous direction, support, and control by the state" <I>(10)</I>.  And if, as they clearly intend, most of the $150B of expected procurement is kept in-country through tech transfer and co-production, and marketing of defense products is a state policy, over the next decade or two Turkey will switch from being a "Big Emerging Market" to a Big Arms Supplier.<P>

Finally, associated with this push to develop industrial capacity and expand foreign sales is a recognition of the need to develop an internal R&D capability, steered and coordinated by the central procurement organization.  Although there is already some R&D within the defense industries, the TGS recognizes that Turkeys intellectual potential and scientific expertise resides in the universities.  It intends to establish closer collaboration between them and the state and industry.  Thus it can be expected that the TGS and MND will support an increase in R&D (currently and historically between 0.3 and 0.5% of GNP).  Direct military funding of university research also is expected (and eagerly awaited by the researchers) for the first time in 1997.<P>

<B>4.  TUBITAK and Turkish S&T</B><BR>
The Turkish Scientific and Technical Research Council, TUBITAK, is Turkeys "exclusive body" for S&T <I>(11)</I>.  The President of TUBITAK reports directly to the Prime Minister; he also chairs the Scientific Advisory Board which is the key S&T decision-making body.  Tubitaks annual budget is on the order of $50M, indicative of the traditional neglect of S&T by the federal government.  TUBITAK however attempts to leverage regional and international programs to supplement the meager national support.  TUBITAK has seven roles:<P>

(1) Its primary function is as a funding agency, like NSF.  It has competitive research grant programs in eight disciplines, each with an Executive Director. <BR>
(2) It owns and operates three Research Institutes: BILTEN at METU (described in more detail below), one in the defense sector (about 110 employees; NFI), and the Marmara Research Center (MRC) near Istanbul.  MRC has a staff of about 800 (half S&T, half support) and a broad scope of work.  TUBITAK has subjected it to two recent external reviews, and hired consultants from TNO to help turn it into a contract research organization.  As a result, contract research has increased from about 5% to 40%, about the level desired. <BR>
(3) TUBITAK is a human resource development organization: It manages a program of scholarships for elite students, starting at the high school level and extending through postgraduate work, to develop the most promising S&T talent.<BR>
(4) It is the national Science Policy Institute, reporting through a Secretariat (President and Vice President of TUBITAK) to the Supreme Council of S&T, chaired by the PM and comprised of all the Ministers.  VP Prof Pak noted that this was both good and bad - it has all the necessary horsepower, but on the other hand S&T is seldom an important enough issue to get their attention.  Although by law it is supposed to convene yearly, it last met early in 1993.  In the interim the Secretariat deals with dynamic policy issues.<BR>
(5) Its is an Informatics Institute: it implemented the national Internet connection (through METU), which has now been privatized (and seems to work well, from the connectivity that I observed - though it doesnt yet serve the villages, etc).  TUBITAK will now focus on enhancing the academic network.<BR>
(6) It is an International institute - responsible for bilateral and international (e.g. with NATO, EC, and the UN) S&T interactions and agreements.<BR>
(7) It supports Industrial R&D; R&D is the only permissible industrial incentive (GATT), so TUBITAK encourages and supports market oriented research.<P>

<B>5.  Middle East Technical University (METU; Orta Dogu Teknik Universitesi)</B><BR>
METU is located on the SW outskirts of Ankara, 7km from city center, on a huge tract of land (thousands of hectares) granted when it was founded in 1956.  It is a state-funded, public University with nearly 20K students (95% Turkish), 680 faculty members, 250 instructors and almost 900 research associates.  METU has 38 Departments in 5 undergraduate Faculties (Engineering, Arts and Sciences, Architecture, Economic and Administrative Sciences and Education) and a "Technical High School", plus Graduate Schools of Natural and Applied Sciences, Social Sciences, and Marine Sciences.<P>

The University has deliberately maintained an international perspective.  Some 10% of the faculty is international, and about the same number of the Turkish faculty is abroad annually as researchers or visiting professors.  About 70% of full-time faculty have studied abroad, and most have their advanced degrees from foreign universities and retain close ties with their international colleagues.<P>

Having celebrated its 40th anniversary this year, METU boasts mostly modern facilities with excellent computer and Internet access throughout.  Classes are all taught in English (students have up to two years to qualify in a preparatory English school). Most students are admitted by a National Competitive Exam (as in Ireland: the top students get first choice of school and Department; METU draws the upper 1%).<P>

My host was Prof. Dr. Cemal Saydam, an oceanographer who recently returned from IMS to set up an environmental remote sensing program in Ankara. In addition to visiting his new satellite down-link lab and discussing his research (currently the impact of Saharan dust on plankton blooms, and a NATO SfS project on snowfall and water volumes in the Euphtretes catchment basin) I met with the METU President and both Vice Presidents, and toured the Computer Center, Mechanical Engineering CAD/CAM and Robotics Center, and the EE Department and TUBITAK BILTEN.  The Computer and CAD/CAM Centers were both modern and well equipped.  METU established, and till recently managed, Turkey's Internet connections; it still serves as the international interface for all Turkish Universities.  The campus has a fiber optic backbone to most academic and administrative units, for communications and access to the 8-node IBM SP2.  There are numerous PC and workstation rooms for teaching and research.  <P>

Similar to the Universities I have visited in western europe, METU is working to greatly expand its research program and develop closer ties with industry in support of national objectives (in its case, even in advance of stated policy).  It already has a number of mechanisms to promote and enhance its research capabilities, and is in the process of establishing the "METU-TECHnolopolis Complex", a combined science and business park, with living quarters, on 210 hectares next to the main campus.  Part of the impetus for this activity is Turkey's entry into the EU common market and the associated need for improved quality to meet the demands of the EU market; Turkey also recognizes that private industry is the key to its competitiveness and in particular to commercial penetration beyond its borders.  GATT restrictions that limit federally funded industrial incentives to R&D also will change historical Turkish patterns of industrial support and should generate additional research funds.<P>

The University obtains government research funding from four primary sources.  The first and most traditional is TUBITAK, through both competitive programs and BILTEN.  Second is the Technology Development Fund, run jointly by private industry and the State Planning Office, with assistance from the World Bank.  It has provided about $40M in support for some 60 projects over the last 3-4 years, with equivalent in-kind support from industry.  Third is the special support directly from the PM's office for issues related to defense, anticipated to begin next year.  This work will be done by university-industry consortia, and is eagerly anticipated.  METU already does some R&D for MND/TGS and is prepared to expand its role.  Fourth is international agencies.  The list of research projects I was provided showed sponsorship from NATO (Science for Stability Program and other parts of the NATO Science Programme, CCMS, and AGAARD), the UN (UNESCO, UNIDO, UDP, FAO, GEF), the EC (EUREKA, and Framework projects via collaboration with scientists from EU nations), foreign nations (Germany, UK, US - NSF, ONR and NASA), and the IAEA.  Private industry - Turkish and international (e.g. Volkswagen, Motorola) - also has started to invest in R&D at the university.  Overall there are about 600 individual research projects, with an annual budget over $25M.<P>

METU has not just recently started active solicitation of research; it has had a contract research organization and program for 30 years.  A number of private and state industries - electronics, rockets, and software - started on campus.  The University brochure lists some 20 Research Centers which report to the Departments, and another seven centers (some R&D, some educational, some support such as testing) that report to the office of the President.  To supplement this, the METU Development Foundation operates seven private companies, in areas as diverse as construction, publishing (the University Press), education (a private high school), food production and distribution, and electronics, computers, and software.  These provide supplementary employment for staff and students.  The computer center director noted that without the opportunity for such work, his staff - whose University salaries are about 1/4 of what they could earn downtown - would quickly disappear; the CAD-CAM center likewise undertakes commercial development.  In addition there are several jointly owned and operated centers and labs on campus including the Air Force-METU Development and Post-Graduate Center, the International Center for Heat and Mass Transfer, the Ministry of Energy and Petroleum Testing lab, and the Chemical Industries Assn Chemical Engineering Rsch Center.<P>

TUBITAK's Information Technologies and Electronics Research Institute (BILTEN, which was started in 1985 and now has about 120 staff) is another campus-based research organization.  Students and faculty are involved in some 15 project groups (in areas such as computer hardware and software, electronics and communications, image processing, power and control systems, GIS, multi-media products, etc. See Para. 8, Contacts, for additional information), which are primarily staffed by 65-70 full time engineers.  New groups, based around the interests of a faculty member who will serve as director of the research unit, are initially funded by TUBITAK, but are expected to attract commercial investment.  The initial goal was to achieve a 50-50 split by 2000, but this was achieved this year.  TUBITAK retains patents on inventions, but the participating industry receives a cost-free license for 5-7 years; and the BILTEN researchers receive 30% of net profits.

Overall then, much as I saw in Ireland, there already are a variety of University and state supported mechanisms by which a university faculty member or research associate can become actively involved in research, and supplement their low state salary while helping national competitiveness.  The Vice President noted that the weak point is that until now, they haven't been able to organize to take on large projects.  They are trying to develop a mechanism so that faculty from different departments can work with industry on major, multidisciplinary projects.  The President stated that his priorities for investment from the University Research Fund are information technologies, microelectronics, materials, and biotechnology.  I saw evidence of this investment in the well-equipped research and teaching labs of Asst Prof Tayfun Akin, who recently received his PhD from the University of Michigan and is actively pursuing MMIC developments with US and Belgian colleagues under both University and NATO SfS support.  Finally, as previously noted, the TECHnolopolis -- offering land and facilities conveniently close to Ankara and with tight ties to the University's intellectual, communications, and recreation resources, should provide a major boost to METU's rapidly growing research agenda.<P>

Given its high quality faculty (with their good international contacts and fluency in English) and student body, its infrastructure, the supportive policy and regulatory environment, the growing strength of Turkish private industry, and the multiple incentives for expanded government investment in R&D (both defense and civil), METU would appear to have the potential to emerge as an extremely strong international research institution within the next decade. <P>

<B>6.  METU Institute of Marine Sciences, Erdemli</B><BR>
METUs IMS (<A HREF="mailto:ims-metu@deniz.ims.metu.edu.tr">ims-metu@deniz.ims.metu.edu.tr</A>) is one of four major Turkish institutions that conduct large scale oceanographic research in contiguous waters <I>(12)</I>. It is located on a dedicated campus about 5km west of Erdemli (45 km west of Mersin), directly on the Turkish Mediterranean coast.  In addition to research facilities and administrative offices, IMS has a small marina (which accommodates its two 16m boats, although its 40m research vessel R/V BELIM is too large to conveniently use it and is homeported further to the west), and housing for faculty and students and a small number of visitors.  These facilities, combined with its library, data processing and computing center, and satellite imaging and processing center, make it an ideal location to serve as the hub of Black Sea and Eastern Mediterranean collaborative oceanography programs.  <P>

IMS was founded in 1975.  Like the rest of METU, it has maintained close ties with the international community, and in particular with US scientists interested in the Mediterranean and Black Seas.  IMS has a faculty of 20, and about the same number of graduate students; it has awarded a total of 64 MS and 18 PhD degrees.  Its primary strengths are physical and chemical oceanography, marine biogeochemistry, and fisheries biology. It also has a small G&G program.  Recent major research activities include circulation dynamics and biogeochemistry of the Levantine Basin, the Sea of Marmara and the Black Sea, dynamical/climatological and forecasting models for these seas, Black Sea ecology and productivity, dynamics and environmental health of the Turkish Straits, and the influence of atmospheric pollutants.  The research program is supported by a combination of TUBITAK, State Planning Organization, and other Turkish Ministry and state industry grants, and funding from UN (IOC, GEF), NATO, IAEA, the US and the British Council for international Black Sea and Eastern Mediterranean projects.  The Director is Prof. Umit Unluata, a physical oceanographer, whom I first met when we were both in graduate school at MIT in the early 1970s.<P>

I had the opportunity to discuss in some depth the current research projects of three of the physical oceanographers.  Sukru Besiktepe, the Assistant Director, is supervising the development of the multinational Black Sea Data Base under the NATO TU-Black Sea Project (see below), and modifying and applying the Harvard Ocean Prediction System models for the Black Sea.  Temel Oguz is continuing his work on the wind and thermohaline driven circulation of the Black Sea, and with US colleagues is developing a physical-biochemical model of plankton productivity and nitrogen cycling in the Black Sea.  Emin *zsoy is working on exchange and mixing processes in the Turkish Straits (some of the field work for this effort was conducted from the SACLANTCTR ship R/V ALLIANCE), and topographic effects on coastal and shelf circulation.  All are excellent scientists who work closely with top US and European researchers.<P>

As noted above, however, my primary interest was in getting an update on the Black Sea Programs, where Turkey has a leading role.  The Black Sea is interesting intrinsically, as a test basin for physical and ecosystem model intercomparisons, and as an example of regional cooperation among very diverse nations facing common environmental challenges.  The Black Seas surface area is about 4.2 x 10<sup>5</sup> km<sup>2</sup>; it has a wide shelf (depth <100) on the western and northwestern margins, and steep slopes with very complex topography along the rest, leading to the flat 2200 m deep abyssal plain of the central basin.  It is almost totally landlocked; the only external exchange is via two-layer flow through the shallow and narrow (and strategically important) Bosporous.  Its overall mass budget and hydrochemical structure depend critically on its hydrologic balance; precipitation and runoff exceed evaporation by about 300 km3, balanced by the net surface outflux through the Bosporous.  The geography and hydrology drive a complex flow, the major features being two sub-basin scale cyclonic gyres, and quasi-permanent anticyclonic eddies along the margins, driven by interactions of the rim current with topography and baroclinic instabilities. Because of its restricted exchange the Black Sea is anoxic in the 87% of its volume below the permanent pycnocline; below 100-200m, the waters are rich in hydrogen sulfide and devoid of life except for bacteria.<P>

Even beyond its unique natural characteristics, the Black Sea is of international concern because of the severity of the anthropogenic degradation of its environment and resources.  Its major freshwater sources are the Danube, Dnester, and Dneper, which drain much of Europe, southern Russia and the Ukraine (and Chernobyl). Huge inputs of heavily mineralized nutrients have caused widespread eutrophication of much of its euphotic zone; heavy metals, pesticides, and hydrocarbons have led to rapid rise of toxicity, especially on the northwestern shelf.  Symptoms of ecological collapse include loss of vast areas of seagrass, nearly total disappearance of benthos over much of the shelf, drastic reductions in plankton diversity, extreme decline of fisheries, and rapid spread of exotics such as the ctenophore Mnemiopsis (introduced in ballast water), which feeds on fish eggs, larvae, and copepods, and has further exacerbated the loss of fish and shellfish stocks.  The Black Sea has been viewed by many as a harbinger of the disasters that could befall other semi-enclosed seas such as the Mediterranean and Baltic, in the absence of drastic remediative measures <I>(13</I>). <P>

My interest in the Black Sea began at WHOI, where following a major 1988 cruise to the area by the R/V Knorr, I was able to provide some funding for the then-Director of WHOIs Coastal Research Center, Dr. David Aubrey, to participate in a 1990 joint coastal wave experiment in Bulgaria.  The participants in that experiment all encouraged Dr Aubrey and WHOI to help establish a joint program in the Black Sea. The series of planning meetings that ensued culminated in the first major oceanographic collaboration among all the Black Sea riparian states, a five ship joint hydrographic cruise entitled HydroBlack 91.  At the end of the cruise, Dr. Aubrey chaired an international workshop attended by some 130 participants and other interested scientists in Varna, Bulgaria.  At that meeting the participants agreed to continue their joint efforts, and established the "Cooperative Marine Science Program for the Black Sea", or CoMSBlack, with a Steering and Executive Committees comprising representatives of each of the riparian nations (Bulgaria, Romania, Turkey, Ukraine, Russia, and Georgia), the U.S., and the IOC (ex-officio).  Dr Aubrey served as its first Chairman.  (See Para 8, Contacts, for a list of key participants in this and other Black Sea programs). <P>

CoMSBlack was and remains a self-initiated, non-governmental organization of participating scientists, designed to bring together the oceanographic specialists from the region (and interested colleagues from the US and Western Europe).  Its terms of reference include coordination, where necessary, of regional scientific programs throughout the Black Sea; conduct of high quality, internationally recognized oceanographic science, communicated through open international channels; and the provision of high quality scientific input to effective and integrated management of the area and remediation of its ecological problems <I>(14)</I>.  The basic program objectives were to provide the underpinning knowledge of the physical and biochemical conditions and processes, and the associated models, that would be needed for wise management decisions; and to develop a cadre of collaborative scientists from around the area who would be willing to work together at sea, share their data, and employ common procedures.<P>

CoMSBlack has, in my opinion, been a great success. During its first five years it coordinated three types of programs: general surveys, process studies, and research into coastal seas circulation dynamics and fluxes. It coordinated at least one major multi-ship cruise per year, produced nearly a hundred publications, and perhaps most importantly developed a team of 60 to 100 scientists from around the region who collaborate well, have inter-calibrated their instruments, use common manuals and procedures, and share their data and models.  It was officially adopted as a programme of the International Oceanographic Commission of UNESCO in 1993.  The participants agreed this year to continue it for a second 5-year phase, under the joint chairmanship of Dr Unluata and Dr. Valery Eremeev, Director of the Marine Hydrophysical Institute, Sevastopol.  In its 2nd phase, it will focus more on shelf and nearshore processes.<P>

CoMSBlack was never actually funded as a major "program" per se.  Rather, participants obtained support for their activities under its aegis from a variety of sources including NSF and ONR, IOC, private foundations, private individuals, and the local national governments.  National governments have provided the vast majority of support for the data collection and analysis, routed through their Institutions.  CoMSBlack has served as the facilitator for these efforts, and because of its non-governmental nature has avoided politics.  It also has served as the catalyst for at least some of the other multi-national programs in the area, and as a result aspects of its objectives are resfected in them.<P>

One of these is the NATO Science for Stability Programme, "Ecosystem modeling as a management tool for the Black Sea: A regional programme of multi-institutional cooperation" (TU - BLACK SEA; funded by a combination of $1.5M NATO-SfS and Turkeys State Planning Organization, with in-kind participation from collaborating institutions <I>(15)</I>), approved in July 1993 and scheduled to conclude in 1997.  Prof Unluata is Project Director.  TU - BLACK SEA is a follow-on to an earlier Turkish SfS fisheries assessment project; it focuses on lower trophic levels and incorporates CoMSBlack's multinational collaborative approach.  To quote the Projects brochure, "the purpose of the TU - BLACK SEA project is to develop and implement ecosystem models as a management tool for improving the health of the Black Sea and also to help build the capacity within the riparian countries for high quality oceanographic measurement and analysis capabilities for carrying out long term monitoring of the Black Sea following the completion of the project."  <P>

TU- BLACK SEA has three major objectives: to establish a common database management system in all Black Sea countries for oceanographic and environmental data (the data base now has over 125 MB of data; several Russian scientists were at Erdemli during my visit, entering historical data from their research); to provide cross training and standard equipment to participating Black Sea countries (e.g., computers, CTDs, rosette samplers, plankton nets, autoanalyzers; and a satellite image processing system installed at METU IMS); and to understand and develop models of ecosystem dynamics of the lower trophic levels of the Black Sea, as affected by physical processes and anthropogenic changes.  Overall this work is progressing well, the key results being the shared data base, the improved national capabilities and common standards, and the models themselves.<P>

In parallel with the increase in scientific activity in the early 90s, the governments of the region reacted to the food, economic, and health impacts of the Black Seas environmental crisis.  In April 1992, the Black Sea governments signed the Bucharest Convention on the Protection of the Black Sea against Pollution, which provided an international framework for management and established common legal tools for controlling marine pollution.  Its three protocols address control of land-based sources of pollution, dumping of waste, and joint action in case of accidents.  To oversee its implementation, the Convention established the Black Sea Commission, headquartered in Instanbul (Istanbul Commission), whose responsibilities include developing criteria for preventing, controlling, and reducing pollution.  <P>

The governments also decided to establish a common environmental policy for the Black Sea.  This was adopted in Odessa in April 1993.  The Odessa Declaration, based largely on the 1992 Rio Summits Agenda for the 21st Century, calls for common environmental quality objectives and coordinated national plans for reduction of inputs of harmful substances, especially nutrients; a ban on radioactive dumping;, implementation of MARPOL special area requirements; development of contingency plans; establishment of national activity centers; an assessment of inputs of harmful materials; and a monitoring system.<P>

In order to help them implement this policy, the Black Sea Nations requested assistance from the Global Environmental Facility (a $2B trust fund managed by the World Bank, UNEP, and UNDP to assist developing countries in protecting the global environment and in transferring environmentally benign technologies).  GEF allocated $9.3M (with collateral funding from the EU, the Netherlands, France, Austria, Canada and Japan) to establish a three year (1993-95) Black Sea Environmental Programme (BSEP) <I>(16)</I>. At the first meeting of its steering committee in Varna in June 1993, the GEF partners, Black Sea Governments and NGO representatives defined a three year workplan oriented toward the development of a strategic action plan.  Three BSEP objectives were defined: increase the capacity of the Black Sea countries to assess and manage the environment; support the development and implementation of new environmental policies and laws; and facilitate the preparation of sound environmental objectives.<P>

Like the scientists, one of the first tasks for the GEF partners was to establish a collaborative infrastructure among both governmental and NGO participants.  The GEF created a Programme Coordinating Unit (PCU) in Istanbul.  A system of Working Parties was established, based upon regional "Activity Centers" hosted by each of the nations and linked to the others through National Focal Points.  The entire network of some 40 institutions has been linked by email.  In addition to helping coordinate the efforts of the Working Parties to develop national and regional thematic reports, the BSEP PCU has focused on capacity building for assessment and management, increasing public awareness, and mobilizing the scientific community through workshops, meetings and training sessions.  BSEP also contributed over $1.5M to re-equipping the pollution monitoring network.  And because Black Sea remediation requires reduction of riverine hazardous material input, GEF has conducted parallel programs for the Danube Basin and the Danube Delta <I>(17)</I>.<P>

Because the BSEP was designed to last only three years, most of the PCUs effort has been directed toward developing a sustainable management capability in the region.  The key product to this end was a Transboundary Diagnostic Analysis (TDA), published by the PCU in June 1996.  The TDA has three levels: a single table listing the seven major perceived problems of environmental degradation, their root causes and action areas <I>(18)</I>; an overview of the specific actions proposed for each identified issue; and detailed information on the "action areas" and related issues.  The TDA in turn served as the basis for a Strategic Action Plan for the Rehabilitation of the Black Sea as called for in the Bucharest Convention.  This Plan was adopted by the Environmental Ministers of the Black Sea nations at their meeting in Istanbul 30-31 October.  The Action Plan specifies Policy Actions in each of the TDAs Action Areas, directs each nation to prepare supporting national Strategic Action Plans, and charges the Istanbul Commission with its implementation.  To do so the Commission will take over and manage the infrastructure developed by BSEP, including maintaining the electronic communication system and GIS and acting as a data clearing house, and will establish Advisory Groups based on the BSEP Working Parties. <P>

In addition to its TDA and other reports, the PCU has published a <I>Black Sea Bibliography 1974-1994</I>, and - with support from the Netherlands, the electronic <I>Black Sea Information System</I>, a set of meta-level directories of organizations, scientists, projects, and environmental data sets.  See paragraph 8 for further information on these and other relevant publications.<P>

Between the oceanographic and the environmental programmes, therefore, the Black Sea has become one of the more intensively studied bodies of water, and the scientific, governmental, and NGO communities of the area have developed effective collaborations.  While effective management hasnt yet taken hold and the "crisis" is by no means over, deterioration has slowed, fisheries have started to recover, the national governments are attuned to the need for continued action, and a workable infrastructure for assessment and action is in place.  As the GEF and the NATO SfS programs draw to a close, at issue is whats next?<P>

Planning for major new international oceanographic programmes is proceeding along two main technical paths.  The first is additional process studies, focused on understanding the nitrate cycle and new production, which must be comprehended by the ecosystem models being developed in TU-BLACK SEA; the second is a transition to "operational oceanography", long term monitoring and forecasting. <P>

Programatically, the following multinational actions (at least) are underway to these ends:<P>  
a.  There was a planning meeting at the December US AGU meeting in San Francisco to discuss a "suboxic zone" study to be conducted as part of, and possibly as an extension to, TU-BLACK SEA.  METU IMS will provide R/V BILIM for a preliminary cruise for this purpose in April 1997. <BR>
b.  As noted above, the IOC adopted CoMSBlack as one of its official programmes in 1993.  ICO also has formed a Black Sea Regional Committee.  At its first session, held at Varna in September of this year, the Committee adopted two Pilot Projects.  Pilot Project 1 is "Black Sea GOOS: a Step toward Observation and Prediction Systems (STOPS)"; project coordinators are Dr. Unluata of METU IMS, and Dr. L.M.Popova of Bulgaria.  Its objectives are to implement basic elements of an operational network using available resources, to restore routine at sea observations using ships from each country, and to develop a science plan for further development.  Pilot Project 2 is "Assessment of the Sediment Flux in the Black Sea: Mechanisms of Formation, Transformation, and Dispersion and Ecological Significance", designed to study recent geologic and pollution history.  The Project coordinator is Dr. K.M.Shimkus (Russian Federation).  Each nation will conduct studies in their own waters; Turkey and the Ukraine will contribute ships for an initial 1997 cruise, and all will share data.  IOC is expected to provide funds for meetings and coordination, and will coordinate approaches to outside donors; but the scientific efforts will be supported primarily by national funds, and possibly the EC.<BR>
c.  Dr Unluata and Mr Gary Vest of the US DoDs Environmental Security office are co-directors for a proposed NATO Committee for the Challenges of Modern Society Pilot Project entitled "Review of Ongoing Black Sea Projects for the Planning of Future Activities".  This proposed 16 month effort would critically review ongoing projects and their expected results, define and plan predictive ecosystem and environmental models with forecasting capabilities that use long term systematic observations, and define and plan such a continuously operational ocean observation system. <BR>
d.  In anticipation of the advent of NATOs Science for Peace Program, the successor to SfS (that focuses on the Partnership for Peace Nations as opposed to NATOs southern tier), and for possible support under IOCs Coastal Seas Program, and Dr Unluata and colleagues will develop a science plan for the Shelf Seas of the Black Sea.<P>

Finally, as part of the transition toward a Black Sea GOOS, several of the IMS scientists expressed interest in the use of acoustics for continuous monitoring in the Black Sea. The Turks have no relevant acoustical experience, however initial conversations with a Russian acoustician indicated that Russia has conducted low frequency acoustic feasibility experiments from the Crimea, and that continuous acoustic monitoring of temperature, wave and wind conditions, and the pycnocline should be possible.  Acoustic monitoring of the Black Sea may be of interest to SACLANTCTR and possibly to the EuroGOOS program as part of a Black Sea GOOS project.<P>

<B>7.  Comments and Assessment</B><BR>
Turkish defense business is characterized by a complex set of intertwining public and private relationships, under the close overall control of the TGS.  Turkish defense industry will grow and diversify over the next decade.  There are sound economic as well as security reasons for the US to want to remain a strong player in Turkish arms developments.  <P>

Similarly, Turkish S&T - abetted by a complex set of interlocking state, commercial and University mechanisms and closely supervised by TUBITAK - can be expected to develop rapidly.  When I asked the Commercial Attach what Turkish technologies I should be interested in, he responded, "nothing jumps out...".  This wont be true in a decade, and again there are compelling reasons to pay close attention to the development of Turkeys S&T potential.<P>

There already is one area where Turkey has, and in fact has had for quite a while, an S&T capability of great interest to ONR: the oceanography of its contiguous waters.  Many of the Turkish ocean scientists have received their degrees or studied in the States, and they collaborate closely with US colleagues; and the US contingent of ocean scientists with long term interests in the region includes some of our best researchers.  Perhaps even more importantly, Turkish scientists continue to play a leadership role in collaborations with their colleagues in the other Black Sea riparian nations.  IMS Erdemli is a natural center of gravity for the 60-100 Black Sea area oceanographers who now work together; this is a regional collaboration that works well and to the benefit of all involved.  <P>

Black Sea oceanography, just like Turkish defense business and R&D, is characterized by a number of interacting arrangements - in this case among countries, between scientific institutions and their researchers, and with international organizations such as the UN, the EU, and NATO.  It has transboundary political, scientific, and ecological dimensions.  International Black Sea oceanographic collaboration is important for the security of the region, in all aspects of the term - environmental, economic, and military.  Only modest external support is required to maintain the momentum that has been built in the 90s; but with the completion of the GEF BSEP, and with the termination of NATOs Science for Stability Programme, other mechanisms must be found if the transition to operational oceanography, essential to continued efforts to understand and manage the ecosystem, is to be effected.  In my opinion it is very much in the interests of the US, the EU, and NATO help the very capable local team continue and expand its effective collaboration. <P>

<TITLE>ONREUR Support for U.S. Shipbuilding and Manufacturing</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY>
<P>

<H2>Subject:  Office of Naval Research Europe [ONREUR] Support for U.S. Shipbuilding and Manufacturing </H2>

<DD>	I am Howard M. Bunch, NAVSEA Professor of Ship Production Science and Research Scientist at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor.  I have been given leave from the university to serve, for the next two years, as Associate Director, Manufacturing and Ship Production Sciences at the Office of Naval Research Europe, located in London, England.   My assignment is to monitor activities in Europe and Africa relating to manufacturing and ship production.    I will be concentrating on  technologies that enable manufacturing enterprises to become "world class"  by better design, construction, and sale of affordable commercial ships, and one-of-a-kind industrial products.  The information will  be passed on to U.S. manufacturers [especially shipyards] so they have insight in how to proceed in achieving their own  "world-class"  position.<P>
 
	<DD>One of the areas of especial focus will be the role of the vendor in the process.  It has become generally recognized that one of the most efficient production systems is a type that is extremely agile in its configuration; this agility is facilitated by the use of a vendor network that can be quickly configured for a specific product need. <P>

	<DD>A second focus area will be product/process modelling technology, including its utilization in marketing dynamics.  Computer hardware and software systems being introduced  for purposes of supporting flexible manufacturing systems will be of especial interest.<P>

	<DD>My plans are to issue a series of Manufacturing and Ship Production Newsletters.  They will document [1]the developmental status and potential impact of appropriate research and industrial process activities, [2] highlights of Europeqan technical conferences,  [3] trip reports  [to European shipyards, manufacturers, universities  and  research institutes], and [4] and points of contact for specific technical questions. Please confirm your interest in being included in the distribution of future newsletters.  [IF THERE IS NO RESPONSE, I WILL ASSUME THERE IS NO DESIRE FOR INCLUSION].  Additionally, your thoughts on specific interests would be appreciated. <P>

	<DD>Reports will be available via e-mail at my e-mail address or by regular mail.  They will also be available via the world wide web at the Office of Naval Research Europe home page, http://www.ehis.navy.mil/homepage/htm.  After entering the homepage, go to Newsletters: ONREUR[Professor Howard M. Bunch] <P>
	<DD>To date there have been three newsletters issued:<P>

	<DD><B>Newsletter #1</B>--Office of Naval Research Europe [ONREUR] Support
		for U.S. Shipbuilding and Manufacturing<BR>
	<DD><A HREF="hbnews2.htm"><B>Newsletter #2</B></A>--European Study Conferences on International Trade and
		Competition Law<BR>
	<DD><A HREF="hbnews3.htm"><B>Newsletter #3</B></A>--Listing of some conferences to be held in Europe during remainder of 1996 that might be of interest <BR>
<DD>to maritime industry management.<P>

	<DD>I shall also be pleased to be an informal information source on any queries you may have relative to my assignment area.  <P>

<H3>CROSS BORDER JOINT VENTURES CONFERENCE</H3><P>
<PRE><I>September, VIENNA                              &#163;350.00</I></PRE><P>
There are many ways in which a company can
expand into foreign markets, a joint venture being one of the
more popular ways.  This conference looks at the latest developments
and points out the pitfalls.  This will include coverage Central
and Eastern Europe.<P>
<H3>COMMERCIAL CONTRACTS IN THE EU</H3><P>
<PRE><I>4 day, various cities                             &#163;1100.00</I></PRE><P>
The basis of most business transactions is
a contractual relationship which is governed by a complex set
of rules developed over the years through decided cases, jurisprudence,
statutory enactments, codes and international conventions.  The
increase in international trade and business has added to this
complexity.  As contracts are such a basic element in business,
all those engaged in business operations, whatever their capacity,
need to have an understanding of the subject.  This event has
been specially designed to provide vital information on commercial
contracts in Europe, including the impact of EU law, for company
executives, businessmen and their professional advisers.  The
approach will be practical, allowing for questions and discussion.<BR>
Each regional centre will cover jurisdictions
in the neighbouring area.<BR>
The course will take place as follows:<P>

<B>June</B>  <BR>
BRUSSELS - Benelux Countries<BR>
<B>July</B><BR>
NICE - France, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Greece<BR>
<B>September</B><BR>
COPENHAGEN - Scandinavia;<BR>
MUNICH - Austria, Germany &amp; Switzerland<P>

<H3>ECONOMICS FOR THE COMPETITION LAWYER</H3>

<PRE><I>July, 1 day, LONDON                             &#163;350.00</I><P></PRE>

Competition Law can only be properly understood
in the context of the economic theories upon which it is based.
 This one day course will be presented by economists who are specialists
in competition matters - and will provide practising competition
lawyers with a practical insight into the economics of Competition
Law and the economic arguments which may be brought in infringement
proceedings.<P>

<H3>INTRODUCTION TO COMPETITION LAW</H3>

<PRE><I>Monday 16th &amp; Tuesday 17th September, OXFORD                       &#163;650.00</I></PRE><P>
In response to the requests of many delegates
at previous ESC conferences, this introductory course is planned
to be held in Oxford in the two days prior to the 1996 Anti-Trust
Law Conference.  The course will take the form of a series of
practical workshop sessions on the fundamental competition law
for those seeking an introduction or refresher course on the subject.
 Delegates may also opt to remain for the specialist Anti-Trust
Law event following on.<P>

<H3>15TH INTERNATIONAL ANTI-TRUST CONFERENCE</H3>

<PRE><I>18th - 20th September, OXFORD                               &#163;900.00</I></PRE><P>

<PRE><I>Tuesday 8th October, LONDON                         &#163;350.00</I></PRE><P>
As the European economy emerges from recession
and businesses exploit the Singe Market, cross-border mergers,
acquisitions or joint ventures will increase.  Lawyers and company
directors contemplating strategic commercial alliances need to
know the commission is intent on bringing merger control under
its wing with the 1996 Merger Regulation review.  This seminar
will examine the regulation in full, recent case law, what the
Commission's proposed changes are likely to be and how to deal
with them.<P>

<H3>19TH ANNUAL ADVANCED EC COMPETITION LAW CONFERENCE</H3>

<PRE><I>Tuesday 5th &amp; Wednesday 6th November, Brussels                        &#163;650.00</I></PRE><P>

This  two day conference offers a unique opportunity
for lawyers both in private practice and in industry to participate
in this update on recent developments in EC Competition Law.

High-power lasers benefit naval welding<BR>

Text: [article by John Bell: " High-power lasers weld ship-shape
structures"]  [FBIS transcribed text]<P>

<DD> At the end of May, Europe's shipbuilders and their suppliers will meet to discuss the results of a collaborative research project to exploit the benefits of laser welding in shipyards. They want "dramatic reductions" in the cost of reworking steel components that have been distorted by the heat of conventional welding techniques.   Reworking these parts, which can be tens of metres long, involves thousands of man-hours. Shipbuilders estimate that removing distortions in 6 to 8 mm thick plates and modules accounts for up to 33 percent of the labour costs of a passenger ship or fast naval craft, for example. This figure falls to 25 percent with large tankers and commercial carriers, which contain significant numbers of parts made from steel sheet of up to 20 mm thick.<BR>
  
<DD>The industry's motivation for researching laser welding is the need to compete with far eastern shipyards, especially in Korea and Japan. Laser welding will improve quality, and reduce costs and construction time, plus encourage automation and mechanization.  First, the shipbuilders have to satisfy Europe's classification  societies that laser welds are as good as conventional welds a  meeting safety and performance criteria. The societies - such as  Lloyd's Register, Bureau Veritas, Rina in Italy, Norway's DNV and  Germanischer Lloyd - are employed by ship owners or the insurance  industry. They are closely involved in guiding and evaluating the  3.5million pound programme and are drafting guidelines based on its results.<BR>

  <DD> The meeting in Glasgow will review the programme, which was managed by TWI, Cambridge UK.  The work involved 11 European Research institutions, which in turn represented 41 industrial organizations. Its results are still commercially confidential shipbuilders have cut steel sheet of up to about 20 mm thick with lasers since 1992. None has yet adopted laser welding, although the technique is well established for land vehicles and structures. For example, it is already known that low levels of carbon, sulphur, silicon and phosphorus with a high level of manganese in the steel reduces the chance of laser welds cracking. However, the programme has shown that carbon dioxide lasers in the 8 to 15 KW range are suited to joining heavy steel sheet and components for marine applications.<BR>

  <DD> "We should see the first ship built with the help of laser welding within two years," said Hellmut Wilckens, managing director of FDS, a shipbuilding research group in Hamburg that took part in the programme. "there are more European shipyards than you might guess looking at the process. A good number are at an advanced stage, but there is nothing to stop the Koreans and Japanese doing the same."<BR>

   <DD>Another partner, Odense steel shipyard in Denmark, is likely to be one of the first to benefit from the work. It is investing 5 million pounds in a five-axis gantry for the laser cutting and welding of components of up to 4 x 16 m. The company will take delivery of the gantry, and its 15 kw co2 source built by the German company held, early next year.<BR>

   <DD>Odense's executive vice-president, Torben Anderson, told OLE: "The reason for constructing such a large-scale test plant is to find out what labour costs we can save in reworking distorted components. We can't take the whole thing, but the potential is there to take the lion's share of the costs."<BR>

  <DD> Anderson says that it should be possible to automate the welding of about 265 km or 40 percent of the joints in a 340 m long tanker of 300,000 tonnes dead weight. The widths of these welds depends on the application: t-beams and bulb profiles used to stiffen transverse plates need welds of 10 to 15 mm thick, while butt welds of plates are typically 18 to 25 mm deep.<BR>

  <DD> Odense calculates that laser welding joints could cost 50 percent of conventional techniques. The figures include consumables - such as filler wires and gases, as well as labour costs - but exclude investment outlay. Laser systems are two to three times the price of conventional welding systems, which is why Odense will evaluate both cutting and joining on a single system.<BR>

   <DD>Plasma cutting shapes a steel plate of up to 3 x 16 m to an accuracy of plus or minus 2 to 3 mm over 10 m. Laser cutting is precise to plus or minus 0.5 mm, an accuracy that leads to considerable time and cost savings in a 340 m long ship.<BR>

   <DD>Laser welding delivers 10 percent or less of the energy of conventional methods to the plate surrounding a joint. For example, submerged arc welding (saw) delivers 8 to 12 kj/mm when butt welding 25 mm thick sheet; arc welding involves a heat input of 1 to 2 kj/mm in producing t-beams.<BR>

   <DD>Andersen says that Odense will train about ten technicians and engineers to run its new laser equipment. They will probably start by assembling superstructures and in-board components where the savings are likely to be greatest. Welding hull plates is already fairly highly automated, he says.<BR>

  <DD>Lasers butt weld metal sheets, normally with their ends cut at right angles to the main faces, by melting some of the material to make the joint. Other methods form the weld by melting additional filler wires to fill the joint formed by the bevelled ends of the two sheets. As the wires melt and build up the weld, each one adds to the rotational and linear distortions that appear about the joint.<BR>

   <DD>The programme managed by TWI had to demonstrate to the classification societies that a laser weld can be as good as an arc weld - in terms of its resistance to cracking, porosity, and corrosion, as well as its hardness and ductility, for example- as far as shipbuilding is concerned. Therefore it had to define the limits of the three main factors that control the quality and properties of a laser weld: material composition, welding procedure and weld shape.  The performance of arc welds, for example, depends principally on the procedure. They are generally capable of coping with wide variations in the quality of plate materials.   Most of the material in a laser weld comes from the base metal, even if a filler wire is added to the process. The composition of the steel in addition to joint geometry and beam travel speed also affect its quality and properties.<BR>

   <DD>The co-operative programme defined both the limits of the steel composition and the extremes of the laser processes to produce welds that satisfy the classification societies.
   the partners are not publishing details, for example about acceptable levels of non-ferrous elements in the steel. However, they claim that, within the set limits, the programme produced laser welds that show no cracks when tested by ultrasonics or radiography.<BR>

   <DD>Laser welding of ship components will also meet the standards set in the proposed european standard pr en 1419 for porosity in welds.  The draft allows pores of a maximum diameter of 3 mm or 40 percent  of the weld depth, whichever is the smaller, over no more than 2 percent of the weld's area for an intermediate quality weld suitable for shipbuilding.<BR>

   <DD>Researchers adopted standard hardness tests to assess the relatively narrow laser welds, but they can generally achieve hardness figures below 380 hardness vickers. They also say that the joint strengths are at least equivalent to the strength of the plate. (most of the work was carried out on 240 and 360 n/mm (squared) carbon manganese steels.) They achieve laser welds that show 22 percent elongation before failure, equivalent to the required ductility of arc welds.<BR>

   <DD>Now that the programme has developed an approved welding procedure on specified materials, the next step is to establish courses to train workers. Further research might look at extending the limits of the process or allowing cheaper steels of different grades.<P>

   The Future<P>

   <DD>Work at TWI on the new procedure accelerated the development of a new dual-beam welding technique for thick steels. It is also prompting discussion on the development of CO2 and ND:YAG sources for shipyards.<BR>

   <DD>Shipyards have been attracted to laser processing over the past decade as robust lasers with powers in excess of 10 kw have become available. One problem with these high-power sources is that they generate a large molten pool that tends to be distorted by gravity before it has time to cool and harden.<BR>

  <DD> TWI is currently experimenting with tandem-head welding with 8 kw and 10 kw beams that make a joint in a single pass. The heads of the two sources are arranged to deliver their beams within a short distance of each other. One laser welds the bottom of the weld, while the second completes the joint immediately afterwards.<BR>

   <DD> As shipbuilders turn more and more to laser welding, they will  generate an increasing demand for smaller, more manoeuvrable sources  as well as more powerful ones. "Manufacturers will need to do more  research into the efficiency of their lasers to reduce the size of the source and to improve stability," said Hellmut Wilckens of the FDS research group in Hamburg.  Smaller sources would be able to produce welds with tight radii in restricted spaces. They would also encourage robotics and automation.  For example, the us navy is developing portable 1.8, 2.4 and 3 kw ND:YAG sources for welding, cladding and cutting. <BR>

  <DD>One advantage of these tools is that optical fibres can deliver their beams into restricted spaces. Another is that fibres can multiplex ND:YAG sources to deliver a single powerful beam.<BR>

  <DD>The US Navy is experimenting with nd:yag sources to cut up submarine hulls, weld titanium alloys, build structural stiffeners and buttdoin pipes. Its 3 kw ND:YAG has achieved some success in making underwater welds and clads with filler wire.<BR>

   <DD>However, ND:YAG sources may prove controversial in the shipyards of Europe. "The wavelength of an ND:YAG is a tenth of the wavelength of a CO2 source, and the shorter wavelength is dangerous to the eye," said Wilckens. "but I think we may see pulsed diode lasers in shipbuilding within five years."<P>

"PROPULSION MACHINERY FOR LARGE
SHIPS" by T Henriksson, Msc <I>W&auml;rtsil&auml; Diesel
Oy, Finland</I><P>

<DD> As a response to new challenges in the shipping environment, new propulsion machinery solutions are presented. Propulsion plant availability can increase freight
income and reduce down-time.  Exhaust gas emissions an be reduced without increasing the building costs.  The building costs of tankers can be reduced and the cargo capacity of containerships can be increased with optimal machinery concepts.  The recommended
solution for large containerships and for VLCCs is twin medium-speed  engines and a single cp propeller (alternatively twin-screw).
 For VLCCs, large primary shaft generators and electrical cargo
pumps are recommended.<P>

"SAFE AND EFFICIENT SHIPS- FRIENDLY
TO THE ENVIRONMENT" by #R Kvamsdal, MSc and &#134;Prof Dr
Ing M F&oslash;rde, MSc,<I>*Kv&aelig;rner as and &#134;Norwegian
Institute of Science and Technology, Norway</I><P>

<DD>Safer and more efficient ships, friendly
to the enviornment, can only be a reality after a full and balanced
improvement of all relevant factors.  One should also, in addition
to focusing on the operational phase, give attention to environmental
loads from the building as well as the scrapping processes.  There
should also be a balance between safe arrangments, systems and
components on one side, and human dependent operations, the latter
improved by operator-assisted information (ED) systems.<P>

"RISK ANALYSES FOR <I>SOLITAIRE</I>"  by Ir A M van Wijngaarden, MIMarE, <I>Allseas Engineering bv, The Netherlands</I></FONT><P>

<DD><I>Solitaire</I>  will be the world's
largest pipelay vessel.  The unit is being converted from a bulk
carrier hull and will operate fully on dynamic positioning.  During
design and construction, a systematic review of safety essential
systems is carried out by means of risk analyses for evacuation
routes, ballast system and DP system.  Fire and explosion studies
are carried out for the accommodation, helideck, engine rooms,
gas storage facilities and the gas distribution systems throughout
the pipeline production spaces.  The methodology adopted for the
various risk analyses is described.  Two studies are highlighted
in particular: the hazard and operability (HAZOP) study on fire
and explosion for the gas storage facilities and the mustering
flow simulations for the evacuation analysis.  Conclusions and
experiences from the risk analyses are presented.<P>

"PREDICTING BEARING METAL CONDITION
OF DIESEL ENGINE BY USED OIL ANALYSIS"  by T Hashimoto,
H Aoki and N Baba <I>Nippon Kaiji Kyokai (ClassNK), Japan</I><P>

<DD> The bearing metals of a marine diesel
engine are usually disassembled every four to five years as part
of a special survey.  However, this disassembling and assembling
work requires a significant amount of manpower and time.  Moreover,
it is also dangerous.  The classification society to which the
authors belong has dedicated considerable time and effort to examining
whether used oil analysis can be used as an alternative to carrying
out the aforementioned periodic survey.  This paper reports on
the correlation between results obtained from used oil analysis
vy ferrography and the inspection results obtained during special
surveys from two vessels ove a continuous eight year period. 
As a result, the authors believe that periodic used oil analyses
can be effective as one form of condition monitoring based survey.<P>

"OPTIMISING THE COMPLETE SYSTEM
USING SIMULATION: THE CASE OF PREDICTING ENGINE EMISSIONS DURING
SHIP MANOEUVRING" by Prof N P Kyrtatos, BSc (Hons), PhD,
G Kapetanis, Dipl-Eng, G Korakis, Dipl-Eng and I Koumbarelis,
Dipl-Eng <I>National Technical University of Athens, Greece</I><P> 

<DD>A comprehensive simulation model able
to predict the interaction of a marine propulsion diesel with
the propellor and the ship, was used to predict engine emissions
and other performance characteristics during ship manoeuvres.
 To enable this, a detailed NOx emissions prediction code was
developed and was appended to the main simulation model.  The
predictions of the overall model were validated using instantaneous
emission measurements data from full scale shipboard tests.  The
flexibility of the simulation model is further demonstrated by
predicting the effect of emission reduction techniques applied
on the propulsion engine during ship sailing.<P>

"ISM CODE: IS IT DIFFERENT FROM AN OFFSHORE
SAFETY CASE?" by  *E J Mavromatakis, FIMarE, MASCE, MTEE, &#134;D
Colyvas, MTEE and &#135;E Nicolaou, BEng (Hons)<I>*Ergon Consultants
Ltd, &#134;TARANG Consulting Engineers and Trust Shipping Enterprises
Ltd, Greece</I><P>

<DD>By July 1 1998 any passenger ship,
oil tanker, chemical tanker, gas carrier or bulk carrier greater
than 500 gt will not be allowed to operate if the company which
operates the ship or the ship itself does not comply with the
requirements of the International Safety Management (ISM) code.
 At the heart of the ISM code is the Safety Management System
(SMS).  This paper illustrates how experience gained from the
development of safety cases for offshore installations and the
application of quality assurance (QA) principles have been utilised
by the authors to develop the SMS manual in compliance with the
ISM code requirements.<P>

"SHIP QUALITY INFORMATION SYSTEMS"
 by *Prof R G Bea, MSE, PE, &#134;Dr Ing R Schulte-Strathaus and
*M Dry, MSE, <I>*University of California at Berkeley, USA and
&#134;Germanischer Lloyd, Germany</I><P>

<DD>Information and communications are
key elements in development of a ship safety and quality management
system.  A Ship Quality Information System (SQIS) addresses the
life cycle aspects of a ship including design, construction, maintenance,
and operations.  SQIS provides timely and meaningful information
to help achieve desirable quality in ship operations for shipowners
and operators, shipyards, classification societies, insurance
groups, and regulatory agencies.  A SQIS takes full advantage
of modern computation, communications, and information technologies.
 A SQIS takes full advantage of the principles of re-engineering
to focus on 'processes' instead of 'tasks', elimination of unnecessary
tasks and procedures, and formation of process teams.  Substantial
improvements in ship design, construction, maintenance, and operation
efficiencies are the primary objective of a SQIS.  Safer ships
and higher reliability organisations to design, construct, maintain,
and operate ships are a natural by-product of such a development.
 This paper summarises progress that has been achieved during
the past five years in definition of an approach for development
of a comprehensive SQIS.  The components that have been addressed
include those of ship structure, equipment, operations, and personnel.
 Several prototypes have been developed to illustrate how components
of SQIS could be implemented.  One of these components, a Ship
Structural Integrity Information System (SSIIS) is discussed in
this paper.  Experience of several ship operators indicates that
implementation of these components and organisational changes
can result in dramatic decreases in costs and increases in profitability.

"INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY IN SHIP
OPERATION: A NORWEGIAN RESEARCH PROGRAMME"  by E Rensvik,
MsC, <I>MARINTEK, Norway</I><P>

 <DD>The international focus on safety
and pollution prevention is becoming sharper, which gives more
stringent demands on the maritime transportation industry.  The
Norwegian initiative for improved competitiveness through development
of new operating concepts and information systems in shipping
companies in close co-operation with equipment suppliers, classification
societies and authorities has been organised in a joint research
programme (1994-97).  Information technology will, through the
projects, be applied to a more efficient performance reporting,
maintenance optimisation, training systems and new classification
concepts.  The results will be installed and demonstrated onboard
two ships in a demonstrator project for a Norwegian company.<P>

"IMPROVED ONBOARD TRAINING USING
COMPUTER-BASED TRAINING MODULES" by *Dr Ing T E Berg, MSc
and &#134;R Skotg&aring;rd<I>*MARINTEK and &#134;Red Band AS,
Norway</I><P>

<DD>This paper summarises part of the
work done in the R&amp;D project, 'Training, Recruitment, Selection'.
 The project is part of the Research Council of Norway's programme,
<I>Information Technology in Ship Operation</I>.  As a part of
the training project, a baseline for an improved training system
has been developed.  The training system's content will be designed
to meet the company's recruitment and training policy.  The system
uses available assessment tools to define the training needs of
each crew member.  Training activities will mainly be given as
part of cyclic training/retraining actions which will be based
on the functional approach given in the 1995 STCW Convention.
 The paper gives a summary of project activities related to development
and introduction of computer-based training (CBT) modules.  The
methodology used by a ship management company and when implementing
the CBT system for onboard training is described.  The final part
of the paper highlights the experience gained from the first operational
period of the CBT system onboard two Suez max tankers.<P>

"FUEL QUALITY RELATED TO UNSEAWORTHINESS" by R F Thomas, CEng, FIMarE, <I>Fuel Oil Bunker Analysis and
Advisory Service (FOBAS), UK</I><P>

<DD>The paper examines various aspects
of fuel quality based on the parameters given in the international
marine fuel standards.  The effects of deviation from these standards
are considered on engine performance, which under certain conditions
can affect the seaworthiness of the vessel.<P>

"THE ROLE OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY
FOR REDUCTION OF MAINTENANCE COST"  by *Prof Dr Ing M
Rasmussen and &#134;H Moen, Msc, <I>*Norwegian University of Science
and Technology and &#134;MARINTEK, Norway</I><P>

<DD>The Reliability Centred Maintenance
concept is an aid to increasing quality in maintenance, ie to
ensure high safety standards and optimise plant availability while
controlling maintenance cost.  The work described in this paper
focuses on the use of this concept and on information technology
in a continuous improvement of the maintenance activities.  Criticality
assessment, reliability and availability analysis are performed
to pinpoint important functions and equipment.  The initial maintenance
policy is based on these analyses, and continuously improved by
data reported from operation.<P>

AS A TOOL FOR CONDITION MONITORING OF PISTON ENGINES BY ON-LINE
CYLINDER TORQUE ESTIMATION" by*C A J Tromp, &#134;J M Spoelstra
and &#134;Prof J Klein-Woud,<I>*Royal Netherlands Naval College
and &#134;Delft University of Technology, The Netherlands</I><P>

<DD>Torsional vibration contains information
on the operation of all cylinders and thus may have a high potential
for condition monitoring of diesel engines.  Existing methods,
which convert flywheel speed measurements into the shaft torque,
require that the flexibility of the crankshaft can be ignored.
 A new method has been developed for rotor systems with flexible
crankshafts, which converts the vibration at only one arbitrary
chosen measuring point into the cylinder torques.  The amount
of information in torsional vibrations is limited by the structural
dynamics, which act as a filter.  This causes restraints for the
number of cylinders that can be monitored.  It is expected that
in practice the maximum will be about six to eight.<P>

"PMS ON SHIPS: DREAM OR REALITY?"
by G Soncini, <I>SpecTec Srl, Italy</I><P>

<DD> The ISM Code requests the implementation
of planned maintenance onboard vessels.  While the advantages
should be clear to all parties, some of the difficulties related
with installing a PMS, especially a computerised one, are less
known.  Knowledge of the enemy is the first step to his defeat,
so the paper focuses on the main problems and some of the relevant
solutions.  The SpecTec Group has supplied more than 2000 CPMS
onboard ships.<P>

"THE SOCP'S RAM DATABASE/SHIPNET:
A CROSS FUNCTIONAL NETWORK FOR SHIP LIFE CYCLE COST AND SAFETY
DECISION SUPPORT"  by *B Inozu, BS, MSE, PhD, &#134;Z J
Karaszewski, AD, BE and &#135;P G Schaedel, MSE<I>*University
of New Orleans, &#134;United States Coast Guard and Energy Transportation
Corporation, USA</I><P>

<DD> Ship operators are constantly looking
for ways of improving ship safety, reliability and life cycle
cost-effectiveness to face the ever increasing competition of
the global shipping industry.  Vessel operators worldwide are
implementing reliability centered maintenance programs to maintain
and improve vessel reliability with less resources.  In the mean
time, regulatory agencies are embracing risk-based technologies
to improve ship safety with reduced regulatory burden.  In order
to develop reliability characteristics of marine machinery and
to apply risk-based technologies for regulatory reform, a cooperative
structure is desirable, where the failure data is obtained from
many sources operating similar equipment.  This allows statistically
relevant data to be analysed and conclusions drawn on the reliability
of equipment much sooner than would normally be possible.  This
paper describes a cooperative effort at reliability data collection
and sharing being undertaken by the Ship Operations Cooperative
Program (SOCP) to improve total life cycle cost-effectiveness
and safety of ships globally.  Interface between the new Marine
Safety Evaluation Program (MSTEP) of the United States Coast Guard
and SOCP's reliability, availability and maintainability (RAM)
database is also summarised.<P>

"NAUTICUS - A LIFE CYCLE APPROACH
TO SHIP SAFETY" by T Sollie, MSc, M L&oslash;vstad, MSc,
E Rishoff, MSc and S A Brustad, Msc, <I>Det Norske Veritas, Norway</I><P>

<DD>Det Norske Veritas (DNV) has launched
a major development project which is set to provide the company
with its future information system for ship classification.  Being
one of the major classification societies, DNV has its focus on
safety, and Nauticus is set to support safety related decision-making
in a life cycle approach.  It is aimed at improved knowledge transfer
throughout the classification process, using a life cycle ship
product model to ease the recording and retrieval of information.
 The DNV engineers and surveyors shall have at hand an up-to-date
and complete set of information for any DNV classed ship, anywhere
at any time.  The first member of the Nauticus family is the comprehensive
ship modelling and analysis package called Nauticus Hull.  A similar
module on machinery and systems, as well as modules for following
up the ship during construction and operation, are under development.
 This paper gives an introduction to DNV's strategic thinking
behind the Nauticus project, and presents in some detail the first
software module and its implementation in the classification concept.<P>

"SAFETY, AVAILABILITY AND MAINTENANCE
IMPROVEMENTS IN THE SHIPPING COMMUNITY"  by  L Nyh, Msc
<I>SYSTECON AB, Sweden</I><P>

<DD>This paper discusses the objectives,
findings and conclusions of a recently completed prestudy funded
by and with the participation of all the major concerned parties
in the Swedish shipping community.  The prestudy is based on the
assumption that there is a substantial potential in terms of higher
safety, higher availability and lower costs to be gained from
introducing and implementing modern and established concepts for
systems and logistics engineering and for life cycle costing in
the design and operation of ships and ships' systems.  Although
the prestudy has not managed to determine the expected potentials
in quantitative terms, the general conclusion is that by implementing
established methods and techniques for analyses, design and maintenance
of ships and ships' systems, there are potential profits to be
gained for the various actors in the shipping community.  To get
significant improvements, especially regarding safety and life
cycle costs, however, a change of paradigm is probably required
in the shipping community.  The concepts, the methods, techniques
and tools are available and in use, among others, in the aviation
industry and in the power industry.

<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=4>WORKSHOP ON ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATIONS
FOR THE SHIPBUILDING INDUSTRY AND ITS VENDOR BASE</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=4>LONDON, OCTOBER 28, 1996<BR>
</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=4>I.  INTRODUCTION<BR>
<BR>
</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
This report  describes a workshop, held in London, England, on
October 28, 1996, relating to electronic communications within
the maritime industry, with special focus on the shipbuilding
sector and its vendor base.   The workshop was sponsored by Office
of Naval Research Europe.  
<P>
One of the major changes occurring within the shipbuilding industry
 is in the area of electronic communications.  An emplaced  electronic
network is seen as one of the mechanisms  to significantly improve
competitiveness of the shipbuilding enterprise.  It provides the
opportunity to have instantaneous information transfer, which
supports the concepts of shortened production times, of flexible
manufacturing systems and the mass customization of  products.<I>(1)</I>
    In recognition of this benefit, shipyards, and their vendors
around the world are actively involved in developing and emplacing
electronic communication systems.  National efforts are occurring
in the United States, in Europe,  and in the Pacific Rim.  Individual
shipyards are aggressively evaluating the concepts, and some are
actively into the implementation phase.  Some of the vendor associations
are supporting the implementation initiatives of their members.
 And, most of the classification societies are evaluating expanded
electronic communication networks linking them to the shipyards
and to the vendor base.
<P>
The American efforts have revealed issues indicating a need to
examine benefits of international cooperation  on some of the
issues.  First, and foremost, was the question of whether there
is an interest in other regions of the world to have cooperation.
 And, if there is an interest, the question then becomes one of
determining those areas where cooperation would be most beneficial.
 Finally,  there would be the selection of the most effective
method[s] of cooperation. 
<P>
The American investigations have also revealed issues relating
to information security, information formatting, functional relationships,
and organizational and/or institutional barriers.  <P><HR><P>
<I>(1) For an expamded discussion of these, and other, advanced manufacturing concepts refer to <U>Manufacturing Systems: Foundation of World-Class Prectice</U>, National Academy of Engineering, 1992.</I>
<P><HR><P>
Because of the complexity of the issues, the variety of stakeholders,
and the international nature of the questions raised, it was deemed
appropriate to have the workshop, and possibly others, to focus
on issues related to the dynamics of electronic communications
in the shipbuilding industry and its vendor base.   The workshop's
objectives were three-fold:<BR>

<OL>
<LI><I>describe experiences and activities relative to electronic
communications appropriate to shipbuilding and its vendor base;
</I>
<LI><I>share thoughts relative to lessons learned, and problem
areas; and</I>
<LI><I>suggest ideas on how to implement electronic communications
systems that will be internationally responsive.</I>
</OL>

<P>
The list of attendees and the agenda for the meeting are shown
in Appendix A.  <BR>

<P>
As the agenda in  Appendix A indicates,  the workshop was organized
into three sessions.  In the first session there were presentations
by representatives from each of the three major world regions
represented at the meeting:  United States, Europe, and Japan.
  Each presentation was an overview of the major efforts underway
in that region to effect an electronics communication  system,
optimized to the needs of the shipyards and their vendors.  A
summary of each presentation is presented in the next section;
a selection of the overhead slides used by each presenter is contained
in Appendix B.  <BR>

<P>
 The second session was configured into three 6-8 person break-out
groups.  Each of the groups was asked to discuss three general
topics,  and three detail topics if time permitted.  The topics
are shown in  Table 1.   <BR>

<H1>A.  Some United States Initiatives<BR>
</H1>

<H2>1.  The Defense Advanced Research Program Agency [DARPA] &quot;MARITECH&quot;
Program  [presented by Mr. Robert Schaffran,  DARPA]</H2>

<P>
<B> </B>
<P>
MARITECH is a five year program set up by DARPA (Defense Advance
Research Project Agency) of the United States  Department of Defense.
 One of  MARITECH program  aims  is to support research that will
improve the communications and information flow for the shipbuilding
and shipping industry<BR>

<P>
In Phase One, MARITECH supported a series of market analyses during
1994-96 and involved every interested party of the shipping industry.
 Interested parties [which included non-USA organizations] submitted
proposals to MARITECH who reviewed each proposal and selected
those it deemed strongest.  MARITECH's contribution was viewed
as an investment that would assist the U.S. shipbuilding industry
 in providing a quality product.    <BR>

<P>
The following conditions applied:
<OL>
<LI><I><FONT SIZE=2>MARITECH <I>only put up 50% of the project
cost.</I></FONT></I>
<LI><I><FONT SIZE=2>MARITECH <I>has no data rights on any process/product
developed by the project,  <B>but</B> in the event of any military
movements, MARITECH <B>can</B> gain march in rights.</I></FONT></I>
<LI><I><FONT SIZE=2>The life of the program is five years; after
that there is no further funding contemplated.</FONT></I>
<LI><I><FONT SIZE=2>MARITECH<I> completed 36 commercial designs
during phase one,  and has 6 ships ready for export.</I></FONT></I>
</OL>

<P>

<P>
 Phase Two of the program was to assist the shipyards in entering
the international market.  The  projects were to encourage and
implement advanced technology development specifically looking
at:<BR>

<OL>
<LI><I><FONT SIZE=2>the changes in culture to compete with commercial
practices;</FONT></I>
<LI><I><FONT SIZE=2>dramatic improvements required to  increase
the market share; and </FONT></I>
<LI><I><FONT SIZE=2>requirements to self-sustain the shipbuilding
base.</FONT></I>
</OL>

<P>
<BR>

<P>
Examples of projects undertaken in this phase  were:<BR>

<OL>
<LI><I><FONT SIZE=2>Integrated product and process data environment
to revolutionize the ship design and bid process.</FONT></I>
<LI><I><FONT SIZE=2>National shipbuilding information infrastructure
to support ship construction.</FONT></I>
<LI><I><FONT SIZE=2>STEP-Ship product model exchange;</FONT></I>
<LI><I><FONT SIZE=2>Digital product catalogues.</FONT></I>
<LI><I><FONT SIZE=2>Commercial ship life-cycle support information
infrastructure.</FONT></I>
</OL>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2></FONT>
<P>
 In October, 1996, proposals were solicited for the following
thrust areas:<BR>

<OL>
<LI><I><FONT SIZE=2>Advanced business practices technology [requirements
analysis, supplier relations and material procurement, human resources
management, customer relations and life-cycle support, cost estimating
and financial management systems, and marketing].</FONT></I>
<LI><I><FONT SIZE=2>Enterprise-wide technology [dynamic modeling
and simulation, product-to-process decomposition, production planning
and scheduling, material tracking and control, advanced CAD/CAM/CIM,
ship production processes, and yard layout]. </FONT></I>
</OL>

<P>

<P>
The whole process of the MARITECH program is to assist the industry
to profitably market, design, produce and support ships with greater
value and in less time than anyone else in the world.  <BR>

<H2>2.  Presentation  of  American  Efforts  in  Electronic  Commerce
Infrastructure:  &quot;The Development of Marine Machinery and
Equipment Standards for the U.S. Shipbuilding Industry&quot; [presented
by Dr. Martin Fritts of SAIC.]<BR>
</H2>

<P>
With assistance from MARITECH and US Maritime Administration (MARAD),
The Marine Machinery Association (MMA) is  developing methods
of electronic commerce that will allow manufacturers to present
technical information, prices and availability to the customer
via computer.  The project's purpose is to achieve the following:
<BR>

<OL>
<LI><I><FONT SIZE=2>revise the standards of marine information,
 and develop the system;</FONT></I>
<LI><I><FONT SIZE=2>create electronic vendor catalogs;  and </FONT></I>
<LI><I><FONT SIZE=2>research and improve electronic communications
for the marine industry.</FONT></I>
</OL>

<P>

<P>
The aim is to produce catalogs on a six month time frame, and
to review on a regular basis  the procedure of  recording the
material itself.     This is needed because of the speed in which
technology is improving. <B> </B>The tasks for accomplishing this
are:-<BR>

<OL>
<LI><I><FONT SIZE=2>assisting in standards generation, revision
and adoption;</FONT></I>
<LI><I><FONT SIZE=2>looking at production of prototype electronic
catalogs; and, </FONT></I>
<LI><I><FONT SIZE=2>electronic commerce.</FONT></I>
</OL>

<P>
<I><FONT SIZE=2></FONT></I>
<P>
The type of  hard/software used must be easily understood and
operated.  The Internet is ideal as it is both universal and portable.
 The approach is: <BR>

<OL>
<LI><I><FONT SIZE=2>the hardware used would be put up by MMA;
and, .  </FONT></I>
<LI><I><FONT SIZE=2>laptops could be distributed to get things
moving quicker and easier. [CD-ROM is serving as a laptop at the
moment as the Internet is not quite ready. this is still quite
cheap at only 78 cents a CD-ROM which can be distributed overnight.]</FONT></I>
</OL>

<P>

<P>
The format is not final and is open to criticism.  There are test
pages set up to look at the way MMA has bought the information
system together; this can be found on: &lt;www.nsf.com/mma&gt;.
<BR>

<P>
Several CD-ROMS have been produced which are currently being developed
for six companies involved in the program.  The companies vary
in size.  Large ones would include Leslie Controls and Carrier
 Transicold Division of Carrier Corporation.   There are also
small companies involved in the project.<BR>

<P>
The CD-ROMs serve as electronic catalogs and are a cheap and easy
way of mailing to engineers and agents.  The data on the catalog
can be updated easily with a simple connection to the vendor's
server.  It is essential to get the electronic in place and get
the infrastructure up and working.  Standards are needed  to make
the electronic data an internationally used package. <BR>

<P>
NECRC has regional electronic resource centers that support over
350,000 small and medium sized enterprises nationwide who respond
to 98% of all DOD procurements. Its long term mission is to have
a world-class supplier network that links U.S. industry to a national
information infrastructure.   There is a program with a shipbuilding
initiative that has the following activities:  <BR>

<OL>
<LI><I><FONT SIZE=2>process analysis with shipbuilding 'network'

<H1>B.  European Efforts in Electronic Commerce Infrastructure
<BR>
</H1>

<H2>1.  MARIS Project Overview [presented by Dirk Petrat of the
European Commission].<BR>
</H2>

<P>
The Maritime Information Society (MARIS) is an information society
designed to keep the shipping industry internationally updated.<B>
 </B>The MARIS program was one of eleven projects set up at a
G7 conference in Brussels in 1995.  The idea is to launch these
pilot programs in order to build international links in the marine
industry.<BR>

<P>
MARIS has a framework of programs to help assist in the existence
of the international marine industry including:
<UL>
<LI>MARTRANS which deals with the handling of cargo
<LI>SAFEMAR to make sure regulations are approved to combine and
</UL>

<P>
control these systems (electronic charts/ship reporting/port logistics)
<UL>
<LI>MARSOURCE for the marine resources (fisheries database)
<LI>MARVEL  for the industrial sector (intelligent manufacture)
</UL>

<P>

<P>
 The main objectives of MARIS are to:<BR>

<OL>
<LI><I><FONT SIZE=2>establish a worldwide maritime information
system;</FONT></I>
<LI><I><FONT SIZE=2>promote the operability and connectivity of
existing information systems worldwide;</FONT></I>
<LI><I><FONT SIZE=2>demonstrate the possible benefits of maritime
information technology; and,</FONT></I>
<LI><I><FONT SIZE=2>support the worldwide standardization in the
maritime sector.</FONT></I>
</OL>

<P>

<H2> 2.  The MARVELOUS[ project presented by Joachim Brodd, of
BALance Consultants].<BR>
</H2>

<P>
 The Maritime Industry's Virtual Enterprise Linkage Open User
Syndicate (MARVELOUS) is an industrial coordination project, and
is part of the MARVEL initiative.   It has been set up to try
to harmonize the generic requirements for the implementation of
information technology.<BR>
 The project began 15 November 1995 and will continue until 14
February 1997.  The budget for this program is 2.4 million ECU.
 MARVELOUS temporarily joins companies together to perform a product.
 Partners of the MARVELOUS project include shipyards, classification
societies and other supporting societies.<BR>
 
<H2> 3.  Electronic Data Interchange for the European MARITIME
Industry (EDIMAR). <BR>
</H2>

<P>
 EDIMAR is a project derived from MARVELOUS to research the electronic
data interchange for the European maritime industry.  EDIMAR applications
link to classification societies which links to the supplier,
shipyards, etc.  The product structure uses standard parts, raw
material and &quot;make-to-order&quot; products.<B>   </B>By using
the EDI system vast amounts of time and money can be saved.  A
survey was performed using a Danish steel mill in which the following
results occurred:<BR>

<OL>
<LI><I><FONT SIZE=2>Time taken for the preparation of a steel
order (30 pos.) for  ship took:<BR>
  a.  28 minutes (without EDI)<BR>
  b.  8 minutes (with EDI).</FONT></I>
<LI><I><FONT SIZE=2>The adaptation of order responses for steel
took:<BR>
  a.  62 minutes (without EDI)<BR>
  b.  4 minutes (with EDI).</FONT></I>
</OL>

<P>
 
<P>
 The steel mill was a very small example but proves that vast
savings can be made in all aspects of the maritime industry by
using electronic data.<BR>

<H2> 4.  Special Interested Groups (SIG)<BR>
</H2>

<P>
             MARVELOUS are already working with many  special
interest groups (SIGs) from European countries, it is hoped that
this can be expanded so SIGs can be located nationally.<BR>

<H2> 5.  The SEASPRITE Project [presented by Fermando Caldeira-Saraiva.]
<BR>
</H2>

<P>
 The Software Architectures for Ship Product Data Integration
&amp; Exchange (SEASPRITE) project, was the first program started
after the MARIS requirements were designed.   The proposal for
SEASPRITE was submitted in September 1995 and was approved in
principle in January 1996.  The technical annex was completed
in April 1995 and the project actually started in July 1996. 
The completion date for this project will be June 1999.  SEASPRITE's
aim is to change the way in which the maritime industry is run
today, concentrating on current systems like :<BR>

<OL>
<LI><I><FONT SIZE=2>ship plans being the main means of communication
between business partners;</FONT></I>
<LI><I><FONT SIZE=2>manual re-entry of data is prevalent;</FONT></I>
<LI><I><FONT SIZE=2>tasks being carried out sequentially; and,</FONT></I>
<LI><I><FONT SIZE=2>the control of labor being intensive.</FONT></I>
</OL>

<P>
<I><FONT SIZE=2></FONT></I>
<P>
 The working methods currently used consist of vast amounts of
paper and storage space, SEASPRITE intend to change this system:
<BR>

<OL>
<LI><I><FONT SIZE=2>using information technology to improve industry
performance;</FONT></I>
<LI><I><FONT SIZE=2>creating virtual enterprise solutions with
data sharing between business partners;</FONT></I>
<LI><I><FONT SIZE=2>ensuring version control is automated; and</FONT></I>
<LI><I><FONT SIZE=2>encouraging re-use of ship data in all ship
life-cycle phases.</FONT></I>
</OL>

<P>

<P>
 This new vision hopes to cut down time, space, wastage and ensure
all information can be gained effectively and efficiently, to
get private and public information stored together.
<P>
A system must be created and carried out in real-life.<BR>

<P>
 It is expected that over a full life-cycle of a plant, 10-30%
of the life-time costs can be saved.  Other industries have found
time-to-market is reduced which increases market penetration.
<BR>

<H1>C.  Electronic Commerce in Shipbuilding and Ship Machinery
Manufacture in Japan [presented by Shigeru Ito of the Japan Ship
Center (JETRO)]<BR>
</H1>

<P>
 The Japanese are behind in relation to the development of electronic
communication for the maritime industry.  Japan is concentrating
on improving the productivity in the field rather than improving
electronic communication facilities.  Japanese builders are in
a difficult situation concerning electronic communication.  There
is no appreciation to the currency and other such cultural issues.

 CIM is a system which started in 1987 and is aimed at improving
productivity.  It is a database which operates in-house and covers
all items from design to construction.
<P>
The system has been found to improve the productivity in the ship
yard.  This project only consisted of major shipbuilders and didn't
affect other marine companies.<BR>

<P>
 In Spring 1995, a report was issued;  &quot;The Future Course
of Ship Building and Ship Building Industry.&quot;  This report
looks at new concepts in shipbuilding, challenges for Japan within
the shipbuilding industries and which measures need to be taken
to achieve these measures.<BR>

SESSION<BR>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=4> The attendees were divided into three discussion
groups [see Appendix C-1 for the listing for the groups].  The
groups were then asked to discuss three general questions, and
, if time permitted, to examine three additional issues.  Table
1, page 4-5, listed the questions/issues.  <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4> On the question of whether it makes sense for the
various national interest to work together,  all three groups
gave an emphatic &quot;yes&quot; response.   One group summarized
the responses of all: &quot;We must work together due to increasing
globalization in the manufacturing for the marine industry.  The
exchange is inevitable; cooperation will hasten the process, and
will support an enhanced competitive position.&quot;<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4> There was considerable variation in the areas where
cooperation should occur.  Among the ideas that listed were:<BR>
</FONT>
<OL>
<LI><I><FONT SIZE=2>standardization [both in the development and
in the implementation],</FONT></I>
<LI><I><FONT SIZE=2>defining a common vision for what electronic
commerce is to achieve;</FONT></I>
<LI><I><FONT SIZE=2>Internet facilitation, and the development
of a common understanding of how to move toward virtual manufacturing
systems; </FONT></I>
<LI><I><FONT SIZE=2>training program, especially for vendors;</FONT></I>
<LI><I><FONT SIZE=2>test beds for project evaluations; and</FONT></I>
<LI><I><FONT SIZE=2>rationalization of business practices.</FONT></I>
</OL>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2></FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> </FONT>There was agreement by all of the groups
that the cooperation should be directed through the MARIS G-7
organization.  The United States, the European Community, and
Japan are all part of the G-7 structure,  thus a &quot;ready&quot;
vehicle is in place to be utilized.  [The American delegates indicated
during the &quot;open session&quot; they would work to see the
United States more integrated into the MARIS structure, especially
the MARVEL activity.]<BR>

<P>
 One of the groups suggested that the level of concern for protection
of information was a function on the type of information being
discussed: public or private, i.e., proprietary.  Only the proprietary
information should be dealt with, and even then it should be recognized
that it is almost impossible to completely control the security
of the data.    A possible solution would be to develop a repository
of information on security problems and solutions. <BR>

<P>
 In the open discussion  there appeared to be a consensus develop
that the shipbuilding community should be the leader in organizing
an international forum.  The attendees felt that the same force
would not occur with the initiative being led by the vendor community.
<BR>

<P>
 One of the delegates [from Italy] suggested that time is of the
essence in emplacing an effective electronic communications system
that links the shipyards with the vendor base.   At the outside,
it was felt that an effective system must be in place in 2-3 years.
 Delay  beyond that horizon date  would mean loss of any competitive
benefits that would result from early emplacement.<BR>

<H3>September 1995<BR>  Notes from the 4th European Conference on
Advanced Materials and Processes, Padua/Venice, 25 -- 28 September 1995</H3>

<P>Includes:<BR>  Summary<BR>  Intermetallics<BR>  Powder Metallurgy<BR>
  Metal Matrix Composites<BR>  Superalloys<BR>  General Impressions
</P><P><B>Summary</B><BR>  Organized by Associazione Italiana di
Metallurgia on behalf of the 40,000 member Federation of European
Materials Societies, the conference boasted some 300+ oral and poster
presentations of research results from throughout Europe. Five sessions
in addition to the poster session were run simultaneously, and papers
and keynote addresses were organized into eight broad categories
including ceramics and glasses, polymers, composites, structural
metallic materials, surface engineering, materials and processing,
special and functional materials, and environmental effects. My
attention was focused on works presented on intermetallics, powder
metallurgy, aluminum alloys and their composites, metal matrix
composites, innovative steels and superalloys, and small scale
structural alloys. Summaries of presentations and poster displays of
interest that I saw are presented below, as well as general impressions
of the effectiveness of the conference. More detailed information;
including abstracts and copies of papers, and means of contacting
individual participants; will be promptly and cheerfully supplied upon
your request.
</P><P><B>Intermetallics</B><BR>  The keynote lecture; a strong
review of current fundamental understanding of diffusion in Ti-Al, Ni-Al
and Fe-Si and Fe-Ge-Si compounds; was presented by Dr. Helmut Mehrer of
the University of Munster, Germany. Copies are available for those
interested.
</P><P> Interesting work done at the University of Neuchatel in
Switzerland was presented by Drs. David Morris and Maria Morris. Efforts
there are directed toward microstructural characterization of aluminides
and development of structure-property relationships; data for Fe-Al,
Ni-Al and Ti-Al systems were presented. Efforts to associate equilibrium
disorder at domain boundaries in Ni3Al with ductility are interesting,
although controversial. Of particular interest to this participant,
mechanical properties (hardness and yield strength) have been derived
for three microstructural phases in the Ti-Al-Mo system: alpha2, beta2
and gamma. Future efforts will involve assessment of elevated
temperature properties in the Ti-44Al-2Mo alloy as a function of
microstructure.
</P><P> Dr. Johann Mullauer of the GKSS Research Center in Geesthacht,
Germany is investigating a Howmet-cast near-gamma Ti-Al alloy modified
with Cr, Mn, Nb, Si and B additions which show improved specific
stiffness (attributed to boride and silicide precipitates) and
resistance to oxidation (associate with Nb addition) in comparison to a
Ti-48Al-2Cr "pilot" alloy.
</P><P> Dr. Stefan Willems presented work carried out at the Technical
University of Hamburg, Germany which included detailed characterization
of microstructural changes associated with high temperature deformation
of gamma-TiAl. Static and dynamic recrystallization and phase
stabilities have been studied in an attempt to explain the dependence of
strain-rate sensitivity on temperature.
</P><P> More fundamental work to understand deformation in this class
of materials is being conducted at EPFL in Lausanne, Switzerland by Drs.
Joel Bonneville and Jean-Luc Martin. Their work is on the
characterization of superdislocation generation, motion and annihilation
in polycrystalline intermetallics. Results of studies of a gamma-TiAl
alloy (Ti47Al51Mn2) and on Ni3Al variations where significant
proportions of Al is substituted by Hf or Ta were presented at this
meeting.
</P><P><B>Powder Metallurgy</B><BR>  In work presented by Marianne
Leiderman at the Israel Institute of Technology in Haifa, improvements
in the density, hardness and toughness of WC cutting tool materials is
attributed to the use of ultrafine precursor powders (<0.3 micrometers).
It was shown that most of the sintering was carried out in the solid
state, reducing and possibly eliminating the need for matrix cobalt
thereby increasing hardness even further.
</P><P><B>Metal Matrix Composites</B><BR>  Copper MMCs may offer a
reasonable alternative to Cu-Be alloys for high-stiffness,
intermediate-temperature-capable electrical and thermal conduits as
discussed by Dr. Wolfgang Puesche of the University of Dresden. Recent
work there has shown that mechanical and physical properties of Cu-4 wt%
Ti alloys reinforced with 10 vol% TiC approach those of Cu-Be alloys.
The promise of eliminating the need for handling beryllium is very
attractive for reasons of safety and economy.
</P><P> Damage models in particulate reinforced metal-matrix composites
generated collaboratively by Drs. Alan Plumtree of the University of
Waterloo in Ontario and Paul Mummery of the University of Leeds in the
UK were very mature and seem worthy of further assessment.
</P><P><B>Superalloys</B><BR>  The keynote lecture was presented by
Dr. Uwe Glatzel of the Technical University of Berlin where the effects
of relative misfits at the gamma-gamma boundaries of the superalloy
CMSX-4 during high temperature deformation are being studied. They have
found that the magnitude of the internal compressive stresses parallel
to the grain boundaries can be as great as 250MPa. These results were
intelligently related to microstructural development observed during
high temperature deformation.
</P><P> Among the several papers presented on microstructural changes
observed in nickel-based superalloys in response to elevated temperature
stresses, a report given by Muriel Veron on work done with Dr. Yves
Brechet at the Domane Universitaire de Genoble, France was the most
substantive. The effects of plastic and diffusional flow at service
temperatures was incorporated into a simulation program which
demonstrated that the rate of gamma-plate thickening is greater in
response to compressive loading than in response to tensile loading.
These predictions were collaborated by detailed microstructural
observations.
</P><P><B>General Impressions</B><BR>  This was the 4th EuroMat and
the largest to date. These meetings are meant to provide a venue for
researchers from all of Europe to meet and find areas of common
interest. Collaborations among scientists of different nations is
encouraged, and one of the plenary lectures was dedicated to assessment
of the European Commissions priorities for materials research, the
budget allocated for the work, and detailed description of the
Brite-Euram research funding opportunities.
</P><P> The format of the conference with its simultaneous sessions
suggested comparisons with the larger TMS and MRS conferences held in
the United States, and perhaps those more established meetings provided
a model for EuroMat. While several good presentations were made, my
impression is that the conference lacked the "critical mass" of
participants necessary to support strong, focused dialogue. A broad call
for papers was responded to with numerous works of variable quality on
multiple topics, and apparently most were included in the program.
Although papers were clustered into areas of research, the sessions
often lacked unifying themes.

</PRE>
<P><B>1. Introduction and general impressions</B><BR>  The World
Titanium Conferences have become the meeting ground for researchers in
all of the various fields of Ti development. Nearly 500 works were
scheduled for presentation at the Eighth Conference; topics ranged from
raw materials and primary processing, alloy development including first
principle approaches to alloy constitution and structure predictions,
relationships between microstructure and mechanical properties, modeling
of thermo-mechanical processing, environmental behavior and surfaces,
and applications. Four concurrent oral presentation sessions, in
addition to two extensive poster sessions, were held throughout the
four-day conference. My attention was focused on those sessions that
addressed intermetallics; titanium matrix composites; mechanical
properties and microstructures; and some presentations in sessions on
alloy development, alloy constitution and structure; and environmental
behavior and surfaces. Summaries of selected presentations and poster
displays are presented in the following sections; points of particular
technical interest have been highlighted. More detailed information
about the conference, the work presented, and means of contacting the
researchers' whose observations are discussed here is available upon
request.
</P><P> My general impression of the work presented at the conference
was positive; the caliber of the work was generally very high. As the
meeting progressed some interesting trends developed. Firstly, there
appeared to be distinct differences in research focus between European
and American programs: US presentations tended to be on the more
"advanced" classes of materials (e.g., TMC and intermetallics) whereas
European efforts are directed toward new versions of "conventional
alloys" (e.g., IMI 834 and B-CEZ). Another clear trend was demonstrated
in most of the Chinese presentations where significant language
difficulties were encountered. More casual discussions with these
scientists about their work was impossible because of the communication
failure. An unfortunate consequence of this is that Chinese research
efforts and objectives remain obscure, whether they are intentionally
shielded or not.
</P><P> Perhaps the parcel of information that generated the greatest
impact during the conference was not presented orally nor as a poster,
but rather by word of mouth during coffee breaks and lunches. The merger
of TiMet Corporation and IMI Titanium was announced formally in the
press and circulated quickly among the conference participants.
Potential ramifications of the move provided wonderful topics for casual
speculation; the consensus being that the two companies were joining in
an attempt to increase competitiveness with respect to Russian, Japanese
and Chinese titanium producers who are growing stronger each year.
</P><P> After recent experiments in holding the titanium conferences at
three-year intervals, the organizing committee has decided to return to
the original format and hold the meetings once every four years, and
this decision was received very favorably by the participants. In each
of the sessions that I attended, I found the audience's level of
specialization and expertise to be very high. In general, these
researchers are familiar with current literature, have strong
backgrounds and good memories; only recent observations or fully
developed concepts are of real interest to them. Conversely, since it is
the largest forum for meeting fellow titanium metallurgists there is
sufficient encouragement for everyone to contribute something, even if
it isn't fully developed or if it relies heavily on material that has
been previously reported, in order to justify attendance. Extending the
schedule of the conference to a four-year format may go along way to
balance these opposing needs. The next World Titanium Conference is
being planned for 1999 in St. Petersburg, Russia.
</P><P> Selected Lecture notes:<BR>
<B>2. Plenary lectures</B><BR>  The first morning of the conference
was devoted to introductory presentations that highlighted current
research activities in each of the seven most represented nations: the
United Kingdom, France, Japan, Russia, the United States, Germany and
China. In some cases these were simply introductions to the technical
papers that would be presented during the conference. Other speakers
provided surveys of current research programs and objectives and of the
applications that are driving titanium alloy development.
</P><P> Notably, Dr. Paul Blenkinsop of the Interdisciplinary Research
Center (IRC) at the University of Birmingham discussed current efforts
to optimize existing IMI Titanium alloys for more demanding
applications; the pursuit of superplastic forming and diffusion bonding
technologies at British Aerospace, Rolls-Royce and DRA for potential
weight savings; efforts in forging simulation and welding at Smith
Clayton Forging and Bunting Titanium LTD, respectively; Rolls-Royce's
introduction of discontinuously reinforced, XD intermetallic matrix
composites to the Trent stator vane; and the joint effort in the
development of a "bling," bladed ring assembly, by DRA, Sigma and
Rolls-Royce.
</P><P> Dr. Bernard Champin of CEZUS, France announced SNECMA's
NEAR-TERM APPLICATIONS OF TI-17, 8-CEZ AND TI-6-4-8-2 INTO TURBINE
ENGINES AND DISCUSSED THEIR LONG-TERM GOALS TO INCORPORATE TI3AL AND
TIAL INTO FUTURE GENERATION ENGINES. Current large research and
development activities explore deformation in Ti-Al-V alloys, and
improvements in creep resistance and ductility in gamma-based
intermetallics conducted at ONERA under BRITE EURAM support. Brief
mention of Ti-Co-Cr alloys for potential dental applications was also
made.
</P><P> Dr. Igor Gorynin drew attention to work at the Central Research
Institute of Structural Materials (Russia) to develop Ti-alloys for
marine applications. He illustrated that THE SENSITIVITY OF STRESS
CORROSION CRACKING SUSCEPTIBILITY ON ALLOY COMPOSITION, POINTING OUT
THAT THE CRITICAL ALUMINUM CONTENT APPEARS TO BE BETWEEN 4.0 AND 5.5
ATOM%. Other efforts discussed were directed toward improvements in weld
design and in Ti welding processes.
</P><P> Mr. R. R. Boyer of the Boeing Commercial Airplane Group
presented a lively, applications-oriented view of Ti-alloy development
in the U.S. He pointed TO PRATT & WHITNEY'S POTENTIAL USE OF XD
TITANIUM-ALUMINIDE CAST COMPONENTS AND TO ORTHORHOMBIC-BASED ALLOY
DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES AS EXAMPLES OF EFFORTS IN INTERMETALLICS. More
conventional alloys to be incorporated into side-body ribs and bulkhead
(forged by Wymann-Gordon) of the F-22 were noted, and the Ti-10V-2Fe-Al
forgings used in Boeing's 777 landing gear. Also discussed was the
development of Ti/polymer-matrix-composite hybrid laminates for the
MD-11.
</P><P><B>3. Intermetallics</B><BR>  A preponderance of the material
presented on this subject was the result of efforts in the U.S. Dr.
James Chesnutt of GE Aircraft Engines presented the opening lecture: a
general overview of the properties and potential application of
orthorhombic, alpha-2 and gamma titanium aluminides. Current research
and development at GE is focused on Ti-48Al-2Cr-2Nb for potential
incorporation into the GE90 as transition duct beams and low pressure
turbine blades.
</P><P> Dr. James Larsen of Wright Laboratory presented the results OF
A THOUGHTFUL INVESTIGATION OF MICROSTRUCTURAL INFLUENCES ON KEY
MECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF THE NEAR-GAMMA TI-ALUMINIDE K-5
(Ti-46.5Al-3Nb-2Cr-0.2W) quantifying, among other observations, the
enhanced fatigue resistance of the lamellar microstructural condition as
compared with the duplex microstructure of equiaxed grains.
</P><P> Professor I. Polkin of VILS in Moscow presented the interesting
observation that the presence of large, uniformly distributed pores in
as-cast near-gamma titanium aluminides are actually beneficial. They
serve as sites for working and allow dynamic recrystallization to occur
during HIPing whereas fine pores simply heal without affecting the
microstructure.
</P><P> Professor Richard Wagner of the GKSS Research Center in
Geesthacht presented the keynote lecture on the second day of the
conference: a description of German research efforts IN GAMMA
TI-ALUMINIDES WHERE PARTICULAR ATTENTION IS DIRECTED TOWARD PRODUCING
INTERMETALLICS FOR POTENTIAL APPLICATION IN TURBO CHARGER WHEELS FOR
ABB'S LARGE DIESEL ENGINES. A TI-47AL-2CR ALLOY MODIFIED BY THE ADDITION
OF 2000 PPM BORON, GAMMA-TAB, DISPLAYS A HIGHLY REFINED, HOMOGENEOUS
MICROSTRUCTURE AND IS A LIKELY CANDIDATE FOR THIS APPLICATION. Other
efforts include development of powder metallurgy produced billets that
can be forged in a single step, offering potential processing cost
savings over conventionally cast and two-step forged products.
</P><P> Professor Hamish Fraser discussed the results of interesting
work conducted at Ohio State University to understand micro-mechanisms
of fracture and variations in fracture behavior as a function of
temperature.
</P><P> Dr. P.L. Martin of the Rockwell Science Center in California
presented results of recent work to understand the influence of small
amounts of boron and oxygen in near-gamma Ti-aluminides. He reported
that ADDITIONS OF <0.25 ATOM% B TO TI-47AL-2NB-2CR-1MO WERE SUFFICIENT
FOR LACY BORIDE PRECIPITATION AT GRAIN BOUNDARIES. The lacy borides
inhibit grain growth, allow a fully lamellar microstructure to be
achieved in forged components and therefore increase creep resistance,
fracture toughness and room temperature ductility. WHEN OXYGEN CONTENT
IS STRICTLY MINIMIZED IN THIS ALLOY COMPOSITION, THE ORDERED BETA PHASE
WAS FOUND TO BE STABLE AT THE EXPENSE OF THE ALPHA-2 PHASE.
</P><P> Dr. D. Rugg of IMI Titanium, UK reported on work conducted
jointly with DRA and Rolls-Royce. They have demonstrated the feasibility
of extruding near-gamma Ti-aluminide Ti-48Al-2Nb-2Mn and have shown that
extrusions can have as much as 30% higher strength than cast materials.
Although the highest strengths were observed in the as-extruded
condition; extruded, solution heat treated and aged material showed
greater ductility and still maintained yield strengths higher than cast
material.
</P><P> Dr. Gilbert Henaff of CNRS, France presented observations on
the role of environment in fatigue crack propagation in gamma-based
Ti-aluminides. In order to establish the effects of microstructural
state work was done on two alloys: an as-cast Ti-48Al-2Mn-2Nb with a
fully lamellar gamma + alpha-2 microstructure, a cast and HIPed
Ti-48Al-2Cr-2Nb alloy comprised only of fully equiaxed gamma grains. No
significant effect of microstructure or variation between the
composition of the alloys was observed on crack closure behavior,
although a weak interaction between environment (moisture) and closure
effects was noted. Fatigue crack growth rates in gamma-based
Ti-aluminides appears to be highly sensitive to the amplitude of applied
stress.
</P><P> Dr. Brian Worth of the University of Dayton presented the
results of a study of fatigue crack growth behavior in wrought and heat
treated near-gamma Ti-aluminide K-5 in two microstructural conditions:
fully equiaxed and fully lamellar. The alloy in both microstructural
states illustrated improved crack growth resistance at 600C compared
with room temperature. All other variables being equal, fatigue crack
growth rate was found to be lower in the lamellar microstructure and is
considered to be the result of intrinsic toughening mechanisms. As
observed by Dr. Henaff, delta-K has a significant influence on crack
growth rate, and this is attributed to crack closure mechanisms.
</P><P><B>4. Process modeling</B><BR>  Professor Russell W. Evans of
the IRC at Swansea, UK delivered an elegant keynote address; he defined
the key parameters and introduced the approach necessary for developing
models to predict microstructural evolution and recrystallization
phenomena during forging.
</P><P> Dr. S.P. Fox followed Prof. Evan's talk with a description of
current capabilities at IMI Titanium Ltd. where a three-dimensional,
IRC-developed model is used to modify forging practices for greater
microstructural control.
</P><P><B>5. Conventional titanium alloys</B><BR>  Ms. A. Barussaud
of SNECMA discussed efforts to control microstructure in large disks for
the high temperature compressor of the GE90 aeroengine. The
microstructure that offered THE BEST COMPROMISE BETWEEN MAXIMIZED CREEP
RESISTANCE AND LOW-CYCLE-FATIGUE RESISTANCE WAS FOUND TO BE COMPOSED OF
UNCRYSTALLIZED AND COLD-WORKED BETA GRAINS WITH THE ALPHA PHASE PRESENT
IN A WIDMANSTATTEN STRUCTURE. Sub-scale studies correlated slow cooling
from heat treatment temperatures with improved ductility, and
improvements in fracture toughness and creep resistance could be
associated with increased grain boundary angle, theta.
</P><P> Professor G. Lutjering of the Technical University of
Hamburg-Harburg, Germany compared the mechanical properties of Ti-6242
(Ti-6Al-2Sn-4Zr-2Mo-0.08Si) with the Russian alloy BT25Y
(Ti-6Al-2Sn-3.5Zr-3.5Mo-1W-0.2Si). When the two alloys were forged the
BT25Y was found to have a much finer microstructure, and the slower
kinetics were attributed to the tungsten addition. The BT25Y
DEMONSTRATED SUPERIOR YIELD STRENGTH, DUCTILITY AND FRACTURE TOUGHNESS
IN BOTH THE AS-FORGED AND IN THE FORGED+ANNEALED CONDITIONS, AND THIS
TREND IS MAINTAINED AT ELEVATED TEMPERATURE. In the as-forged condition
creep resistance is better for the BT25Y than the Ti-6242, but both
alloys display equivalent creep resistance after annealing.
</P><P> Dr. Mark Hardy of DRA, UK, presented some interesting
observations of a study of fatigue crack growth behavior in near-alpha
titanium alloys, specifically IMI 829 at 600C. He found that fatigue
crack growth rate is time dependent and that loading rate controls
da/dN; these were seen as functions of oxidation and creep effects. The
degree (e.g., number and severity) of secondary cracking was also found
to correlate directly with loading rate. By studying the effects of
symmetric and asymmetric loading schemes it was illustrated that
loading, not relaxation, determines da/dN.
</P><P> Dr. S. Lesterlin of CNRS, France has conducted an extensive
series of experiments to determine the effects of environment on the
fatigue behavior of Ti-6242. For the microstructure composed of 75%
alpha lathes in beta, she found that the material is especially
sensitive to environment over the temperature range of 465 to 600C;
over a magnitude difference in behavior was observed when tests
conducted at 35 Hz and 0.1 Hz were compared. Results of tests done with
various dwell times showed no indication of creep fatigue effects;
however, corrosion fatigue appears to be operative over this temperature
range, and the embrittlement species has been identified as water vapor.
</P><P><B>6. Titanium matrix comopsites</B><BR>  Dr. Malcolm
Ward-Close of DRA, UK, announced that BP SIGMA FIBERS ARE NOW OWNED AND
PRODUCED BY DRA. He then presented the results of technical efforts
directed toward the LONG-TERM GOAL OF PRODUCING TITANIUM MATRIX
COMPOSITE BLINGS (BLADED-RING ASSEMBLIES) AND ACHIEVING A 70% WEIGHT
SAVINGS OVER CONVENTIONAL BLADES AND DISKS. DRA is using physical vapor
deposition to coat the Sigma Fibers with Ti or Ti-alloy. The coated
fibers can then be aligned and consolidated into impressively uniform
arrangements with high packing efficiency. Currently, 1000-meter lengths
of Ti-6-4 alloy-coated fiber can be produced.
</P><P> Dr. D. Upadhyaya of the University of Idaho has developed
email_addressA GADOLINIUM-BASED COATING THAT IS BEING CONSIDERED FOR
USE AS AN INTERFACE MATERIAL IN THE DRA COMPOSITES described above. The
coating is novel because it has a very low modulus and can accommodate
differences in CTE between the matrix and fiber; it also appears to be
chemically stable in the presence of Ti. The gadolinium-based coating is
proposed to be suitable for fiber reinforced composites of conventional
Ti-alloys, Ti3Al and TiAl.
</P><P> Joint work by Dr. K. Takashima of the Kumamoto University,
Japan and Dr. P. Bowen of the University of Birmingham has been
conducted to develop damage assessment techniques for SiC-fiber
reinforced Ti-alloys. Acoustic emission is useful for discriminating
individual fracture events; fiber pullout, fiber fracture and matrix
cracking each have different AE amplitudes. They found that at high
applied stresses acoustic emission is the more sensitive technique; at
lower applied stresses modulus and internal friction measurements are
more effective for measuring individual events.

<B>Summary</B><BR>
An advanced nitrogen-alloyed steel developed in a joint program between German bearing producer FAG, VSG Specialty Steel, and the University of Bochum for U.S. jet engine manufacturer Pratt & Whitney is reported to have significantly improved performance over currently used bearing steels.  Cronidur 30s unique microstructure of uniformly distributed semi-coherent refractory carbo-nitrides in a nitrogen-rich martensitic matrix enables superior wear resistance, corrosion resistance, rolling contact fatigue resistance, strength and toughness in comparison with conventional bearing steels.  The metallurgists who developed the alloy tell us that in several instances the properties of Cronidur 30 are one- or two-orders of magnitude better than the competitors at similar costs.<P>

<B>Introduction</B><BR>
Cronidur 30 is a promising high-nitrogen containing martensitic stainless steel developed to meet the demands of bearings in the space shuttle main engine by FAG Bearing Co. (German bearing manufacturer), Vereinigte Schmiedewerke GmbH (VSG, German steel producer), Ruhr-Universitat Bochum Institut fur Werkstoffe, and Pratt and Whitney (P&W). These particularly challenging requirements include high hardness (>58 Rc), fracture toughness, wear resistance and corrosion resistance including stress corrosion cracking resistance-- requirements that are common to several naval ship and aircraft applications. The alloys are currently produced and sold by VSG at prices comparative to those for M50 steel.  A licensing agreement is being established that will allow the production by a second source in the United States, Canada and France.<P>

<B>Material Performance</B><BR>
Perhaps the most widely used bearing steels are AMS 6444 (52100) and AMS 6490 (M50).   For more demanding high-speed bearing applications the carburized steel, M50NiL, with its high surface hardness and tough core is another material of choice.  However, these steels do not possess the corrosion resistance required for aerospace applications nor the oxygen compatibility required for Space Shuttle main engine bearings.   In their efforts to meet these demands FAG, VSG and the University of Bochum have developed Cronidur 30, one of a family of nitrogen-alloyed stainless steels boasting superior corrosion resistance.  A subsequent joint FAG/P&W program evaluated the material for use in the Space Shuttle bearing; they met success with the first flight of the high performance reusable Space Shuttle liquid oxygen turbopump bearing on 13 June 1995.  These alloys are also of great interest to those of us who do not fly Space Shuttles, because the reported mechanical properties and corrosion resistance of Cronidur 30 are significantly better than those ascribed to either M50NiL or to AISI 440C.<P>

The chemical composition of Cronidur 30, reported in weight percent, is 
Fe - 15.5 Cr - 1.0 Mo - 0.33 C - 0.33 N. An AMS specification has been released for the alloy: AMS 5859.  The alloy is produced in production pressurized electroslag remelt units in Essen, Germany.  <P>

For comparison the compositions of AISI 440C and M50NiL are <BR>
AISI 440C: Fe - 17 Cr - 0.45 Mo - 1.0 C <BR>
M50NiL: Fe - 4.1 Cr - 4.4 Mo - 1.15 V - 3.40 Ni with the surface carburized to ~0.9 C.<P>

As described by the developers, the microstructure of Cronidur 30 consists of a fine, uniform dispersion of semi-coherent refractory carbo-nitrides, displaying none of the large eutectic carbides and stringers found in AISI 440C after similar treatment.   Thermal processing and resultant characteristics of the stainless steel, as identified by the developers, are as follows.<P>

Through Hardening:  Solution, quench and temper are carried out similarly to the processing of conventional bearing steels.  After solution and quench treatment hardness is approximately 56 Rc.  Subsequent tempering precipitates semi-coherent hard carbo-nitrides throughout the microstructure that strains the martensitic matrix leading to hardnesses of between 58 and 60 Rc.<P>
 
Dual Property (DP) Processing:  DP processing is an induction hardening treatment applied to the bearing surfaces.  It is carried out in three steps: (1) conventional hardening and high temperature tempering to a medium hardness, tough core condition followed by (2) localized gradient induction heat treating to case harden the steel, and (3) finally cold treating the hardened case to lower the retained austenite level and tempering the case to 58 Rc.<P>

After conventional heat treatments to the same hardness and fracture toughness, Cronidur 30 appears to demonstrate superior strength, ductility and toughness over the commonly used corrosion resistant stainless steel AISI 440C.  The room temperature tensile yield and ultimate tensile strength of Cronidur 30 (heat treated to 58 Rc throughout) were found by the developers to be 270 ksi and 315 ksi, respectively; elongation to failure was reported at 4%.  This compares favorably with AISI 440C (heat treated to 58 Rc throughout), for which yield strength is 185 ksi, ultimate tensile strength is 254 and elongation is 0.8%.  Perhaps more significantly, the published impact energy of Cronidur 30 is 120 J/cm2 compared with 19 J/cm2 for AISI 440C.  Cronidurs reported mechanical behavior at elevated and cryogenic temperatures is similarly impressive.<P>

Anodic polarization corrosion testing in both H2SO4 and NaCl aqueous solutions conducted by FAG and P&W show that the passive current density of Cronidur 30 is two orders of magnitude lower than AISI 440C.  At least one-order of magnitude improvements in times to failure during stress corrosion tests at 120 degrees Fahrenheit and 98% humidity have also been reported for Cronidur 30.   The developers of the alloy correlate this behavior with solid solution strengthening influences of nitrogen, chromium and molybdenum and the absence of coarse chromium carbides that can set up localized galvanic cells at the steel surfaces leading to pitting. <P>

Simulated bearing tests have been conducted, including those with and without lubrication and those which incorporated cycles of 4-hour periods in salt spray chambers with 24-hour rolling contact fatigue bearing tests.  Cronidur 30 is reported to have demonstrated fatigue lives 26-times greater than that shown by AISI 440C in the lubricated condition and a 4- to 5-fold improvement in wear resistance in the un-lubricated condition.  Furthermore, the FAG/Pratt and Whitney team informs us that in combined salt spray/rolling contact fatigue AISI 440C failed within 10 hours after the first salt spray while the Cronidur 30 continued to perform well after the ninth cycle when the test was terminated.  <P>


<B>Assesment</B><BR>
FAG and Pratt and Whitney appear to have developed an impressive bearing material with properties superior to many alloys currently in use, and it is clear that numerous advanced systems must face increasingly hostile environments and will require materials that can withstand both corrosion and wear.  Affordable materials that meet these severe demands better than the previous generation are worth investigating.  Further evaluation of  Cronidur 30 for other essential properties, including fatigue performance is therefore recommended.  It is also recommended that the alloy be compared with currently used steels and other alternatives, and be considered for near-term applications in systems where significant bearing loads, wear and corrosion are anticipated. <P>

<B>Summary</B><BR>
The NATO-ARW on Protective Coatings and Thin Films was successful.   
 Highly qualified participants represented nineteen nations and several   
specific fields of study. Sessions during the one-week program included   
Plasma-Based Deposition Processes, Chemical Vapor Deposition Processes,   
Coatings for Tribological Critical Applications, Characterization, Hard   
Coatings, Structure/Property Relationships, Thermal Barrier Coatings and   
Thermal Spray Coatings, Optical Coatings, and Ion Beam Assisted   
Processes.<P>

The topics of the presentations were diverse ranging from Dr. S. Lucus's   
report on the viable application of soft diamond-like coatings as   
intermediate layers onto steel sheet for the automotive market to Prof.   
V. Valvoda's more academic but equally valuable lecture on   
"Characterization of TiN by X-Ray Diffraction."  Significant   
technological advances were reported by Dr. T. Mantyla who has developed   
a surface modification and sealing technique to be used in conjunction   
with thermal spray coatings for improved wear resistance, and by Dr. K.L.   
Lewis who reported on protective coatings for IR-optics that have   
demonstrated at least a four-fold increase in the life of optical lenses   
on the AV-8B.  Thoughtful reviews were also presented; two of particular   
note were Dr. W.J. Ensinger's discussion of ion implantation and ion beam   
assisted deposition processes for improving corrosion resistance, and Dr.   
C. Donnet's review of solid lubricant development for the demanding   
applications of space-based systems.<P>


<B>Introduction and General Impressions</B><BR>
Organized by Prof. Y. Pauleau of Grenoble the workshop was an opportunity   
for fifty-nine participants representing eighteen European countries plus   
the United States to exchange results of recent technical activities and   
to develop the personal relationships necessary for productive   
collaborations.  These goals were met easily.  During the one-week   
program, a number of very good papers were presented, and the structure   
of the workshop promoted numerous opportunities within the one-week   
program for scientists and engineers to meet in small groups and identify   
common areas of interest.<P>

Other goals of the workshop were more lofty.  Evening sessions were held   
to assess current efforts in specific subjects and to identify future   
research goals.  Topics for these sessions included "Polymer Coatings and   
Thin Films," "Replacement of Electrodeposition Processes and   
Electroplated Coatings," "Coatings for Aerospace Applications," and   
finally, "Future Directions in Research and Development of Protective   
Coatings."  In general, the broad technical issues were defined quite   
clearly during these sessions.  For example, the discussion on coatings   
for aerospace applications was introduced by Dr. Christophe Donnet, who   
presented the tribological requirements and physio-chemio requirements of   
lubricants meant to be used in space-bound systems.   This insightful   
introduction focused the discussion on what could be achieved in the near   
term.  While a variety of viewpoints were proposed some truths were   
agreed upon: there is still a need for better performing, longer lived   
lubricants and coatings, and life prediction is not a mature science and   
should receive more attention.<P>

When the topic becomes more esoteric (e.g., where is future research to   
be directed, why and by whom), the product of the group discussions   
becomes less obvious.  The conversation quickly gravitated toward the   
usual debate about the changing balance between research and development   
efforts.<P>

<B>PLasma-Based Deposition Processes</B><BR>
Dr. S. Lucus of Cockerill Sambre, a Belgian steel producer, reported on   
the practical application of soft diamond-like coatings as intermediate   
layers for paint adhesion and corrosion protection.  In the very real   
world of a steel rolling facility, Dr. Lucus' group has demonstrated a   
continuous cleaning and magnetron sputtering process that is capable of   
meeting the 200 to 400 meter per minute speeds at which sheet products   
are produced.  The resulting coating meets the same porosity and adhesion   
standards as the electrolytically prepared coatings it has been developed   
to replace, eliminating the environmental problems of disposal and   
treatment of electrodeposition waste solutions.<P>

<B>Chemical Vapor Deposition Processes</B><BR> 
Prof. G. Wahl of Technische Universitat Braunschweig, Germany presented   
the keynote talk for the CVD session in which he highlighted the   
development of "reservoir coatings" for protection of turbine blades.  An   
intermediate layer exists between the basic material and the passive   
layer.  In the event of spallation or cracking of the passive layer, this   
intermediate layer must be capable of generating another protective   
layer.  Reservoir coatings contain precipitates of Cr- or Al-rich phases   
within the intermediate layer which serve as reservoirs of the reactive   
metals from which the passive oxide layer can be rebuilt.  His work has   
demonstrated how manipulation of the layer film chemistry enables the   
repassivation kinetics to be controlled.<P>

Dr. O. Conde of the University of Lisbon reported some careful research   
on laser-assisted CVD processed boron carbide thin films.  Her group has   
been able to form stable B4C over a broad composition range and to   
precisely control lattice parameters, and therefore composition, by   
manipulating the partial pressure ratios of carbon carrier to total gas   
pressure.<P>

Dr. P. Rodhammer of Plansee AG in Austria demonstrated the applicability   
of pack cementation for depositing SiCrFe coatings onto Cb 752 screws and   
nuts for the European Space Agency.   Here oxidation resistance,   
resistance to thermal cycling at 800 degrees C and adherence to close   
tolerances within complex interior geometries were critical issues when   
determining the film and process technique to be employed.<P>

<B>Coatings for Tribological Critical Applications</B><BR> 
Dr. E.W. Roberts of ESTL in Warrington, U.K. gave the key note lecture,   
"Solid Lubricant Coatings: Their Performance and Applicability at   
Temperature Extremes," which reviewed the results of modeling and   
extensive testing of several lubricant-substrate systems in various   
environments conducted for the European Space Agency.  In summary, in an   
N2 environment MoS2 has 10-times longer life than WS2 at room   
temperature, and both lubricants degrade with increasing temperature.  In   
both N2 and N2 plus 500ppm O2 environments, silver coatings and the   
NASA-developed PS212 performed best at elevated temperatures (> 800   
degrees C), but these coatings are thicker and cannot be used for   
precision components.  At cryogenic temperatures, MoS2 performed best   
compared with lead and leaded-bronze systems, or PTFE component raceways.<P>

Dr. M.T. Dugger of Sandia National Laboratories continued the discussion   
of solid lubricants for space applications.  He has studied three films   
(MoS2 with columnar grains, Ni/MoS2 multilayer approx. 1-micron thick,   
and SbO2-doped MoS2 approx. 2-microns thick) for low earth orbit (LEO)   
where the environment is primarily atomic oxygen.  MoS2 performed best in   
all exposure conditions, retaining tribological properties even after   
atomic oxygen exposure.<P>

Dr. A. Erdemir reported that he and his colleagues at Argonne National   
Laboratories can produce smooth, nanocrystalline diamond and diamond-like   
coatings (DLCs) when using a fullerene carbon source.  He found that   
diamond coatings produced by conventional CVD methods do not graphitize;   
however, because of their hardness, they do induce wear in mating SiC   
components.  Hydrogenated DLCs will begin to graphitize at temperatures   
above 400 degrees C which limits application temperatures.  However,   
because the hydrogenated DLCs are softer they do not induce wear in   
mating components and therefore maintain a lower system frictional   
coefficient throughout wear testing.<P>

A very animated talk was given by Dr. M. Gardos of Hughes Aircraft Co.   
who presented and supported his theory of reconstruction to describe the   
tribological behavior of polycrystalline diamond films.  Reconstruction   
is the reversible process by which hydrogen atoms are liberated from the   
diamond surface as a function of temperature in vacuum.  With time at   
elevated temperature the carbon bonds, which had been left dangling by   
the liberation of hydrogen, link together and a concomitant increase in   
coefficient of friction is observed.  This leads to the speculation that   
the low frictional properties of diamond at room temperature can be   
attributed to a hydrocarbonate-like friction reducing behavior, liken by   
Dr. Gardos to the effect of motor oil.<P>

Dr. C. Donnet of Ecole Centrale de Lyon discussed "Transfer Film and Tribochemistry: Two Key Factors for the Tribology of Diamond-Like Carbon Coatings."  His work is two-fold.  First he has characterized the effects of ratios of the gaseous components (C4H4 and Ar) during processing on coating properties.  By controlling the ratios of the gases and the bias voltages, Dr. Donnet can produce films that are either soft polymer-like DLCs or hard wear resistant DLCs.  He then compared the wear behavior of these two chemically similar coatings with very different mechanical properties.  While both types of film will show similar environmental sensitivity when tested in ambient air, dry air or ultra-high vacuum, the role of the transfer film is considerable.  Performance was found to be largely determined by the effect of wear particles and debris which are clearly functions of the coating type.<P>

<B>Characterization</B><BR> 
One talk in this session was especially well presented and illustrated just how much data can be retrieved from an x-ray diffraction profile when skillfully analyzed.   Prof. V. Valvoda of the Charles University, Prague, Czech Republic compared the Bragg-Brentano and Seeman-Bohlin methods of x-ray diffraction analysis demonstrating how XRD can be utilized to thoroughly characterize the "picostructure" of a film.  Picostructure information includes lattice parameter, residual stress, microstrain, phase composition, preferred orientation and grain size.  If you share an interest in these analyses, I would recommend contacting Prof. Valvoda (valvoda@karlov.mff.cuni.cz); his understanding is rare and valuable.<P>

<B>Hard Coatings</B><BR> 
Prof. J.E. Sundgren of Linkoping University, Sweden presented the key-note lecture titled "New Hard Coatings through Metastable Thin Films."  Metastable thin films are described here as those with extensive defect structures, layered materials and/or those with metastable crystal structures.  Prof. Sundgren reviewed recent efforts in this area including the effects of ion-induced defects in TiN; the development of multilayer films (e.g., NbN-TiN, Mo-V, and TiN-AlN); and the development of hard elastic C-N films composed of crystalline clusters of a cubic phase in an amorphous matrix.<P>

<B>Thermal Barrier Coatings / Thermal Spray Coatings</B><BR> 
Dr. R.C. Tucker of Praxair Surface Technologies, Indianapolis opened the session with a keynote lecture based on his vast experience with thermal spray coatings entitled "The Use of Thermal Spray Coatings for Protection Against Wear and Corrosion at Ambient and Elevated Temperatures." His overview included descriptions of the High Velocity Oxy-Fuel (HVOF), Detonation Gun and Super D-Gun processes which typically produce coatings with thicknesses of between 50 and 2000 microns.  Higher particle velocities are attained with each new generation of thermal spray processes, and higher particle velocities are correlated with better inter-splat adhesion and consequently increased coating densities, better bonding to the substrate and improved wear resistance.  His work continues.<P>

Dr. T. Mantyla of the University of Technology in Tampere, Finland presented the results of his group's efforts to improve the mechanical properties and corrosion resistance of thermal spray coatings through modification and sealing of the surfaces.  In this work a solution of Al(OH)3 and H3PO4 is applied to an as-sprayed coating, allowed to permeate and then heat treated.  During an extensive comparison of several ceramic oxide coatings achieved by different thermal spray techniques he found that the best wear performance was produced by Detonation Gun Spray (DGS) followed by High Power Plasma Spray (HPPS), High Velocity Oxy-Fuel Spray (HVOF), and finally Atmospheric Plasma Spray (APS).  While Al2O3 with 3 percent TiO2 and Al2O3 with 40 percent Zr2O3 were found to be superior to other coatings tested, the composition of the ceramic oxide coating does not affect the wear behavior as significantly as the process technique.  Further, the wear resistance of each coating is improved by the sealing process.<P>

Dr. M.J. Deakin of Cranfield University, UK presented "The Formation of Intermetallic Diffusion Barriers by High Temperature Reaction Synthesis of Sputter Deposited Multilayers."  In this high temperature technique, the aluminum carrier melts and a step-wise reaction produces the intermetallic coating.   Using this process, Dr. Deakin and his research group have successfully produced 3-micron thick PtAl2 layers on IMI834 and TM754 substrates, demonstrating effective oxidation resistance at temperatures up to 700 degrees C.<P>

Dr. K. Rebstock of Daimler-Benz Aerospace, Germany reported on an oxidation protection system for carbon-fiber reinforced silicon carbide composites intended for use as heat shields on the Hermes.  The 100- to 150-micron thick system is composed of three layers applied by PVD or thermal spray techniques.  The first is a C-SiC bonding layer, the second is a B2O3-SiO2 self-healing functional layer, and the outer-most layer provides erosion protection.  Oxidation resistance has been demonstrated to 1600 degrees C during step-wise testing, and the coating is predicted to withstand operating conditions at 1400 degrees C for at least 100 hours.<P>

Dr. K.L. Lewis of the Royal Signal and Radar Establishment, UK presented "Ultradurable Protective Coatings Using Phosphide Materials."  These coatings have been developed to protect IR-optics from the environment while not compromising the functional properties of the substrate.  Of the phosphides studied, boron phosphide is the most interesting for it displays properties similar to diamond-- high strength, hardness and thermal conductivity.  In a collaborative program with Hugh Blackwell at MCAS Cherry Point, a combination DLC/boron phosphide coating has been found to extend the life of optical lenses installed on AV-8B's from 200 hours to more than 800 hours.<P>

<B>Ion Beam Assisted Processes</B><BR>
This session, on the last afternoon of the workshop, was kicked-off by one of the better delivered lectures of the entire week.  Dr. W.J. Ensinger of the University of Augsburg, Germany presented "Protection Against Aqueous Corrosion by Ion Implantation and Ion Beam Assisted Deposition," a discussion of how ion implantation and ion assisted deposition can be used to generate or manipulate metastable alloys at metal surfaces which behave as predicted by normal electrochemical laws.  Specific techniques highlighted in this talk included the implantation of Pt into stainless steel surfaces where Pt acts as a cathode thus shifting the potential to the anodic polarization region and inducing passivation of the stainless steel.  Pd introduced into Ti-alloys by ion implantation provides cathodic protection.  Ion assisted deposition of TiN-Ti multilayers demonstrate orders of magnitude better corrosion resistance than single layers of either because the process prevents columnar growth and the associated porosity at the grain boundaries.<P>

<H3>Notes from the 7th European Conference on Composite Materials: Realising their Potential (Incorporating Metal Matrix Composites - 5)<BR>
London, United Kingdom, 14 - 16 May 1996</H3> 

<B>Summary</B><BR>
This year the 7th European Conference on Composite Materials included Metal Matrix Composites - 5 and focused on the challenges and successes of bringing composite materials to industry.  The one-day plenary session projected a positive picture -- illustrating how decades of composites research have provided elegant solutions to challenges in civil engineering, transportation, aerospace, marine and biomedical applications -- while emphasizing the contemporary mandate of reducing implementation costs.<P>

Two days of technical sessions followed, and these too were dominated by papers describing unique applications of composites technology and manufacturing approaches.  This summary focuses on the papers presented in the Metal Matrix Composites - 5 sessions, including applications of aluminum alloy-matrix-composites for the automotive and aerospace industries.  Additionally, two new approaches to the production of fiber-reinforced titanium-matrix-composite (TMC) rings  originating at DRL (Institute for Materials Research, Germany) and at Oxford University are described.  Also reported here are the development of alumina-aluminide alloys by a reactive powder metallurgy route as described by Prof. Claussen of the Technical University of Hamburg-Harburg, and some advances in the prevention of fiber-matrix interface reactions in TMCs made by researchers at DRL.<P>

<B>General Impressions and Introduction</B><BR> 
The theme of this conference on composite materials, "Realising their Potential," encouraged participants to approach their subjects in a way dramatically different from the manner most technical symposia are guided.  Focusing on design and means of increasing the market for advanced materials, and highlighting stellar performances of the right composites in the right applications, the proceedings at times took on the qualities of a pep rally.  Participants were uplifted by illustrations of how decades of research and development have made significant contributions to society and industry.  They were also taken aback by the honest picture of the future of R&D presented there, as cost reduction was emphasized as the primary objective.<P>

Overall, I found this meeting useful for taking stock of the environment in which composites research must be conducted.  However, if this theme is invoked more often than every five years or so, it would simply generate a distraction from the fundamental aim of bringing researchers together so that they can benefit by sharing approaches and observations.  The symposium did provide a good opportunity for some researchers and design engineers to point out hard earned successes and truly innovative ideas and approaches to design limitations.  However, it was not a particularly good forum for discussing detailed research work, and some-well developed, well-presented papers were lost in this event.<P>

Incorporation of Metal Matrix Composites - 5 (MMC-5) into the program of ECCM - 7 was an experiment and is not likely to be repeated.  While the two sciences are linked by a number of common technical goals (e.g., the need for reliable non-destructive evaluation methods and the resolution of interface issues), the two technologies are separated by years of development and market presence.  Hence, the two conferences have different objectives, and the participants have different information needs.  Wisely, MMC-6 will be held independently on the former bi-annual schedule in November or December 1997.<P>

The format of the meeting brought all participants together for a day-long plenary session.  On the second and third days, five sessions were run concurrently; one of these was MMC - 5.  I focused on those papers presented in the MMC - 5 sub-sessions: Applications, Manufacturing Technology, Ceramic Composites and Intermetallics, Microstructure and Characterization, and Properties and Testing.  Those papers that I found particularly interesting are discussed briefly below.<P>

<B>Plenary Session</B><BR>
Focused on innovative applications of composites technology and challenges which face mature technologies, this plenary session had a unique character.  The opening discussions and lectures established an optimistic mood as speakers hold of successful implementation of composites in civil engineering, transportation, aerospace, marine and biomedical applications.  "The Innovation Process" presented by Chris Voss of the London Business School, clearly directed toward the entrepreneur, was a positive -- if unusual -- item on the agenda of a technical conference.<P>

One recurrent theme expressed throughout this first session was that while good science and engineering had brought composites to the point that they accepted by designers and society, future efforts must be directed toward cost reduction if they are to be fully exploited.  Dr. Julia King's (Head of Materials for Rolls-Royce) mantra of "Cost, cost, cost," was echoed throughout the session.<P>

Dr. D. Giachardi, Director, Courtaulds Plc., represented the European Union and presented the first formal lecture of the conference.  The European Union places high value on science that directly benefits society and the environment as well as industry, and his discussion emphasized these points.  He stressed two goals of composites research: (1) reducing total lifecycle costs, including recycling; and (2) developing reliable, high-production, low-cost fabrication technologies.<P>

Dr. W. Bonfield, Director of the Interdisciplinary Research Centre (IRC) in Biomedical Materials presented work on artificial bone and joint replacements.  Work at the IRC has produced a synthetic bone that, like natural bone, is a polymer-matrix-composite reinforced with hydroxyapatite.  Mechanical properties of this composite more closely match those of human bone than the monolithic titanium alloys widely used in biomedical applications.  The compatibility of stiffnesses and strengths means that hydroxyapatite-reinforced composite bone replacements are much less likely to fail by aseptic loosening, the current cause of 90% of all skeletal implant failures.<P>

Dr. J. King of the Rolls-Royce Gas Turbine Materials Centre gave a visually beautiful talk on current aeroengine applications of polymer-, metal- and ceramic-matrix-composites.  While showing numerous slides and describing the choices of composites for each application, she emphasized the driving forces that will bring composites to the industry as major players.  Lower life cycle costs, reduced maintenance costs, cleaner air, quieter engines, and reduced fuel consumption can all be realized now by the implementation of existing composites technologies.  However, if these materials are ever to be fully exploited by the aerospace industry, initial costs must be brought down.  The researchers' goals: reducing unit costs of composite materials and reducing the costs of manufacture.<P>

Jean-Michel Guillemot showed-off the nose of the Eurostar as an example of GEC Alsthom's extensive use of polymer-matrix-composites.  Mechanical components and electrical equipment were presented as examples of successful applications in rail transportation.  The next challenge is improving reliability.  Dr. Guillemot then briefly described a current BRITE-EURAM project to develop self-monitoring composites: Structurally Integrated Systems for the evaluation of Composites (SISCO).  The aim of SISCO is a composite with embedded passive optic sensors that can be monitored via active internal or external piezoelectric actuators.<P>

<B>Applications</B><BR> 
Dr. A.M. Walker of A.E. Goetz, UK, presented "Automotive Applications of MMCs -- Piston Technology," outlining some of the recent advances in squeeze casting.  Typically, aluminum alloys with Si, Cu and/or Ni additions are reinforced with between 0.05 and 0.3 volume fractions of Al2O3, yielding squeeze cast materials that have the temperature capabilities of conventional wrought alloys such as RR58.  This alternative fabrication route offers considerable cost savings over forging and machining operations and will be applied to the manufacture of brake components and engine blocks, in addition to the pistons now being made.  Research and development activity is still required to overcome the challenges of fiber wetting and of matrix nucleation onto reinforcement particles.<P>

A.D. Tarrant of Aerospace Metal Composites Ltd. intelligently discussed "Aerospace Applications of MMCs," illustrating where MMCs are currently implemented and sharing development strategies.  Anisotropy, superior damage tolerance and good fatigue performance of SiC reinforced aluminum alloy composites make them viable replacements for graphite reinforced epoxy composites where high stiffness and low density are key properties: upper wing skins, equipment racks, fuselage-to-wingbox connections, etc.  Future research efforts will be directed toward higher temperature capability (to 350 degrees C), incorporation of Al-Li matrices to improve corrosion resistance and reduce the need for complicated heat treatment, and fabrication technologies for graded structures.<P>

R. Young, of AEA Technology, spoke on the application of Al alloys with high volumes (up to 70%) of SiC or B4C for electronic applications.  The composites are produced by first preparing a SiC slurry that is cast into a preform of approximate density of 70% SiC particles; then the preform is infiltrated with molten Al at low pressures.  Typical property values are 5 - 6 ppm/K for coefficient of thermal expansion; approx. 230 W/m K for thermal conductivity; approx. 3 g/cc for density; and more than 20 MPa sq.rt. meter for fracture toughness.  With these properties and costs nearing one dollar per square inch, these composites may be an attractive alternative to beryllium alloys.<P>

<B>Manufacturing Technology</B><BR> 
Dr. R. Leucht of DRL, Institute for Materials Research, Germany described an interesting development at DRL: a new, lab-scale apparatus for continuously coating SiC-SCS-6 fibers via magnetron sputtering, bundling and canning them in preparation for hot isostatic pressing (HIPing).  In this process, two magnetron sputters are activated as fibers are wound onto a rotating cylindrical holding spool which actually comprises 3 of the 4 sides of the HIP can (inner diameter, top and bottom).  The process generates uniformly packed fibers with homogeneous matrix layers.  The fourth side (outer diameter) of the HIP can is then welded in place, and the assembly is HIP'd.  Because coating, winding and canning of the fiber assembly is carried out inside the apparatus under vacuum, environmental contamination is avoided.  Cross plies with different fiber orientation angles can now be produced, and DRL has demonstrated the feasibility of fabricating a fiber-reinforced titanium ring by this method.  Work is underway to magnetron sputter alloy matrices while maintaining composition control.<P>

"Spray/Wind Manufacturing of Hoop Reinforced Ti-MMC Rings" was presented by Oxford doctoral candidate Z. Fan.  This method may develop into a relatively cost-effective, high-production-rate means of producing cylindrical fiber-reinforced composites.  Best results were achieved with a semi-continuous process.  In this process, CP titanium powders are vacuum plasma sprayed (VPS) onto a heated, rotating mild steel drum to form a matrix layer.  Then a single SiC-SCS-6 fiber layer is wound onto the drum by a computerized unit that controls speed and spacing.  Winding speed is reduced, and matrix VPS and fiber winding are carried out simultaneously.  The operation continues as the layers build into a green composite ring which is then HIPed.  Work continues to identify optimal winding speeds and hot pressing conditions in order to achieve high densities with minimal fiber-matrix interaction.<P>

<B>Ceramic Matrix Composites and Intermetallics</B> <BR>
The keynote lecture was given by Prof. Anthony Kelly of the University of Cambridge and President of the Institute of Materials.  In spite of the many accolades, Prof. Kelly remains very practical and approachable.  His talk was entertaining and bright, focusing on issues that must be considered when identifying ceramics to incorporate into composites.  Written at a level suitable for undergraduates, the printed form of the talk would make a good, brief introduction for students.<P>

Dr. C.P. Beesley, representing Rolls-Royce, discussed "Opportunities and Challenges for CMCs in Gas Turbines."  CMCs promise enhanced performance, elevated operating temperatures and weight savings that are attractive to aeroengine designers.  Yet, behavior is difficult to predict as current fabrication methods offer many opportunities for inconsistencies.  Still, contemporary CMCs have their place in aircraft engines: primarily in static components where temperatures are severe and compressive stresses are active.  Rolls-Royce will soon fly simple components, and materials research continues there in an effort to expand capabilities.<P>

Prof. N. Claussen of Technische Universitat Hamburg-Harburg described the development of fully dense Alumina-Aluminide Alloys (3A) by a powder metallurgy route.  Aluminum, alumina and an oxide of an aluminide former (e.g., TiO2 or Fe2O3) are attrition milled, pressed and heated.  Solid state reactions are seen by XRD to initiate at temperatures below the melting point of Al (around 600 degrees C); at approximately 700 degrees C an exothermic reaction is triggered, yielding an alumina- aluminide alloy compact with sufficient strength to be machined.  The compact is then sintered  Composites of TiAl reinforced with up to 50 volume % Al2O3 have been produced; microstructural features are homogeneous and on the order of 3 to 30 microns.  No mechanical property data was presented.<P>

<B>Properties and Testing</B><BR>
Prof. H.J. Dudek of DRL, Institute for Materials Research, Germany, presented three talks on behalf of his colleagues and himself;  "Fibre Protection for TMC High Temperature Application" is briefly summarized here.  Beautiful TEM micrographs were used to illustrate the effectiveness of various barrier layers proposed to prevent fiber-matrix interactions that occur at temperatures greater than 600 degrees C and to prevent the development of thermal stresses at the fiber-matrix interface.  Working with SiC-SCS-6 fibers in an IMI834 matrix they made some interesting observations.
When C-coated SiC fibers in an IMI834 matrix are annealed at 800 degrees C, two boundary layers form: TiC adjacent to the SiC fiber and a titanium-zirconium-silicide in contact with the matrix.  Together the two layers form an effective barrier to Ti and C diffusion and do not seem to diminish mechanical properties.  The silicide is compositionally similar to S2 particles in the matrix alloy and is very stable.  With longer exposures at 800 degrees C the silicide layer thickens and becomes discontinuous, and TiC permeates the silicide layer.  This activity coincides with depletion of Si, Zr, and Sn in the matrix next to the interface.  Researchers at DRL now plan to deliberately add an interfacial layer of the (Ti, Zr)-silicide in an effort to minimize the effect on the matrix composition while still benefiting from the effective diffusion barrier.<P>

<H3>Notes from the Conference on Processing and Design Issues in High Temperature Materials<BR>
Davos, Switzerland; 19 - 24  May 1996</H3>

<B>Summary</B><BR>
Organized by the Engineering Foundation, the conference dealt with a diverse range of material systems with a primary goal of encouraging wide interdisciplinary interaction.  This aim was achieved.  While there were many opportunities for researchers to compare observations and approaches, few "designers" were present so that the meeting was biased toward materials development and evaluation.  A substantial number of the participants were North American, and significant contribution came from the US materials community with reports covering atomic studies to intermetallics, investment-cast superalloys and steels for steam turbines.  Other countries represented were Japan, UK, Germany and Switzerland.<P>

The majority of talks focused on the difficulties of translating good research to commercial products.  Professor Yamaguchi provided a notable exception to this trend -- and indeed a noteworthy example of commercial application of advanced materials achieved in Japan -- in his description of Nissan's establishment of a mass production plant for TiAl intermetallic exhaust valves.  The TiAl valves yield a 40% reduction in weight and an 8% increase in power.  Literature by Nissan (in the form of brochures) was available in which the virtues of the titanium intermetallics and the production plans were outlined.<P>

Papers were partitioned into nine sessions addressing four major themes: Interfaces, Intermetallics and Composites, Ceramics, and Advanced Metallics.  A few of the more interesting reports from each of these major areas and the keynote lecture are summarized below, and additional information is available upon your request.  (All alloy compositions are given in atomic percent.)<P>

 <B>Keynote Lecture</B><BR>
Prof. A. Evans (Harvard) presented the keynote address, a comparison of design and life prediction criteria for two examples of advanced materials which have received considerable attention: ceramic matrix composites (CMCs) and titanium matrix composites (TMCs).  He showed that in many cases these advanced materials now meet performance requirements but are hindered in their application by relatively high unit costs.  His talk stressed the need for materials scientists to interact with designers and displayed a mature skepticism of the likelihood of many of the "new" materials under consideration finding applications.<P>

<B>Interfaces</B><BR> 
This part of the conference dealt with the role of interfaces across a wide spectrum of materials and ranged from atomic modeling studies on the MoSi2/Mo and MgO/Ag interfaces by John Smith of GM and a paper by M.H. Yoo and C.L. Fu (ORNL) on the role of interfaces in deformation and fracture of intermetallics, to the mechanical behavior of austenitic/ferritic interfaces by S. Suresh of MIT.  The basic science of metal interfaces and polycrystalline plasticity were reviewed by M. S. Daw (Clemson) and H. Mecking (Technical University of Hamburg, Germany).<P>

M. Yoo and CL Fu's work on "Interfaces, Deformation and Fracture" focused on the influences of interfaces on mechanical behavior in two-phase intermetallic systems using the alpha-2/gamma and gamma/gamma interlamellar interfaces in binary titanium aluminides as an example.  Yamaguchi's work on psuedosynthetically twinned (PST) crystals had pointed out the apparent anomaly that the alpha-2/gamma lamellar structure in the soft orientation is actually weaker than single phase microstructures of the weaker constituent, gamma.  Yoo and Fu reconciled this by illustrating that dislocation energy is reduced by a factor of two when the dislocation is allowed to glide at the pseudo-twin interface.  The lowest interfacial fracture energy calculated was along the alpha-2/gamma interface.  They further proposed that strain rate sensitivity observed in these materials is the result of hydrogen segregation to the interfaces and a consequent reduction in interfacial energy.<P>

S. Suresh presented one of better papers of the conference, titled "Geometrical Design of Layered and Graded Materials for Optimum Thermomechanical Performance."  He has developed a model to describe and quantify the evolution of strains and curvatures induced in dissimilar metallic layers as temperature is applied.  The model is supported by results of clever experiments designed to evaluate the effects of soft interlayers.  By explosively bonding austenitic and ferritic stainless steels (with and without BN interlayers), he was able to produce samples with controlled layer thicknesses that would induce compressive stresses at key locations in the component, i.e., at notch sites.  Good correlation between predictions and experiments conducted on layered 3-dimensionally printed zirconia-toughened-alumina components illustrated that the model is valid for multi-layered structures of widely different size scales.  By understanding the curvature, where and when plastic deformation initiates can be predicted; then, predictions of crack arrest behavior can be made and applied to real systems to retard fatigue crack propagation.  For instance, insertion of a thin (50 microns) layer of Ni-5Al between a ferritic steel and its Cr2O3 protective coating (typically 400 microns-thick) significantly increases fatigue life as cracks will repeatedly stop in the softest layer.  Providing that the microstructures are stable with stress and temperature, Prof. Suresh proposes that grading can accommodate, shift and control stresses, can control plasticity in metallic subcomponents, and may be a means of changing thermomechanical fatigue behavior.<P>

<B>Intermetallics and Composites</B><BR> 
TiAl-based alloys were discussed by a number of workers.  In joint presentations, R. Wagner (GKSS, Germany) and M. Nazmy (ABB, Switzerland) discussed two alloy systems: Ti-47Al-4(Nb, Cr, Si, B) "TAB" alloy and ABB's alloy Ti-46-2.1W-0.5Si.  The ABB alloy was said to have performed well in Daimler-Benz tests for valves, but costs still present a problem.  It was reported that MTU was testing cast TAB blades in a RB199 rotor designed to operate at 700 degrees C and 16,000 rpm, and that Plansee had made structural panels from TAB materials.  Wagner reported that carbon additions to TiAl alloys increased strength and creep resistance without adverse effects on ductility.  This effect is explained by Ti3AlC precipitation which is believed to interact with deformation twins in gamma.<P>

M. Yamaguchi reviewed the Japanese efforts in TiAl which is sponsored by AIST-MITI and spans years 1989-1996.  Six corporations, 3 Research Institutes and 2 Universities participated.  A separate program by MESC involved 15 Universities for a total of 67 (!!) research teams.  Interim national goals were 280MPa strength at 1000 degrees C and 2% strain at RT.  These goals appear to have been met by alloy of Ti-47Al-2.3Nb-1.0Ta.  Present goals call for 380 MPa at 1000 degrees C and 3% strain at RT.  Industrial successes were highlighted, including Nissan's plans for a production plant to provide TiAl exhaust valve for use in its sedan automobiles and Nippon Steel's Al2O3 -reinforced alpha-two + gamma alloys.  The Nissan production process appears to be based on elemental powders and be based on a binary Ti-45Al alloy.  Rheocasting of Ti-44Al-10% ZrC composites and directional solidification of lamellar Ti-Al ingots was also reported.  Other goals of the national Japanese effort are centered around isothermal rolling and superplastic forming, and it was reported that progress has been made in all areas although no specific results were given.  A special August 1996 edition of the journal Intermetallics will include extensive papers reporting AIST-MITI progress.<P>

M. Lorretto (Birmingham University, UK) presented data on the microstructural evolution in Ti-47Al-2Mn-2Cr alloys, and L. Christodoulou (Imperial College, UK) discussed the role of the morphology of the alpha/gamma phases on the properties of Ti-(45-48)%Al alloys.  It was shown that an acceptable combination of fracture toughness and ductility can be achieved when the equiaxed proportion of the microstructure is in the range of 30-60%.<P>

A. W. Thompson (Lawrence Berkley Laboratory) reported on hydrogen effects in Ti3Al and TiAl alloys.  In alpha-2 H is absorbed at temperatures of 500-650 degrees C at low pressures and stabilizes the "O" phase; strength is marginally improved while ductility and fracture toughness gradually decrease.  In gamma little H absorption occurs at 1 atm, but large uptake is induced at high pressures and temperatures (800-900 degrees C); two hydrides are formed and considerable strengthening is noted.<P>

In-situ composites through reaction processing were discussed by S. Fishman (ONR HQ).  Benefits of in-situ processing include thermodynamically stable composites that have better performance because of their stability and that are often less expensive to produce than composites generated in other ways.  In-situ processing often relies on inexpensive starting materials and simple techniques.  The science is in kinetic biasing, altering the sequences of phases in a transformation pathway and inducing selective phase formation.  For example, in the production of a Ni-Al2O3 composite, the addition of excess oxygen to the Ni matrix prior to reacting forces the formation of a necessarily stable, spinel interface layer.  MoSi2-SiC composites formed by solid state reaction of MoC and Si forces the growth of platelets and equiaxed particles as a function of dissimilar diffusion rates.<P>

D. Miracle (Wright Labs) introduced his cruciform sample geometry for evaluating interfacial failures and the stresses acting on fibers in TMCs.  With data generated from this series of tests, he proposes that one of three different failure mechanisms can be invoked in response to tensile loading, depending on the strength of the fiber-matrix interface.  When the interface is weak, failure occurs by tangential shear at the interface first.  When the interface has intermediate strength, the interface fails in tension after a crack is initiated by tangential shear; and when the interface is characterized as strong, radial cracking in the fiber generates slip into the matrix.<P>

Efforts on directionally solidified silicides and Cr2Nb-Nb aligned eutectics were presented by B.P. Bewlay (GE Center for Research and Development).  Using a CZ process aligned silicide/Laves phase composites were fabricated with up to 60% volume of Laves phase.  Hf and Ti additions were found to improve toughness and oxidation resistance.<P>

Niobium aluminides were discussed by H. Fraser (University of Ohio).  His work on Nb-15Al-10Ti, Nb-15Al-25Ti and Nb-15Al-40Ti  compositions demonstrates optimum strength and ductility (30% elongation at room temperature) in the alloy with 40% Ti.  The lack of ductility observed in alloys with lower Ti content is attributed to the formation of stress-induced martensite which does not form in the 40% Ti alloy.  Chromium additions improve oxidation behavior.  Electron microscopy work continues in order to understand the ordering scheme and deformation mechanisms in these aluminides containing B2, orthorhombic and A15 phases.<P>

NiAl was discussed by M. Kaufmann (University of Florida), and C.T. Liu of Oak Ridge National Laboratory reviewed progress in Ni3Al.  Fatigue and fracture behavior of intermetallics was reviewed by N. Stoloff (Rensealler Polytechnic Institute), and K.T. Rao (UC Berkeley) reviewed toughening mechanisms in composite systems.  Life prediction of TMC in complex flight profiles was discussed by Ted Nicholas (Wright Labs).<P>

<B>Ceramics</B><BR>
High frequency fatigue behavior in the Nicalon/CAS, Nicalon/Si-C-O-N and Nicalon SiC systems was compared and contrasted in a paper by N. Chawla (University of Michigan) with specific emphasis on differing interface characteristics.  Laminar ceramics with and without fiber layers were discussed by F. Lange (UC Santa Barbara) who pointed out the importance of the interface characteristics, i.e., whether strongly or weakly bonded.  Applications for SiC/SiC as first wall materials for fusion reactors were discussed by R. Jones (Battelle NW).<P>

S. M. Wiederhorn of NIST reviewed the creep behavior of Si3N processed by liquid phase sintering.  Work on nano crystalline ceramics at Hughes Phillips Labs was reported by K. Upadhya.  E. J. Brooks (University of Hull, UK) reported on a technique which employs a soft indentor and is claimed to estimate the critical resolved shear stress in polycrystalline diamond.<P>

A. Eckel (NASA Lewis) discussed damage by oxygen and hydrogen on Si-based CMCs, and W. Hillig of RPI gave an analysis of the role of high concentration of H2O vapor on the oxidation of Si-based ceramics.  Other work also at RPI on the effects of processing and environment on the properties of SiC/SiC composites was presented by P. Lipetzky.  F. Petit (University of Pittsburgh) gave an overview of environmental effects observed in ceramic and intermetallic systems, including the more subtle effects can be controlled by modification of processing techniques.<P>

R. Cocheran of Westinghouse, Bettis Atomic Power Laboratory reported on efforts to develop a pack cementation process for imparting direct conversion coatings onto niobium- and titanium-based aluminides.<P>

S.L. Sass (Cornell) presented work on the Ni-Al-O system which under partial reduction conditions can produce Ni/Al2O3 composites.  Ni can be formed as needles or equiaxed particles depending on the temperature of reaction (1200 and 1350 respectively).  Clean interfaces are consistently formed.  However shrinkage associated with the reaction causes cracking. Addition of 10% ZrO2 addition was found to reduce the tendency for cracking but lead to porosity in the alumina, while TiO2 doping speeds the conversion reaction but reduces fracture toughness by weakening the interfaces.  Work continues to identify a means of tempering the ceramic.<P>

<B>Superalloys and Steels</B> <BR>
Superalloys were discussed from a historical perspective by C. Lund of Lockheed-Martin.  His lecture entitled "Superalloys: the Aging Alloys Have Matured," described how motivation and approaches changed during the forty-year effort to produce the materials the aerospace relies on so heavily now.  Over the years these changes in perception caused leaps in performance every fifteen years or so, but increases in performance have been only incremental recently despite maintained levels of research.  For the next leap in capabilities engineers will need to look to other alloys.<P>

New single crystal alloys without rhenium were described by Cannon-Muskegon scientist G. Erickson.  Notable is the fact that these alloys (one with a higher Cr content of 12.5 - 14.5 for use in sulfur-containing environments) were designed with the industrial turbines in mind, and are approximately half the cost of Re-containing alloys such as CMSX-4.<P>

Steels for steam turbines were discussed by R. B. Scarlin (ABB, Baden) in the context of a European COST program to develop and evaluate improved, weldable, creep resistant 9-12% Cr steels.  Target goals are operation at 600 degrees C and 100 MPa for a lifetime of 100,000 hours.  A 40 ton forged rotor has been made from a 10%Cr, Mo, W, V, Nb, N steel.  Material requirements for advanced power generation turbines were discussed by T.B. Gibbons (ABB-CE, USA).<P>

<H3>Coastal Oceanography Report No. 1 <BR>
From ONR Europe<P>

Notes on visit to the Proudman Oceanographic Laboratory Bidston Observatory, Birkenhead</H3>


<B>1.	The Proudman Oceanographic Laboratory</B><P>

	The Proudman Oceanographic Laboratory (POL) is one of the five centers of 
ocean/coastal research in the UK.  The other four are the Department of 
Oceanography, Southampton University, University College of North Wales 
(Bangor), the Defense Research Agency (DRA), and the Plymouth Marine 
Laboratory.  Southampton is the largest program (400), POL next (180), DRA 
(80), with Plymouth and Bangor smaller yet.  There are, of course, several 
other university programs in the UK that carry out ocean and coastal related 
research.  Cambridge and Hull, for example, have coastal studies programs, 
and Imperial College in London has a marine program.  <P>

	POL, located about 10 minutes from Liverpool, has been the subject of two 
excellent ONREUR overview articles prepared by John Dugan in 1993 (ESNIB 
9306) and John Dugan and Tom Kinder that same year (ESNIB 93-02).  Dugan and 
Kinders summary of The Proudman laboratory is still applicable:  this is a 
center of excellence in the marine sciences, especially related to the 
coastal sector.  They specialized in storm surge research (modeling and 
prediction), large- and small-scale coastal processes, sediment transport in 
estuaries, the impacts of climate change on coastal and estuarine 
environments, and modeling all of the above.  In conjunction with these 
programs they have an instrument development staff and facility.  <P>

	The research support for POL is about 50 percent directly from NERC and 50 
percent from competitive contracts.  There is a distinct trend within the UK 
to privatize the government laboratories and The Proudman is included.  The 
staff believe that the complete transition to totally competitive contract 
funding for the support of their programs will take place over the next five 
or so years, amounting to a systematic reduction of the NERC support each 
year (i.e. 50%, 40%, 30%, etc.).  It should be pointed out that the current 
50% NERC support is line-itemized in the NERC budget so The Proudman does not 
have to compete for these funds.  In the future they will.  The 
competitors will include other government labs, universities, and private 
industry.  It goes without saying that the latter two groups are quite 
pleased with this trend, and that the labs will probably devote more time to 
short-term projects with application as opposed to long-term basic research.  
The other implication is that this trend will probably move the UK ocean 
researchers further away from systematic data collection programs.<P>

<B>2.	The Agenda for our Meeting</B><P>

People I talked with:  Roger Flather, David Prandle, Peter Hardcastle, and 
Peter Thorne<P>

	We met as a group and had what might be termed a roundtable exchange.  These 
were the topics:<P>

<OL>
<LI>Wave interactions, wave modeling, and storm surge.
<LI>Coastal sediment transport processes, coastal evolution, coastal 
engineering, monitoring coastal processes.
<LI>Water quality and particulate matter in the waters of the North Sea and 
English Channel.
<LI>Operational models for storm surge prediction and coastal flooding (in collaboration with the UK met office).
<LI>The UK national network of tide and sea level observations.
<LI>Modeling coastal systems and prediction of intermediate-scale coastal processes and morphology.
<LI>Coastal defense research in the UK.
<LI>ONREUR's mission in Europe and the new NICOP program.
</OL>

<B>3.	Roger Flather</B><P>

	Roger Flather heads the team of researchers that I talked with, and he is 
clearly one of POL's top scientists.  His field is waves and modeling, 
currently dealing with the impacts of storm surge and currents on wave 
properties.  He has also been a lead investigator for the past several years 
on a project to develop an operational three dimensional shallow-water tide 
and storm surge forecast model for the NW European shelf area.  The spectral 
model, which has a 12 km horizontal resolution, is being developed to run 
operationally at the UK Meteorological Office for predictions of tides, 
surges, currents, and temperature conditions.  Initial comparisons between 
model and observed surges, tidal currents, and temperatures show good 
correspondence.  POL has excellent documentation on this program.<P>

	Flather has also used this model to investigate trends in storm surges over 
a 40-year period using data from the Norwegian Meteorological Office.  Time 
series analyses of the Norwegian dataset show no significant trends or 
periodicities over the 40 year record, which corresponds with the work I have 
done on middle latitude storms impacting the Atlantic coast of the US.  One 
would expect a detectable signal in the storm data if the climate 
(temperature) was changing significantly.  This raises questions regarding 
the recent excitement in the UK regarding climate change.  If Flather 
cannot detect any significant difference in the frequency, magnitude, or 
tracking of the winter storms that move across the North Sea, its highly 
unlikely that any other weather data will show conflicting trends.  I am 
especially interested in just how these storm data were collected.  
Apparently, a final report summarizing the storm data will be available 6 
months.  I have a follow-up trace on the source of the report and the author.<P>

	Flather has also been active in the development of a 'fully coupled spectral 
wave plus 2D tide-surge model' in order to investigate interactions in 
shallow-water between waves, currents, and water levels.  His work shows that 
the influence of wave-current interactions on both waves and surges is 
substantial and in places highly focused (and predictable).  ONR has a place 
in this project in that the design and results are relevant to the 
international Waves in Shallow Environments (WISE) group's efforts to develop 
a community model for coastal wave propagation and transformation.<P>

<B>4.	David Prandle</B><P>

	David Prandle is one of the top young ocean scientists in the UK.  At POL he 
has been designated a 'special merit scientist' which is a distinct honor and 
gives him considerable flexibility to move from project to project 
independent of the institutional or project structures.  <P>

	Prandle is a coastal oceanographer interested in water quality modeling, 
sediment transport processes, modeling, and verification of models with 
empirical data.  His recent work has focused in two areas:  the North Sea and 
Holderness on the east coast of England.  <P>

	In the North Sea project, Prandle is using principal component (PCA) and 
regression analysis to investigate the spatial and temporal patterns or mode 
of variation (sources and sinks) of suspended particulate matter.  This 
program has been underway for several years and has thus been well documented 
by POL.  Although this is an interesting application of PCA and might 
certainly be worth following up, I found his second project, 'Coastal Area 
Modeling for Engineering in the Long Term' (CAMELOT), closer to my area of 
expertise.<P>

	CAMELOT is also called 'The Holderness Project' at POL.  This field 
experiment has been described as a 'mini-Duck' in that the goal was to 
monitor the processes of sediment transport along the Holderness coastline, 
one of the most rapidly eroding coasts in the UK and the largest source of 
sediment to the North Sea.  The specific goal was to record processes (waves, 
tides, currents, etc.) and beach responses continuously over a winter in 
hopes of capturing in their data one or two significant storms.  The database 
is to be used for verification of their numerical models, not unlike the 
series of 'Duck' projects carried out in North Carolina.  The period of data 
collection extended from October, 1994, to March, 1995, with a follow-up 
between October, 1995, and January, 1996.<P>

	The 'core program' of measurements was carried out by POL and the Hydraulics 
Research laboratory.  This included installation of two lines of three of 
POL's ocean monitoring platforms (PMP's) cross-shore that measured vertical 
profiles of currents and suspended sediment using acoustic Doppler current 
profilers developed by POL together with near-bed turbulence and currents 
with electromagnetic current meters, suspended sediment with optical 
transmissometers, and tide, surge, and surface waves.  In addition to the 
PMP, several other instruments were used at the site, including X-ban radar 
for directional wave spectra, directional wave and meteorological buoys, a 
cross-shore array of bottom mounted pressure sensors, and an H.F. Radar 
back-scattered spectra.  The one component of the program that did not work 
out was the effort to record the fine-scale bathymetery.  At the larger or 
intermediate-scale, POL tested the use of remote sensing and conventional 
surveying to record the beach and cliff retreat processes at the site.  
Finally, the RRS Challenger operated in the area during the experiment 
collecting CTD profiles and before-and-after conditions at the site.  
Although the project was designed to focus on the physical attributes of the 
coast, an add-on experiment was conducted dealing with simulating mixing of 
both biological and chemical tracers in the area.<P>

	In addition to an excellent set of data from a high energy coastal site, 
this experiment confirmed the sturdiness of the PMP's that POL uses in their 
field work.  Their data return for the project was 100% and soon after 
installation of the platforms the site was subject to 80 kt winds and high 
seas.<P>

	One of the problems with a field experiment of this type is that few 
governments can support a continuous monitoring program like that underway at 
the FRF at Duck, NC.  In the CAMELOT project, one of the main goal was to 
record the impact of powerful storms but during a defined period due to 
limitations in the budget.  Unfortunately, with the exception of a few 
moderate storms, nature did not fully cooperate during CAMELOT, but plans are 
afoot to develop a European-wide initiative so that a more comprehensive 
coastal monitoring project can be considered.  This be may the seed for a 
European Sandyduck at some point in the next century.<P>

	The CAMELOT data were collected primarily for calibration of models being 
developed in the UK.  The results are only beginning to appear.  For example, 
the wave data alone provide a large synoptic dataset for the study of wave 
transformation in shallow-water, a subject that the POL scientists are 
focusing on.  However, in the final analysis the UK invested in this project 
for the specific purpose of learning about the processes of coastal erosion, 
and hopefully how to address the issue of rapid beach retreat.  This will be 
the primary product of this project: a model that simulates coastal erosion 
under different environmental states.<P>

<B>5.	Peter Thorne and Peter Hardcastle</B><P>

	Peter Thorne is interested in suspended sediment transport processes in 
shallow-water.  His recent research has focused on the development and 
application of acoustics for measurements in relatively high energy 
environments.  In collaboration with Peter Hardcastle, Thorne has developed 
single frequency (3 MHz) and triple frequency (1, 2.5, and 3 MHz) acoustic 
backscatter device that have been successfully deployed in two estuarine 
sites.  The instruments are mounted on a platform called 'Sediment Transport 
and Boundary Layer Equipment' (STABLE) that has been under development for 
several years and is well documented in several POL documents.  In short, 
this is a tripod-like platform that has attached to it a wide variety of 
instruments that can be positioned to look up, down, to the side, and at 
various locations vertically.  The results Thorne is getting are 
encouraging.  Comparing his acoustical data with direct measurements (pumped 
samples) of suspended sediment, the result are close to unity.<P>

	Thorne has not attempted to use his platform in the surfzone, although this 
is something they would very much like to try.  When I described the range of 
complementary data that would be collected at the Sandyduck97 field program, 
there was interest in the possibility of installing some of his instruments 
at the site.  However, we were both aware that Sandyduck is only 10 months 
from the start-up and that it might be too late to consider complicated add-
on experiments at this late date.<P>

<B>6.	R. Dolan</B><P>

	I provided an overview of the functions of ONREUR, and described the new ONR 
Naval International Cooperative Opportunities Program (NICOP) goals, and our 
possible interest in a coastal oceanography initiative.  In the discussions 
it was evident that the POL staff are not just interested in increased 
collaboration with ONR and US coastal programs, but enthusiastic.  I believe 
this can be traced, to a degree, to changes that are taking place in 
government support for research in the UK specifically, and to Europe in 
general.  The trend is for less support and the question of 'value for money 
invested' that seems to be asked at every front.  Application and competition 
are the key words in seeking support for research.  This leads to concern in 
every institution that support for basic research in the UK for the ocean 
sciences will be reduced and that perhaps a tighter connection with a 
large-scale US program would provide at least some continuity with longer-
termed research efforts.  <P>

	In addition, I did not detect a 'hunger' for the ONR NICOP funding.  It 
appears that POL is adequately supported.  Their best people are fully funded 
and can just about choose what they want to work on.  I believe their 
interest in increased international collaboration can also be traced to 
recent positive experiences with European cooperative programs, such as 
MAST.  To close, it is clear that they are convinced that collaboration with 
the US will result in a 'multiplier' effect in their programs.<P>

	The programs that the POL people would like to pursue with regard to 
increased collaboration, with or without NICOP, are:<P>

<OL>
<LI>Technology -- reciprocal deployments of new instruments.
<LI>Modeling -- inter-comparison of model applications (e.g. WAM-WISE)
<LI>Thematic -- suspended sediment, coastal processes, wave dynamics.
<LI>Organization -- modus operandii such as Community Projects in the UK MAST 
programs in the EEC (experience in initiation).
</OL>
	For the longer term, issues they would be interested in considering for 
parallel research programs include:<P>

<OL>
<LI>The impact of climate change (sea level rise, storm frequency, etc.) on coastal estuarine bathymetery and morphodynamics.
<LI>Development and assessment of technology for monitoring coastal systems.
<LI>Development and assessment of generic models for simulating the coastal zone.
</OL>

	Finally, the POL staff believe a positive start would be reciprocal  lecture 
tours by 3 or 4 people from each side of the Atlantic, which would include 
visiting 4 or 5 laboratories for a week each, and a series of workshops at 
the labs during these visit focusing on research topics of interest to both 
groups.  We did not discuss just how this would be funded, although as a 
college professor it sounds like a great idea.<P>

<H3>Coastal Oceanography Report No. 2<BR>
Office of Naval Research Europe<P>

30 September 1996<P>

Diamonds, Coastal Processes, Signal Processing, and Pattern Analysis of the Sea Bed<P>

Heriot-Watt University<BR>
Edinburgh, Scotland<P>

Robert Dolan and Kenneth Lobb</H3>

<I>Key words: Sea bed texture; sidescan sonar; fractal analysis; signal processing.</I><P>

<B>1.	Introduction.</B><P>

	Heriot Watt University is a moderate-sized institution by US standards, but 
has an excellent reputation throughout the UK as a research-based institution 
focused on technological subjects.  Their strongest programs are in 
engineering and various aspects of computer science. <P>

	The program we wanted to learn more about is in the Department of Computing 
and Electrical Engineering where Professor Laurie Linnett's has a research 
team working in computer vision and signal processing.  We had heard about 
their program in image texture analysis and synthesis using fractal and 
statistical processing techniques work while visiting the Defense Research 
Agency (DRA).  We wanted to explore whether there might be opportunities for 
collaboration applications of their analyses in the inshore and shelf-edge 
research.<P>

<B>2.	The Heriot-Watt Research Program.</B><P>

	The goal of the research underway at Heriot-Watt in signal processing is to 
develop methods for extracting subtle patterns from complex fields of data, 
and to reduce data storage problems by developing models that simplify the 
noise and focus on the signals.  Their models are not deterministic; the 
patterns are described in terms of probabilities.  <P>

	Linnetts group, consisting of about 15 graduate and post-graduate students 
and staff, does not include a single earth or ocean scientist; they are 
electrical engineers who have specialized in signal processing.  However, 
their research in recent years has focused on the texture of the sea bed, 
including several projects supported by DRA, so they have gained considerable 
knowledge about the ocean environment through their work.  In addition, they 
have carried out research under contract with DeBeers to investigate patterns 
of sedimentary on the shelf off the Orange River in SW Africa (more detail 
later), and another project supported by a major US airframe manufacturer to 
see if they could detect "difficult to see" airborne targets.<P>

<B>3.	Fractal Analyses of Images of the Sea Bed.</B><P>

	For the past several years, Laurie Linnett and his team has concentrated on 
development of fractal models for texture analysis and synthesis of sidescan 
sonar data of the sea.  Their work has been sponsored by the mine warfare 
group in DRA, who have interest in development of an automated classification 
of sidescan sonar images, particularly in areas where MCM route surveys are 
needed.  In the beginning, the Heriot-Watt group investigated several 
operated-assisted classification systems, concluding that the fractal model 
would be the most useful and flexible.<P>

	The texture analysis problem, given to them by DRA, involved the automatic 
detection of different textures or changes in texture within in a sonar image 
(like a mine).  Basically, they were trying to segment the image into 
separate areas of texture that the human eye sees as "different".  They used 
fractals to produce realistic images of the natural sonar images but they 
wanted to do more, and in particular they wanted to use a fractal model to 
analyze or interpret the images.  The first step was to develop a series of 
fractal dimensions as image descriptors.  Several techniques were tried but 
they have focused on a rather simple calculation that provides a measure of 
the fractal dimension that is adequate for use in texture segmentation.  As 
Linnett described it, "a feature image is produced for each of these 
directions, and this image is then used as an input to a statistical 
classifier".  The modeling is done in the frequency domain and the spectra is 
then transformed to obtain the textural image in the spatial domain.<P>

	The next step in this process is the classification or "pattern
recognition" of the areas in the original sonar image.  Linnett and his team 
have worked with "operator supervised classification" schemes as well as with 
automated "unsupervised classification" schemes.  However, since quite a bit 
is already known about different types of sea bed configurations, it would be 
foolish to ignore this information.  So they incorporate existing information 
in their analyses and it is only in the boundaries that a kind of 
"unsupervised classification" is incorporated.  The "unsupervised" technique 
is described in a paper that is available from Linnett, but in its simplest 
form the method involves looking for clusters in a transformed space.  The 
computer can then automatically identify these clusters and assign a texture 
or "unknown type" to each cloud.  The final step is the segmentation of the 
original image into separate areas of texture that are "different".  This is 
a rather easy step once the pattern recognition or classification has been 
completed.<P>

	The process of synthesizing sea bed textures is important for two reasons.  
First, the ability to mathematically model a sea bed texture can provide an 
important input for the analysis of a given sonar or perhaps the performance 
of a proposed sonar, and second, an important characteristic of texture is 
that different samples of the same texture appear visually identical despite 
the fact that their corresponding pixel values are different.  This 
characteristic can be exploited in the field of image coding, where it may be 
necessary to compress the data from an image for compact storage or, perhaps 
more importantly, for real-time transmission over a limited-bandwidth link.  
By using these fractal texture techniques, Linnett and his team has 
demonstrated a capability to provide a data compression ratio between an 
original sidescan sonar image and the coded images that was about 100 to 1.<P>

<B>4.	Diamonds and Fractals.</B><P>

	Can signal processing and fractal models of the sea bed help find subaqueous 
diamond placer deposits?  This is what the DeBeers Company wanted to know 
when they offered to support Linnetts team to answer this question.  DeBeers 
provided a set of sidescan sonar images of the sea bed off the coast of SW 
Africa near the Orange River delta.  The geologists who work with DeBeers 
have know for decades that the richest diamond deposits outside of the 
kimberlite pipes are the placer deposits associated with the rivers draining 
the pipe areas.  Mining progressed from the land to the sea bed, but with 
each step into deeper water the cost of dredging and processing increased 
exponentially.  In addition, in the deeper water the surface evidence of 
likely areas to mine became less evident.  Therefore, under the assumption 
that there may be a subtle "signal" within the vast field of sea bed data, 
Linnetts team analyzed the DeBeers sonar data and determined that there 
were, in fact, patterns that could be recognized and mapped.  Using their 
fractal modeling and pattern analysis methods, they located patterns that had 
a higher probability of revealing relic fluvial channels.  What this 
translates into is maps not actually showing diamond deposits, but rather 
places where there is a higher probability of success.  By classifying 95 
percent of the sea bed area as low probability, the return on the costs for 
processing millions of cubic meters of alluvial gravels, in water depths of 
up to 100 meters, can be maximized.  This is exactly what the DeBeers group 
wanted, and the Heriot-Watt team delivered.<P>

<B>5.	Simulation of Sidescan Sonar.</B><P>

	Dr. Judith Bell, one of Linnett's recent graduates, has developed a 
simulation model which permits the pictorial visualization of synthetic 
sidescan sonar images.  The main aspects of her model include: Seabed 
reverberation; acoustic propagation; transmission losses; transducer 
directivity; towfish motion and instabilities.  Any of these effects can be 
considered independently or in combination, to permit the simulation of 
complex scenes.  The simulated sidescan sonar are characterized by the input 
parameters describing the transducer environment.  The model therefore 
provides a valuable tool for the testing and visualization of complex 
processing algorithms and the isolation of the influence of individual 
parameters.  Bells work is also sponsored by DRA, and from what we can 
gather it will form the basis for much of their work on future sonar designs.<P>

	There are several aspects of Bell's work that are interesting, but
perhaps the most important is a further step in the development and use of 
fractal models to represent, both visually and statistically, the seabed 
topography.  This permits the calculation of the interaction of the acoustic 
pulse with complex, yet controlled surfaces.  The fractal models we discussed 
above are used to generate images to represent the seabed topography for 
input to the sonar simulation model.  This technique removes any assumptions 
regarding flat sea beds and the sea floor can be represented as a random 
rough surface.  Dr. Stuart Clarke, another one of Linnetts recent graduates, 
is taking Bell's results and models to investigate ways to analyze existing 
sonar data and, in particular, work on schemes to reprocess the sonar images 
for different depths, azimuths, roll angles, etc., to help provide a good 
registration with other/previous sonar images.<P>

<B>6.	Coastal Applications and Possible Collaboration.</B><P>

	During our initial visit to Heriot-Watt, and subsequent discussions with 
Linnett and has group, we have explored possible applications of their 
pattern analyses in coastal applications.  One could asked, if they can find 
placer deposits on the sea bed, it would seem that this could be extended 
into forms and motions in the inshore zone.  Since they are not geologists or 
oceanographers, and we are not signal processors, these follow-up discussions 
regarding possible collaboration were based to a considerable degree on logic 
and intuition.  However, we are convinced that this is an area worth 
investigating, especially within the groups working on intermediate-scale 
coastal processes.  As our databases become larger, we will need to classify 
and compress.  The Heriot-Watt group seems to be on the way to reaching both 
of these goals.  <P>

	Linnett's team consists of extremely bright young dedicated people, with 
enthusiasm for their work, and eager to expand their applications.  
Collaboration with US coastal scientists would be welcomed, especially with 
DRAs interest in expanding their US connections.<P>

Robert Dolan<P>

Notes on a visit to the Defense Research Agency<BR>
Winfrith, Dorset</H3>

<I>Key words:  Applied coastal oceanography, mine warfare.</I><P>


<B>1.	The Defense Research Agency (DRA).</B><P>

	The DRA program at Winfrith focuses on military applications in 
oceanography.  It's staffed with about 50 scientists, and has about 30 others 
working under contracts.  They have a satellite remote sensing group, headed 
by John Scott, and an active applied coastal research program, headed by Tony 
Heathershaw.  DRA conducts in-house research, and they support research 
through contracts ranging from basic through to specific problem-solving for 
the military.  <P>

People I talked with:  Graham Jackson, John Scott, and Tony 
Heathershaw<P>

(01305 212762)<P>

<B>2.	DRA Research Program.</B><P>

	Currently, the highest research priorities at DRA are shelf-edge and 
shallow-water processes; what might be termed the mine warfare and amphibious 
planning; and development of capability in rapid environmental assessment.  
DRA has supported the signal processing research underway at Heriot-Watt 
(report No. 2 in this series), and they are also pressing to better 
understand marine aerosols and boundary layer processes in response to the 
threats in chemical warfare.  <P>

<B>3.	Purpose of Visit.</B><P>

	My purpose was to assess DRA's interest in collaboration with ONR-supported 
coastal scientists, to discuss specific areas of interest and opportunities, 
and to learn more about their interest and support in signal processing of 
sidescan sonar data.<P>

<B>4.	Discussion with Graham Jackson.</B><P>

	Graham Jackson, who heads the DRA program at Winfrith, stated in our discuss 
that the position within his program and the operational people in the 
Ministry of Defense (MOD) is that there is a 'total lack of capability in the 
prediction of intertidal zone processes and morphological change at 
sufficient resolution to be of fundamental value to MOD, and that little is 
known regarding aerosols.'  He also stated that from the standpoint of the UK 
military applications, there's little confidence in the linkage between 'what 
we know about coastal processes and our capability to predict for specific 
naval applications.' Graham is convinced that there would be considerable 
support from MOD for increased dedication of resources into that area for 
1998, and perhaps some re-directed resources for 1997.<P>

	DRAs  primary customer, MOD, has high exceptions for rapid advances in 
these two areas.   Jackson's use the term 'customer' reflects the fact that 
DRA is one of the UK laboratories that is undergoing transition into a 'privatized' form of operation.  This means that they compete for contracts 
and support, which will probably lead them away from longer-termed projects 
that ONR would consider 6.1 or 6.2, and toward shorter-termed problem solving 
and application.  This trend in the UK toward 'value received for money 
invested' appears to be the future for the ocean science and technology 
laboratories.  The change from line funding in the NERC budget for the 
oceanography laboratories to full-scale competitive programs will probably 
come sooner than later, and will eventually involved about 15,000 people in 
these labs and facilities.  The field competing for the research projects 
will include the major research laboratories, universities, and private 
consulting firms.<P>

<B>5.	Discussion with John Scott.</B><P>

	John Scott is an oceanographer/modeler who works with satellite remote 
sensing.  He has considerable experience with European satellite data and he 
has good working relationships with several ONR/NRL investigators.  I didnt 
spend much time with Scott simply because the scale of his work is too small 
[coarse] for my focus while with ONREUR; that is, the wave transformation 
zone and inshore processes.  However, he did offer suggestions for contacts 
in the UK and he did express interest in the concept of the NICOP program and 
the opportunity to expand his international connections.<P>

<B>6.	Discussion with Tony Heathershaw.</B><P>

	Tony Heathershaw is a valuable source of information for anyone interested 
in the coastal oceanography and geology in the UK and Europe.  He's a 
physical oceanographer who has made several important contributions in the 
field of shallow-water processes and modeling.  Tony has extensive experience 
in working with most of the better known European coastal scientists, and he 
is familiar with the U.S. coastal research community.  Anyone interested in 
making a UK/European connection in the coastal field should start by 
contacting Tony Heathershaw at DRA.<P>

	Specific projects that Heathershaw and DRA would be interested in 
collaborating on would develop around work already underway, taking advantage 
of the modeling skills and complex coastal environments of the UK, and the 
strong data collection and verification opportunities that the US could 
offer.  He believes, from the standpoint of DRA's priorities, a focus on 
improvement of our ability to model and predict intermediate-scale processes 
would be a welcome element to their program.<P>

	Another area of special interest in their program is sediment concentrations 
in the inshore zone, including the variations in turbidity plumes and 
associated changes in the acoustical properties.  DRA has and continues to 
support research to develop models and instruments, but have had few 
opportunities to carry out calibrations under a range of field conditions.  
The type of data they are interested in is being (or planned) collected at 
the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Field Research Facility at Duck, North 
Carolina.  Heathershaw is convinced that DRA has instrumentation that would 
be of interest to US investigators that could be adapted to the Duck data 
collection effort.<P>

<B>7.	DRA's Interest in Signal Processing.</B><P>

	DRA has supported research in signal processing and pattern recognition of 
sea bed configuration for the past several years.  This is an extension of 
the UK approach to MCM using the route survey approach.  As most of you no 
doubt know, today's mines are tough, they are difficult to find, they are 
very smart, and they are relatively inexpensive.  Development of methods that 
makes it easier to identify them and predict their behavior in areas of 
common deployment (the surf-zone) is a high priority at DRA.  The remote 
sensing, signal processing, pattern analysis approach underway at Heriot-Watt 
and DRA Bincleaves is an extension of this need.  Douglas Carmichael, who is 
at DRA Bincleaves, is a graduate of Laurie Linnett's program at Heriot-Watt 
(see my report number 2 for more on Heriot-Watt).<P>

<B>7.	Summary.</B><P>

	It appears to me that there are several areas of mutual interest in the DRA 
and ONR/NRL research programs that would be worthwhile to explore.  Clearly, 
any focus on sediment mobilization in the surfzone will be of interest on 
both sides of the Atlantic, and our UK colleagues have dedicated considerable 
time and resources in the development of instruments and models in this 
field.  Their work in signal processing and pattern recognition may also be a 
valuable avenue to pursue; however, I admit only modest knowledge regarding 
this complex subject and recognize that we have, in the US, competitive 
programs underway in this area.  Finally, I was struck by the similarity of 
their specifically expressed needs in what is termed 'rapid environmental 
assessment' and the discussions that I heard at NRL during the course of the 
ONR/NRL coordination meetings last May.  If Graham Jackson and Tony 
Heathershaw did not have British accents, I would have thought I was hearing 
an echo of the discussions at NRL.  <P>

<B>Introduction</B><P>

The Office of  Naval  Research hosted a two day workshop in London on 17 - 18 October, 1996, to explore potential international collaboration in research focused on nearshore coastal processes.  The motivations for the meeting was the desire of US and European research program managers to promote long-term international research, and to discuss the opportunity for support research under the new Naval International Collaborative Opportunity Program (NICOP).  The specific objective was to develop a framework for long-term initiatives, based on expansion of research underway within programs of excellence.  <P>

A decision was made to restrict the workshop to approximately 12 participants in order to facilitate discussion.  ONR selected the participants with a goal of inviting a broad cross-section of specialties in the field of coastal dynamics.<P>

Workshop Deliberations<P>

The participants initially developed a list of 45 topics related to cooperation and methods of conducting collaborative research (Appendix 1), which were categorized and prioritized. The participants concluded that effective collaboration was best accomplished by having European and US investigators directly working together on  specific projects.  That is, it is better to have a modeller working directly with a field investigator as opposed to making the data and the model "available" on the World-Wide Web.<P>

Following the initial discussions, the workshop participants concluded that the opportunities for successful collaboration could be organized under three general subject areas, which in turn provided structure for further discussions and subgroups.  The participants met, however, several times collectively to discuss the specific recommendations of the three subgroup "teams".<P>

<B>SURFZONE HYDRODYNAMICS:</B>  Team Leader A. Dalrymple with R. Flather and R.  Diegaard<P>

<UL>
<LI>The objective of the hydrodynamics modelling effort is to understand the nearshore wave climate and nearshore circulation system, and to provide the fluid forcing of the sediments in the nearshore zone due to waves and currents.  This area includes wave and current modelling, and can include turbulence.  Generally, deepwater waves are treated with spectral models, while in the nearshore zone other models (parabolic, Boussinesq) are used.
</UL>

<B>Wave Modelling</B><BR>
<UL>
<LI>Boussinesq models developed in Europe and North America propagate waves from deep-water to the surf-zone with reasonable accuracy.  These time-domain models have an active community of international researchers on both continents that would benefit from collaborative efforts on such topics such as the implementation of wave breaking, wind-generation, wave-current interaction, long-term current generation.
<LI>Rather than working in the time-domain, which is good for short-time scales, numerous frequency-domain models exist that were developed specifically for the shallow-water propagation of wave spectra with wind generation, and those that simply propagate a given spectrum.  The wind-generation spectral modelling, the Dutch (SWAN model) has a strong user-base.   This model propagates the spectrum accounting for varying depths and wind input.  Two and three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modelling has begun to treat such problems as detached run-up and plunging breakers.
<LI>Another important area of research is in stochastic wave modelling.  Unknowns in the input wave and wind conditions, and the uncertainty in the exact bathymetry, lead to errors with deterministic models.  Quantifying these errors would be an important contribution.
<LI>Hydrodynamic forcing produces an oscillatory boundary layer in the vicinity of the bed, which plays a role in the hydrodynamics, but perhaps more importantly, in sediment transport mechanisms.  This boundary layer has been investigated in laboratory experiments (flumes, oscillatory water tunnels), field experiments, and by turbulence models; however, additional field and laboratory verification is needed to explain discrepancies between models and the field.  New investigations should be at scales appropriate to field conditions, and should fill in parts of the parameter space not covered by previous experiments -- and be capable of measuring maximum as well as mean bed shear stresses.  The experiments should cover immobile, rough, as well as mobile beds.  Both total and skin-friction shear stresses are important.  New instrumentation (acoustics, for example) gives hope of acquiring better field data.
<LI>Suspended sediment has an impact on the turbulent boundary layer through stratification effects.  This subject has not been treated satisfactorily to date, and the vertical exchanges of sediment and momentum need further research. 
<LI>In the case of a loose bed, ripple and mega-ripple formation is an important factor for flow resistance and energy dissipation. Although studies of ripples has been carried out by numerical modelling (discrete vortex models and turbulence models), further research in this field is needed.
<LI>The current model discussed below provides the hydrodynamic inputs to sediment transport calculations, there are important feedback mechanisms.  Changes in bottom depth, bed forms, suspended sediment concentrations affect the hydrodynamic calculations.  This information has to be input in the wave model in a simultaneous manner.
</UL>

<B>Current Modelling</B><BR>
<UL>
<LI>Although running a Boussinesq model over a long time period leads to currents, there is an economy in the use of vertically averaged models to predict nearshore currents.  On-going research in the US  and Europe could benefit from collaborative work on such topics as the influence of 3-D currents, complicated bathymetry, low-frequency motions, friction factor selection, wave-current interaction, and how to use spectral wave information into the hydrodynamic model.
<LI>Cross-shore flows (including undertow) are important for the 2- and 3-dimensional circulation system.  Recently the importance of these flows in influencing the mean nearshore circulation have been elucidated.  As these flows are important for onshore/offshore sediment transport, further research is needed.
<LI>Low frequency motions and instabilities of the nearshore current system are  areas of active interest in both North America and Europe.  How these circulation systems evolve with time to full nonlinear circulation systems is of great interest.  
</UL>
 
<B>Turbulence</B><BR>
<UL>
<LI>For both wave and currents in the nearshore zone, turbulence due to the rough bottom and wave breaking is important.  Models have been developed for turbulence (k-epsilon, large eddy simulations) but more work is needed.  The influence of bottom roughness elements, such as ripples, in generating turbulence has received some attention, but the importance of these structures in the hydrodynamics modelling has not been fully explored.  Obliquely descending eddies have been observed to play a role in sediment transport and nearshore mixing by Japanese scientists.
</UL>

<B>Data  Model, Large Lab, and Field Comparisons</B><BR>
<UL>
<LI>Numerical models require initial and boundary conditions.  In the field, that would dictate a number of gages on the outer boundaries of the model area. There are interesting problems in determining how to start a model with lots of grid points on the offshore row with data from a small number of gages.  How are the remainder of the offshore grid points initialized in a rational way?  In a wave tank, the problem is simplified to two-dimensions and thus more easily modelled. Large wave tanks (such as the Delft Delta Flume and the Hannover Grossen Wellenkanal) are facilities that offer opportunities for modelling in a laboratory at full-scale.  This offers strong possibilities for collaboration.
<LI>Skill criteria needs to be developed to determine how models behave and the degree of disparity between models and data due to random and systematic (bad physics) errors.
</UL>

<B>Data Assimilation</B><BR>
<UL>
<LI>Running models in 'quasi-real' time permits the use of more than initial and boundary conditions.  Data from within the model data domain can be used to steer the model to a more "correct" solution.  Data assimilation techniques are well-known in meteorology or blue-water oceanography, but have rarely been used in the nearshore field.
</UL>

<B>Testing European Models With US Datasets, Developing Standard Datasets, and Diagnostic Model/Data Tests.</B><BR>
<UL>
<LI>There is a need for calibration of existing hydrodynamics models with existing field data. By providing a standard set of data runs, the US field modellers can provide the base for a fruitful collaboration with the European modelling community.  One purpose of this comparison is to determine the differences between models and the data, implying a problem with the physics inherent in the model.
</UL>

<B>Methods for Collaboration</B><BR>
<UL>
<LI>Collaborative projects between European and U.S. scientists have been developed in the past to facilitate scientific advancement.  The joining of complementary research capabilities can pay important dividends for a research topic.  Based on experiences with the European MAST program and other collaborative efforts, it is evident that some methods foster this process and others do not.  The best approach is to bring together people with a common interest for periods of time greater than a few days or a week. These visits could be in the form of sabbatical visits, or extended visits of investigators between institutions. Also successful are joint research projects that have balance in responsibility.  Methods that do not work so well are periodic meetings of short duration where ideas are discussed but there is little or no follow-up.
</UL>

<B>Recommendations for Collaboration</B><BR>
<UL>
<LI>ONR-Europe Fellows:  A proven approach to successful long-term collaborations is the development personal contacts between researchers.  A program that would fund the exchange of recent Ph.D. recipients between research institutions would rapidly develop collaborative relationships and long-term contacts.  This could also be done through  the use of post-docs on a project-by-project basis.  <P>
<LI>Field-modeller Collaborations:  The example in the US of a dichotomy between those who gather field data and those who develop models offers guidance for collaboration between modellers and field investigators.  These relationships result in publications that give credit to both.<P>
<LI>Model Intercomparisons:  There are examples in Europe of model comparisons with numerous laboratories running their models on a standardized data sets (idealized or real).  The result shows discrepancies, but the long-term result is that all the models are improved.  These competitions would be useful in several areas of research--Boussinesq models would be one example for cases where wave breaking is included.  Funding would be needed to develop the standardized datasets and to fund the modelling efforts.
</UL><P>

<B>SMALL-SCALE MORPHOLOGY AND SEDIMENT TRANSPORT:</B> Team Leader E. Thornton with A. Bowen<P>

<B>Process of Sediment Transport</B><BR>
<UL>
<LI>The processes of sediment transport and small-scale morphology have time-scales ranging from seconds to hours with space-scales from centimeters to meters. The process of sediment transport and evolution of small-scale morphology are the least understood of the processes in the nearshore environment.  The science/technology objectives are to measure and predict sediment transport and small-scale morphology ranging from vortex (wave) ripples to cross-ripples to mega-ripples until a critical stress is achieved and the bed is flattened under sheet-flow conditions.  <P>
<LI>Small-scale processes integrate to the large-scale morphology; therefore, our understanding of the small-scale processes is essential to our ability to predict large-scales coastal phenomena. Small-scale morphology determines the mode of sediment transport and feeds back to the hydrodynamics though enhanced stress due  to increased bottom roughness.  For example, during Duck94 the bed shear stress coefficient inferred from measured profiles of the longshore current varied by an order of magnitude across the surf-zone as the small-scale morphology varied from wave ripples offshore, to mega-ripples approaching the bar, planar-bed on the top of the bar, mega-ripples again in the trough and planar on the foreshore.  This variation of the bed shear stress coefficient is not presently incorporated in hydrodynamic models and may account for much of the observed discrepancies in model/data comparisons.<P>
<LI>Europeans, funded under the MAST program, have focused on model development and laboratory studies.  Model development is this area includes wave boundary layer and sediment transport models.   Unique European laboratory facilities include several proto-type scale wave flumes and water tunnels.  U.S. coastal scientists have excelled at hydrodynamic and morphologic measurements in the field.  The research carried out by the two communities is complimentary.
</UL>

<B>Goals</B><BR>
<UL>
<LI>Test European sediment transport models using U.S. field data.
<LI>Evaluate, and further develop, existing sensors for the measurement of sediment transport.
<LI>Develop improved hydrodynamically driven sediment transport and small-scale morphology models and test using lab and field data.
<LI>Perform joint U.S./European field experiments
<LI>Inter-compare new technologies to measure sediment transport and small-scale morphology. 
</UL>

<B>Approach</B><BR>
<UL>
<LI>There is a growing suspicion that the present knowledge of  bottom stress related to wave and current forcing, which are essential to our understanding of sediment transport and small-scale morphology, is based on inadequate parameter space.  Most of the data used in this research area is derived from laboratory studies.  There is a consensus for the need for proto-type scale data from both large-scale laboratory facilities (flumes or tunnels) and the field.  A natural collaboration would be to utilize the new instrumentation that has been developed in the U.S. for field experiments, and wave boundary layers in a large-scale flume such as those at Delft Hydraulics or Hanover.  A laboratory experiment allows selecting the input wave conditions and the simplification of a 2-D problem.  The lab also offers the possibility of differentiating between total stress (important to the hydrodynamics) and skin friction (important to the sediment transport), which is not possible in the field.  New instrumentation includes the Bistatic Coherent Doppler Velocimeter (BCDV), acoustic sediment profilers, acoustic bottom profilers, bubble meters, and PIV.  For example, the BCDV measures the profiles 3-components of velocity and sediment mass over the bottom 1 m of the boundary layer at 20 vertical intervals varying between 1 - 5 cm (programmable) sampled at 48 Hz  and resolved at 1 cm.  Using the BCDV wave and Reynolds stresses can be profiled within the wave boundary layer.  The high resolution sonic scanner measures small-scale morphology every 2 cm in an x,y grid over a 3 m square area at mm vertical resolution.  The amount of bubbles in the water column are inferred using void fraction meters that measure the conductivity.  Vertical arrays of void fraction meters can be used to examine the depth of turbulent injection of bubble under breaking waves.   These and other new instrumentation used in a controlled laboratory experiment could greatly increase our understanding of wave boundary layer and sediment process under breaking waves.<P>
<LI>International collaboration would include exchange visits to test sediment transport and hydrodynamics models developed under the MAST programs with field data acquired under the ONR-funded NSTS and DUCK experiments.  A positive example of such a collaboration was between Delft University of Technology and the Naval Postgraduate School in which Reniers applied the Dutch-developed quasi-3-D model to demonstrate that the alongshore pressure gradients due to wave breaking over alongshore inhomogeneous bathymety could explain why a longshore current maximum can occur in the trough of a barred beach.  Field data is essential to test the large-area 3-D hydrodynamic/sediment transport models.<P>
<LI>Opportunities for joint U.S. and European collaborative field experiments  should be explored.  The U.S. scientists have experience, expertise and instrumentation resources, gained from a number of large-scale nearshore field experiments. Collaborations on several field experiments have been successful.  These include field experiments at Skallingen, Denmark, between Brian Greenwood (U. of Toronto) and Troels Agaard (U. of Copenhagen), and participation by Chris Vincent (U. of East Anglia) with Dan Hanes (U. of Florida) in SandyDuck.  Short-term opportunities for collaboration should also be explored, including involving additional Europeans, either as investigators or observers at Sandy Duck, and collaboration of U.S. investigators in future MAST-funded field programs.  Long-term field collaborations should be fostered through workshops and joint planning.<P>
<LI>Ongoing efforts of inter-calibration (standardization) of experimental techniques for the measurement of sediment transport should be continued and fostered.  For example, Alex Hay (Dalhousie) and Arjen Schaafsma (Delft Hydraulics) have been working together on acoustic backscatter theory and techniques applied to the measure of sediment concentration and size.

<B>Suggested Topics for Collaborative to Improve Models for the Prediction of Sediment Transport and Small-Scale Morphology:</B><BR> 
 
<UL>
<LI>Benthic boundary layer dynamics and turbulence, a focus in MAST leading to extensive intercomparisons of European models.
<LI>Parameterisation of complexity. 
<LI>Simple models (Baillard/Bowen), are being evaluated in both Europe and North America. 
<LI>Self -organised models (Werner), offer a new view of simplexity data assimilation, using observed hydrodynamics.
<LI>Diagnostic use of model/ data comparisons.
<LI>Small-scale morphology development.
</UL>

<B>Benefits Of Collaboration</B><BR>
<UL>
<LI>The Europeans possess complimentary large-scale laboratory facilities and expertise in sediment transport models; the Americans have developed new instruments and rich databases of field measurements with which to test models.  Combining the expertise of these two communities will accelerate the development of new models, measurement techniques, and data to test the models.
</UL>

<B>LARGE SCALE MORPHODYNAMICS: </B>Team Leader H. de Vriend with R. Soulsby and R. Holman<P>

<B>Science/Technology Objectives:</B><BR>	
<UL>
<LI>To understand and predict- the behavior of open, wave-dominated sandy coasts at various time scales, below and beyond the horizon of the prediction capability of physics-based models.
</UL>
 
<B>Importance Of Topic:</B><BR>
<UL>
<LI>The coast is a highly nonlinear system, which means that there may be inherent limits to the predictability of its state. The ability to understand and predict this state is essential to assess its susceptibility to adverse evolution. The large-scale morphology determines, to a considerable degree, the smaller-scale hydrodynamics and morphology, and hence the short-term variability of the system and its vulnerability to extreme events.
</UL>
 
<B>Goals:</B><BR>
<UL>
<LI>Short-term:<UL>
<LI>To develop techniques to quantify the observed (or modelled) behavior of the coast.
 
<LI>Define measures of skills of models in predicting;

		<DIR>(a) the mean coastal evolution,</DIR>
		<DIR>(b) the natural variation with respect to this mean,</DIR>
		<DIR>(c) the impact of extreme events,</DIR>
<LI>To identify the horizon of predictability of the system's state,
<LI>To identify the horizon of prediction capability of models.</UL>
<LI>Intermediate:<UL>	
<LI>To make sure that long-term data-sets continue to be built up, via the application of existing techniques and the implementation of cheaper new technology; since the coastal system is nonlinear, the availability of consistent, high-density information over long time spans is absolutely essential to its understanding.</UL>
<LI> Long-term:		
<UL>
<LI>To extend the horizon of prediction capability of models,
	<DIR>(a) via improved process descriptions.</DIR>
	<DIR>(b) via data assimilation.</DIR>
<LI>To improve the insight into the capabi-lity of models to reproduce coastal behavior and into their sensitivity to the inclusion of terms/processes (science-oriented angle).
<LI>To identify the "minimum model" to adequately describe the aspects of coastal behavior which are essential to answer specific questions in a particular case (practical-oriented angle).
<LI>To develop a thoroughly underpinned top-down approach, which links input conditions to the coastal behavior to be expected.    
</UL> </UL><P>

<B>Approach: </B><BR>
<UL>
<LI>Bottom-up, via integration of detailed physics-based models (white-box approach) and top-down, via empirical models based exclusively on data (black-box approach) and behavior-oriented models based on a combination of data and physical knowledge (grey-box approach).
</UL>

<B>Benefits Of Collaboration: </B><BR><UL>
<LI>To achieve the above goals, it is necessary to bring together the following four elements:<UL>
<LI>Data on the physical processes at work (mainly US-based),
<LI>Process-based models (mainly EU-based).
<LI>Long-term data on coastal behavior (partly US-based, partly EU-based, partly from elsewhere in the world).
<LI>Long-term models (not yet readily available, but being developed in MAST).</UL>
 
<LI>There is clearly significant benefit of US-European collaboration.  Apart from this, interdisciplinary collaboration may be of great use here, especially at the data-oriented end of the spectrum. Comparison with similar nonlinear systems, such as the atmosphere (weather, climate) may be enlightening.</UL>

<B>Opportunities: </B>
<UL>
<LI>Starting from the assumption that, in order to be feasible, NICOP-activities should be linked to on-going projects or existing research networks, there are good opportunities in European via the MAST-program, and SANDY DUCK 1997 provides a good opportunity in the US.
</UL>

<B>Facilities/Technology:</B><UL> 
<LI>To achieve the goals, the following facilities and technology are needed:<UL>
<LI>Access to existing long-term datasets.
<LI>Long-term monitoring programs (including measurements of the external forcing parameters such as waves and tides), and improved enabling technology.
<LI>Adequate access to state-of-the-art physics-based morphodynamic models.
<LI>Techniques to predict the behavior of stochastically forced nonlinear systems.
<LI>Techniques from systems theory (model fitting, data assimilation, diagnostic use of model/data-comparison).
<LI>Facilitation of researchers' exchange, extensive wor-king meetings, etc.</UL></UL>
 
 <B>Examples of Possible NICOP Large-Scale Morphodynamics Projects</B><UL>
<LI>Measures of model skill.<UL>
<LI>Have a workshop on the definition of measures of model skill, in such a way that these measures can be applied to rate a given model's performance in a particular case.
<LI>Realization: get modellers and data gatherers from US, EU (and possibly from other continents) together in a workshop/working session to generate ideas and possibly establish a first version of a set of skill measures.</UL>
<LI>Exchange during field programs. <UL>
<LI>Enable international scientists to participate or attend field campaigns (e.g. SANDY DUCK, Egmond, Teignmouth) and interact with the researchers present there. It may be necessary to explicitly organize a working meetings in order to make this happen.</UL></UL><UL>
<LI>Predictability horizon.<UL>
<LI>Organize a working session, including specialists from other disciplines dealing with nonlinear systems and pattern analysis, for the identification of predictability limits inherent to the coastal system. Links in with ongoing MAST-work and needs ARGUS-data for input.</UL></UL><UL>
<LI> ARGUS-program<UL>
<LI>Increase European participation in the Argus program. Develop teams to investigate top-down and bottom-up modelling.  The objective would be to improve the characterization of the coastal behavior (model-based data reduction) and to test various types of models against the data available (also: blind tests).</UL></UL><UL>
Support data for ARGUS-stations<UL>
<LI>Support of tide and wave data gathering at new ARGUS-stations.
<LI>Support the establishment of ARGUS-stations at new sites where field campaigns will be carried out (e.g. Egmond, Teignmouth).
<LI>Support getting access to existing tide and wave data.</UL></UL>

<B>CONCLUSIONS</B><P>

The workshop participants agreed that the international collaboration on the research questions outlined in this report would improve our predictive capabilities in surf-zone dynamics, and that once collaboration is started, stronger , more lasting relationship would develop.  The participants also recommended establishment of a permanent "Coastal Dynamics Coordinating and Planning Committee", consisting of representatives of the major coastal research groups in Europe and the U.S. <P>

<B>1.  Introduction</B><P>

		This overview concerns recently completed and ongoing projects on coastal dynamics that have been carried out with support in the framework of EU-MAST.  The purpose is to provide information on what MAST actually is, what it has produced so far, and what European research networks have been formed to achieve this.  Facts, figures, names and addresses concerning existing projects were obtained from the project-summaries provided by the European Commission.  <P>

		For each MAST-supported project, a brief description is given in terms which are considered relevant to ONR and the new Naval International Cooperative Opportunities in Science and Technology (NICOP).  Copies of the relevant pages of the aforementioned EC-documents are added in the Annex.  Information on proposed projects has to be more concise and is therefore included in the main text.<P>

	<B>2.  What is MAST?</B><P>

	MAST is the acronym of the Marine Science and Technology programme, one of the research programmes funded by the European Commission.  These programmes are funded in rounds (Framework Programmes);  the first issue of MAST (MAST-I) started as part of the Second Framework Programme.  At the moment, MAST-III is currently underway as a part of the Fourth Framework Programme.<P>

	Apart from support for administrative activities, MAST has always consisted of three research areas; (1) oceanography/marine biology, (2) coastal science/engineering and (3) marine technology (instrumentation, etc.).  Out of these, the coastal section has always been the smallest, with a funding level of approximately 10 million ECU (1.25 US$ = 1 ECU) in MAST-I (total budget 50 million ECU), approximately 15 million ECU in MAST-II (total budget 118 million ECU) and approximately 40 million ECU in MAST-III (total budget 228 million ECU).  Along with the increasing level of funding, the scope of work has been broadened, so that the actual amount of money per working area in this compartment has increased to a lesser extent.  Yet, the amount of money available for coastal research is quite substantial and MAST has definitely boosted the European research activity in this field.<P>

	The basic document in MAST is the Work Plan, which defines the scope of activities without going into detail.  Project proposals within this scope are submitted upon a call for proposals which is issued before the start of each round (only MAST-III is having a second round about one year after its start in 1995).  Proposals are selected by a panel of experts and a board of national representatives.  The most important criteria are multinational collaboration, scientific excellence, practical relevance, exploitability, and European dimension.<P>

	This procedure yields a substantial number of projects, each with a budget of one to a few million ECU.  Each project is carried out by an international consortium of main contractors, and each of them may bring in associated partners, who are supposed to take part in the scientific work, and subcontractors who deliver goods and services.  The principal products are data, models, and instrumentation, mostly described in scientific reports and publications.  Important by-products are a number of quite extensive European research networks, which often survive the end of the project.  Thus MAST has greatly contributed to the integration of the coastal research community in Europe.<P>

	In spite of its success as a programme, it is uncertain whether MAST will be continued as a separate programme under the Fifth Framework Programme.  This is partly due to a concentration of the programmes (most of the working areas will probably come under an environmental programme), and partly to a shift in emphasis of European research.  MAST-III projects will go on until the year 2000 or later.  Therefore, a collaboration with US research networks via NICOP is definitely attractive to European coastal scientists.<P>

<B>3.  Value of US-EU Collaboration</B><P>

	Based on discussions about the NICOP concept with the staff of the MAST-bureau, it is clear that MAST is interested in collaboration with US researchers.  The EU has already demonstrated this interest by allowing the active participation of US researchers through European institutes to some of the MAST-projects, e.g. PACE.  The interest from the part of MAST is driven by needs such as:

<UL>
<LI>cheap and reliable operational tools for event-scale monitoring,
<LI>model validation against a wide range of real-life, data-rich cases,
<LI>broadly agreed measures-of-skill of coastal morphodynamic models,
<LI>identification of predictability horizons in the behaviour of coasts (depending on the aggregation-level),
<LI>further development of data analysis/reduction and data-driven modelling techniques, and
<LI>development of techniques for the prediction of coastal behaviour under uncertainty of model parameters and inputs.
</UL>

Collaboration with US researchers can help to meet these needs, e.g. via <P>

<UL>
<LI>further improvement of the interpretation of data from the ARGUS nearshore monitoring system,
<LI>jointly using some of the larger US datasets (Duck, Florida) for model validation,
<LI>joint definition of measures-of-skill, etc.
</UL>

Moreover, it is of interest to Europe to have its research products applied by a worldwide research community in order to have them challenged at the scientific level, and to increase robustness at the application level.<P>

<B>4.  Relevant MAST-Projects</B><P>

<B>4.1 The coastal compartment of MAST-I.</B><P>

	The coastal part of MAST-I consisted of a section on coastal engineering (hard structures) and one on coastal science (dynamic processes).  The latter involved projects such as:<P>

<LI>Linear Sand Banks, the forerunner of the CSTAB-project (see Section 4.2),
<LI>RESECUSED, the forerunner of the STARFISH-project (see Section 4.2),

This project, which is considered quite successful, has made an important contribution to Europe's present position in the mathematical modelling of coastal behaviour.  It was the largest project of MAST-II, and the EU refers to it as the "MAST-flagship".  It has created an extensive pan-European network of coastal researchers, centered around the group of nine hydraulic laboratories (G9).  Various part so this network are still intact after the project has ended and operate in various research programmes.<P>

<B>5.  Pathways of collaborations</B><P>

<B>Partners</B><P>

	The part of the MAST Work Programme that corresponds with the ONR-Coastal Dynamics programme is Area B:  "Coastal Science and Engineering".  Most of the aforementioned projects are funded from this part of the EC programme.  Being primarily a funding framework, MAST has an administrative bureau but no in-house researchers.  MAST could, therefore, facilitate collaboration with ONR-NICOP, but the actual connections will depend on the research consortia which are carrying out the projects.  These consortia would be the natural collaboration-partners from the EU-end.  One of the most important consortia in the coastal sciences compartment of MAST is the group of 9 European hydraulic laboratories (G9);  they were behind the G6-M and G8-M projects in MAST-I and MAST-II, and they are behind a considerable number of projects and submissions in MAST-III (PACE, SAFE, INDY, SASME, SEDMOC, COAST3D).  G9 includes Europes most important centres of numerical model development and laboratory work in the coastal research area.<P>


<B>Frameworks</B><P>

Although G9 and other research consortia which are active in MAST are spending significant amounts of their own resources to match MAST-projects (commercial institutes have to cover 50% of the costs of each project, universities can only charge marginal costs made especially for the project), they do not have a joint independent research organization.  Research collaboration exists within the projects, but seldom beyond them.  So the research projects are the natural frameworks of collaboration.  The work definition in the ongoing projects is primarily science-oriented (as opposed to product-oriented), with sufficient flexibility to include an unforeseen collaboration via ONR-NICOP.  If contracts need to be modified, this can be done without too many complications, especially if MAST officially supports the collaboration.  The networks which carry out MAST-projects tend to survive the projects end, but once support ends, the interactions usually reduce to scientific exchange between individuals.  Therefore, collaboration within the framework of ongoing projects is recommended.  As the projects to be funded under the last round of MAST-III are expected to start in 1997, these are also candidates for collaboration.  The decision on which projects will be funded is expected in early 1997.<P>

<B>Scope</B><P>

	Areas of high European research activity in the field of coastal dynamics are in areas of uninterrupted sandy coasts, barrier-island coasts, and estuaries and coastal lagoons.  A range of timescales is covered, from microscale (boundary layers and wave-current interaction, small-scale bedforms), via mesoscale (wave and current patterns, sediment pathways, morphodynamics at the event-scale and the seasonal scale), through to macroscale (decadal/ centennial/millennial scale).  Much of the research is driven by the need for predictions, but, due to the nature of morphodynamic processes, hydrodynamics, sediment transport and micromorphology are equally important research issues.<P>

 <B>Potential links</B><P>

	In the foregoing we have mentioned a number of ongoing and submitted MAST-projects which cover most of this area.  As the principal inputs into this collaboration are numerical and laboratory modelling expertise from the EU-end, and field-oriented knowledge from the USA-end, it would seem logical to link via ONR-NICOP a number of field-work oriented groups in the USA with modelling-oriented MAST-projects, such as PACE for the macroscale (annual and more, depending on the spatial scale of the phenomena), SAFE for the mesoscale (up to decadal), the Wave-Current Interaction project for the micro-scale (hydrodynamics only).  SEDMOC, if funded, would cover micro-scale morphodynamics in general, SASME event-scale morphodynamics of the nearshore, INDY meso- and macroscale morphodynamics of tidal inlet systems.<P>

<B>Multiplier-effect</B><P>

A collaboration between EU-modellers and USA-field workers and modellers would be beneficial to either party, but it would probably not increase the modelling capability in the USA, nor the field work potential in Europe.  The strongest multiplier effect would be achieved if the EU-partners in the collaboration would not only be modellers, and the USA-partners not only field workers.  Exchange of knowledge works best with "senders" and "receivers" at either end.  In other words;  the EU-participation should also involve some joint field work (e.g. via COAST3D and/or the Egmond experiments), and the USA- participation should involve hands-on modelling.

<P><B>1. Summary:</B> A workshop on Reasoning with Uncertainty in
Robotics was held at the University of Amsterdam under the auspices of
the Department of Mathematics and Computer Science. Researchers from 11
nations were represented in discussions which took place over the course
of three days. The objective was to create interaction among groups
performing research on uncertainty in the fields of artificial
intelligence and robotics. The workshop was successful in highlighting
historical development and current trends in theoretical issues
underlying robotics applications, while current robotics practice seems
to rely heavily on Kalman estimation. Papers outlining theoretical
development, architectures for control, multi-disciplinary estimation
techniques, and information based metrics give indications of progress
and evolving maturity in the field and have significance for military
systems.
</P><P><B>2. Discussion:</B> The workshop was intended to bring
together researchers in the fields of uncertainty in artificial
intelligence and robotics, in order to clarify the relationship between
differing approaches and to identify urgent problems. Problems in
robotics provide a good paradigm for larger scale problems in
information processing and management which occur in military
environments. Further, the small scale and tractable constraints
presented in typical robotics problems provide an excellent focus for
evaluating theoretical issues and their practical implications. Typical
robotics problems deal with localization, navigation, exploration or
sometimes, more generalized actions, in the context of uncertain,
incomplete or inconsistent information.<BR>  Participants at this
workshop could be broadly categorized in two camps: the AI types or
"logicians" - theoretically oriented, seeking robust mathematical
formalisms, relying heavily on symbolic approaches; and the roboticists,
- application oriented, satisfied with narrow formalisms, generally
resulting in numeric solutions. The papers and discussion provided
excellent insight into underlying issues and evolution of thinking and
capabilities in the field.<BR>  The central issue in automated systems
is the problem of dealing with uncertainty. Estimation theory provides a
mathematically consistent method for combining data, for predicting on
the basis of data, and for propagating errors in control systems.
However when source data are incomplete, or ambiguous in terms of
objective statements, additional tools are needed to invoke inferences
or to reason about significance. Probability theory provides a strong
formalism for dealing with uncertainty, but the interpretations are
often subjective, and the combinatorics of the required probabilities,
for full scale problems, can become unmanageable. Early AI workers
developed 'certainty factor models' to apply measures of uncertainty to
qualify facts and rules in expert systems. These approaches, while
sometimes successful, have no theoretical justification, despite
attempts to provide a probabilistic connection. Evidence theory,
embodied principally in Dempster-Shafer Theory, provides a formalism for
representing and combining evidence at different levels of abstraction.
D-S overcomes the combinatorial problem of probability theory, but
recent efforts have focused on the soundness of Dempster's combination
rule, stemming from interpretations of independence in the D-S
framework. The most recent efforts in this field have focused on Bayes
nets, or causal networks, as a means to emulate human reasoning.<BR> 
The evidence of this workshop is that roboticists continue to apply
estimation theory, embodied primarily in Kalman filtering, because it
provides real solutions for combining of sensor data and control of
actuators. Such techniques are deficient when it comes to reasoning
about information in larger contexts, as in problems of route planning
or sensor management. The logicians, meanwhile, continue to seek a
single robust, theoretically sound, formalism for dealing with
uncertainty of all forms. A holy grail perhaps.<BR>  A number of papers
on robot design, indicated the use of a layered hierarchy, with high
level control provided by an estimation approach, generally Kalman, but
utilizing probabilistic (Bayes) or certainty factor models for a
specific solution subset. The best of these provided examples of robots
with ability to navigate through a sequence of corridors, locate and
pass through doors, or to localize an object in a room. One example of a
large scale application was fully automated guidance and control of a
trailer transporting cargo containers through a complex dock area.<BR> 
Two papers were of particular interest in problems of planning and
reasoning under uncertainty. The first, a paper by Glen Shafer,
introducing the concept of a "Probability Tree" as a more robust
structure for capturing causality than Bayes nets. The second, offered
by Leslie Kaelbling described the partially observable Markov decision
process (POMDP) as an approach to choosing optimal actions in partially
observable stochastic domains. The computation is often difficult to
achieve, but has value in problems with discrete domains. An application
of POMDP was discussed in a separate paper showing its utility in map
learning within the design of an office delivery robot at Carnegie
Mellon University.<BR>  A novel approach to capturing and managing
knowledge, with implications for measures of information sufficiency,
was offered by Elfes in the form of a grid based representation of
physical objects. Elfes has developed a formalism for an 'inference
grid', which has multiple properties allowing complex representation of
information about the environment, including entropy measures relating
to mission relevant information. This concept was first outlined in a
paper by Elfes in 1992 and has since been applied with some success in a
number of designs. The question of scalability would be of interest.<BR>
 Three issues were cited in many of the papers and throughout the
discussion. These are core issues underlying collaboration and progress
in all areas of S&amp;T. They are noted here because they were noted
frequently at the workshop, and because they tend to be ignored or
under-supported in emerging technology disciplines.<BR> 
</P><PRE>
1. Modeling 
   - accurate models of sensors and physical environments;
   - understanding of model limitations;
 2. Benchmarks: 
   - measures for comparison;
   - canonical problem sets;
   - shared environments to perform testing.
 3. Semantics:   
   - lack of agreement on terms, ( i.e. "uncertainty" vs. "ignorance", "confidence" vs. "variability");
   - issues of numerical representation 
   - independence of data/information.
</PRE>
<P><B>3. Assessment:</B> Work on robot design appears to be centered
on laboratory or simulation environments, and is applied to narrowly
constrained problems. Typical tasks, while of small scale, provide the
basis for needed theoretical development and insight into larger system
architecture and implementation issues. Progress in this area,
therefore, has significance for military systems. Current efforts to
develop robust formalisms (Voorbraak) and the evolution to hybrid
control architectures (Crowley, Kristensen,) for flexibility and
adaptability, and decomposition of search space to enable evaluation of
appropriate metrics (Elfes, Konolige) are evidence of such progress.
Equivalent military problems to aggregate source data for various types
of decision support (situation assessment, plan development, replanning,
etc.) rely on the same underlying technology, and may benefit from
monitoring of developments in this community particularly in the areas
of theoretical foundations and metrics.

<P><B>1. Summary</B>
</P><P> Command & Control technology at TNO-FEL is organized into two
groups: tactical C2, dealing with land and air operations, and platform
C2, dealing with maritime operations. The organization has a strong
awareness of underlying trends and issues in C2 development, and appears
to make a strong contribution in areas of applied development. Expertise
is maintained by performing in-house development in selected areas and
programs, with guidance derived from active user relationships. A
limited number of programs were briefed. Two of these, ATCCIS and ISIS
have long term implications for interoperability in that their relation
to GCCS is not clear.
</P><P><B>2. Discussion</B>
</P><P> TNO-FEL is the Netherlands Organization for Applied Scientific
Research (TNO) Physics and Electronics Laboratory (FEL). FEL is one of 3
institutes within TNO, employing approximately 400 people (down about
20% from 1994) and doing approximately 85% of its work for the NL
Ministry of Defence. The other institutes are TNO Prins Maurits
Laboratory (TNO-PML) involved in munitions research and related chemical
and physical processes, and TNO Human Factors Research Institute
(TNO-TM). TNO-FEL is organized in four divisions; Operations Research,
Command & Control and Simulation, Telecommunications and Defense
Electronics, and Observation Systems. The latter contains radar,
electro-optic, acoustic and remote sensing groups. The principal
advertised products are sensor systems, information and
telecommunications systems, trainers and simulators, and policy studies.
This visit focused on command and control activities which are conducted
in two groups - tactical C2, (dry) dealing with land and air operations,
and platform C2, (wet) dealing with maritime operations. TNO-FEL
provided an overview briefing reflecting knowledge and appreciation of
current trends in C2, along with a number of specific program briefings.

</P><P> The overview briefing reflected sensitivity to the range of
drivers affecting modern C2 systems: short planning horizon, the
conflicting problems with upgrading legacy systems and keeping pace with
technology maturation, the need for evolutionary procurement, commercial
leveraging (COTS), and the need for commonality in training,
management/policy development, and operational systems. The development
approach incorporates tenets of evolutionary acquisition, leveraging
COTS wherever possible, encouraging and maintaining user involvement,
and promoting concepts of integrated C2 (i.e. commonality in tools,
environments, databases, etc.). Extensive use is made of testbeds for
simulation and validation. The distinction made between C2 developments
for 'dry' or 'wet' operations is justified on the basis that
organizational structures (Army and AF v. Navy) are quite different, but
is probably a response to customer attitudes. Within the organization
there appears to be active recognition and leveraging of common
technologies.
</P><P><B>3. Programs</B>
</P><P><B>ATCCIS (Allied Tactical Command and Control Information
System)</B><BR>  Under development to provide interconnectivity down to
the database level between C2 systems of different nations. A
demonstration of this capability was conducted at TNO-FEL, November
1995, involving 7 nations (NL, US, UK, GE, DEN, FR, SP). ATCCIS
addresses standardized communications protocols, database structures
(common data transfer), and data models (common language). Extended
discussion on this topic was foreclosed due to limited time. However,
ATCCIS was presented as the basis for NATO's C2 system of the future -
the "A" in the acronym was recently changed from Army to Allied. Some
awareness of GCCS was expressed but the relationship to ATCCIS,
particularly in the area of underlying structures, data models, etc.,
was not clear.<BR>
<B>ISIS (Integrated Staff Information System)</B><BR>  Builds on
ATCCIS, intended to provide a standardized operating environment to
facilitate intelligence information flow and related information to
enhance situation awareness. Deals with network architecture, services,
and selected applications. Will eventually support all organizational
levels, but currently focused at brigade level and upwards.<BR>
<B>DFD (Data Fusion Demonstrator)</B><BR>  This is a multi-phased
program, established under NATO AC/243, Panel 3, with participation of 7
nations (GE, NL, FR, CA, IT, UK, DEN). The purpose is to process
intelligence data to produce a coherent perception of the enemy
situation. Focus is on processing (including correlation and display) of
message based data and environmental information. Emphasis is placed on
knowledge based techniques. The project started in February 1993 and is
approaching the completion of a laboratory evaluation phase this year,
with a prototype to be built and demonstrated by the end of 1997.<BR>
<B>Helicopter Mission Planner</B><BR>  A planning aid which supports
allocation of helicopter resources (three types, limited numbers of
each) to missions of transport, MEDEVAC, C2 and search and rescue. The
planner runs in a PC environment and performs route planning considering
fuel, terrain, and threats, and recommends tasking of required assets,
and load configurations.<BR>
<B>DIS (Distributed interactive simulation)</B><BR>  Demonstration of
a sophisticated capability employing multiple in-house models
distributed throughout the facility, and connected to simulations in
other countries including the US (NAWC, Orlando) and UK (DRA,
Farnborough). Apparently used somewhat routinely within the FEL-TNO, in
various configurations, in support of systems analysis and as a testbed
for different programs. The particular demo was of an engagement of
multiple ships, aircraft, and missiles, to evaluate effectiveness of
ship countermeasures and maneuvers in defeating missile threats.
</P><P><B>4. Assessment</B>
</P><P> Strong awareness of C2 issues and a robust development
capability with expertise in selected areas of emphasis. Selected areas
are driven apparently by a combination of self interest and user
concerns. The role of ATCCIS and related efforts relative to GCCS is an
issue. Is there an intended relationship or is there a looming
interoperability problem?

<P><B>1. Summary</B><BR>  TNO-FEL is currently flying a full
polarimetric C- band SAR (synthetic aperture radar) named PHARUS. As one
of a limited number of SAR systems available for test on an airborne
platform it is worthy of note. The system was designed for remote
sensing applications, is implemented with an active phased array, and
has fully programmable waveform, processing, and recording
characteristics.
</P><P><B>2. Discussion</B><BR>  The Physics and Electronics
Laboratory of TNO (TNO-FEL) is currently flying a full polarimetric C-
band SAR (synthetic aperture radar) named PHARUS (Phased Array Universal
SAR). The design of PHARUS satisfies a variety of remote sensing
purposes including environmental monitoring and military applications.
The system is composed of three subsystems: the base radar mounted in a
pod external to the aircraft, on-board data processing and recording
inside the aircraft, and ground-based SAR processing. The antenna is an
active phased array, configured as part of the pod. It supports a number
of scan modes including swath, spotlight, multi-target tracking, pulse
to pulse beam steering, and active nulling. Single or full linear
polarization modes may be selected. Radar parameters relating to
waveform, processing, and recording characteristics are programmable.
The system is currently flying on a Cessna Citation II.
</P><P> Key specifications are as follows:<BR> 
</P><PRE>
Frequency      5.3 GHz
Peak Power     480 w
Waveform       Linear FM
Bandwidth      100 MHz (max.)
Pulse Length   to 25.6 ms
Resolution     Range:      3.75 m
               Azimuth:   1m.
Polarization   Transmit:  H or V
               Receive:   H and V
Swath width    up to 20 km
Max. range     up to 30 km
Recording BW   100 Mbit/s
</PRE>
<P>In addition to its use for various environmental data collection
programs, it is envisioned that the PHARUS concept provides the basis
for a family of similar airborne SAR's, built on a common basis, and
tailored to individual user needs. PHARUS was designed and built through
the combined efforts of TNO-FEL in The Hague, the National Aerospace
Laboratory (NLR) in Amsterdam, and the Delft University of Technology.
</P><P><B>3. Assessment</B><BR>  PHARUS represents one of a limited
number of SAR systems available on an airborne platform for test
purposes. It is a modern radar design with a number of significant
features. It is fully polarimetric, has programmable waveforms, and is
well instrumented for data recording. The availability of PHARUS on a
Cessna Citation II makes it ideal as a data collection platform.

<B>1.   Summary</B><BR>
The SHAPE Technical Centre (STC) has a mission "To provide scientific and   
technical advice and assistance to SHAPE".  It serves primarily as a   
system developer/engineering organization, with close links to the   
requirements organization and to operational users.  STC performs   
technology evaluation through studies and experimentation, and promotes   
technology exploitation through user oriented testbeds and rapid   
prototyping.  In meeting these roles it leverages strong interaction with   
operational users, a multi-national technical workforce, and a proactive   
policy toward evolutionary acquisition.  In the June '96 time frame it is   
expected that STC will merge with NACISA (NATO Communications and   
Information Systems Agency) to form a new NATO C3 Agency.  This change is   
expected to shorten acquisition timelines, and improve the quality of   
fielded products.  This newsletter outlines the organizational structure,   
and highlights selected programs.  Among many technical contributions,   
special note is made of (a) CRONOS - an information exchange network   
built on exercise experience and an Internet paradigm, and now serving as   
a "NATO Wide Web";  (b) RAP - a recognized air picture provided to NATO   
forces on a near real time basis; and (c) ACCS - design work for a future   
NATO air C2 system - this work (similar to work in land C2 systems at   
TNO-FEL) should be examined by US counterparts to avoid problems in   
interoperability downstream.<P>

<B>2.   Discussion</B><BR>
The SHAPE Technical Centre (STC) located at The Hague, The Netherlands,   
has a mission "To provide scientific and technical advice and assistance   
to SHAPE".  It operates effectively as a system engineering organization,   
emphasizing technology exploitation on behalf of operational users in   
support of goals set by Allied Command Europe.  STC employs a scientific   
staff of 113 people with 14 NATO countries represented, 29 are from the   
US.  Lab facilities are quite modern with extensive internal and external   
connectivity, performing simulation, analysis, testbedding, and   
prototyping, in support of either developmental or operational goals.   
 This visit provided a broad overview of the organizational structure,   
visibility into a number of programs, and insight to the nature of   
activity and facilities.<P>

STC is organized into four technical divisions:<BR>
    - Operations Research,<BR>
    - Communications,<BR>
    - Command, Control & Sensors,<BR>
    - Information Systems<BR>
An overview of each division is provided below<P>

Work is performed in nine scientific and technological packages, the   
percentage of the total work program is shown in parentheses:<BR>
    - Support to Defence Planning,  (17%)<BR>
    - Support to Operational Planning,  (9%)<BR>
    - Information Systems,  (13%)<BR>
    - Training and Exercises,  (4%)<BR>
    - Communications,  (21%)<BR>
    - INFOSEC Support,  (3%)<BR>
    - NATO Airborne Early Warning and Control,  (5%)<BR>
    - Electronic Warfare Research Studies,  (4%)<BR>
    - Air Command, Control, Surveillance, Missile Defence Support (21%)<P>

STC work is sponsored primarily by four ACOS' (Assistant Chiefs of Staff)   
at SHAPE, accounting for (88%) of the total budget.  STC has a direct   
connection to the ACOS' as it does with operational units through   
extensive user oriented testbedding, and field prototyping activities.   
 Users are involved in various stages of the development process, through   
lab activity, exercise participation, and phased deployment of technology   
to the field.  STC has positioned itself with a number of features   
well-suited to fulfilling its technology exploitation role.  These are:   
(a) a strong connection with users for sensitivity to emerging   
operational problems, (b) a capable staff with the technical savvy to   
offer appropriate technology solutions, (c) an effective policy for   
applying evolutionary acquisition mechanisms wherever possible, and (d) a   
short sponsor chain so that necessary changes can be effected rapidly.<P>

In the June '96 time frame it is expected that STC will merge with NACISA   
(NATO Communications and Information Systems Agency) to form a new NATO   
C3 Agency.  The effect of this merger will be to bridge the gap which now   
exists between STC as developer and NACISA as acquisition agent.  The   
change is expected to create a closer coupling of plans and prototypes to   
specs and procurements, thus expediting introduction of validated   
products to the field.<P>

<B>3.   Organization and program overviews</B><BR>
Many of the STC programs and products are familiar to performers in the   
US either through direct involvement or usage in NATO contexts.  The   
following brief summaries are intended to outline the resources and   
capabilities offered at STC and to highlight a few selected programs.   
 Additional information is available on request.<P>

<I>3.1  Operations Research Division</I><BR>
       <DIR>[Areas of Interest: Land, Air Maritime Force Requirements;
        Movement and Transportation; Sustainment Requirements;
        Models and Databases; Decision Support; Experimental Gaming.]</DIR>
Performs analyses to support Alliance strategic and operations planning   
in areas of defence planning (threat assessment, readiness estimates,   
coordination of national contribution to defence goals) and support to   
military operations (crisis response planning, lessons learned, decision   
support tools to manage integrated operations).  This latter activity   
includes continued development and dissemination of ADAMS<BR>
   > ADAMS (Allied Deployment and Movement System) -a PC based,
       tool for logistics analysis, movement planning, and execution
       monitoring. ADAMS is employed by SHAPE for planning and
       coordination of multinational deployments.  It includes relevant
       databases, planning tools, decision support, displays and
       communications interfaces.<P>

<I>3.2  Information Systems Division</I><BR>
       <DIR>[Areas of Interest: Information Systems engineering;
        Operations/Logistics Support Systems; Intelligence Systems;
        Command Centers Systems Integration; Computer Assisted
         Exercises.]</DIR>
Provides system engineering and support tools for information systems   
required by SHAPE at the force coordination level and higher.  Heavy   
emphasis is placed on rapid prototyping and user evaluation in functions   
of intelligence, and operations/logistics.  Simulation capability is   
focused on CAE (computer assisted exercises) which provide training in   
simulated battle environments including force maneuvering and threat   
responses.  The intent is to augment (eventually replace) warrior prep   
exercises.<BR>
Developmental efforts include:<BR>
    > CRONOS - an information exchange network put in place as an
       "operating prototype" to support Bosnian operations.  It connects
       organizations such as SHAPE, NATO HQ, AFCENT, AFSOUTH,
       ARRC,SACLANT, SIXATAF, and others.  CRONOS is now
       considered to be operational, and in essence serves as a "NATO
       Wide Web".  It uses Internet (or Internet-like) protocols, is PC   
based,
       uses dedicated routers and 64KB links, and builds on prior   
networks
       employed for exercise support (i.e. SRIXS in Strong Resolve, and
       ECHO a wide area data network).  Maintenance and a help desk are
       provided by STC.  In addition to supporting routine command level
       interaction (monitoring, reporting, etc.), it carries a variety of   

       products, including ADAMS -a logistics planning tool, RAP -
       recognized air picture, and has connections to appropriate   
databases
       and intel systems.<BR>
    > PAIS (Prototype ACE Intelligence System) - upgrades for improved
       crisis monitoring and management.  PAIS provides order of battle,
       situation awareness, and imagery information.<BR>
    > Anchor HQ Concepts - for maintaining staff out of operational areas   

       to reduce associated costs and risks, currently being evaluated   
for
       quality of interaction and support effectiveness.<BR>
    > Information management tools for filtering open source and
       message data, text searches and automated web searching.<P>

<I>3.3  Command, Control & Sensors Division</I>
      <DIR> [Areas of Interest: Air Command & Control; Surveillance; NATO
        AEW&C; Electronic Warfare; Theatre Missile Defence.]</DIR>
Projects focused on planning, execution and monitoring of air power for   
the alliance.  Specific projects include studies, employing modeling and   
simulation, and system upgrades, DT&E focus, for such programs as NATO   
AEW&C (NATO Airborne Early Warning & Control System - E-3A), AADGE (ACE   
Air Defence Ground Environment Improvement Support), and TMD (Theatre   
Missile Defence).  Simulation facilities for testing radar and EW   
responses are extensive and modern.  The EW Tactics Lab in particular,   
offers a unique capability for test of countermeasures under dynamic   
conditions.<BR>
Two efforts worthy of note:<BR>

<B>4.   Assessment</B><BR>
STC serves primarily as a system developer/engineering organization, with   
close links to SHAPE (Requirements and Sponsors) and to operational users   
(needs and evolutionary paths).  This role will likely be strengthened   
with the upcoming merger of STC and NACISA (NATO Communications and   
Information Systems Agency) to form a single NATO C3 Agency.  The change   
is expected to happen in June '96.<BR>
STC possesses a cadre of technically knowledgeable personnel who stay   
abreast of the state-of-the-art and have demonstrated good ability to   
exploit technology to meet operational needs.  The organization maintains   
strong interaction with users through exercises and fielding of   
prototypes, and supports rapid movement of lab products to operational   
usage by applying concepts of evolutionary acquisition.  Simulation and   
laboratory facilities in support of systems development, test and   
evaluation are excellent.<BR>
Work being conducted at STC in C2 systems architecture and functionality   
(as at TNO-FEL) should be examined by US counterparts to avoid problems   
in interoperability downstream.<P>

<B>1.   Summary</B><BR>
The Fourth Bayona Workshop On Intelligent Methods In Signal Processing and Communications, held at Bayona-Vigo, Spain, was a gathering of approximately 75 scientists from 16 nations including the US and Canada.  The Workshop had the objective of a cross-fertilization of ideas relevant to intelligent processing and facilities for communication terminals.  The meeting provided a useful sampling of the state of research in signal processing oriented to communications, and exposure to a collaborative program among a few US and Spanish universities which appears to have accelerated the technical maturation of all concerned.  The workshop represented the initial activity of COST #254, "Intelligent Processing and Facilities for Communication Terminals".  COST (European Cooperation in the Field of Scientific and Technical Research) provides a framework for R&D cooperation in Europe.  A description of COST will be provided in another newsletter.<P>

<B>2.   Discussion</B><BR>
<B>2.1   The Environment</B><BR>
The workshop represented the initial activity of COST #254, which addresses "Intelligent Processing and Facilities for Communication Terminals".  COST programs are structured to explore S&T in selected areas where there is strong market potential and demand for new ideas and products.  The strength of the telecommunications arena is beyond question, and it appears that COST has been an effective catalyst in creating networks among researchers in the field across Europe.  Within telecommunications there have been 26 completed COST actions, 25 are currently ongoing, and 5 new ones are being considered.  Among workshop attendees, attitudes about the value of COST in providing focus and support to research activities were quite positive.<BR>
Another complementary activity, which was credited with having a positive influence on programs at universities in Madrid and Vigo was also evident.  It appears that an ad hoc relationship among these institutions and the University of New Mexico has been mutually beneficial in raising the quality of the research program, including overall faculty support, facilities, and student quality.  This relationship is now being institutionalized and expanded under the name ISTEC (Iberoamerican Science and Technology Education Consortium) to include institutions throughout the Americas and Spain.<P>

<B>2.2   The Papers</B><BR>
The workshop offerings were of uniformly high quality, with the papers providing a good mix of theoretical explication and new, often innovative, approaches to current issues.  Papers came from 16 nations with Spain providing the most, but more than half coming from other European countries.  The workshop featured six technical sessions presenting current research, and six invited papers - tutorials/state-of-the-art reviews - to set the theme for each session.  Some fifty papers were offered; persistent themes were modeling and processing of non-linear signals, use of wavelets for analysis and processing, neural nets, chaos in signal and image processing, adaptive techniques including echo equalization, channel modeling, and adaptive arrays.  All of the invited papers were from North America (4 - US, 2 - Canada), the work described is assumed to be known or accessible.  Sessions and invited talks are outlined in the following section.  A proceedings will be published.<P>

<B>3.   Overview of Sessions and Invited Talks<BR>
3.1   Sessions:</B>

</UL>

<B>4.   Assessment</B><BR>
The evidence of this workshop is that European S&T capability in signal processing for communications is quite strong.  The quality of the papers offered in the sessions, and the breadth of nations represented and participating, gives indication of a healthy research environment and of a strong cadre of emerging researchers.  While the largest single source of papers was from Spanish researchers, not surprising given the location, the majority of papers were distributed across thirteen other European nations.  The impact of research level collaboration - apparently spurred by COST - without specific controls and limited guidance appears to have broad benefit.  While there was a general lack of industry presence, much of the work was well framed in the context of real-world problems and market issues.  It is noteworthy that virtually all the invited papers were presented by North Americans - this may be a reflection of where the scientific leadership in this area still resides - for the time being.<BR>
The contribution of COST as an environment for stimulating general progress in S&T capability should be examined in greater detail as it applies to telecommunications and to other areas.  Similarly the benefit and contribution of consortia such as ISTEC should be considered more closely.<P>

<B>1.   Introduction</B><BR>
As part of its charter this office is responsible for identifying practices and environments which are conducive to innovation and collaboration in S&T.  COST is a program set up under the Commission of European Communities, General Directorate for Science, Research and Development which appears to have had some degree of success in identifying issues and coordinating national activities.<P>

Cost is primarily a framework for R&D cooperation, which allows for the coordination of nationally funded research on a European level.  COST employs a "bottoms up" approach which addresses a broad range of activities.  A feature of COST is that any group of scientists can propose a new Action on a research activity where they see a need to cooperate.  Only five COST countries need to sign the MoU to put the Action into effect.  COST is funded as part of the European Union (EU) Framework Programme but at a very low level.  (Latest estimate: COST receives approximately 40M ECU out of a 4 year total Programme budget of 13B ECU, about 0.3%!).  (1 ECU ~ $1.25)<P>

The following description of COST is extracted from material provided by the program.  Additional information may be found on the COST homepage at: <A HREF="http://www.cordis.lu/cost/home.html">http://www.cordis.lu/cost/home.html</A><P>

<B>2.  Cost cooperation</B><P>

COST (European Cooperation in the field of Scientific and Technical
Research) is a framework for scientific and technical cooperation, allowing the
coordination of national research on a European level. COST Actions consist
of basic and precompetitive research as well as activities of public
utility.<P>

There are 25 COST member countries : the fifteen European Union (EU) Member States plus<BR>
Iceland, Norway, Switzerland, the Czech republic, Slovakia, Hungary,
Poland, Turkey, Slovenia, Croatia and the European Commission.<P>

<B>2.1  Background</B><BR>
COST Cooperation was set up in 1971 by a ministerial Conference attended by
Ministers for Science and Technology of the 19 original COST countries.
This cooperation was widened to include Iceland, Hungary, Czechoslovakia
and Poland at the second Ministerial Conference held on COST in Vienna in 
November 1991.  This organization, which laid the foundations for scientific
cooperation at the European level, is based upon a flexible set of
arrangements enabling different national organizations, institutes,
universities and industry to join forces and make concerted efforts in a
broad range of scientific and technical areas. From the beginning, the
European institutions (Commission and Council Secretariats) have played a 
particularly important role in the COST framework.<P>

Since 1989, organizations and institutes from non-COST countries and
especially from other Central and Eastern European countries may also
participate in individual COST Actions, if there is a justified mutual
interest.<P>

Four basic principles underlie COST mechanisms :<P>

<OL>
<LI>All COST member countries, as well as the European Commission, can propose COST Actions.
<LI>Participation in these Actions is voluntary and " la carte" (variable geometry), associating only interested countries.
<LI>The research to be coordinated is funded nationally.  The coordination costs are funded both by the participating countries and by the European Commission.
<LI>A COST Action aims to coordinate national research at a European level (concerted action).  The work undertaken by each Action is administered by a Management Committee.
</OL>

In contrast to Community Research Programmes, this form of collaboration
does not require an agreed overall research policy.  It focuses on specific
themes for which there is particular interest in the COST countries.<P>

From an initial 7 Actions in 1971, COST has grown to 123 Actions in
February 1996.<P>

<B>2.2  Cost Actions</B><BR>
A special feature of all COST Actions is the complete freedom of
participation by each country involved, according to national research
priorities. Any COST country can join an Action by signing a "Memorandum of
Understanding" (MoU) which is the legal basis of the Action. This resembles
a "gentleman's agreement" and is an expression of good faith rather than a
formal and legally binding document. The MoU governs the joint aims, the
type of activity to be pursued, the terms of participation and compliance
with sovereignty and if necessary, with intellectual property rights. The
signature of the MoU by at least five COST countries enables the entry
into force of the Action.<P>

The great advantage of this approach lies in a relatively rapid exchange of
information between scientists and technical experts and in the
arrangements made concerning the distribution of tasks for the research
work involved in the Action.<P>

<B>2.3  Types and Areas of Collaborative Research</B><BR>
The COST framework has proved to be suitable for several types of research
work. In most cases it is used to coordinate at European level existing or
proposed research programmes, in such general fields as :<P>

<UL>
<LI>research on topics of international interest such as oceanography, environmental protection, meteorology;
<LI>R & D appealing to a greater or lesser extent to all European countries, both individually and jointly, such as data processing, information technology, advanced materials, agriculture and food technology;
<LI>mutual adaptation of the various standards and specifications among the individual European countries in order to achieve the most widespread cross-frontier uniformity possible, for example in the telecommunications and transport sectors.
</UL>

COST Actions exist in the 17 following domains at present :
<UL>
<LI>Agriculture and Biotechnology
<LI>Archeology
<LI>Chemistry
<LI>Civil Engineering
<LI>Environment
<LI>Fluid Dynamics
<LI>Food Technology
<LI>Forests and Forestry Products
<LI>Informatics
<LI>Materials
<LI>Medical Research
<LI>Meteorology
<LI>Oceanography
<LI>Physics
<LI>Social Sciences
<LI>Telecommunications
<LI>Transport
</UL>

The following are examples of particularly successful COST Actions :

<UL>
<LI>COST Action 70 which led to the setting up of the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts in Reading (UK);
<LI>COST Actions 50 and 501 which contributed to the development of advanced high-temperature materials for use in gas turbines and energy conversion systems;
<LI>development of electronic traffic aids on major roads (COST Action 30) and of shore-based marine navigational aid systems (COST Action 301);
<LI>the first concerted efforts in the field of environmental protection research (COST Actions 61, 64 and 68, followed-up in COST Actions 611, 641 and 681);
<LI>the development of future telecommunications and tele-informatics facilities for disabled people (COST Action 219).
<LI>COST Action B1 concerning the choice and definition of healthy volunteers and patients together with the role of metabolic and kinetic studies in drug development;
<LI>the study of vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizae in the circulation of matter in soil and in plant nutrition (COST Action 810)
<LI>COST Action 508 aiming for better knowledge of the various properties and the rheological behaviour of wood as well as the application of new technologies for wood industries.
<LI>COST Action A5 which studies the role of technology in increasing the participation of the elderly in society.
</UL>
In addition, a large number of COST Actions, especially in the fields of
informatics, telecommunications and materials have contributed to the
development of the Community's first major industry oriented programmes
such as ESPRIT, RACE, EURAM and BRITE and also to programmes in the
fields of environment, food technology and social science.<P>

<B>1.   SUMMARY</B><BR>
DDRE (Danish Defence Research Establishment) is the principal government laboratory performing research and development in support of Denmarks Chief of Defence and the Ministry of Defence.  It operates primarily as a consultancy, exercising program development responsibility in only selected cases.  The structure and responsibilities of the lab are outlined, and notable programs and contributions - including world class theoretical work in radar polarimetry, and an instrumentation grade high resolution radar - are described.  The lab is active in NATO and European programs particularly in C2 related programs dealing with aspects of data fusion.  This work is outlined.  <P>

<B>2.   ORGANIZATIONAL OVERVIEW</B><BR>
The DDRE is the principal government laboratory supporting the Chief of Defence and Army, Navy, and Air Force operational and materiel commands.  Located in Copenhagen, Denmark, the DDRE mission is to "satisfy the need of the Danish Defence for knowledge and advice based on technological and scientific competence".  DDRE is a small organization comprising approximately 100 people.  The lab Director is responsible directly to the Denmark Chief of Defence, and accountable for review and oversight purposes to the DDRB (Danish Defence Research Board) which is a 4 person panel made up of Technical University of Denmark professors.  The position of Director, recently vacant, will be filled as of September 1, 1996 by Dr.Scient. Peter Lawaetz, who is a former president of the Technical University of Denmark.  <P>

DDRE functions primarily as a consultant organization.  Only in selected cases does it have development responsibility for programs; in general it acts in an advisory role to the armed forces on issues of procurement, test, operational usage, and training.  The laboratory maintains expertise in technical areas viewed as being important to Danish military concerns.  DDRE participates in relevant NATO DRG (Defence Research Group) activities, including panels and RSGs (Research Study Groups), to stay abreast of technology trends and as one input to guide its determination of where best to apply R&D resources.  <P>

DDREs areas of concern include sensor systems and related countermeasures, technologies for target identification and stealth, command and control systems, computer assisted exercises, software engineering, and operations research.  The organization has three technical components: Sensor Department, Computer Science Department, and an Operations Research Department.  A brief summary of each:
<UL>
<LI>Sensor Department research areas include radar, electro-optics, acoustics, signal processing, and EW countermeasures.  
<LI>Computer Science research areas include command & control systems and architectures, and human computer interaction with emphasis on geographical information systems.  
<LI>Operations Research Department provides modeling and simulation in support of force level assessments and advice to military acquisition components. 
</UL> 

<B>3.  PROGRAMS</B><BR>
MRS (Modular Radar System) <BR>
MRS is a multipurpose experimental radar system designed to perform real time calibrated polarimetric measurements of target cross section and signature.  The radar is fully polarimetric, employs a 20 w. CW waveform, capable of being swept in frequency over the band 2 GHz to 18 GHz, and of measuring a 1 sq. m. target cross section at ranges up to 10 km with better than a 10 dB SNR in a 1 kHz bandwidth.  <P>

MRS was designed and built by the DDRE and a contractor (CRIMP A/S)  as an instrumentation grade radar for measurement of target signatures over a significant portion of the radar spectrum, and at any desired polarization.  Of significance is the calibrated RCS (radar cross section) measurement accuracy of ~0.5 dB, range resolution of 25cm, and the ability to measure target response at frequency pairs which are independently selectable over the operating band.  <P>

The radar achieves high resolution with a phase coded waveform and wide instantaneous bandwidth, thus enabling measurement capability not achievable with synthesized high resolution waveforms.  Complete parameters are available on request. <P> 

The radar has been employed by DDRE in a campaign to reduce the RCS of Danish ships, and to evaluate the effectiveness of deployed chaff.  Such measurements of dynamic phenomena requires high resolution in both range and time.  The system is mounted in a standard shipping container and thus is readily transportable.  <P>

Radar Polarimetry - <BR>
World class theoretical work on analysis of the radar scattering matrix and interpretation of phenomenology measurable using polarimetric techniques is performed at DDRE.  With increasing interest in the application of radar polarimetry to remote sensing for both military and environmental purposes (if indeed there is a difference) this work has large significance.  Among the extant decomposition theories for analyzing polarimetric responses is the so-called Krogager decomposition theory.  Ernst Krogager is a researcher at DDRE.  Krogager has developed a three component decomposition which applies to the coherent case and results in scattering components associated with a sphere, a diplane, and a helix.  Processing of imagery using this technique allows classification on a pixel by pixel basis, in terms of these three components, enabling interesting interpretation of the underlying structure.  <P>

Command & Control - <BR>
C2 developments are applied to each of the services in different ways as the CISs (Command Information Systems) for Army, Navy, and Air Force are not unified.  DDRE efforts in this area emphasize the application of techniques developed elsewhere to Danish environments.  Three levels of activity are addressed: C2 environments, including application of tools and standards; architectures, such as application of open system concepts in the development of DACCIS (Danish Army Command & Control Information System); and selected, specific functional developments such as data fusion.  <P>

The lab has two approaches to the development of data fusion technology.  Fusion of data from multiple diverse or distributed sources is addressed within the Computer Science Department, while fusion of data across commensurate data types or within a platform is addressed within the Sensor Department.  As an example of the former, DDRE is involved in the NATO DFD (Data Fusion Demonstrator) Project, and the EUCLID RTP 6.1 (EUropean Collaboration for the Long term In Defence - Research Technology Package) effort.  Fusion work fitting the latter category is DDREs contribution to NATO AC-243 / Panel 10 / RSG.18: Sensor Fusion for Short Range Air Defence (SHORAD). <P>

DFD  -  is a seven nation project within NATO AC-243 / Panel 3.  The project started in 1993 and is intended to demonstrate the feasibility of automating the process of formulating the enemy ground order of battle.  Its focus is artificial intelligence and knowledge based tools for fusion of all source message traffic.  The demonstrator is implemented in a simulation environment.  The Danish contribution is in a module called CAF - correlation, aggregation, fusion.<P>

EUCLID RTP 6.1  -  EUCLID is a collaborative military research program aimed at developing defence related technologies, under the WEU.  The program is designed to promote trans-national cooperation among companies.  RTP 6.1 involves seven nations and addresses the application of artificial intelligence techniques to C3I systems.  Danish work is focused on a generic workstation for command & control, with emphasis on automated message analysis and decision support for planning. <P>

RSG.18 (SHORAD)  -  is a newly initiated study group with the related objectives of showing that sensors can be used in land and sea battle environments in a more efficient way, to define the benefits, and to describe methods for realizing the benefits for short range air defence.  The Danish representative to RSG.18, Christian Birkemark, is its chairman.  <P>

<B>4.   ASSESSMENT</B><BR>
DDRE is a small organization providing scientific and technological advice and development capability to the Danish Defence structure.  It functions primarily in a consultant role, applying its research and development capability to carefully selected areas.  The organization maintains active involvement with NATO DRG activities, and leverages these for awareness of evolving technical issues and to derive at least part of its guidance for selection of areas of emphasis.  With some notable exceptions, the lab emphasizes the application of techniques developed elsewhere to Danish environments.  A new Director (Dr. Scient. Peter Lawaetz) has recently been appointed, if his background provides any indication, this may signal future support for increased emphasis on research, giving the lab a better balance with what appears to be its current trend toward system engineering.  The efforts of note are contributions to radar polarimetry (world class) and an instrumentation grade, high resolution radar (somewhat unique).  C2 work, particularly in the area of data fusion, is of interest but not ground-breaking.  The NATO DFD and EUCLID RTP 6.1 programs address somewhat similar issues from different perspectives and with different methodologies.  Of the two, the EUCLID effort appears to be the more promising. <P>

<B>1.   SUMMARY </B><BR>
The Electromagnetics Institute of the Technical University of Denmark conducts research and development in three main areas: remote sensing, optical communications, and antennas.  This newsletter provides an overview of research performed at EMI with emphasis on remote sensing activities performed under the Danish Center for Remote Sensing (DCRS) using Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) for earth observation.  The primary instrument for data collection is the EMISAR radar which operates at L- and C-bands, provides 2m best resolution, is fully polarimetric, and has interferometric modes of operation.  EMISAR is flown in a Danish Air Force Gulfstream G-3.  As a data collection resource EMISAR combines a number of advanced capabilities which make it a unique asset for geophysical measurements.  Characterization of topology, vegetation, and man-made objects can be performed in 3-dimensional spatial, velocity, and polarimetric fields.  Programs conducted to date have addressed glaciology, geology, vegetation, and various geophysical parameters. <P>

<B>2.  ELECTROMAGNETICS INSTITUTE (EMI) </B><BR>
The Electromagnetics Institute (EMI) is part of the EE Department of the Technical University of Denmark (TUD).  TUD is located just outside Copenhagen in Lyngby.  The Institute conducts research and development in three main areas: remote sensing, optical communications, and antennas (and EM field theory).  Research at the Institute is sponsored primarily by Danish government funding for civilian technology but EMI also receives support from private sources within Denmark and from other nations.  EMI is an active participant in a number of European research programs and collaborates with other universities and researchers for scientific analysis and experimental support.<P>  

EMI hosts two major national programs:  the Center for Broadband Telecommunications (CBT) is sponsored by the Danish Technical Research Council to perform research in optical communications, and the Danish Center for Remote Sensing (DCRS) is sponsored by the Danish National Research Foundation to address research in radar remote sensing.  In addition EMI hosts the Near field Antenna Test Facility which serves as a calibration facility for the European Space Agency (ESA)..<P>

<B>2.1  Optical Communications </B><BR>
Research activities pertaining to optical communications are organized under the Center for Broadband Telecommunications (CBT) and divided into four main areas: 
<UL>
<LI>Lasers and Optical Amplifiers - including use of fibre optics in microwave links and cellular mobile communication systems, photonic networks and switches, and optical components.  
<LI>Gigabit Electronics - including digital monolithic IC, MMIC and VLSI research.  
<LI>Optical Waveguides and Broadband Switches - including optical waveguide components, and active materials in waveguides.  
<LI>High Speed Systems - including optical front end amplifiers, optical CPFSK experiments, and investigations into non-linear effects in high speed switching.  
</UL>
Additional details or points of contact are available upon request. <P>

<B>2.2  Antennas</B><BR> 
Research on antennas and antenna measurements with emphasis on computational models for describing electromagnetic radiation as well as scattering phenomena.  Theoretical work in the area of near field methods has moved measurement capability beyond conventional frequency domain measurements, to the development of time domain methods which allow transformation of near field measurements to representation of far field radiation patterns for large bandwidths.  Applied work has resulted in design and implementation of airborne and space based antennas, and as noted, EMIs anechoic chamber (dimensions ~17m x 15m x 14m) provides precision calibration for the ESA.  <P>

<B>3.  REMOTE SENSING</B><BR> 
Remote sensing at EMI has a long history of addressing principles for observation of the earth using primarily radar and radiometric techniques.  Research areas include microwave sensors, collection methods, signal interpretation, and presentation techniques.  Since February 1994 research has been organized under the Danish Center for Remote Sensing (DCRS) which is financed by the Danish National Research Foundation, (50M DKK over a five year period; 5.5 DKK ~1 USD) and headed by Dr. Soren Madsen.   <P>

<B>3.1  Danish Center for Remote Sensing (DCRS) </B><BR>
DCRS was established to  "..conduct research relating to instruments for remote sensing and their application to Earth Observation and Earth Science."  Predecessor organizations at TUD have a long history of environmental measurements at various locations throughout the world.  Programs conducted by DCRS to date have addressed glaciology, geology, vegetation, and earth parameters.  The Centers primary instrument for data collection is EMISAR (Electromagnetics Institute SAR). <P>

<B>3.1.1  EMISAR</B><BR>
The EMISAR system is a dual band (L- and C-band) polarimetric SAR with interferometric capabilities which allow generation of 3-dimensional and velocity imagery.  It is capable of repeat track interferometry (RTI) in both bands and cross track interferometry (XTI) in C-band only.  EMISAR is installed an a Danish Air Force Gulfstream G-3 aircraft, it operates at altitudes up to 12 km, and in its high resolution mode has a 12 km swath width and 2m x 2m spatial resolution.  The system has on-board real-time processing and display for a selected mode of data, and high density recording of all data for post flight processing and display.  The aircraft is equipped with GPS and INS navigation systems.  In order to meet stringent data collection requirements, DCRS has designed a novel control system which couples navigation, radar, and aircraft flight management systems to enable the aircraft to fly desired baselines to an accuracy on the order of 10m or less. <P>

The diversity of EMISARs modes make it a powerful instrument for data collection.  Polarimetric data provides robust characterization of topographic features, vegetation, and man-made objects.  While full understanding of scattering responses as a function of different scattering matrix decomposition methods is still being developed, polarization based imagery clearly enables discrimination among different surface features such as changes in vegetation state and recognition of geometric shapes and attitudes. <P> 

RTI allows highly accurate topographic mapping, change detection, and measurement of dynamic phenomena such as movement of glaciers and earthquakes.  The method is based on collection of image pairs from consecutive flight passes and has potential for achieving 10cm height resolution.  XTI enables accurate 3-dimensional measurement of an objects location.  Because image pairs are collected simultaneously, height determination of moving objects is possible.  The method requires that an image pair be collected simultaneously from two antennas displaced in height on the same platform.  The difference in elevation angle between simultaneous observations is used to derive the height dimension in a 3-D SAR image.  <P>

The EMISAR may be unique in providing this combination of measurement capabilities.  While a few other systems (very few) are known to possess some of these advanced features, the flexibility offered by EMISAR for geophysical experiments is believed to be unique.  <P>

<B>3.1.2  Collection Programs</B><BR> 
EMISAR has been employed in a number of flight campaigns to explore the uses of SAR technology  features of the system for improved understanding of geophysical properties.  In many cases these studies are coordinated with other European programs, sharing assets for experiments and data for collaborative analysis and interpretation.  Some of these programs are listed below.  <P>

GLACIER DYNAMICS STUDIES - Storstrommen Glacier, Northeast Greenland; use of SAR RTI to provide spatial measurements of instantaneous ice velocity and micro-topography.  Significant for monitoring changes in glacier size, surface elevations, and velocities, believed to be indicators of global climate change.  <P>

SEA ICE STUDIES - ice monitoring in South Greenland waters to develop an understanding of the microwave signatures of ice surfaces as a function of their physical properties.  Analysis is based on  C-band polarimetry supported by microwave radiometry and video.  <P>

GEOLOGY - a geologic survey of a selected area in Eastern Greenland to determine if polarimetric SAR or interferometric SAR techniques can be applied to study the relation between terrain morphology, geologic structures and the physical properties of mountain complexes.  <P>

SOIL AND PLANT STUDIES - Foulum, Jutand;  research concerning the application of remote sensing techniques to monitor agricultural crops, biomass, hydrology, soil moisture and surface roughness.  <P> 

SAND DUNE DYNAMICS - Rabjerg Mile dune field, Jutland;
research on atmospheric circulation, and effects of friction with the earths surface by estimation of soil removal, dust generation, loss of nutrients and seeds, etc. from detailed topographic information.  Precise topography is derived from repeated measurements of the same area using interferometric SAR techniques.   <P>

<B>4.   ASSESSMENT</B><BR>
DCRS must be rated as a world leader in technology relating to instruments for remote sensing and their application to earth observation.  As noted, EMISAR represents a unique measurement capability.  The diversity of measurements possible from simultaneous modes, and the relative ease with which independent measurements can be made to either verify results, or separate correlated effects, make it a valuable measurement instrument.  DCRS emphasizes applied research, focusing on sensing technology, measurement techniques, and visualization methods, while collaborating extensively with others for scientific analysis and interpretation.  The focus of DCRS research is on civilian applications, but the work it has conducted in remote sensing clearly has implications for military systems, addressing the need to understand details of the environment to be encountered by both friendly and hostile forces, and also for specific requirements such as foliage penetration, and target detection and classification.  .<P>

<P><B> 1. Summary</B><P></P>A spaced based multispectral imaging
system has been developed in Germany by Daimler-Benz Aerospace, now
Dornier GmbH Satellitensysteme. The sensor system is now in its third
generation development called MOMS 03. Forerunners, MOMS 01 and MOMS 02
space qualified on SPAS 01, missions STS-7 and STS 11 and US Space
Shuttle Mission 55, respectively. A version of MOMS 02 is part of the
ongoing MIR Priroda project. MOMS 03 is a tri-partite imaging system
combining a high spatial resolution panchromatic imaging capability with
two channel stereoscopic alongtrack panchromatic imaging and a 4 channel
multispectral imaging unit. Talks are on-going for possible inclusion of
a follow on version of a NRL Clementine class, small satellite, under
the auspices of the Navy Space Science & Technology Council. </P><P><B>2.
MOMS 03 Imaging System</B><P></P>The MOMS 03 characteristics include a
published 5 meter Ground Sampling Distance (GSD) for the high Resolution
Panchromatic Imaging Equipment on a 500 km orbit. Dornier felt that
further improvements might be possible. The stereo alongtrack capability
was 10 meter GSD and the multispectral 4 channel section produced a 15
meter GSD. Under these conditions all three subsystems exhibit a 60 km
swath and a Field of Regard of 645 km. The single panchromatic and the
stereo channels are both 530-760 nm. The 4 spectral channels cover the
bands of 440-505, 530-575, 645-680 and 770-810 nanometers.<BR>  The

and the product called EarthMap will eventually be on the market. The
system shows promise for both government and commercial uses once space
qualified. Space qualifying hardware that will be needed for future
naval warfighting requirements is one of the objectives of the Navys
new Space Council under Admiral Peleaz, as Chair. The Council is new,
having stood up in June, but is off to an ambitious start. While no
projects have been approved or funded as yet, one of the considerations
is a Small Satellite of the Clementine class to be a technology
demonstrator platform. Preliminary plans include a series of small
satellites of this variety to be launched on a three year replacement
cycle. It is hoped that the development and launch of this series will
be joint projects under either Memorandum of Understanding or Bilateral
Agreements with our Allies. Talks are on-going with the Germans about
the possibility of space qualifying MOMS 03 on a remote sensing version
of the new Clementines. </P><P><B>3. Personal Contacts</B><P></P>MOMS

<P><B>1. Summary</B></P><P>A space based stellar compass has been
developed in Denmark at the Technical University of Denmark under the
guidance of John Leif Joergensen. An early version of the stellar
compass is scheduled to fly as part of the &Ouml;rsted project on board
a Danish microsatellite, with mission requirements to determine the
magnetic vector accuracy to at least 3 nT and 20 arcseconds with a
scalar accuracy of at least 1 nT. The advanced stellar compass is
comprised of two separate units, a CCD detector (based on a commercial
Sony interline CCD detector) and data processing unit with a 486
processor. The camera head derives attitude information from star
recognition in its field of view, using a star catalog of 10,000 plus
stars. Prototype testing at the Jet Propulsion laboratory Table mountain
Observatory has been recently completed. This Stellar Compass represents
an advance in the art of star trackers with a low mass, low power
consumption and fully autonomous operation providing a high accuracy
quaternion output and low cost implementation. Talks are on-going for
possible space testing on a follow on version of a Naval Research Lab
Clementine class, small satellite, under the auspices of the Navy
Space Science & Technology Council. </P><P><B>2. &Ouml;rsted Advanced
Stellar Compass</B></P><P>The &Ouml;rsted microsatellite payload
consists of a vector fluxgate magnetometer, an Overhauser scalar
magnetometer, an advanced stellar compass (2), six charged particle
detectors and GPS backup receivers. An eight meter deployable boom
carries the two magnetic-field measuring instruments and the stellar
compass. The boom isolates the instruments from the perturbing magnetic
field generated by the spacecraft. The spacecraft attitude control is by
gravity gradient stabilization, supplemented by active magnetic-torguer
coils. The position is determined by the GPS receivers. The overall mass
of the space craft is 64.4 Kg with a 45 cm width, a 68 cm height and a
depth of 45 cm. It is to be launched on a polar orbit, 450 X 850 km.
</P><P>The stellar compass has been evaluated with real sky images at
JPLs Table Mountain. It was mounted on the front of a 24 inch telescope
with a fairy long interconnection, causing a small degradation in
performance due to noise. The testing was primarily to determine the
noise equivalent angle of the system. The measured relative accuracy was
5.7 arcseconds (3s (sigma)) for each of two axes, 42 arcseconds for roll
angle about the boresight and an NEA of 3.22(3s(sigma)) for each of two
axes. Flight versions of the stellar compass are expected to exhibit
increased accuracy. It is believed that modifications to the optics and
processor would allow cost effective radiation hardening to adapt to
more stressful orbits. For full testing data please contact Allen R.
Eisenman, Jet Propulsion Lab, below. </P><P>The stellar compass shows
promise for both government and commercial use. Space qualifying
hardware that will be needed for future warfighting requirements is one
of the objectives of the Navys Space Science and Technology Council
under Admiral Peleaz, as chair. While no projects have been fully
approved or funded as yet, one of the Councils considerations is a
Small Satellite of the Clementine class to be a remote sensing
technology demonstrator platform. Preliminary plans are for the
Clementine Remote Sensing Spacecraft to be the first of a series,
launched on a three year replacement schedule beginning in 1999. It is
hoped that the development and launch of this series will be a joint
project under agreements with many of our allies. Plans are solidifying
with the Germans about the possibility of flying a multi-spectral
imagining system called MOMS 03. .<I>See</I>, Newsletter Number One on

<P><B>Executive Summary</B>
</P><P> The Annual Conference on European Defense Industrial Policy was
presented by Euromanagement, a training firm, and Jane's Defence
Magazines. The theme of the conference was in the nature of a wake-up
call for European Governments to guard their Defense Industry Technology
Base from a leaner, meaner American arms export market. Figures were
soft but alarming. The American post cold war share of total world arms
exports has doubled from 25 percent in 1990 to 51 percent in 1995. The
widely shared fear is that the USA will go from the main supplier of
world arms to the only supplier. Since the Cold War, Europe imported 18
b USD in arms, 16 from the United States, which meant Europe bought
eight times more from America than from Europe itself. American
procurement policy was described as subsidized, protectionist,
monopolistic and colbertist. Speakers, all well known defense experts,
articulated a belief in free markets and 'best value for money,' while
advocating policies that would skew the procurement towards national
European champions. The strong American position was seen as the result
of currency, protectionist policy, industrial rationalization and the
Gulf War 'infomercial'. The speakers did not see transatlantic mergers
and acquisitions likely, were unhappy with subcontractor status and
advocated a 'Fortress Europe' defense industry policy. Conclusion:
American defense industry should expect a more difficult European
playing field in the coming decade.
</P><P><B>Introduction and General Impressions</B>
</P><P> The Second Annual International Conference on Reshaping
Business Strategies in the European Defence Industry was held in
Amsterdam on January 25 & 26, 1996. The conference was organized by
Euromanagement, a training firm and Jane's Defence Magazines. The
speakers were well-known global defense experts including government
policy makers, industrialists, journalists and trade union leaders.
Government speakers covered the spectrum from liberal United Kingdom to
nationalistic France. All Governments see the need to both rationalize
their national defense industry and foster cross border European mergers
and acquisitions. All representatives from Europe professed to believe
in the free market and in best value for money in procurement.
</P><P> The constituent Nations were reading from separate scripts,
though, when it came to advocated policy. Even liberal United Kingdom
acknowledged that best value for money did not necessarily mean free and
open competition, as we think of the term in our procurement policy.
France, nationalistic as ever, stood on the left side of the spectrum,
advocating rigid control on import/exports and close government control
over all rationalization, but especially cross border mergers and
acquisitions. Germany, looking both at the rest of Europe and
transatlantic, felt that Europe could consolidate and rationalize along
American lines and welcomed collaboration with enthusiasm. A surprise
player on the world armament stage is Sweden, shedding their pacific
anti-military bias, and speaking of European consolidation and cross
border mergers with both their European brothers and transatlantic
partners. Egon Lindroth, President & CEO of Celsius Industries, used his
own company to underline the Swedish effort at defense industry
rationalization and hinted at two possible cross border mergers not yet
made public. It was obvious to me that Sweden intends to play a bigger
part in European defense now that they are a full member of the EU.
</P><P> The tone of the conference was not hostile towards the
Americans, but we were clearly the target. There was scarcely a speaker
that did not have a slide that highlighted our doubling of world market
share in the last five years. Lockheed/Martin generated a lot of
interest with one slide depicting the possibility of a medium-sized
country going to this single American company for all their defense
needs. Another slide was captioned, 'Lockheed/Loral, Gunning for
European Defense Jobs'. It was acknowledged that we were reaping
benefits from downsizing and consolidation, but the primary emphasis was
on our post cold war defense policy, seen as nationalistic by the
European nations. One futuristic slide showed the European defense
industry, first going to monopolistic national segment champions, then
to subcontractor status with America industry, and finally, out of
existence. One French speaker estimates the United States will command a
75 percent share of the world market in defense technology by 2005.
</P><P> In spite of this 'the sky is falling' ambiance, the attendees
seemed gloomy about obtaining the Pan-European consolidation and
rationalization necessary to compete with the brash, new American
defense industry. Only Germany seemed to think that Europe could
overcome the nationalist tendencies enough to consolidate into a truly
European industry. The German optimism may be attendant to the planned
Daimler-Benz/Areospatiale merger; an enthusiasm not shared by the other
nationalities. In response to a question from the floor as to when was
it too late to take the actions necessary to correct the imbalance,
Francois Heisbourg, Senior-Vice-President, Strategic Development, Matra
Defense Espace, replied, "...last year, ...there are many of us dead
now, we just don't know it yet."
</P><P><B>The Players</B>
</P><P> The United Kingdom has led the way with privatization and
mergers, and consequently, is viewed as the most liberal of the Western
European Nations. The result is a 30 percent loss of defense jobs and
export dollars, but United Kingdom defense experts feel that the United
Kingdom is poised to capitalize on this recent rationalization. BAe
(third) and GEC (ninth) are two of the three European defense companies
in the world's top ten by revenue. The United Kingdom, in contrast to
the Continent, believe themselves ready for both cross-border and
transatlantic alliances.
</P><P> French defense industry is in disarray. Giat (tanks and guns)
and Direction des Constructions Navales (ships), are grossly overmanned,
losing money and not ready for cross border arrangements. Nor is the
nationalistic French Government ready to liberalize enough to
rationalize even within its own borders, let alone cross border. Trade
unions, falling markets, overmanning and a virulent protectionist
attitude do not bode well for building national champions available for
cross border alliances. The French, with a minority voice, support the
Treaty of Rome's article 223 which allows governments to protect defense
firms from EU rules. It is this author's opinion, after hearing the
French rhetoric, that France will be one of the barriers to a
Pan-European defense rationalization. Questions from the floor indicated
Germany and the United Kingdom think this too.
</P><P> Germany has started the rationalization process. R & D is down
thirty percent the last five years, defense jobs down fifty percent and
the exchange rates painful. Germany expects to lead the way toward a
European defense industry. Daimler Benz is looking at an alliance with
French Aerospatiale whereby Germany would own fifty-one percent of the
resultant firm. We will see! The German speakers articulated a free
market policy and underscored the need for creating a unified European
defense industry, but acknowledged a need for transatlantic alliances
during the process. Never-the-less, all German speakers indicated that
reciprocity in defense procurement policy with the Americans was
required to help balance the playing field.
</P><P> Sweden was surprisingly enthusiastic about building a European
defense industry to provide a larger share of Europe's defense needs.
They took a vocal opposition to the Treaty of Rome's article 223 and
hinted at two cross border mergers in the works for Celsius Industries
(Bofors, Klockums, electronics and aerospace). Early rationalizations
have made Sweden more competitive on international markets, both
financially and technically. They are serious about contributing to a
European Defense Industry in the future and should be a much larger
player across the Atlantic during the next decade, as well.
</P><P> The trade unions from United Kingdom, France and elsewhere
naturally were against any rationalization that meant a loss of jobs,
which negates the process. They spoke of supporting the 'best value for
money' concept of procurement but wanted a figure added to all external
bids to compensate for the loss of work to the national industries.
Where were we to get this figure? The trade unions will supply it, of
course!
</P><P><B>An Asian Aside</B>
</P><P> Paul Beaver, a consultant with Jane's, presented an area
analysis of the Asian market. This is the only area in the world where
defense industry markets are growing. From Pakistan to Japan, North
Korea to New Guinea, the region has conflict, tension and turmoil. The
Indian/ Pakistan dispute is the world's only nuclear arms race at the
moment. China's bid to increase its territorial waters has driven
defense markets in Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore and Brunei. (There
were five delegates at this conference from Brunei MOD, out of
approximately 80 attendees???) Indonesia has internal problems with East
Timor, Sumatra and Irian Jaya. Japan remains concerned with an unstable
Russia and North Korea. Western arms spending targeted for these areas
has risen and the trend will continue well into the next century. In
Paul Beaver's words, "Asia is the place to be and be seen in the late
1990's."
</P><P><B>Conclusion</B>
</P><P> This conference was a wake up call for European defense
industries to drop their nationalistic policies and rationalize towards
a competitive position viz. a viz. American industry or prepare
themselves for extinction. All speakers and attendees acknowledged the
need for Europe's national defense industries to cut costs and shed
jobs, to get into a position where national champions can be established
in segments and then industries. The United States was both the target
and the road map to follow out of current difficulties. The speakers
took care not to disparage their transatlantic alliances, but it was
clear that all players intend to reduce the arms purchased from the USA.
Everyone agrees that the American market is protected and an uneven
playing field. While there were at least three different scripts on how
to build a Pan-European defense industry, no one advocated a free
market, as no one thought that Europe could compete in the short term
with the newly lean and mean American defense industry. We heard support
for subsidies, licensing, fudge factors to skew the procurements and
just plain protection, but no Adam Smith, at least not in the short run.
Lockheed Martin was a lightning rod and it is a shame that the one
American Speaker, John Montague, Vice-President Financial Strategies,
Lockheed Martin, flew in at the last minute. He gave his speech in a
vacuum and left without confronting the 'Fortress Europe' mentality
extant at this conference. I would expect the European market to be a
more difficult playing field for American defense industry in the
future.

<B>Executive Summary</B><P>

The European Commission has adopted new regulations for Technology Transfer, Mergers and Acquisitions, and cross border Research and Development within the Union.  These new Commission Regulations (EC No 240/96 et seg.), came into effect on 1 April of this year. The new regulations replaced patent licensing and know-how regulations, rolling both into a new technology transfer regulation.<BR>
These regulations apply whenever technology moves into the EU or crosses borders within the Union.  The definition of technology is broad, and the regulations apply to any agreement that involves intellectual property, technical data, trade secrets, licensable manufacturing technology or technical data. The intent of the restrictions is to preclude monopoly and ensure the dissemination of technology widely throughout the Union.
The regulations have certain common features:  they are for defined periods; they contain a defined list of permitted restrictions ("white list")and proscribed restrictions ("black list"); they incorporate an opposition procedure; and they entitle the Commission to withdraw the benefit of granted exemptions under certain circumstances.<BR>
The Commission provided within these regulations provisions for granting block exemptions, in certain areas, for agreements meeting the criteria specified in the relevant exemption.  An agreement either meets the exacting requirements of a block exemption or must be presented to the Commission under a notice provision.  Without a block exemption the notice process is lengthy and requires onerous data to be submitted, and the agreement is likely to be turned down by the commission for the same reasons that it did not fit within a block exemption.  The block exemptions generally do not allow a transferor long term control over their intellectual property,  and permissable controls are fraught with over regulation.  The penalty for failure to obtain Commission approval is invalidity of the agreement and the loss of the National or European Courts as a means to enforce it.<BR>
 A separate provision, article 223 of the Treaty of Rome, exempts defense industry agreements as exclusively within the sovereignty of individual nations and, at this point in time, makes these new regulations a "who cares" for the defense community.  Article 223 is broadly interpreted by Nation States and narrowly by the Commission.  More importantly, the article is under attack as an impediment to European Defense Industry rationalization by many States, e.g., Sweden, U K, and Germany. If  the Defense Community losses 223 as a shield, these regulations will become a concern in the future.<P>

<B>The New Regulations</B><P>

Article 1 sets out a list of obligations that may be included in a licensing agreement and which will not be regarded as restrictive of competition.  The block exemption procedures only apply when there are no more than two parties to the agreement.  With multi-party agreements the notice requirements and full scrutiny by the Commission is required. An agreement that does not fit the rigid requirements of a block exemption and that has not been submitted to the Commission under the Notice Procedures is invalid.  If the agreement involved a patent or patents, the patents would not be enforceable in the National or European courts.  It is important to note that these procedures apply to all Nations doing business within the European Union not just to agreements between Member States.<P>

	The restrictions white listed  in Article 2 are those normal and requisite to a technology transfer agreement and generally do not allow the full exploitation of the  patent or other intellectual property.  The white list has grown from what was contained in the previous regulations but is Milque Toast when it comes to vigorous exploitation of intellectual property rights.  The regulations normally limit protections to less than ten years.  A patent theoretically has up to a 20 year life and trade secrets forever.<P>

	Article 3 is the black list of restrictions that, when incorporated, always cause the agreement to fail.  It includes the familiar prohibition on restrictions on pricing and barriers to parallel imports.  For example, a United States company that markets a product world wide and restricts domestic licensees to U S markets, without allowing exports, may run afoul of the Commission as restrictive of European competition and find their agreement unenforceable on this side of the Atlantic. Other black listed restrictions are automatic term extensions, royalties beyond the life of the patent, tying-in of other licenses, customer division and many more.<P>

	Article 4 contains the opposition procedures that allow challenges.  Your licensee might take a license knowing it to be outside the exemptions and then later challenge the agreement.  Actually, this is a carryover provision from the old rules and has been rarely used.  Article 7 gives the Commission the authority to remove the benefit of a block agreement if they decide that it violates the exemption conditions.  Other articles are definitional and technical.<P>

	Finally, the benefit of a block exemption is denied when market share under the agreement is above 40 percent of the relevant market, which might be the European  Union or the World.  Small companies have to watch out for a small agreement with an industry giant that might exceed the market share test of the combination, resulting in invalidity and unenforceability of the agreement transferring technology.<P>

<B>R & D  Block Exemption</B><P>

	Commission Regulation 418/85 of 19 December 1984 continues to provide for a block exemption for agreements between two parties, where the sole purpose of the agreement is R & D.  Use of this provision requires the agreement to cover an identified R & D project, to give all parties access to and the right to exploit all results.  The agreement must be restricted to intellectual property rights and/or substantial know how.  There are numerous restrictions concerning products and market share of any developed product.  The agreement can cover no more than a 5 year period; renewable once under certain circumstances. There are mandatory requirements for the exchange of information regarding exploitation and granting of non-exclusive licenses regarding improvements of products.  There can be no restrictions regarding production, distribution and marketing other than those contained in the "white list" of the regulations.  It goes on and on.<P>
	
	Delegates at this conference, most of whom are competition or patent attorneys working in this field, indicated they have never seen a real agreement that could use the R&D Block exemption.  The reasons are many, for example, the time constraints mean that the agreement terminates before the intellectual property protection expires and the restrictions on controlling the product of the R&D are simply not adequate for companies to protect their markets.  Mergers and acquisitions can change the market share during the agreement and void the contract protections.  The R&D block exemption is a good idea but still needs a lot of work.<P>

<B>Perceptions</B><P>

	These new regulations suffer from too many cooks.  There are simply too many lawyers, bureaucrats, lawyers, commissioners and lawyers for coherent regulations.  The technical sections stretch on for an interminable length reflecting the many opinions and languages involved.  The operative articles are intertwined with 27 recitals leading up to article 1, and they, too, present binding conditions and proscriptions.  The starting position is that everything is proscribed and that you have to find an exemption for anything one wishes to do.  If you can not make the agreement fit the odd-shaped pigeon hole the agreement fails.  There is no rule of reason such as permeates US anti-trust law and the regulations are stiff and formal.   Worse, there is no history of case law providing a road map for guidance.  It is impossible to cover the multiplicity of business relationships with a list of do's and don'ts that cover the spectrum of agreements or even a single agreement, for that matter.  The seminar, attended mostly by patent attorneys laboring under the incoherence of a legal education superimposed over the exactness of an engineer, soon degenerated into techno-babble when trying to decide what one could or could not do.  Remember, these new regulations come from the same group that gave us the exacting size and curvature of an acceptable banana and a European strawberry!<P>

	The new regulations contain a provision asking those doing business subsequent to implementation, to serve notice to the Commission as to what, and how many, agreements they have entered into in the past that violated the now-superseded, old regulations.  This is like asking a person "when did you stop beating your wife?"  Not surprisingly, the attorneys are advising their clients not to comply with this precatory requirement.<P>

<B>So Who Cares</B><P>

	Not very many, at least, not in the defense community and not yet.  The treaty of Rome contains article 223 that exempts all military and defense activity from Commission regulations.  A couple of caveats are appropriate however, and the first is that article 223 is under attack and several European Union Members advocate eliminating this fence which gives members room to protect their industry under the guise of national sovereignty.  More than one of the speakers at a recent European defense conference cited the provision as an impediment to developing a pan-european defense policy and advocated its rescission.  Europe is concerned with rationalizing defense policy in order to compete with the post cold war competition across the Atlantic.  They see this as one of the beginning steps.  (See, newsletter 002-1996 by this author.)  Without article 223, the defense community would be subject to these regulations.<P>

	Second, while many member states interpret the 223 exemption broadly, the Commission does not.  It is my opinion that 223 will endure but that the Commission will chip away at its breadth.  It is likely that government to government agreements, e.g., MOU's  between DOD and allied MOD's will remain outside the Commission purview, but agreements that embody dual use products might find the Commission ready to sever the agreement and examine the transfer for its commercial impact.  The European court did this very thing a few years ago when they bifurcated an agreement concerning aircraft engines into military and civilian markets, then held the agreement void and unenforceable as an agreement splitting customers between distributors.  Non-defense U S industry takes the Commission seriously now and defense may be forced to in the future.<P>

<B>Executive Summary</B><P>

The First Annual Space Technology Consortium Symposium convened in Crystal 
City, Virginia on 14 May 1996, with opening remarks by VADM William Ramsey, 
USN RET.  The theme of the symposium was to formulate a national and 
domestic approach to space through smarter make or buy decisions and new 
alliances. It was a Navy organized effort, but all the alphabet soup of 
space was represented;  DOD, Services, NASA, BMDO, DARPA, NRO, NOAA, even 
the White House and Congress, played their part in the activities.  The 
theme was governmental / industry partnerships, teaming, interagency 
cooperation, off-the-shelf acquisition and international collaboration. 
 Budgets drove the participants and will continue to be the driving force in 
space development for the foreseeable future.  What these spacemen want is 
cheaper cost to orbit, more bandwidth and ways to leverage shrinking budgets 
while faced with escalating costs.  There may be a lot of shotgun marriages 
in this group, but everyone is saying their vows and singing from the same 
song book for now.  Space has become too expensive for any single agency, or 
even any single nation, to go it alone.<P>

<B>What, Where, When and Why</B><P>

The Space Technology Symposium, 14-16 May 1996, was organized by the Office 
of Naval Research through private conference support.  Captain Patrick 
O'connell, Secretary of the Navy Space Science and Technology Council and 
Head of the Office of Naval Research Special Programs Department, put 
together a comprehensive conference.  The Speaker roster and attendees 
comprised a 'who's who' listing of national space.  It was a Navy show; 
 consequently there were more Navy stars in the sky than one normally sees 
when looking into space, but it was by no means limited to Navy interests. 
 All the players were represented, including not only Defense and the 
Services, but BMDO, NOAA, NASA, NRO, DARPA, the White House and Congress. 
 The Defense Under Secretary (space) and the National Space Architect, both 
new positions, were participating as speakers and panel moderators.<BR>
     The theme of the conference was Forging New Alliances for Space 
Technology and the program stayed on track.  Smarter make or buy decision 
provided an undercurrent for the conference goals and smarter make or buy 
decisions reduce to national teaming arrangements, government / industry 
partnerships, international collaborative programs and more off-the-shelf 
space hardware.  In a nut shell, those topics dominated the three day 
conference.  Each afternoon provided a panel discussion in the area of 
future technology thrusts, domestic partnerships and international 
cooperation.<BR>
     The Crystal Gateway Marriot was a delightful setting, the conference 
well orchestrated and the program incisively targeted to the theme.  Not 
only the speakers and panelists, but the 240 attendees, kept their minds 
fixed on the conference goals without letting the space techno-bable take 
over, as it often does in high technology conferences.  That will follow, of 
course, with a series of narrowly targeted workshops, invited and staffed 
from the conference attendee list.  The bottom line, and this conference was 
first and foremost concerned with the bottom line, is that conference goals 
were met.<P>

<B>Kaminski Perspective</B><P>

     Donald Stein from OSD International Programs Office spoke on the 
viewpoint of the Under Secretary of Defense ( acquisitions and technology), 
Paul Kaminski.  ---- There is a renaissance in arms cooperation throughout 
the free world.  Defense budgets are down, joint operations and coalition 
agreements up.  We need jointness and teamwork for inter-operability and to 
strengthen relationships, as well as to leverage technology and research 
dollars.  Defense initiatives contributing to the renaissance include 
acquisition reform, switching to ISO standards versus Mil Specs,  reforming 
the International MOU process, supporting more NATO Cooperative R & D, and 
buying off the shelf from our Allies.  An Armaments Cooperation Steering 
Committee has been established, as have International Cooperative 
Opportunity Groups (ICOGs) to guide joint endeavors with our Allies.  The 
ODC network is an essential input into this process and moving the ODCs from 
their position under the CinCs to Kraminski is a possibility.  All 
international cooperation is under Don Stein and he is the policy point, 
while implementation will fall under the military departments.<P>

<B>The Speakers</B><P>

          <I>Lionel Johns, Associate Director of the Executive Office of the
          President of the United States, Office of Science and Technology 
Policy.</I><P>

     The OSTP supports space development, in part, through the "Reinventing 
Government" approach that incorporates reliance between agencies, 
particularly DOD and NASA.  NASA has been restructured, NSA now shares data 
with EPA, and International cooperative projects are growing and critical to 
success.  Space development is too expensive to go it alone; we need 
industry / government teaming, more dual use projects and international 
collaboration. The United States enjoys 85 percent of the satellite and 
space communication systems but only 15 percent of the world's launch 
capabilities.  The OSTP estimates a 60 million USD annual savings from the 
DOD/ NASA reliance and upwards of 1.3 billion USD savings from 
standardization of satellite systems.  We and the world need cheaper access 
to space and we need a space transportation policy.<BR>
     Speaking of which, what about the Presidential Directive on National 
Space Policy?  Well, the process is difficult, differences between the 
Defense and Intelligence communities are extant and we are still digesting 
the changes of the post cold war environment.  Ummm, sounds just like last 
year.<P>

          <I>Robert Davis, Deputy Under Secretary of Defense, (space)</I><P>

     The office is new but Bob Davis is an old spaceman.  His new office is 
now up and operating.  A DOD initiative under DR Anita Jones, DDR&E, has 
done a great job of managing resources and building alliances across the 
Defense Agencies. Defense has several immediate goals in space that include 
enhanced spacecraft power, thermal management, data fusion, spacecraft 
structures and inertial guidance.  Continued collaboration with NASA is a 
must and critical to this nation's space program, especially in areas such 
as propulsion. Mr. Davis felt we were not bold enough in our propulsion 
industry and challenged the industry to march bravely into the future.  He 
felt this is the 'key' to space and one where the U S has only 30 percent of 
the world market.  The world has developed 28 new rocket engines in the last 
20 years and only one was ours.  He wants a Reusable Launch Vehicle (RLV) 
with a single stage to orbit and he wants the national propulsion industry 
to "quit resting on its laurels" and provide it.<P>

          <I>The Services -- Three and Four Star Flags from Army, Navy,
          Air Force, Marine Corps, BMDO</I><P>

     These warfighters want what most everyone else wants in space; cheaper 
access and more bandwidth.  All services consider space systems as not only 
desirable but required to win any major regional conflict.  The collective 
wish list spans the spectrum of space technology but C4I to the individual 
warfighter heads the list.  VADM Paul Reason (4 star select), when ask to 
prioritize the Navy's three main needs in space, replied, "bandwidth, 
bandwidth, bandwidth."  How bad is the problem?  Pretty bad.  The Navy is 
investigating the possibility of spooling fiber optic cables behind our 
ships!   All our warfighters agree that the cost of space is too high, that 
jointness is the key to bringing national costs down and that governments 
must continue R&D funding as industry will not, at least in the military 
arena.  Littoral warfare, shallow water and general ocean surveillance are, 
not surprisingly, high on the Marine Corps - Navy list.  Finally, the space 
development side of the house needs more explicit guidance from the CinCs, 
if the needed future space systems are to be available for acquisition next 
millennium.  Space costs too much, especially space transportation, but the 
good news is that space is the only area of the defense budget that is still 
increasing.<P>

          <I>Gill Klinger, Principal Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (space)</I><P>

     The warfighters care not a wit what happens at Phillips Lab or NRL. 
 Research has to develop the systems and sell them to the warfighters on 
their merits.  While the space budgets, both classified and unclassified, 
are holding their own, R & D is not.  Cryptology is a problem but that is a 
policy issue and must be solved within that purview.  Yes, systems built 
multilaterally cost more, but you get a system you can not afford to build 
yourself for a price you can.  We have a mandate from the highest levels of 
DOD to pursue international cooperation and, while we need a coherent policy 
for space based R & D, we know we need alliance development in the following 
six areas:  Communications, launch capabilities, propulsion Systems, 
environmental monitoring, early warning and Recon/surveillance. 
 International cooperation in space is not a cold war blip; there are 46 
countries engaged in space and 17 with launch capabilities.<P>

          <I>Congressman Bob Walker</I><P>

The Honorable Bob Walker, somewhat subdued from the Special Order days of 
railing at the empty House along with his then minority friends Newt 
Gingrich and Vin Webber, can still capture an audience.  Congress thinks 
that industry is only contributing to the national space programs in the 
communications arena and not doing enough outside.  Those of us inside 
government need to encourage commercial development of space, not fight it. 
 Congress expects results from our developing national space program and 
will not accept monuments again.  We need to balance and coordinate between 
agencies, stop the turf battles, stop punishing success, overcome 
bureaucracy and look at new innovation.  Do we need more symposia?  We know 
what we need; reduced cost to space.  Congressman Walker believes the joint 
space station to be the unique lab in human history.  He envisions an 
industrial park with clusters of commercial 'free flyers,' tethered through 
an umbilical to the lab for power and services, but on an industrial frolic 
of their own.  He also believes small satellites are the way to reduce costs 
in the near future,  then noted that NASA 'Mission to Planet Earth' was 
fighting the concept.  In a spirited outburst reminiscent of the old 'Mad 
Dog' Walker, he scolded the Defense Department for starting the tech demo on 
a Reusable Launch Vehicle, then abandoning it to NASA.  In like spirit, Bob 
quoted a famous Pennsylvanian, Mario Andrettti, "If you are in control, you 
aren't going fast enough!"<P>
     
<B>Perceptions</B><P>

     From a layman's point of view it was one of the better conferences.  It 
was represented by most all of the bright stars within our national space 
program and everyone was in the same room singing from the same song book. 
 Even the services and space surveillance were talking of joint projects, 
teaming and interagency cooperation.  Do not misunderstand me.  These people 
are not suddenly struck with an urge to share their hard fought for turf, 
but are driven by decreasing budgets and the ever increasing cost of space 
systems and transportation.  If there were any peacemakers here, it was the 
comptrollers.  Leveraging budgets, sharing R & D, buying off the shelf, 
collaboration and partnerships are all driven by the preclusive cost of 
space.  These pundits were not the dreamers of yester year but the engineers 
and managers that use space for a purpose.  It may be warfighting, 
environmental, communications or space industry, but it is not man's search 
for knowledge and a new frontier for this group.<BR>
     I can not help lamenting the lack of the Mott's and von Brauns of 30 
years ago.  There were no dreamers of man's expansion into the universe and 
interplanetary exploration at this conference.  When manned space flight was 
mentioned it was with derision for the high risk and costs.  Risk taking was 
to be avoided, which may be why we are left out of the world's space launch 
industry.  The maiden flight of the ESA Ariane 5 last week showed how risky 
heavy launch development is and will remain for some time.  We need cheaper 
cost to orbit but are working to get there by smaller payloads, 
miniaturization, standardization and partnership leverage, not bold 
innovation and new propulsion techniques.  No talk of planets or returning 
to the moon, these are engineers with a narrow purpose in space, and if the 
American people have lost interest in space it is because there is no fire 
in our bellies for knowledge and the conquest of the unknown by humankind. 
  Dollars, bandwidth, surveillance, imaging, technical data and commercial 
profit are all that is left of our glorious national space program.  Dr. 
Eilene Galloway, the Grand old Dame of Space, talked of serving on Senator 
Long's Armed Service Committee when sputnik was launched but only reminisced 
about the old glory.  Congressman Bob Walker was the only speaker that spoke 
from the gut and with vision, but even this may have been more habit, left 
over from his years in the minority, than actual enthusiasm.  We did have a 
futurist, Dr. Ken Cox, from Johnson Space Center, with the enviable topic of 
our third millennium in space.  He skipped the next 50 years!<P>

<B>Executive Summary</B><P>

The 8th Annual International Acquisition/procurement Seminar was held at the Royal Military College of Science, Shrivenham, England, on 8 - 12 July 1996.  These Seminars are Sponsored by the Defense procurement education networks in the four IDEA nations, United States, United Kingdom, Germany and France.  The Keynote Speaker, Sir Robert Walmsley presented the procurement Strategy of the united Kingdom emphasizing the rapid and ongoing privatization and adherence of the UK to a 'Best Value for Money' strategy.  Transatlantic collaboration is considered and considered early, but the negotiations take too long and the money needs to be available sooner if joint projects are to continue.  A comparison was made by speakers from each of the IDEA nations of their respective procurement processes.  Mr. Bruce, Director, Armaments Cooperation, Atlantic - OSD, discussed the new streamlined procurement regulations of the US and emphasized our increasing reliance on international collaboration in filling our Defense procurement needs.  The participants indicated a belief that American policy in procurement was protectionist.  This was countered by Mr. Bruce, pointing out that the dollar amount of our procurement available for international competition was larger than that of any one of our Allies.  The importance of Intellectual Property Rights and the need to settle them in detail were stressed throughout the seminar, with IPR cited as the enemy of  joint projects.  There is a feeling that the US fails to address IPR fairly and adequately in our international negotiations.  The next seminar will be held in Mannheim, Germany, in July of 1997.<P>

<B>What, Where When and Why</B><P>

This conference is the eighth annual seminar sponsored by the International Defense Educational Arrangement (IDEA).  The IDEA group is comprised of directors from the Defense Systems Management College (DSMC), Fort Belvoir, Virginia, Royal Military College of Science (RMCS), Shrivenham, United Kingdom, The Federal Academy of Defence Administration & Technology (BAkWVT), Mannheim, Germany and the Centre d'Enseignement et de Formation d'Arcueil (CEFA), Paris.  Each year the IDEA seminar is hosted by a different national principal with this 1996 seminar at the RMCS, Shrivenham, United Kingdom.  The program was held 8 - 12 July 1996 and attended by over 80 participants from 10 nations plus the US Office of  Defense Cooperation (ODC) officers from Belgium and Italy.<BR>
 The theme of the conference was comparative defense procurement processes and timetables.  Each of the principal nations presented approximately two hours, detailing the cradle to grave procurement process in their respective nations. The presentations gave special attention to the approval and decision makers, the time tables for the different steps, the overall procurement philosophy and stressed the national policy on international collaborative programs and transnational off-the- shelf procurement.  Shrinking defense budgets have forced a change in procurement strategies on both sides of the Atlantic. Industry partnerships, international collaborative programs and off-the-shelf  hardware are now considered earlier in the procurement process of all participating nations.  In a nut shell, international collaboration dominated the first four days of the five day conference.  The final morning centered on comparative defense procurement and acquisition training in the IDEA countries.<BR>
 The Royal Military College of Science in Shrivenham was a delightful setting, the program well orchestrated and our British hosts gracious and attentive.  The Juxtaposition of the several national procurement strategies painted a picture remarkably similar in form and process but strikingly different in nuance.  Attendees gained an insight in the different expectations that collaborative partners bring to the table in a joint enterprise and discussions were frank and vigorous.  The discussion secessions and lectures were interspersed with tours of the RMCS tank and gun museums and a familiarity brief and participation exercise in the Distributive Simulation Laboratory.    Not only the speakers but the 80 plus attendees kept their minds fixed on procurement processes and education.  The consensus was that this seminar was a must for large, international program managers, ODC officers, and acquisition specialists involved with international procurement. As is often the case, the interchange between the various participants and their organizational affiliations in the several countries was as valuable as the formal seminar topics.<P>

<B>Keynote</B><P>

Sir Robert Walmsley KCB, British Chief of Defence Procurement, presented the defense procurement strategy for the United Kingdom in a keynote address.  It was a measured, diplomatic presentation, which mostly reiterated the policy and position long held by our maternal ally.  There were no surprises and privatization continues, 'best value for money' remains the priority and international cooperation, both transatlantic, and across European borders, is considered early and honestly in forming the procurement strategy.  While the defense budget is shrinking and under stress, Sir Walmsley is hopeful that the procurement money will increase in the coming budget cycle.  Collaboration across the Atlantic is considered early, but the agreement negotiations must move more quickly and money must be available in a timely fashion.  Pan-European rationalization is imperative too, and industry must take the initiative, as sovereignty issues and protectionism are still extant. Competitive procurement is the rule.  Off-the-shelf equipment, both at home and abroad, is always considered and even the strategy of choice in these trying budget times. A caveat is appropriate in this regard, however, in that, if a bid is to be successful, the bidder must 'make something' and not be just an integrator.<P>

<B>The Four Principals:</B><P>

The four Principal IDEA Countries gave national presentations that concentrated on the procurement strategies and acquisition processes of their respective Defense Procurement Agencies.  The Juxtaposition of the four systems left the participants of the seminar with a somewhat erroneous impression of similarity.  While the overall process block diagram produced remarkably compatible slides with decision and approval steps and a somewhat synchronized timing, the differences came in the details.   Configuration control shows up for critical parts (although not always by this name)and destruction and disposal are costed from the start, across the board.  Germany and the US consider an international collaborative strategy somewhat earlier in the process than the UK, and the word international did not appear in the French presentation until the 41st slide.  The point where the requirement is frozen varied amongst the participants.  The point where the money was irretrievably committed also varied, with the US always subject to congressional appropriation.  This presents a risk to our allies in collaborating with the US and is considered in the decision making process of whether or not to go international with a joint development project.  A point by point comparison of the IDEA country's defense procurement processes will be the subject of a future newsletter when seminar proceedings are distributed.<P>

<B>US procurement update:</B><P>

Mr. Bruce, Director, Armaments Cooperation, Atlantic, OSD, presented the changes in US procurement regulations and strategy.  The new 5000.1 series acquisition regulations have replaced about two feet of interrelated regulations with a coherent, concise regulation about a half inch thick.  The new regs require that any procurement plan first look at modifying an existing system, then buying off-the-shelf anywhere in the free world, then international collaboration.  Only if these options are not available do we turn to tri-service or single service development. We now think international from the on-set and our current Administration supports and encourages collaboration with our allies to a much larger degree than in our past.  The MOU process which was cumbersome, time consuming and fragmented amongst the services has been standardized by Defense adopting the International Agreement Generator developed by the Navy International Programs Office, with modifications.  The approval process is down from a year or more to 30 days.  The approval points within Defense, Commerce and the services have a 21 day limit and concurrence is assumed if the deadline is not met.  In response to the widespread criticism that our procurement policy is protectionist, Mr. Bruce pointed out that while we have the Buy American Act and a 'within borders' requirement for much of our procurement, any country with whom we have an armament agreement can ask for waivers.  Furthermore, the absolute value of our procurement that is open to international competition is vast and much larger than any other country's requirements allowing US competition.  He asked that we look at what is available and view the glass as half full rather than half empty.  He then pointed out that we have 190 cooperative R & D agreements with 18 countries, 730 DEA's and IEA's with 26 nations, and over 22 armament MOU's and 9 logistic MOUs.  We also have 90 science and technology exchanges with 12 of our allies and 50 co-production programs with 19 countries.  The NATO countries are central within this activity.  We are serious about working with our allies and the trend toward international collaboration will continue. Under Secretary of Defense (acquisitions and technology), Paul Kaminski is hopeful that the decreasing defense procurement budget has bottomed out and that this single area of our defense budget will rise in the next budget cycle.<P>

<B>Intellectual Property:</B><P>

Mr. Bill Cruickshank, Head of Intellectual Property Rights for UK MOD, spoke of the problems associated with Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) in international programs.  He knows.  Bill Cruickshank has had responsibilities for negotiating tech transfers in 15 plus collaborative programs over the last 16 years.  He has worked with some projects, such as the third generation anti-tank program since pre-feasibility in 1981 to the present production phase.  It is a continuity that we lack in the US and his consequent knowledge of international negotiations and associated intellectual property issues is enviable from a US perspective.  He knows more about US requirements and regulations at the negotiating table than the US delegation.  For example, we have no IP attorney assigned to the Navy International Programs Office charged with negotiating all Navy MOU's. There are no IP attorneys within the entire Defense Office of General Counsel and the undersigned is the only IP attorney from any of the Services assigned outside the continental United States.<BR>
 Mr. Cruickshank painted IPR as the enemy of collaborative programs and pointed out that the AMRAAM program collapsed because of IP.  Inadequate program IPR will place the program contractors in a monopoly position.  He finds the US rigid in both our contract and IPR rules, and often sees a US strategy of remaining silent on IPR rights at the MOU stage, thus leaving the program at constant risk.  In his view, you have to have the right people running the program and you have to have the money, but every other concern and deliverable of a collaborative program is intellectual property rights.  They must be thought out carefully and only what you actually need negotiated, otherwise the excess rights often bankrupt the program.<P>

<B>The Industrial View:</B><P>

The most interesting presentation at this seminar was a pragmatic critique of a joint production program between the UK and Italy for EH101 helicopters.  SR  Giacomo Saponaro is the business Director of E.H. Industries, the management company established to coordinate the joint venture between Agusta of Italy and GKN Westland Helicopters of the UK. He contrasted this program (successful so far) and the Concord (unsuccessful) with a conclusion that for a joint venture to succeed, the contractors must have wide latitude and ownership of the IPR, with governments only taking what they need.  The contractors must decide how the work is distributed with contractor competence the pole star.  The work share requirements should be simply a figure and the contractors free to obtain them with their own arrangements. Government oversight in the workshare arena should be only to quality and quantity.  If governments want best value for money they must be ready to compromise and allow the market place flexibility to meet the requirements in a way that also provides the industrial participants a malleable product to service their commercial markets.<P>

<B>Perceptions</B><P>

This was a very productive seminar from the point of the participants.  The value, as so often happens, was more from the interaction of the attendees than from the speaker's rostrum.  A large percentage of the participants are actually involved in international programs. The contacts are valuable and the interchange frank and of practical benefit to those in, or contemplating, collaborative development.  This is an annual event and many of the attendees have consequently established a long term relationship. A criticism of the seminar is that the proceedings are not distributed for months, leaving the attendees without the meat of the program to take home with them.  Many of the speakers did not even furnish biographies.  One either spent all his time trying to take notes and figure out the speaker and where he worked, or listened to the presentation.  The most valuable information was a step by step comparison of the procurement process of the IDEA nations.  These presentations were complex and replete with unfamiliar acronyms, making any meaningful comparison impossible without copies of the slides and presentations.  The next IDEA conference is in Mannheim, Germany.  Entry is without registration fee and those involved with international programs should consider attending.  Equivalent credit is given for the Multinational Program Management Course (Defense Acquisition University course PMT #202) offered buy the Defense Systems Management College, Fort Belvoir, Virginia.<P>

<B>Executive Summary</B><P>

The <B>NATO</B> Advanced Research Workshop on Intellectual Property: Influence on business Activity took place in <B>Moscow</B> from September 9-11, 1996.  This was the third annual workshop aimed at providing the Russian Federation Western ideas on how to expeditiously transfer state owned technology to the world market place.  The ten Western speakers and the breakout sessions discussed issues in three areas: firm strategy, finance and capital, and moving federal technology out of the state institutions into the market place.  The prescription in all three categories was the same; pass fair legislation in employee/employer relations concerning intellectual property, get a patent law on the books,  straighten out the banks (two thousand of the three thousand banks are bankrupt) and create a fair tax system so the entrepreneurs of the world can enter and do business.  A comprehensive court system and civil code needs to be put in place so that there is a means for dispute resolution.  Mous and Deas are needed, but first the Russians have to know what their national law and policy are, or they can not staff and sign the agreements.<BR>
	Most of the Western speakers had attended the first two workshops and they all spoke of the attitude change in the Russian participants.  There were still a few old school ideologues that advocated state ownership of technology, or at least state compensation for the technological base developed under the old Soviet institutions.  They were in the minority and mostly derided by their Russian colleagues.  From Vice Minister Yakobashvilli, Ministry of Science and Technology, to the Heads of Agencies, to the new science and technology incubators, all appreciated the ideas and workshop, and  all seemed determined to make the changes necessary to enter the free market and global market place.  They ask our forbearance and for us to understand the Russian difference, and to appreciate why it was taking a long time.  They do think differently and have a different history and culture.  It is my opinion that we made some mistakes in rushing in and buying research at fire sale prices.  What we needed then and need now, is truly collaborative undertakings.  <P>

<B>What, Where, When and Why</B><P>
	
This conference was the third annual  Advanced Research Workshop sponsored by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.  These workshops are sponsored by <B>NATO</B> to contribute to the critical assessment of existing knowledge on new important topics, to identify directions for future research, and to promote close working relations between scientists from different countries and with different professional experience.  This particular workshop was to assist Russia in transferring state owned technology to the market place and developing the infrastructure necessary to sell on the global market.  The workshop was sponsored by Dr. Alain Jubier, Program Director of <B>NATO</B>s Scientific Affairs Division.  The workshop was co-directed by Dr. Willem van Oort of the Netherlands, the managing Director of Lincentec, a technology licensing brokerage consultancy and Mr. Yevgeny Buriak of the  Russian Federation, Vice President of the Russian Association of Patent Specialists. There were ten Western speakers from six <B>NATO</B> nations, Finland, Czech republic and the Republic of Korea. Six formal speakers from Russia  were scheduled but scores of additional Russian participants stepped to the table to speak.  <BR>
A particularly useful part of the workshop was small group breakout sessions where specific topics were vigorously debated.  The subject matter was roughly trifurcated into Business firm strategy, finance and capital, and state support.  I found it interesting that the consensus on how to move forward in all three of these areas reduced to the same prescription.  Russia needs to establish a safe and secure infrastructure in legislation, financial institutes and banking, and the courts.  It was obvious that the economic playing field, that we from the West take for granted, does not yet exist in Russia nor in the thinking of most Russians.  There was still some ideological posturing, mostly from the old guys, but it was clear that the hearts and minds of these participants overwhelmingly were determined to enter into the  global marketplace and compete with the Western nations with their technology.  It will not be easy nor quick, the Russians are truly different in their thinking and grow from a different history and culture.  They need help from the West, and at least this group is ready to accept it.<BR>
	Except for the small group of Western speakers, this was an all Russian conference.  These were not the scientists but the bureaucrats.  The speakers and participants represented the Ministry of Science, Ministry of Nuclear Energy, Minister of Justice, Heads of various state committees and the <B>Eurasian Patent Office</B>.  The participants represented nearly every state agency and committee involved with science and technology including the State Duma.  These are the boys that can and must make it happen if Russia is to take its rightful place in the worlds science and technology marketplace.  The Western speakers, many who attended the first two workshops, were optimistic with the progress and changing attitudes of their Russian colleagues.  <BR>
	The workshop was held in the Headquarters for the Coordination of Military Collaboration of the CIS Countries in <B>Moscow</B>. This was the former <B>Moscow</B> headquarters of the WARSAW PACT, roughly the parallel of our SHAPE Headquarters. It was an august conference chamber replete with the ghosts of old Soviet Communist Party Secretaries and Generals.  This is a military complex located on the main road to <B>Moscow</B> center from the airport.  Security was high and military guards checked your passports coming in the gates, getting into the building, moving from one floor to another and in the hallways.  The building was spacious and glorious in its heyday, but that was before.  Now it was mostly deserted except for our conference and the western speakers that stayed there.  There was a three star in residence as the Commandant and the building was quickly showing the signs of disuse.  My room was a three room suite, replete with china and silver with two large crystal chandeliers and a desk about a mile wide.  There were message ports through the walls, wall safes and message repositories, all with combination locks.  One could almost feel the presence of the old soviet brass that no doubt spent their time thinking about us as we did about them.  But that was the old days.  Now the room is poorly kept, and the toilet paper reminiscent of corrugated aluminum. Light bulbs are missing without enough light to read and it is impossible to make an international call on the phone system.  It was a fitting setting to contemplate the changes needed to propel Russia and her technology into the world market in the 21st century.   <P>

<B>Keynote</B><P>

<I>Mr. Zurab A. Yakobashvilli</I>, Vice Minister of the Russian Federation Ministry of Science and Technology policy gave the keynote opening address.  He was appreciative of the workshop and noted that there were many positive indicators that Russia was moving forward toward a market economy.  He asked those of us from the west to be understanding of the Russian difference and to be sensitive to the difficulties his nation was experiencing throughout the agencies as Russia makes the transition.  He pointed out the progress being made in legislation including Russias new draft patent statute asking us not to be too critical in that it wasnt perfect but the best political compromise they could do at the present time.  Other legislation is in process including a State Secrets Act, employer-employee civil code concerning intellectual property and intellectual property dispute resolution.  He felt as we did, that progress was slow, but moving in the right direction.  Vice Minister Yakobashvilli (its still unofficial, but hes apparently in for a big promotion) was more pro-West in this presentation than his former speeches and writings would indicate.  (still unofficial, but in for a big promotion) He complimented everyone for the efforts leading up to the Gore/Chernomyrdin agreement on intellectual property and pointed out that the chairman and two members of the Chernomyrdin intellectual property committee, staffing the agreement, were participating in the workshop.  It was not just a quick speech and run, as he seemed genuinely interested in the workshop, talked to us during the breaks, and returned to the workshop and participated intermittently over the next three days.       <P>

<B>Speakers</B><P>

One of the main themes of this workshop was that in order to move technology from the state owned institutions into the global marketplace, it is necessary to form and use private firms to raise venture capital and market the technology.  Several of us spoke on this point and I discussed the experiences of our own government, the Stevenson Wilder Technology Transfer Act, the motivating force of this act in providing an incentive to inventors and laboratories to protect and market their inventions, and the important role private technology marketing firms play in this process.  An abstract of some of the other presentations follows. <P>

<I>Vladimir Smirnov</I>, Head of Analysis and Law Department, Ministry of Nuclear Energy, entitled his talk "The allocation of rights for the industrial property objects, developed in the course of works, implemented at the expense of the state budget."  The essence of this unwieldy title was that the West, read United States, were gaining unearned benefits in the Russian Federation by unequal dealings with their research and development community.  He cited 190 research contracts between CIS research institutions under a US DOE program with the title of NIS-IPP, 60 contracts with US DOE  laboratories and other CIS institutions, 450-500 bilateral or multilateral contracts under International Scientific and Technical Collaboration program (ISTC), and a few commercial contracts with companies such as Proctor and Gamble, as exploitative.  Mr. Smirnov cited the Bayh-Dole Act, the Stevenson Wilder Technology Transfer Act, and the US code on collaboration in the field of research and development, as US instruments for forcing these unequal agreements.  Apparently  the head of DOE, Mrs. Hazel OLeary, announced a temporary two year waiver under a government to government agreement (Gore/Chernomyrdin) with enforcing these agreements with respect to the transfer of <B>Intellectual Property Rights</B>,  in order to work out new, and fair terms.  A further change is needed, in Mr. Smirnovs opinion, and that is for DOE to also give up the contract rights to a US license of the technology to practice the inventions for governmental purposes throughout the world, and March-in-Rights.  (This is the contract right to patent technology developed under a contract, if the inventing party fails or refuses to do so.) <BR>
	So what is going on here?  The first question I received from Mr. Smirnov was, "Why does the U S believe that they do not have to pay for background intellectual property in collaborative agreements?".  I fumbled a bit and replied that I am sure that we did not take that position.  He replied that US DOE did.   We were speaking through translators and it took most of the conference to figure out what engendered the bitterness.  Mr. Smirnov believed that the technology developed by the old Soviet State Institutions had great residual value.  When he referred to "background IP" he meant the technical know how and experience of the scientist and engineers, not existing patents, copyrights, etc. that we think of as IP.  We only use the term background referring to technical data, not protected IP.   Furthermore, when he styled the agreements cooperative, he was actually referring to contracts.  He, and others, accused the West (USA) of entering Russia amid the turmoil of social/political change, picking and choosing the plumbs of soviet science, and buying them at fire sale prices.  It was a hard charge to answer for that is what we did.  The DOE agreements were standard Federal Acquisition Regulation contracts (FAR) where we paid certain scientists , usually for a low hourly wage, to conduct R & D.  We took the results of the research as a deliverable under the contract and, in standard FAR terms, owned the rights to subject inventions.  (A subject invention is any invention first conceived or first reduced to practice under a contract.)  We went to the best scientists working in cutting edge research because that is what we needed to augment our own development.  In one of these contracts the scientist designed and built a prototype switch, we claimed rights to the invention in accordance with the contract, and the Ministry of Science stopped performance and refused to relinquish rights to the switch.  Their position is that the knowledge and experience of the researcher acquired before the contract actually resulted in the invention and he only turned it into a device under the contract, not invented it thereunder.  Another contract term that caused heartburn was the FAR provision that allowed a grant of an exclusive license to the contractor for certain subject inventions where we took title, but then kept a US government nonexclusive license to make and use the invention for government purposes throughout the world.  Mr. Smirnovs position was that an exclusive license meant just that, exclusive, and only the licensee could make and use the invention. <BR>
	Although Smirnov represents the old guard and his views are in general disparaged by his colleagues, and he is way off base in western terms, there are some lessons here for us.  These simple contract terms which we all know and love, and have, since we were knee high to a patent attorney, are new and confusing to our Russian colleagues.  We no longer question such terminology since it has been through the courts, accepted, and used for years.  In my opinion, it is a shame that we went after Russian technology with contracts rather than equitable collaborative development agreements, as we have poisoned the well.  We know all that stuffread the contractcaveat emptora deal is a deal, and so forth, but our Russian colleagues do not.  The free market is new and strange to them and it is inevitable that as they learn the street smarts necessary to play this new game, they will both get burned and have a tendency to blame the West for the burning.   We missed a chance to garner their good will and it will take a long time undoing.  Ever wonder why the Gore/Chernomyrdin Agreement on Intellectual Property took so long in coming and then seemed to say nothing?  Mr. Smirnov was the chairman of the Chernomyrdin staff that negotiated the agreement!<P>

<I>Evgeny Buryak</I>, Vice President of Russian Association of Patent Experts, spoke on the Russian Patent office (<B>Rospatent</B>), and the draft patent law that is now before the State Duma.  Mr. Buryak felt that the progress was too slow but that the draft legislation presented a pretty good first effort at a workable patent statute comparable with world wide standards.  The essence of his speech was that there was much pain in getting the consensus necessary to draft legislation that could pass all the agencies necessary to submit legislation and then get it signed into law. The Duma passed legislation for a state secrets law only to have it returned unsigned.  Part of the new patent statute controls how technology impacting national security is protected from publication and one legislative effort is forced to wait on the other.   I will publish a separate newsletter on the draft patent legislation in the near future.<P>

<I>Victor Blinnikov</I>, President of the <B>Eurasian Patent Office</B>, spoke of the historical changes resulting from the USSR <B>Rospatent</B>s termination of functions and authority in the former republics.  The Eurasian Patent Convention arose to fill the vacuum. The idea of establishing a sole patent system was agreed upon by six states in 1991 and the principles for establishment approved by nine states in 1993.  The interstate Bureau for the Protection of Industrial Property was created and was the organizing body for the Eurasian Patent Convention.  This convention was signed into existence officially by 11 states in 1994 and entered into effect in August of 1995.  It is now open to any state that is a member of the UN and bound by the Paris Convention and the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT). The convention has set up the Eurasian Patent Organization which includes the <B>Eurasian Patent Office</B> (EAPO) and an Administrative Council.  The EAPO performs all Administrative functions and is now recruiting qualified personnel.  This is a tough job in that personnel requirements include relevant educational backgrounds, practical experience in industrial property, organizational abilities, and fluency in Russian, the official language.<BR>
	Eurasian patent Attorneys must meet two mandatory requirements.  They must have the right to be a representative before the national Patent Office of the member state in accordance with national legislation, and be registered by the EAPO as a patent attorney.  Entry is controlled by a registration procedure which includes a proficiency examination.  There is a grandfather provision that waives the exam for those registered before December 31, 1996.  More than a hundred Attorneys have registered under these grandfather provisions so far.  <BR>
	Filing of an EAPO application saves time and money.  A single filing (in Russian) gives coverage in all member states and costs less than filing in each.  There are procedures for a speedy examination but at considerable extra cost.  An EAPO application proceeds in two phases, the first part is an examination for completeness and formalities, publication and search, with the payment of fees.  Then the examination for patentability and the grant of a patent, again for the payment of fees.  Rule forty provides for a reduction of fees for low income member countries of about 80 percent.  Opposition procedures are available within short timelines. There is a provision for converting an EAPO application to a national application and preserving the original filing date should the EAPO application fail.  In general, the EAPO procedures are pari passu with those of most of the worlds statutes.  In my opinion, like the national patent for the Russian Federation, the fees are too high to be competitive on the world stage, but for a first effort, not bad.  <P>
   
<I>Edouard Bourgeois</I>, Head of International Affairs for ANVAR, the French Agency for technology  and innovation of small to medium sized enterprises(SME) spoke on the French program of subsidizing the transfer of technology to the market place.  His agency takes a demand pull rather than a technology push approach.  The SMEs propose their own projects and the technology is developed under a systemic development plan.  The old paradigm of a lineal process of research to invention to industry has been replaced with an integrated networking that has a product in mind throughout the process.  Product development is complex and technology without a product is worthless to the marketplace.  The SMEs supported by ANVAR receive up to 50 percent total funding with an interest free loan that only has to be repaid if the project is a success.  The Agency stays involved throughout the project, and both influences and monitors the methods of management and human resources.  An ANVAR study encourages SMEs to recruit an academic or Ph.D. with 5 to 8 years experience in higher education to act as the R & D executive and be in charge of the innovative program, at least partially.  ANVAR is the most important actor for the promotion of innovation in French SMEs, but results are hard to measure as ANVAR is supported under the French National Budget and has no result oriented accountability.<P>

<I>Mr. Gijsbert Boot</I>, General manager of a private, joint Czech Western Venture Capital Fund, Regionalni Prdnikatelsky Fond (RFP), discussed the formation of his business and experiences in the Czech Republic.  The RFP was founded in June 1994 by the Foundation for Regional Development, a cooperation between the EU and the Czech government, with the objective of introducing venture capital to stimulate the development of SMEs.  The philosophy is that for SMEs to survive, an entrepreneurial culture and venture capital must exist. RPF provides the former and, first the EU and then investment banks (ING Bank/Baring) the latter. The company is located in a Czech industrial center, not the capital, to keep a hands-on approach.  There is no shortage of proposals with RPF receiving 364 in its first two years of existence.  Only 3 percent (eleven) of the proposals have been funded (5 million ECU or 4 million USD)and one has failed.  The selection criteria is laborious and the due diligence process long and man hour intensive.  A 25 to 50 percent target rate of return is sought and RPF takes an actual stake in the business and a role in the management.    The fledgling company is succeeding.  RPF started as an EU project but is now privatizing and increasing its investment capital from 10 to 50 million ECU.  They are now expanding to other Czech industrial centers.  Sounds good but how do you get out?  Well, we do not yet know, the firm holds investments for 5 to 7 years and the company is either sold to a strategic partner or listing on the Czech stock exchange.  We will see.<P>

	<I>Jan Lettinga</I>, Member of the Executive Board of Delft Instruments, The Netherlands, spoke of conversions from military to civil business.  His theme was again that any technology transfer policy must be product driven.  If supply and demand in a given market are in balance, then there is no demand for an increase in the supply .  The technology in the state and military institutions are just such an increase in supply.  Research and development must be product driven to have value. A successful transfer of military technology must come from market pull which requires thorough knowledge of markets and applications, which a military business does not have.  To convert a military business to a civil business is long and must be done in steps.  You can not take the existing organization and convert it with fiat,  because you bring the old attitudes and prejudices with the transfer.  The only successful way is to absorb the military organization into an existing civil firm by moving only a few of the state employees into the civil organization, with at least a 20 to one workforce ratio, until they are trained. (I think the actual word is reprogrammed)  Once they have learned product driven production, value engineering and the know how associated with a product creation process based on small margins in price/performance ratio, another transfer of personnel can begin.  It is a long and risky business.<P>

<I>Dr. Hans Claes</I> with the Catholic University, Louvain, Belgium, spoke on the University - Industry relationship.  Universities, mostly due to financial concerns, are increasingly induced to collaborate with industry.  The highly competitive technological environment stimulates industry to be interested in the technological and scientific possibilities the universities can offer.  Principal concerns regarding the relationship between the universities and industry, such as the independence of the university, academic values, conflicts of interest and commitment, can all be resolved through university policies.  The Katholieke Universiteit Leuven has set up an organization within the university, Leuven Research and Development, which is responsible for organizing this relationship.  Leuven R & D is an autonomous, service oriented and financially independent organization.  Its Board of Directors is composed of the vice presidents of the university and members of industry users.  The philosophy of Leuven R & D is determined by the choice of high quality research projects, a full disclosure policy and an impartial attitude.  The objectives of this organization include establishing a technology brokerage system, pursuing an active patent policy and the establishment of new companies through a transfer of university technology.  Initial results show results and are encouraging.  <P>

<I>The Russian Participants</I>, about fifty, from a multitude of agencies, ministries and new technology Transfer organizations, spoke mostly on Russian progress in legislation, philosophy and the special nature of Russia.  A common theme was that, as Russians, they are different.  They have a different history and they think differently.  The constantly changing map in that part of the world is driven by 170 separate nations and ethnic groups, gathered by the czars and held together, of late, by the communists.  The people, at first Surfs then Kulaks, are now broke and out of work.  The people lost all they had when the ruble floated to equilibrium, and a large portion of the Russian people, including the military, have not been paid for months.  Surprisingly, at least for this group of workshop attendees, the ideological battles are mostly over.  They like their new freedoms and want to compete on world markets.  Yes, there were still a few of the old school, such as Mr. Smirnov, <I>supra</I>, that thought the infrastructure of the old Soviet regime was just fine and that nothing needed to be done with the courts or civil codes.  He had a minority of support from the participants, and it was obvious that most of the attendees were trying to solve the problems that would open Russia to the West and world markets.  The speakers noted that of the three thousand banks in the Russian Federation, two thousand were bankrupt.  This is a problem that is being swept under the rug, but they are aware.  Not only is it a risk of solvency to bank money, but it creates a record and the tax man cometh. And boy does he come.  New taxes come from every direction, and every agency takes a bite, until there is nothing left.  The small company that arranged the conference for <B>NATO</B> refused to put any money in a bank and dealt with cash.  Dollars of course, and they were hit from every direction until they were forced to approach <B>NATO</B> with a plea for more money to continue.  The Russians know this and talked more about this problem than the Western speakers. Two years ago the funds for the conference came in stashed in a couriers shoe.  <BR>
The Russians appreciated our help, acknowledged their problems and asked our forbearance while they sort out the new country.  They want truly collaborative agreements with the West, not just hourly contracts.  They also realize that we need Data Exchange Agreements and Memoranda of Understanding, but must work out their national policy and legislation before they can be staffed and signed.  The breakout sessions were vigorous, spirited and frank.  There are two competing models of how Russian technology should be held: The Belarus model, which advocates ownership and complete control of the technology by the state, and what they call the American model, which is the state subsidizing the transfer of the technology to private industry and then getting out of the way.  They know the first will not work and they lack funds to do the second.  We were sympathetic and pointed out that the Western countries have the same problem, in that technology languishes in the federal labs.  We suggested, and they agreed, that the creators of the technology must have a stake in the fruits of their labor and that the developing labs and institutions must also.  It is the free market that moves  the technology, turns it into products, and markets it.  The state, theirs or ours, has never been successful in this arena.     <P>


<B>Perceptions</B><BR>

This was a productive conference.  Generally both sides felt that Russia was moving towards the right goal post but that it was very difficult given the social/political turmoil in the Russian Federation.  Perhaps we have tried to move too fast.  The first steps must be to create the infrastructure necessary for the world to conduct business there.  Legislation is needed and a court system established for dispute resolution.  Entrepreneurship is hindered by unjust fees and taxes.  The country still moves on grease and it is driving up the costs, until few of the new small businesses can survive.  But the good news is that most of the socialist/ communist ideologues have faded from view.  The Western participants that attended this conference in the past all report a sea change in philosophy of the bureaucrats towards determination to create a free market.  Yes, just attending this conference is a filter, but its bandwidth is increasing.  We take a lot for granted about markets that they dont yet understand.  It was hard to convince them that for any Russian product to sell on the world stage, it must benchmark against what is available and either provide something new or better or something existing that is cheaper.  This is a problem for Russian goods as they have not had to meet these standards before.  One of the thorns stuck in the foot of the Ministry of Science was that a private deal between Proctor and Gambol and a Russian firm, listed ten million dollars in Intellectual property as assets they were bringing to Russia.  They had no patents or copyrights and the Russians could not grasp the fact that the Trade Name, Proctor and Gamble, had value, as did the company good will.  <P><HR><P>

Maritime Research Institute (MARIN), The Netherlands: An Update</H3>

<B>1. Summary</B><P>

On 19 March 1996 I visited the research facilities of MARIN, towards
an update on their current emphasis on research in ship hydrodynamics
and acoustics, their expansion into areas of related research, efforts in
international co-operative reseach, and their rather ambitious plan for a
nearly total replacement of their large test facilities to incorporate more
modern and sophisticated structure, equipment and techniques.  As a
private organization MARIN --until quite recently known as the Netherlands Ship Model Basin (NSMB)-- has traditionally enjoyed financial
support for upgrade as well as operational subsidy from the Ministry of
Transport and Shipping and the Netherlands Government in general.
Their Government has always placed a very high value on basic and
applied ship research and, therefore, the status of a national asset on
MARIN.<P>

In Surabaya, Indonesia, the new Indonesian Hydrodynamic Laboratory
was inaugurated by President Suharto in July 1995.  This laboratory,
which principally comprises a 235 x 11 x 5.5m towing tank and a
variable-depth maneuvering and offshore basin, was designed by MARIN
which also supervised its construction.  Facility calibration and on-site
personnel training are currently being conducted by MARIN.<P>

<B>2. Background</B><P>

To naval architects and those in ship hydrodynamics research, MARIN
has been particularly known for its Depressurized Towing Tank, known
more commonly to the related community as the "Vacu-Tank", a unique
facility since 1970 which enables the standard Froude-number-matched
ship model towing tests at the full-scale cavitation number.  To those in
the field of research and design of marine propellers, MARIN research
has been of historic significance: prior to the advent of computers making
possible the use of lifting-line and lifting-surface theories, the approach
to the design and analysis of propellers, since the 1940s, had been based
on the popularly known Wageningen B-Series Propellers, derived from
extensive research at MARIN (located near the quaint farming town of
Wageningen).<P>

MARIN was founded in 1929 in a joint effort by four Dutch shipowners and
the Government of the Netherlands.  Following the completion of its first
towing tank, research work began in 1932.  Today's facility comprises, in
addition, two cavitation tunnels, a seakeeping basin, a shallow-water basin,
a wave and current basin, a high-speed towing tank, and the depressurized
towing tank (the "Vacu-Tank").<P>

<B>3. Recent Upgrades and Expansion</B><P>

<B>(a)</B>. Following its recent emphasis on support of the industrial services and
nautical research and training MARIN has made substantial investments
in mathematical simulation programs and developed two significant training
simulators: the Vessel Traffic Services Simulator and the Ship Maneuvering
Simulator.<P>

<B>(b)</B>. Recent upgrades in Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) enable a
reliable analysis of mixed-flow phenomena, such as those involving a very
complex interaction of viscous hull-flow with hull-propulsor interactive flow
modification.<P>

<B>(c)</B>. Emphasis on offshore research and an increased interest on the
measurement and prediction of wind resistance of high-speed craft have
led to MARIN's development of their new Windforce Dynamometer which
measures wind forces and torques on a superstructure.  MARIN's recently-
developed techniques for single-point mooring as well as dynamic
positioning (actively controlled) are already in use by the offshore industry.<P>

<B>(d)</B>. A rather new addition to research and service areas is that of Trials and
Monitoring, for full-scale data acquisition and analysis in the disciplines of
hydrodynamics, structures, acoustics, vibration, and ship position-keeping.<P>

<B>(e)</B>. A very new Department of Automation, Intrumentation and Installations
has been created at MARIN, towards the development of software and
hardware in the areas of automatic control, modelling and simulation, and
robotics.  To a large extent this Department today acts in support of the
mainstream MARIN disciplines.<P>

<B>4. Facility Re-Design and Construction</B><P>

About two years ago MARIN presented to the Ministry of Shipping and
Transport a very ambitious plan to re-design and re-construct nearly all
of its facilities at a slightly different location.  This plan included even a
wholly new "Vacu-Tank" with very sophisticated acoustical features built
into it.  MARIN approached the Government requesting its support
as a bank-loan "guarantor".  It appears quite certain that the Ministry's
guarantee will come through very soon.<P>

<B>5. Co-operative Research</B><P>

MARIN formed, in 1969, the Co-operative Research Ships (CRS) Group,
a consortium of ship research sponsors for whom the selected research
would be conducted primarily by MARIN.  The current CRS membership
represents twelve countries, with the total number of sponsor members
being twenty-one.  Exxon and the American Bureau of Shipping have
been the only two sponsor members during the past twenty-seven years.
The CRS research topics are traditionally aimed at solving problems of
common concern among ship designers and ship owners.<P>

<B>6. MARIN Location and Point of Contact (POC)</B><P>

MARIN is located in the Ede/Wageningen area of the lower Dutch midlands.
Ede/Wageningen is about one hour away by train from the Schiphol Airport,
including a change at the Duivendrecht Station.<P>

Dr J Th Ligtelijn, Head of Ship Research Department and my friend and
colleague of twenty-one years, is always a very hospitable host.  Those of
the US Government willing to visit MARIN can contact me for a visit
arrangement.  I can be reached by phone on +44-171-514-4947;

Marine Technology Directorate (MTD): A UK Consortium for Ship and Offshore Technology Research</H3>


<B>1. Key Words</B><P>

<I>Multi-Sponsor Research; Ship Dynamics; Ship and Offshore Technology;
Ship Acoustics; Composites.</I><P>


<B>2. Summary</B><P>

A research consortium aimed at the advancement of marine and offshore
technology, MTD is regarded in the related UK community as a prime
exemplar of a multi-sponsor research organisation.  Areas of research
are selected based on the requirements of government, the needs of
industry, and the capabilities of academic and applied researchers.
In the recent past the primary thrust of sponsored research by MTD
has been in support of the offshore oil and gas industry, with smaller
but significant support for ships and marine transportation.  Today,
however, the emphasis on ship research is increasing rapidly.  Process
is nearly complete today towards the incorporation of the US Office of
Naval Research (ONR) as the first foreign member of this consortium.<P>


<B>3. MTD Objectives</B><P>

In the broadest terms the objectives of MTD are  (a) to promote ship and
offshore technology advancement with a view to requirements and needs of
government and industry;  (b) to promote collaboration and discussion
among industry, government departments, and Higher Education Institutes;
(c) to support Higher Education Institutes in research in the areas of
strategic importance.<P>

Contribution to community education and training is an important function
of MTD:  it is entrusted with the approval --and introduction-- of courses
towards government Research Studentship for MSc and PhD candidates.  (The
award process for such Studentships is quite the same as that for ONR
postgraduate fellowships in the US.  In addition, however, based on the
needs of government and industry, the MTD can specify a topic of research
for which a studentship is granted.  The uniqueness of this arrangement is
that MTD does not provide the grant itself: it instead acts as the
recommending authority for the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research
Council, which provides the grant.) <P>


<B>4. MTD Structure</B><P>

Responsibility of the formal management of research programs is with
Marinetech South Limited, a Southampton based organisation formed solely
for this function.<P>

In reality, the financial support for the MTD research programs comes
largely from the UK taxpayers, as much of the funding (between 70 and 80
percent) is provided by the UK Government's Engineering and Physical
Sciences Research Council (EPSRC).  The remainder of the required funding
comes from the industry and other UK Government agencies (e.g., Ministry
of Defence --another source of taxpayer support).<P>


<B>5. Research Technology Centers</B><P>

A number of Technology Centers are distributed throughout the UK, on the
basis of technology and research expertise and activities.  A brief
description of these Centers is provided below:<P>

<I>(a) University of Southampton, Department of Ship Sciences.</I><P>

Together with the University's Institute of Sound and Vibration Research,
Departments of Mechanical, Electrical, and Electronics Engineering as well
as Aeronautics and Astronotics, this Technology Center has recently
completed projects on motions and hull-loading characteristics of catamarans
in waves;  shaft- and structure-borne noise induced by inverter-fed motors
on ships;  developments towards the reduction of shipboard piping vibration
and noise;  design studies of power electronic drive systems for thrusters;
and assessment of bahavior and damage tolerance levels of fibre-reinforced
polymer sandwich structures.<P>

<I>(b) University College London, Department of Mechanical Engineering.</I><P>

Research projects at this Center include the problem of variable-amplitude
corrosion fatigue of high strength steel;  studies on subsea umbilicals
suitable for deepwater environments;  nonlinear dynamics;  and advanced
sonar applications for the marine environment.<P>

<I>(c) Cranfield University, Department of Materials.</I><P>

Current activities at this Center include research on the use of high strength
steels in offshore engineering, their weldability, toughness, and corrosion
fatigue behavior;  and applied research on deepwater hyperbaric welding, for
which a new welding facility has recently been commissioned.<P>

<I>(d) University of Manchester School of Engineering.</I><P>

Newest member of the family of Centers, the Manchester School of Engineering
has successfully completed a research program on cost-effective offshore use
of fibre-reinforced composites.  Primarily towards the support of offshore
oil companies, this Center has recently launched a program on the design and
instrumentation for Process Separation Systems.<P>

<I>(e) University of Newcastle-Upon-Tyne, Department of Marine Technology.</I><P>

Together with the Electrical and Electronics Engineering Department and the
Mechanical, Materials and Manufacturing Department, this Center is currently
engaged in research on undersea acoustics;  deepwater umbilicals;  offshore
differential global positioning systems;  and on uncertainties in loads on
offshore structures.<P>

<I>(f) The Heriot-Watt University, Edinburgh, Institute of Offshore Engineering.</I><P>

Current topics of research at this Center include relevant and cost-effective
petrophysical methodologies for improved reservoir characterisation;
technologies for unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs);  design of wave and
offshore basins from consideration of joint-probability-distribution extreme,
multi-directional wave loads;  sound transmission through offshore and marine
structures;  and effects of motion on topside separation process.<P>

<I>(g) The University of Glasgow, Department of Mechanical Engineering.</I><P>

Principal research emphasis at this Center has been in the areas of ship and
offshore hydrodynamics, structures, and materials:  development of design
and analysis tools for deepwater offshore platforms and high-speed advanced
marine vehicles;  maneuverability of ships in shallow waters;  RO-RO ferry
stability;  heavy-weather oil containment systems;  failure criteria in
high-strength steels for offshore use;  design guidelines for adhesively
bonded steel connections;  erosion and corrosion mechanisms in specialist
steels and alloys;  erosion performance of a range of polymer-glass
composites used for offshore pipes;  and underwater sensor materials.<P>

<I>(h) The University of Strathclyde, Dept of Ship and Marine Technology.</I><P>

Recently-completed projects at this Center include those in the areas of
underwater stereo vision systems;  sonar-based navigation systems for UUVs;
near-surface hydrodynamics of UUVs;  and snatch-loading characteristics of
cables during the launch and recovery of tethered subsea units.<P>


<I>6. Benefits of the MTD Consortium Membership</I><P>

Benefits of the above examples of research are quite obvious to the ships
and offshore community.  Given that about an 80-percent contribution of
the required funding is obtained from the UK taxpayers, by way of EPSRC,
the return of investment of a sponsoring member towards the remaining
twenty percent obviously is extremely high and, therefore, equally
attractive.  Process is nearly at a completion towards the introduction of
the US Office of Naval Research (ONR) as the first foreign member of MTD.<P>

<B>7. Further Details</B><P>

Krylov Shipbuilding Research Institute, St Petersburg, Russia: An Update</H3>


<B>1. Key Words</B><P>

<I>Ship Research in Russia; Propulsor Research; Waterjet Propulsors;
Ship Resistance; Wings-in-Ground Craft.</I><P>


<B>2. Summary</B><P>

Present newsletter provides an update on the home of Russian ship
research, the Krylov Shipbuilding Research Institute (KSRI), based on
my visit of its facilities on 14 and 15 May, 1996.  The most notable
of my observations has been KSRI's rapid adaptation to the context of
world shipping and shipbuilding: Indeed, according to my colleagues
in KSRI's largest department, the Department of Hydrodynamics, about
ninety-five percent of their current research is under the sponsorship
of commercial shipping and offshore companies of western Europe.  The
Department of Acoustics, which commands about the same status for its
excellence, has however remained focussed largely on navy needs.<P>


<B>3. Background</B><P>

The Krylov Shipbuilding and Research Institute, which celebrated its
centenary two years ago, had been established in 1893 as a towing tank
facility for ship resistance and powering research--just as the US Navy's
Carderock Division of Naval Surface Warfare Center began as the Experimental
Model Basin (EMB) about the same time.  Much the same way as Carderock,
KSRI soon became a world leader in fundamental and applied research in
the fields of ship hydrodynamics, acoustics, structures, and related
systems.  During the 1940s this research center was named after Krylov,
a pioneer in mathematical formulation of ship wave resistance mechanisms.<P>

Today, research in ship and propulsor hydrodynamics still dominates the
activity at KSRI.  The facility in this area comprises a deep water towing
tank, a shallow water towing tank, a high-speed towing tank, a seakeeping
and maneuvering basin, a rotating-arm basin, five propulsor cavitation
tunnels, a cavitation basin, an ice model basin, a wind tunnel, and a
number of test units for pressure vessels.<P>


<B>4. Research Emphasis Today</B><P>

Discussions during my visit addressed KSRI's current emphasis, future 
interests, and research collaboration possibilities primarily in two
areas: hydrodynamics and acoustics.  Areas of interest are outlined in
the following.<P>

<B>4.1 Hydrodynamics</B><P>

Much of the current work as well as work planned for the immediate future
are of proprietary nature.  The following provides a description of KSRI's
major in-house efforts.<P>

<I>4.1.1 High Speed Marine Propulsors</I><P>

Propulsors requiring special features for dynamically-supported high speed
marine vehicles have in the recent years received special attention
throughout the world.  The principal challenge in the design of such a
propulsor is in attaining a high efficiency at low speeds.  KSRI's most
notable development in this area has been that of the Ventilated Waterjet
Propulsor.  The design-point efficiency of this propulsor has been shown
to be higher than that of a subcavitating propeller.  However, ventilated
waterjets do have a problem in providing a steady craft acceleration at
intermediate speeds, which can be corrected by means of an active system
modifying blade hydrodynamics instantaneously.  However, this problem can
also be alleviated through design modifications allowing the propulsor to
operate in different hydrodynamic regimes at different speeds.  There does
exist considerable interest among the KSRI scientists and management in a
US-Russian collaborative effort for further research on this concept.<P>

<I>4.1.2 Ship Resistance Reduction by Gas Cavities on Hull Surface</I><P>

This is a KSRI concept towards which considerable effort is expended today
both in theoretical research and in towing-tank measurements for empirical
parameters.  Conceptually, this approach applies and maintains a gas film
separating a large part of the ship bottom from hull boundary layer, thereby
eliminating the associated skin-friction drag.  First introduced more
than a century ago, implementation of this concept has so far not been
possible because of the instability of such a gas film.  Beginning
with a two-dimensional development of theory and its experimental
validation, KSRI has extended this concept to three-dimensional hull
forms and obtained rather promising preliminary model test results.  There
is no particular interest on the part of KSRI at this time to extend this
project into a collaborative effort.<P>

<I>4.1.3 Aerodynamics of Wings-in-Ground craft (WIGs)</I><P>

This project started as a study of near-ground performance of conventional
aircraft, leading to the development of new theories and experiment methods.
Because of the highly nonlinear relationship between ground clearance and
wing lift a measurably high transient gain in lift occurs at very small
heights (under 20 percent wing chord).  Towards craft operation at such
minute clearances  KSRI is currently developing new theories which, if
supported by experimental data, will lead to a wing design of substantial
departure from the conventional.<P>

<B>4.2 Acoustics</B><P>

Applied research in acoustics is quite entirely aimed at navy's requirements.
A description of the general areas of fundamental research is provided below.<P>

<I>4.2.1 Propulsor-Induced Hull Vibration and Acoustics</I><P>

The principal effort in this area appears to be in development of materials
for use as a frequency-tuned compliant stage of thrust bearing to absorb
the propulsor-transmitted fluctuating forces.<P>

<I>4.2.2 Localization of Noise Sources</I><P>

The emphasis is on further development of KSRI's capabilities in this area
thorugh modifications to their directional synthetic aperture antenna
approach, based on simultaneous two-point reception with perpendicular and
parallel bases.<P>

<B>2. Summary</B><P>

The Eighth International Conference on Laser Techniques in Fluid
Mechanics was held in Lisbon, Portugal, during 8-11 July 1996.
In part, this conference was jointly sponsored by the London-based
Office of Naval Research Europe, US Army Research and
Development Group, and the US Air Force Office of Research.
Hosted by the Department of Mechanical Engineering, University
of Lisbon, this conference is held every two years at the same
venue and it provides the related community with an update on
recent developments in the measurement techniques for unsteady
turbulent fluid flow and related energy transfer.  Non-intrusive means
of measurement such as those discussed in this conference are
essential for many cases of complex fluid-flow: sophisticated but
intrusive means such as hot-wire anemometry can often alter the
basic flow structure.  Based on papers and related discussions of
recent work, the emphasis on advancement of techniques appears
the greatest in Germany and the USA.  Development of equipment
for the measurement of three-dimensional properties together with
data processing software appears to put Denmark, the UK and
the USA in the lead.  As described in the following paragraph, today
there is a particular need in the Navy for sophisticated laboratory
measurement techniques, towards the validation and certification of
numerical simulation tools.  I plan to hold an international workshop
in a few months towards establishing specific needs, related plans,
and international collaboration possibilities in both sponsorship and
execution of the research plans. <P>

<B>3. Background and Naval Perspective</B><P>

This conference was held closely following the 21st ONR Symposium
on Naval Hydrodynamics in Trondheim, Norway, which presented
today's Navy emphasis on numerical simulation and prediction of
ship dynamical and propulsive performance for realistic ship hull
geometry and ocean environments.  In many cases such numerical
"model tests" are aimed at replacing the traditional, expensive
practice of physical model tests.  Detailed and accurate laboratory
measurements are however essential towards sufficient confidence
in these numerical models: for validation of their physics-based
modelling of fluid-flow and associated energy-transfer mechanisms;
and for certification of a physical parameter-based envelope within
which such validation holds.  Because this validation must be
established for each computational step representing a re-distribution
of energy within the fluid, the corresponding laboratory tests must
provide a very accurate, high-resolution description of the kinematic
and dynamic properties of the fluid.  Recent advancements in the
measurement techniques and related data-processing softwares
presented and discussed in this conference are of great significance
to the numerical model validation and certification.<P>

<B>4. Conference Highlights: Advanced Techniques</B><P>

The following provides a brief description of recent advancements in
two areas: Measurement Techniques and Measurement Equipment.<P>

<B>4.1 Measurement Techniques</B><P>

<B>4.1.1  Combined Application of Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) and
Laser-Doppler Anemometry (LDA):</B> A paper by Volkert, et al, of the
University of Erlangen-Nurnberg, Germany, describes a combined
PIV-LDA technique which is used to measure the properties of a
swirling flow under compression.  Previous measurement approaches
to this problem had been those of scanning LDA measurements,
two-point velocity measurements, the use of filters in the frequency
domain, etc., due to the limitation that the LDA velocity is known
only at one point and any global flow-movement cannot be deduced
from it.  PIV on the other hand is a whole-field technique, but today
it does not provide the sufficient spatial and temporal resolution
necessary for a statistical description of the turbulence field.  The
combined approach presented here, both in the experimental set-up
and in data recognition and processing, are of general nature and
therefore applicable to a range of fluid flow problems.<P>

<B>4.1.2  Application of Particle Tracking Velocimetry (PTV):</B> A paper by
Rothlubbers, et al, of the Technical University Berlin, Germany,
describes a new technique for the analysis of single-frame,
double-exposure PTV images.  As against Digital Particle Image
Velocimetry (DPIV), the PTV technique offers the advantages of
high signal to noise ratio by not requiring a large concentration of
particles; it allows a quantitative measurement of macroscopic
particle behavior with a low-energy laser combined with a camera.
Overall, principally because of its low particle-concentration
requirement, it can be a far less time consuming technique
than DPIV.<P>

<B>4.1.3  Laser-Induced Fluorescence Tomography:</B> A paper by Merkel,
et al, of the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, Zurich, presents
a novel approach to the 3-D velocity measurement, using an adaptive
least-squares correlation of "grey" level distributions of patches
generated by Laser-Induced Fluorescence (LIF).  Without the
requirement of multiple measurements and subsequent differentiation,
this method allows the determination of the fluid vorticity vector and
rate-of-strain tensor.<P>

<B>4.1.4  Holographic Particle Image Velocimetry (HPIV):</B> A paper by
Katz, et al, of the Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, USA,
presents a hybrid HPIV measurement system developed under the
sponsorship of ONR and the US National Science Foundation (NSF).
In the case of the standard PIV technique a local velocity is obtained
from double-exposure images of the flow field, measuring the particle
displacement.  The HPIV technique, however, is capable of recording
data in a three-dimensional space and therefore providing a 3-D
distribution of velocity.  In their design of the hybrid system the
authors use in-line and off-axis holography for forward- and side-
scattering, respectively, together with a phase conjugate wave which
illuminates the hologram from a direction opposite of the recording
reference beam.  The reconstructed phase-conjugate image allows
the elimination of aberrations introduced by the relay lenses.<P>

<B>4.1.5  Scanning Particle Image Velocimetry (SPIV):</B> A paper by
Brucker of Aerodynamic Institute, RWTH Aachen, Germany,
describes the use of SPIV, an alternative to HPIV for 3-D velocity
measurements.  The paper describes a technique which uses two
color-coded overlapping light sheets and applies a spatial cross-
correlation to the images in the overlapping planes for the
out-of-plane velocity component.<P>

<B>4.1.6  Jet Flames by Laser-Induced Fluorescence (LIF):</B>
A paper by Meier, et al, of Institut fur Physikalische Chemie der
Verbrennung, Stutgart, describes a novel approach to the
characterization of jet diffusion flames in terms of temperature and
chemical composition by spontaneous "Raman Scattering" together
with LIF measurements.  The experiment was aimed principally at
the quantification of a major pollutant in the exhaust: the family of
oxides of nitrogen.<P>

<B>4.2 Measurement Equipment and Softwares</B><P>

The above researchers are no doubt dependent largely on the state
of the art in measurement eqipment and softwares as enabling
technology, developed and provided by organizations dedicated to
this need.  The following three organizations stand out as being in
the lead of such development.<P>

<B>4.2.1 DANTEC Measurement Technology</B><P>

With its corporate headquarters in Skovlunde, Denmark, DANTEC
is an international organization with branch offices in the UK, the
Netherlands, Ireland, France, Germany, Hong Kong, China, and
the USA.  Together with hard- and software capabilities for real-time
data analysis in many cases, DANTEC's flow-measurement systems
include PIV, LDA, hot-wire anemometry, Burst Spectrum analysis,
particle sizing and analysis, as well as laser positioning systems
used by aerospace, automotive and shipbuilding industries.<P>

<B>4.2.2 TSI Incorporated</B><P>

With its corporate headquarters in St Paul, MN, USA, TSI is an
international organization with branch offices in Germany and France.
TSI provides a wide range of LDV systems, up to a Doppler
Frequency of 100 MHz, with single-, dual- and three-component,
single- and dual-axis configurations.  TSI's other capabilities include
a patented method for a real-time estimation of a Doppler burst
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR); and the ability to optimize, on-line, the
the sampling rate for each burst together with SNR-based recognition
of the beginning and end of burst, in order to obtain the center of
burst from which samples were collected.<P>

<B>4.2.3 Oxford Lasers Limited</B><P>

Based in Abingdon, Oxfordshire, UK, with branch offices in the USA
and Germany, Oxford lasers has developed very specialized
capabilities in laser imaging for high-speed photography, flow and
welding visualization, combustion analysis, PIV, etc.  Their principal
innovation is "Laserstrobe", which uses the copper laser of high peak
power and very short pulse (about a 30-nanosecond duration).  This
allows a time-resolved, very-high-resolution imaging system.  The
Laserstrobe recording is on a standard 35-mm film, with a resolution
density of at least 125 lines/mm, at a rate of at least 40,000 frames
per second with an exposure duration of 20-60 nanoseconds.<P>

<B>5. Assessment</B><P>

As observed in sections 4.1 and 4.2 above, there is strong emphasis
in the European fluid mechanics community on the advancement of
measurement techniques and technology.  As with many other areas
of basic research, a greater level of investment is evident in Germany
towards an experiment-based understanding of the physics of
various complex fluid-flow phenomena.  Another noteworthy
observation is that of the close relationship between such scientists
and those engaged in the development of enabling technologies of
equipment for the acquisition, processing and analysis of data.<P>

<B>6. Related Plans for the Future</B><P>

As described in section 3 above, the Navy has a great need today
for laboratory experiment-based validation and certification of the
various numerical simulation models.  I plan to hold an international
workshop in a few months towards establishing their specific needs,
related experimental plans, and possible international collaboration
in both sponsorship and execution of the research plans.<P>

<B>2. Summary</B><P>

Hosted by Professor C. Rice, Dean of Engineering, and Professor
W. G. Price, Head of the Department of Ship Science, I visited
on 06 August 1996 the academic and research staff as well as the
laboratories of two Departments of the University of Southampton:
(a) Department of Ship Science; and (b) Department of Electronics.
Professor Price, long regarded as one of world's foremost authorities
on the subject of ship dynamics, joined the Department of Ship
Science eight years ago; and since then he has brought the quality
and diversity of ship related research in this Department to match
today's specialized demands.  The prominent research areas in this
Department are those of ship dynamics, propulsor hydrodynamics
with emphasis on computational fluid dynamics (CFD), and ship
structures with emphasis on light-weight composites.  In the area of
undergraduate education this Department has a unique requisite,
involving all of the real-world features: project definition; preparation of
technical and cost proposals; presentations; obtaining approval and
budget; project planning; hardware purchase; project management
and execution; and, possible budget cut!      My interest in the
Department of Electronics --now called the Department of Electronics
and Computer Science-- was initially related to its research in fuzzy
logic with application to real-time active control systems design.
This Department is however engaged in very high quality research in
a number of areas, including some which combine computer science
with neuroscience.  Until about the mid-1950s, in most universities
the areas of electronics formed a special disciplinary aspect of the
study of electrical engineering.  Established in 1946 as a Department
of its own entity, Southampton's Department of Electronics and
Computer Science is the oldest such department among the UK
universities.<P>

<B>3. Research and Academic Activities</B><P>

Areas of research and academic emphasis in the Department of
Ship Science and the Department of Electronics and Computer
Science are outlined in the following.<P>

<B>3.1 Department of Ship Science</B><P>

Recognition and reputation of the University of Southampton is
world-wide for its excellence in the study and research of ship and
ocean sciences.  The Department of Ship Science is however
separate from the Southampton Oceanography Centre, and its focus
is on basic and applied sciences as they relate to naval architecture
and offshore technology.<P>

<B>3.1.1 Research Areas:</B>  Ship Dynamics, Propulsor Hydrodynamics,
and Structures are the principal areas of research in this Department.
Especially in the prediction of ship motions and sea loads, while the
emphasis throughout the world now is on elaborate numerical models
based on boundary-element and Navier-Stokes approaches often
requiring days of computer time, this Department has in addition
maintained extensive analytical research towards physics-based
problem formulation and understanding of the kinematics as well as
dynamics of ship motions.  Corresponding numerical solution
procedures are then quite straightforward, requiring very modest
computer time while providing sufficient and accurate information on
the rigid-body response of ships and offshore structures to potential
wave loads.  A most recent and very noteworthy of such research
efforts in hydrodynamics is the development of a unified mathematical
model describing the maneuvering of a ship travelling in a seaway.
Through the application of impulse response functions and convolution
integrals to represent fluid actions, this unified model --together with
the traditional formulations of slow-motion derivatives, oscillatory
derivatives, and hydrodynamic coefficients-- describes the dynamical
behavior and maneuvering of a ship travelling in a seaway.
Research in propulsor hydrodynamics emphasizes the mechanisms
of lift modification in a turbulent boundary layer, the shedding of blade
vortices and associated acoustics, tip vortex generation and mixing,
etc., by way of numerical models comprising formulations of
Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations, Large Eddy
Simulation (LES), and potential vortex theories.  Development of a
generalized "inverse design" formulation is a major research effort for
direct application to the design and optimization of propulsors.
Research in ship and offshore structures appears to have a clear
emphasis on light-weight composites, with researchers working in
close partnership with material scientists.  The principal material type
under investigation is the carbon fiber re-inforced plastic, with a large
variation in its composition, lamination and its directivity, structure
and dimensionality of weave, etc.  The approach of research is largely
empirical, as dictated by its nature, and it has a very direct focus on
the real-world application: structural configurations for offshore and
ship use with particular attention to the unique and complex joints,
as well as the nature of steady, transient, and cyclic loads.  In
addition to problems in common with isotropic metal structures, an
inherent problem in the case of composites is that of simultaneously
meeting the requirements of strength, deflection, and dimensional
limits.  Additionally, the prediction of fatigue failure is difficult today:
For metals of traditional use there exists a sizable volume fatigue
data in the form of "S-N Curves" while for composites that are often
in their developmental stage such data are still being generated.  The
research approach at Southampton is very comprehensive, rigorous,
and thorough; and, as a result, some of these developments are now
being transitioned to actual ship structural applications.<P>

<B>3.1.2 Academic Curriculum:</B>  In general, a UK university appears to
place a much greater emphasis on the undergraduate involvement in
university research than is evident in the US.  In particular, it is true
of the departments of marine technology and ship sciences.  As part
of their graduation requirements the Southampton undergraduates in
Ship Science take part in research projects in their Department, in
addition to their independent work towards the Design Thesis.  A very
unique requirement must additionally be fulfilled by the third-year
undergraduates here: one of a program technical and financial
management.  Students in groups of three or four present to a panel
their technical and cost proposals for projects of their choice.  If a
proposal is accepted based on its technical merit, students then
prepare and present a detailed technical schedule together with a
breakdown of costs.  If it is approved, students are given actual
money for the necessary purchase of hardware and ancillaries.  They
then have exactly three months in which to complete their project,
within cost.  Sometimes they may even be notified of a budget cut,
and asked to tailor their project to a reduced funding level.  Examples
of such projects are an operational wind tunnel, various ship models
for use, a number of complex composite structures for laboratory
tests, and the design and manufacture of an experimental set-up for
material fatigue tests.<P>

<B>3.2 Department of Electronics and Computer Science</B><P>

Established in 1946 as Department of Electronics, this is the first
such Department among UK universities.  My initial interest in this
Department was in connection with its research efforts in fuzzy logic
and related application to active control systems design.  During my
discussions with professors and researchers I came to know of a
large number of areas of research in this Department, some of which
are outlined below.<P>

<B>3.2.1 Research Areas:</B>  The Image, Speech & Intelligence Systems
Research Group (ISIS) carries out fundamental research including
the formulation of "neurofuzzy" algorithms for modelling of command,
control, perception and cognition, and speech processing --much of
it in the context of systems engineering and integration for various
infrastructures related to warfare, public utilities, and transportation
industries.  The goal is that of an Intelligent Autonomous System
which combines the distributed human elements with a complex,
integrated system to perform tasks autonomously in uncertain
and dynamic environments.  The Intelligent Control, Modelling and
Estimation Group (ICME) is active in advanced research developing
an autonomous active-control algorithm for dynamic processes.
This group has developed novel fuzzy-logic algorithms.  An on-board
command and control system has been successfully used on an
unmanned underwater vehicle (UUV).  Planned future work in this
area includes distributed systems of artificial intelligence (AI) for
command and control.  A few other examples of advanced research
are the development of a channel-adaptive speech transceiver; biased
temporal filtering in ultrasound imaging; intelligent parallel image
analysis; and developments in optical fibre technology.<P>

<B>4. Assessment</B><P>

In the Department of Ship Science, while the level of research in
numerical prediction and analysis models in hydrodynamics in
general lacks some of the sophistication and complexity in
formulation, its continued emphasis on the analytical research has
brought significant understanding of the physical phenomena and
therefore the capability for their physics-based modelling.  The
research in the area of ship structures is most comprehensive,
systematic, and thorough.  The undergraduate academic curriculum
of this Department can be regarded as a model, with a very sensible
balance of classroom education, laboratory research, and training in
project formulation, planning, execution, and technical and financial
management.   Research in the Department of Electronics and
Computer Science as it relates to fuzzy- and neuro-fuzzy-logic, and
neural network algorithm for optimal control systems, is of the highest
level of sophistication; and much of it has been implemented and
validated.<P>

<B>2. Summary</B><P>

I visited the Mechanical Engineering Department of the University of
Leeds on 05 September 1996 for a discussion and demonstration of
its computer model supporting an integrated approach to definition,
manufacture, and in-service upgrades of an engineering product.  In
conformity with the ISO standards for the exchange product model
data, the combined architecture of the computer models comprises
modules for requirements, resources, their interpretation and test
for compatibility; the development of product model of a generic
description for manufacture; and life-cycle configuration control.
Though in most aspects of its structure this integrated model is in
its developmental phase, it nonetheless has a sound, logical basis
for its concept and therefore the promise of a rational methodology
for simultaneous engineering in product definition, manufacture, and
life-cycle management.<P>

<B>3. Background</B><P>

In the UK, both the Ministry of Defence (MOD) and the Engineering
and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) have over the
recent years maintained a focus on research in the development of
methodology and engineering practices towards streamlining the
steps in Process Engineering and Manufacture as well as in-service
configuration control and logistics support.  The Government and the
private sector are equally active today in their efforts to reduce costs
related to engineering manufacture and maintenance.  The model
currently under development at Leeds, sponsored primarily by the
Government, is an example of such efforts.<P>

<B>4. The Leeds Model: A Brief Description</B><P>

At the top level the Leeds model begins with two Definition and
Descriptions Protocols: the Application Protocol (AP) and the
Resources Protocol (RP).  The Application Protocol first defines the
Application Activity Model comprising the requirements of product,
maintenance, or logistics.  It then translates the information in terms
of the model parameters consistent with ISO standards and, where
applicable, the NATO Stock Numbers (NSN); and the translated
information is then written into the Application Requirements Model.
In parallel, the Resources Protocol provides the Integrated Resources
Model, comprising numerical models and databases for generation
of geometric and topological representation, product structure
configuration, computer-aided design, finite-element analysis for
material and scantlings selection, necessary checks on kinematics,
towards computer-aided manufacture.  The fundamentals of the
model architecture is based on matching the Application
Requirements Model with the Integrated Resources Model in a way
which could enable an automated process that begins with
engineering manufacture or maintenance requirements, selects the
necessary Resources as well as the criteria for an optimal product
decision, and provides the necessary information for computer-aided
manufacture.  This automated decision-based matching process
involves a very logical engineering interpretation of the product
requirements which often are provided in operational parameters.
The current approach, under development, is to further translate the
Requirements Model into Application-Interpreted Definition Model,
and the Integrated Resources Model into Application-Interpreted
Constructs, so that the "Interpreted" models can have a common-
definition-based interface for information transfer and iteration.<P>

<B>5. Assessment</B><P>

Though in most aspects of its structure the Leeds model is currently
under development, it nonetheless defines an integrated architecture
on a very sound logical basis.  The challenge will largely remain in
the various stages of decision-making process which will require a
very sophisticated logic of artificial intelligence (AI).  Relative to
component design decisions towards a set of requirements the goal
of this model is more complex, as it to a large degree attempts to
take into account a system-level synergism towards a product
decision.  However, the University of Leeds is a recognized leader
in the field of Automated Process Engineering and therefore its
progress in continued development of this model is worth studying.<P>

Dantec Measurement Technology</H3>

<B>1. Key Words</B><P>

<I>Fluid Flow Measurement; Laser-Doppler Anemometry;
Particle Image Velocimetry; Fluid Flow Visualization.</I><P>

<B>2. Summary</B><P>

I visited on 12 September 1996 the Bristol, UK, facility of Dantec
Measurement Technology for an update on its recent developments
in complex fluid flow measurement techniques.  Long recognized as
a world leader in measurement technology, Dantec is an international
organization with its corporate headquarters in Skovlunde, Denmark,
and branch offices in the UK, Germany, France, the Netherlands,
Hong Kong, China, and the USA.  In addition to its recent advanced
techniques in Laser-Doppler Anemometry (LDA) with real-time data
processing capabilities, Dantec has maintained a consistent focus
on developments towards the understanding of fluid flow phenomena
which are not easily understood by point-measurement techniques
such as LDA or hot-wire anemometry.  As a result, it has made a
substantial investment in research towards the development of a very
comprehensive method based on Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV),
together with capabilities for on-line, real-time processing of data.
In addition to its efforts towards non-intrusive measurements of
fluid-flow properties, Dantec has also utilized its laser expertise in
the development of precision measurement techniques required in
product manufacture.<P>

<B>3. Background</B><P>

During the past decade, as computational fluid dynamics (CFD)
tools grew in their capabilities to predict complex fluid flows, the
techniques for accurate measurement of such flow fields received
equal emphasis.  Previously-employed measurement techniques
such as hot-wire anemometry, though very sophisticated, would
often alter the basic flow structure.  Non-intrusive approaches were
first started with the use of Laser-Doppler Anemometry (LDA).  But,
because the velocity provided by LDA is known only at one point,
a global flow movement history could not be derived from it.  Next
came the Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) technique which, though
a whole-field technique, does not often provide a sufficient spatial
and temporal resolution.  Currently, a combined LDA-PIV approach
is being investigated among other techniques such as Holographic
PIV and Particle Tracking Velocimetry (PTV).<P>

<B>4. Dantec's Capabilities</B><P>

Today, Dantec's most recent and most advanced development is that
of "FlowMap", a comprehensive set-up for flow visualization, and data
acquisition and processing based on the PIV technique.  In addition
to especially-designed devices of electro-optics and laser optics for
proper illumination of complex flow fields (e.g., breaking waves, jets,
flows around airfoils, engine flows, etc.) as well as high-resolution
recording devices, this system also includes Dantec's "PIV 2000
Processor", quite possibly the world's only processor designed
uniquely for real-time treatment of the vast PIV data.  One great
advantage of this system is that, by virtue of its efficiency in data
acquisition, processing and management, it enables quick decisions
as to the quality and completeness of information (providing a quick
turn-around for a repeat test with set-up reconfiguration, if necessary.)
Another of Dantec's innovative development is an analysis software
called Light Scattering Analysis (LSA) which provides the mechanism
of how light is scattered by spherical particles in the fluid.  In the LDA
or PIV experiments the detailed knowledge of the scattered light field
is often essential.  The Burst Spectrum Analyzer (BSA), recently
developed by Dantec, is aimed at experimental efficiency: its analog
output provides results on line, enabling real-time optimization of the
experimental set-up.  The Flow Velocity Analyzer (FVA) is another
example of Dantec's software capabilities: a correlation signal
processor for the LDA, the FVA has a large dynamic range for
velocity and, compared to most other processors, is able to identify
and analyze information with lower signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).<P>

<B>5. Assessment</B><P>

With offices and facilities in eight countries, Dantec Measurement
Technology has long been established as one of the leaders in the
development of technology and techniques for measurement of
complex fluid-flow properties.  This organization remains in close
contact with scientists in both experimental and computational
science in order to understand new requirements of information,
towards new developments as well as modification of existing
software for unique test conditions.<P>

MTD-PSTI Merger: CMPT</H3>

<B>1. Key Words</B><P>

<I>Multi-Sponsor Research; Ship and Offshore Technology;
Petroleum Technology; Subsurface Geology; Petrochemistry;
Petrophysics; Offshore Drilling Technology.</I><P>

<B>2. Summary</B><P>

In <A HREF="http://www.ehis.navy.mil/pmnews2.htm">Newsletter 96-002</A> of last year I reported on the structure, operation
and scope of Marine Technology Directorate (MTD), a UK consortium
for research in ship and offshore technologies, of which ONR had just
become the first non-UK-based member.  Very recently a merger has
occurred between MTD and the Edinburgh-based Petroleum Science
and Technology Institute (PSTI) which has been an organization for
basic and applied research in sciences related to petroleum and its
extraction.  Name for the amalgamated organization has been chosen
as Centre for Marine and Petroleum Technology (CMPT).<P>

<B>3. MTD Background</B><P>

A research consortium aimed at the advancement of marine as well as
offshore technology, MTD has been regarded in the UK as a prime
exemplar of a multi-sponsor research organization.  Areas of research
have been based on the requirements of government, the needs of
industry, and the capabilities of academic and applied researchers.
Responsibility for the formal management of the research programs
has been with Marinetech South Limited, a Southampton-based non-
profit organization formed solely for this function.  In reality, the
financial support for the MTD research programs has come largely
from the UK taxpayers, as much of the funding (between 70 and 80
percent) has been provided by the UK Government's Engineering and
Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) and only the remainder
has been collectively provided by the consortium members.  Last year
ONR became the first non-UK-based member of this consortium.<P>

<B>4. PSTI Background</B><P>

An Edinburgh-based research organization, PSTI has been engaged in
basic and applied research related to petroleum and its extraction. The
primary areas of emphasis have been subsurface geological prediction
together with reservoir characterization from seismic data; reservoir
modelling; study of materials in deep-water environments; hydrates
and their control; subsea drilling; subsea cleaning; subsea batteries;
subsea communication; and a number of topics in petrochemistry and
petrophysics.<P>

<B>5. Assessment of Future: Newly-Formed CMPT</B><P>

It is currently understood that the charter, structure, management, and
sponsor participation of CMPT will follow those of the former MTD, as
described in section 3 above.  It is naturally speculated that the areas
of research formerly within PSTI will enjoy relative emphasis in funding
as the potential sponsors for such research are oil companies.  The
UK Government's support, by way of EPSRC, for research in the areas
related to ship and offshore structure technology is however expected
to remain as high as it has been for the MTD research.<P>

Newsletter No. 1 
</H3>
<H3>Russian Foundation for Basic Research</H3>
<P>The field of biophysics covers a vast range of topics. Despite a
lack of definition, biophysics, an amalgamation of the biological and
physical sciences, is recognised as a major scientific activity that has
led to spectacular developments in biology and biotechnology.
</P><P> "European Biophysics" is an electronic newsletter that reports
on items of biophysics (including biotechnology, neurobiophysics,
psychology, psychophysics, chemical detection, bioelectronics,
biomimetic materials, physics of interfaces, personnel training,
underwater bioacoustics, etc.) discovered in Europe, FSU and the Middle
East.
</P><P> My general intent is to send short, 1-3 page newsletters. In
the future I can mail a newsletter series on a specific topic for those
who have interest in that topic.
</P><P> This newsletter is the first report about my trip to Russia in
November of 1994. This first report contains general data about the
trip; newsletters that follow will be technical reports that I divided

of opportunity for the Navy, and US high-tech industries for partnership
and collaboration in various unique and novel R&amp;D projects in
Russia. This window of opportunity should be used expeditiously as
conditions in academic institutions are deteriorating rapidly. Most of
these academic institutions presently have 3 day work-week and do not
have funds to pay utilities and communication bills.

Moscow, 117334, Russia
</P><P> ONREUR: J. Silva (Director), N. Bottka (electronics), J. Simon
(manufacturing technologies), and I. Vodyanoy (biophysics)<BR>  RFBR:
Fortov (Director), Alfimov (deputy director), Dykhne (head of Physics
section) Other: Ostrovsky, Rachimov
</P><P> The RUSSIAN FOUNDATION FOR BASIC RESEARCH (RFBR) was
established by a Presidential Decree in 1992 as an independent federal
agency for the advancement of science in Russia. They receive and review
research proposals and award individual, pilot and group grants,
instrumentation grants, support of data bases and information systems,
and publication projects.<BR>  Their budget comes from the Federal
Government as a fixed share of the Federal budget for science.
Additional funds are expected to come from foreign sources through
different co-operation and collaboration projects.<BR>  Presently the
RFBR share in 1994 total R&amp;D Russian budget is 5%. RFBR will match
$12 M from SOROS foundation, $2- $5 M from NSF (US), will have matching
funds for German Science Foundation (Fortov' s words). Fortov's office
also works on agreements with Japan and China.<BR>  Thirty panels
(10-16 experts) out of the pool of about 1,000 scientists, reviewing
(for a fee) about 3,000 proposals annually. They allow 20% grantee
institutional overhead.<BR>  RFBR presently supports about 1,200
institutions in the fields of: Mathematics, computer and information
sciences, physics, chemistry, biology, geophysics, atmosphere,
oceanography, humanities and arts. The average grant is $10,000/year.<BR>
    I have a complete list of all projects funded (1994) by RFBR. The
list has the PI's name, project title, and the name of institution. It
is published in Russian, a copy has been mailed to ONR and was made
available to the other services at Edison House.
</P><P><B>3. Trip Experiences</B>
</P><P> Planning for this trip took more than two months. E-mail,
telephone calls to Moscow, St. Petersburg to a more than 20 parties. I
have restored my network of friends and alumna in Russia. Many of them
have become department chairs, institute directors, academicians, full
generals and government officials.<BR>  Our experience indicated that
the number of people in our S&amp;T review party (4) was too large. A
group of this size made planning difficult on the Russian side. I think,
the right number for a party is two. If it is more than two, then
Russians see us as a "delegation" and treat us differently, that is,
they treat us more "officially". That means they start to set up all the
visits from the "centre" to periphery and it takes a lot of time and
puts a lot of unnecessary bureaucratic barriers in the way of visits
arrangement.<BR>  I specifically asked our hosts to treat our party as
a private one. This was very difficult an was possible to accomplish
only with the help of my colleagues' network. During our visit in Moscow
and St. Petersburg there were 10- 15 people working for us behind the
scenes. There was even a person waiting in line at the petrol station to
fuel our cars.<BR>  Dr. Rachimov, a representative of East-West
Technology Partners Inc. (US Virginia) was a big help to Jack Simon and
to all of us. Academician Ostrovsky, who was our primary host, worked 20
hours a day. He travelled with us and helped in both cities, Moscow and
St. Petersburg. His assistance, overall was invaluable to the success of
this mission.
</P><P><B>4. Next Steps</B>
</P><P> There is a tremendous opportunity for the US government
agencies and industry to leverage the enormous scientific and
technological resources in Russian academic and private R&amp;D
institutions. During many years of isolation and secrecy Russian
scientists developed some highly original ideas and technologies that
have not been available. They are available now at all levels, from
conferences to collaboration, to joint projects, and to direct funding
or co-funding.<BR>  The Russian Foundation for Basic Research could be
used as an instrument for proposals screening and review by experts and
also for a fiscal control. RFBR directors expressed their willingness to
screen proposals according to our list of interest, to review them and
to give recommendations. They also proposed to disburse our grants
according to our contractual and legal prescription (collecting reports,
advancing payments, etc.) by using their accountants and contract system
and taking 2-5% of negotiable overhead. Grants can be made to
individuals and they say that PI's institutional overhead can be
specified by the US granting agency.<BR>  The Russian Foundation for
Basic Research proposed to match DOD funding of the projects they
recommended. They also could match funding of workshops and conferences.<BR>
    Proposals from private R&amp;D industry could be developed with the
help of East-West Technology Partners Inc.
</P><P><B>5. Concerns</B>
</P><P> Most Russian scientists are reluctant to submit proposals
directly (personally) to any US agency and specifically to the DOD
agencies. They prefer if a proposal would be submitted through their
institutional directors or would be pre-screened and duplicated for us
by the Russian Foundation for Basic Science. That way all "formalities"
will be satisfied.<BR>  A major concern expressed by many scientists
working in application fields regards their intellectual rights. They
would like to have a grant or a contract that would legally protect
their intellectual rights and are reluctant to submit any technical
proposals or give their samples out without understanding the means of
protections available.

</OL><P><B>1. Summary</B>
</P><P> During many years of isolation, Russian scientists developed
many highly original ideas and technologies. While on my recent visit to
Moscow and St Petersburg in Russia I discovered the few interesting
coatings with potentially significant practical importance. These
provide an opportunity for the Navy, and US high-tech industries for
partnership and collaboration in these unique and novel R&amp;D projects
in Russia.
</P><P><B> 2. Pressure sensitive coating</B>
</P><P> A pressure sensitive surface coating was developed at the
Institute of Physics of the St. Petersburg State University. The coating
is luminescent and its luminescent properties depend on the air pressure
in the range of 0.1-1000 Torr. These luminescence changes can follow the
air pressure change with frequency up to 1kHz. The coating can be
applied to a virtually any material. It could be used for example for
dynamic airflow studies in a wind tunnel.
</P><P><B> 3. Electrostatic protection coating</B>
</P><P> The Plasma Test Inc. has developed and tested a coating that
protects plastic and composite materials against an electrostatic
charge. This coating was utilised on fuselage materials of helicopters
and aeroplanes.<BR>  The coating, when polymerised on the surface,
becomes an integral part of the surface that is uninterrupted
electrically (with conductivity of about 1/2 of aluminium; mesh-like;
flexible) with thickness of about 25 microns and weight of about 40
grams per square meter. <BR>  During the tests it was able to dissipate
from 8 to 10 direct hits of about 300 kV without any damage. The coating
was tested by Sukhoi avionics designers.
</P><P><B> 4. Anti-biofouling coating</B>
</P><P> The Plasma Test Inc. research division has developed and tested
a multilayer non-toxic coating that effectively prevents biofouling in
sea water. The coating is porous, contains heavy metals that form some
salt compounds which fill the pores when exposed to the water. <BR> 
The coating was tested in the Baltic Sea, Indian and Atlantic Oceans.
Tests were conducted using the coating on a hull metal, fiber glass, and
a concrete. Some underwater port structures (in Ethiopia) were coated
and found free from bio-deposits after 7 years of exploitation. A coated
part of the ship's hull was also found practically free from deposits
after six months of navigation in southern hemisphere seas.<BR>  The
coating is claimed to be environmentally safe (salts are leaching very
slowly out of the pores). The coating technology production on
industrial scale and technology of surface treatment are fully developed
and tested. A process of surface treatment is simple, inexpensive, not
time consuming and can be applied to a hull in a dry dock. 
</P><P><B>5. Carbon-lead electrodes for batteries</B>
</P><P> A lead coating process to cover a carbon cloth using plasma
metallization was developed by the Plasma Test Inc. to replace lead
electrode plates in lead-sulphuric acid batteries. This lead covered
carbon electrodes weight 50% less and have 1.4 times increase in life
expectancy compared to the regular solid lead electrodes for batteries.
Batteries made with these compound electrodes have 1.2 times increase in
cold discharge current.
</P><P><B> 6. Coating for chemically aggressive environments</B>
</P><P> The "ANTECH" analytical centre (Moscow) has developed a surface
coating that is highly chemically resistive. The coating can be applied
to a metal and metal alloys surfaces. The coating is named "Tetron" and
is based on organo-soluble polymers with specific modifiers for
adhesion. The coating was tested for a long term use in chemical and
biotechnological reactors, sea water, acids and bases. 
</P><P><B> 7. Protection for carbon electrodes</B>
</P><P> A protective coating for reducing breakdown rates of high
current density arc producing graphite electrodes was developed at the
Plasma Test Inc., and then tested by industry in the full scale
industrial processes. The coating is produced by using a cold plasma
spraying of aluminium compounds (0.4-0.6 mm thickness). The electrode
breakdown rate was reduced by 35% and service time was increased by 50%.
About 150 tons of electrodes were tested.
</P><P><B> 8. Next steps</B>
</P><P> All of these sample coatings can be purchased. For those with
further interest ONR Europe can assist in obtaining additional technical
and proprietary information on the coatings. For those interested,
proposals from private Russian R&amp;D industry could be developed with
the help of East-West Technology Partners Inc.

</P><P> This report outlines some projects in the area of sensory
perception, psychophysics and neurophysiology that attracted my
attention by their potential applications in both military and civilian
sectors.
</P><P><B> 2. Emotion Detector</B>
</P><P> Dr. Frolov and co-workers from the Institute Of Higher Neural
Activity & Neurophysiology Of Russian Academy Of Sciences of Russian
Academy of Science(RAS) in Moscow developed an original and
mathematically sophisticated model of human speech analysis. Using 8
parameters of human speech the model is capable of determining the
emotional state of an individual with high fidelity. The model was
developed jointly with the group of mathematicians from the other RAS
institute.<BR>  Multiple speech tests showed that physiological
parameters correlate well with the model's prediction. Tests were
conducted in the laboratory as well as in the field. These field tests
were carried out during simulated and actual jet fighter flights. The
speech analysing system takes just about 30 min. to learn individual
differences.<BR>  Regular telemetry reports physiological parameters,
such as pulse rate and blood pressure, whereas this system can actually
report on the subject's emotion i.e. joy, sorrow, fear, hate or whatever
they are experiencing at the time. The system can be used for personnel
training.
</P><P><B>3. Sound Source Movement Simulation</B>
</P><P> At the Pavlov Institute Of Physiology RAS, St. Petersburg, the
group headed by Dr. Altman has developed a novel and unique auditory
simulation of a sound source's three-dimensional spatial movement and
velocity change. The simulation development was based on psychometric
measurements, an analytical and computer modelling.<BR>  The model was
realised (for two dimensions) as the electronic device that can simulate
the movement of a sound source moving with changing direction and
velocity. This simulation device can be used in computer virtual reality
models and can be integrated into sonar or a radar output for two or
three dimensional orientation enhancement.
</P><P><B>4. Assymetric Brains</B>
</P><P> Dr. Chernigovskaya from the Sechenov Institute Of Evolutionary
Physiology RAS, St. Petersburg, works on mathematical modelling of
cerebral hemispheric functions. It is a multidisciplinary project in the
areas of psychosemantics and neurocognitive research, joint with the
group of knowledge analysts and computer specialists from the St.
Petersburg Technical University. The objective of the project is to
understand and formally define cerebral asymmetry of higher functions by
probing mental and sensory spaces. The ultimate goal understand the
biological basis of artificial intelligence.<BR>  A long-term
preliminary study (of about 15 years) was conducted to define cerebral
mechanisms of individual cognitive styles as a function of cerebral
right-left asymmetry. The studies were conducted using large groups of
children and adults.<BR>  It was established that significant
improvement of instruction process could be reached when instructor's
and students' brain assymetry are matched. The data allow the use of
individual brain asymmetry to substantially improve computer instruction
for computer aided learning processes. The work will greatly contribute
to designing and improving man-computer interface in general.
</P><P><B>5. The Cocktail Party Effect (Selective Listening)</B>
</P><P> At the N.N. Andreev Acoustic Institute RAS, Moscow, Dr.
Dubrovky's laboratory developed a mathematical model of the "listening"
attention mechanism. This mechanism allows conversation in a noisy room
(as a cocktail party effect) and is studied using psychoacoustic
experiments and mathematical modelling.<BR>  The model is tuned to a
number of spatial parameters of an acoustic field. An optimum algorithm
for a sound perception in human (panoramic listening vs. selectivity)
can be realised computationally, provided that the signals pass through
a bank of filters with parameters similar to the critical band filters
of hearing. The mathematical model correlates well with the
psychoacoustic experiments. This mathematical model can be utilised as a
device for a selective multidirectional sound detector.
</P><P><B>6. Electric Fish Technology</B>
</P><P> Environmental Biology group headed by Dr. Baron from the
Severtsov Institute Of Evolutionary Animal Morphology And Ecology, RAS,
Moscow developed a novel technology for underwater short-range
orientation, location and communication based on propagation and
reception principles derived from electric fish.<BR>  The laboratory
has studied electrogeneration, electroreception, electromagnetic field
structure and information processing in so-called "weakly electric
fish". Under a non-wave propagation specification they developed the
full range of technologies for prediction of radiation patterns and
efficiency of electric and magnetic antennas, signal-to-noise ratios,
propagation distance limits, etc.<BR>  A number of experiments were
carried out in water-to- water, water-to-air, and water-to-ground
communication systems. As a result wireless underwater speech
communication for divers, underwater telemetric system, and an
underwater short-range orientation system were designed and successfully
tested: .
</P><P><B>7. Directional Hearing in Dolphins</B>
</P><P> Auditory brainstem response to sound clicks from sources at
different positions were recorded in dolphins by Dr. Supin research
group from the Severtsov Institute Of Evolutionary Animal Morphology And
Ecology, RAS, in Moscow.<BR>  The position of the dolphin's "acoustic
window" was determined by measurements of acoustic delays. The acoustic
window was found to lie close to the auditory meatus and the bulla
rather than on the lower jaw.<BR>  A wave observed in the auditory
brainstem responses was found to be sensitive to the side of sound
presentation. Dependence of the wave threshold on location of the sound
source showed that the interaural intensity difference in dolphins was
more than 20 dB<BR>  Binaural hearing mechanisms were studied in
dolphins. It was shown that the azimuth position of a sound source at
10-15 degrees from the longitudinal axis elicited interaural intensity
disparities up to 20 dB and interaural latency differences as large as
250 microseconds. The latency differences are proposed to be an
effective way of intensity disparity coding.
</P><P><B>8. Next Steps</B>
</P><P> Russian scientists are interested in collaboration at all
levels, from conferences to short visits, to joint projects. ONR Europe
has funds to support European scientists' visits in the US government
and academic laboratories. Proposals can be submitted by individual
scientists upon request.<BR>  The Russian Foundation for Basic Research
(see European Newsletter #1) proposed to match DOD funding of the
projects they recommended. They could also match funding of workshops
and conferences.<BR>  There is a tremendous opportunity for US
government agencies and industry to leverage the enormous scientific
resources in Russian academic institutions. The current window of
opportunity has to be used expeditiously as conditions in academic
institutions deteriorate rapidly.

Technology in Russia</H3>
</P><P><H4>Office of Naval Research Europe announces a Workshop-Review
"Sensory Biology And Biosensors"</H4>
</P><P> The workshop will be held in Moscow at the Institute of
Biophysics, and in St. Petersburg, Russia in November of 1995. 
</P><P><I>Objective: Review of the state-of-the-art Russian sensory
biology and biosensors science and technology.</I>
</P><P> Nature has evolved extremely sensitive and versatile sensory
systems for detection of practically any minute change in environment
trace chemicals, electromagnetic fields (and light), and sound. It can
combine extreme sensitivity with amplification and selectivity. 
</P><P> In 1994, the first US-Russian Workshop on Sensory Biology was
held at the University of Maryland at College Park. The workshop was
supported by the Department of Personnel Optimization and Biomolecular
Sciences and Technologies of the Office of Naval Research. It became
clear during the workshop that Russian scientists developed original and
unique approaches to many of the sensory transduction problems. 
</P><P> The Review workshop will allow US science managers to become
familiar with the research progress, to discuss how the work can be
applied for development of man-made sensors, and to review the latest
accomplishments of Russian scientists in applied research in biosensors.
</P><P> The workshop will be hosted by the Biophysics Institute in
Puschino and by the Institute of Evolutionary Physiology & Biochemistry
in St. Petersburg

</OL><P><B>1. Summary </B>
</P><P> A novel approach for exploring topographical and functional
characteristics of living cells and to study the electrochemistry of
biocorrosion or spatial electrochemistry of membanes or electrodes using
Scanning Ion Conductance Microscopy has been developed by scientists in
England. This unique instrument has enormous potential for cellular
studies. It expands the capabilities of conventional 'patch- clamp'
technology, and allows real-time imaging and micro- manipulation of
living cells. 
</P><P><B>2. Scanning Ion-Conductance Microscopy</B>
</P><P> It was used for the first time to image ultra-soft samples such
as living animal or human cells in physiological solutions. The high
resolution images captured by this microscope resemble those obtained by
scanning electron microscopy of fixed and shadowed material - the
significant difference being that in this system, the cells remain
viable and active. 
</P><P> This instrument consists of a computer-controlled three-axis
translation stage with measurement and feedback systems. The x and y
axes of the translation stage are driven so as to scan the probe over
the specimen, while recording measurements of some parameter of interest
using the probe. In this system, the probe consists of a micropipette
similar to those used in the patch-clamp technique. The position of the
tip, in relation to the local sample surface, strongly influences the
ion flow through the pipette. This ion current can be used as a feedback
signal, to control the vertical axis of the positioning system, so as to
ensure that the sample and probe do not come into contact with one
another. 
</P><P> The unique capabilities of this microscope allowed studies of
cellular damage and death induced by pore-forming agents, including the
toxins produced by certain pathogenic bacteria (Korchev, Y.E. et al.
(1995) J. Membrane Biol. 143: 143-151). 
</P><P> Further development of this technique will provide technology
which will have far-reaching impact on a wide range of research topics.
At the fundamental level, for example, it will enable studies of the
electro-chemistry of membrane surfaces, by using multi-barrelled
pipettes to scan topography, simultaneously measuring local ion
concentration by employing another of the barrels as an ion-selective
electrode. On higher levels, it will enable exploration of the
topography and specific functions of cell-cell interactions, such as
neural networks or other multicellular systems where cell contacts are
essential for system properties.

Newsletter No. 8</H3>
</P><P> <H3>European Science Foundation</H3>
</P><P>This newsletter is about the European Science Foundation - an
organization that brings European scientists together to work on topics
of common concern, to co-ordinate the use of expensive facilities, and
to discover and define new endeavors that will benefit from cooperative
approach.
</P><P><B>1. Address</B>

</P><P><B>2. Background</B>
</P><P> The European Science Foundation was established in 1974. Its
Member Organisations are the major European academies, research councils
and other institutions supporting scientific research nationally.
Although these are funded mainly by governments, the ESF itself is a
non-governmental organisation. It maintains close relations with other
international bodies with interests in scientific research particularly
the Commission of the European Communities and the Academia Europaea.
</P><P> The European Science Foundation is an association of its 55
member research councils, academies and institutions devoted to basic
scientific research in 20 countries. The ESF assists its Member
Organisations in two main ways: by bringing scientists together in its
Scientific Programmes, Networks and European Research Conferences, to
work on topics of common concern; and through the joint study of issues
of strategic importance in European science policy.
</P><P> The scientific work sponsored by ESF includes basic research in
the natural and technical sciences, the medical and biosciences, the
humanities and social sciences.
</P><P> The ESF maintains close relations with other scientific
institutions within and outside Europe. By its activities, ESF adds
value by cooperation and coordination across national frontiers and
endeavors, offers expert scientific advice on strategic issues, and
provides the European forum for fundamental science.
</P><P><B>3. How ESF works</B>
</P><P> ESF pays for its activities through the contributions of its
Member Organisations (these are listed in the centre pages of this
booklet). Contributions are made both to the ESF basic budgets, to which
Member Organisations contribute on a scale that is calculated on the
basis of national incomes, and to specific programmes and projects in
which certain Member Organisations may have particular interest.
</P><P> The modes of ESF scientific work vary with the expressed needs,
and may change in character over the years. Broadly ESF Scientific
Programmes almost always contain teams of scientists who carry out
research. ESF Scientific Networks discuss, plan, innovate, analyse or
co-ordinate research, but seldom carry out large amounts of substantive
research. Programmes are often long-term, and are funded (except in the
developmental phase) by participating Member Organisations. Networks are
usually of shorter term (three years); they are funded from the Network
Account within the ESF basic budget.
</P><P> In early 1994 there were 25 ESF Scientific Networks and 32 ESF
Scientific Programmes in operation, with others being prepared.
</P><P> ESF also organises, jointly with the Commission of the European
Communities, a programme of European Research Conferences.

</OL><P><B>1. Summary</B>
</P><P> This report is about some revolutionary and novel vision
devices and optics technology. A biosensor for detectiing UV radiation
based on bacterial proteins is described. These attracted my attention
because of their potential applications in both military and civilian
sectors.
</P><P><B>2. Underwater Television (and seeing through a snow storm)</B>
</P><P> Several unique optical devices were demonstrated in March at
the International Maritime Defence Exhibition and Conference 95 (IMDEX
95) in Greenwich. Developers of these devices from Turn Ltd., a S&T;
company based in Russia, call them Laser Vision Systems (LVS). The
Russian ship-building industry has a special program that will deploy
LVSs on ships and submersible vehicles. Japan is also interested in
installing the underwater television onto their submersibles.<BR>  The
Underwater LSV that was demonstrated at IMDEX 95 extends the television
vision range to 150m (550ft) in the turbid atlantic water! The device
consists of a sensitive (0.002 lx) CCD camera (6 pounds), green laser
(580 nm, 300 W, 12kg), special electronics block, and a monitor. The
camera is synchronised with the laser's pulses. The undisputed advantage
of this method is that vision is not distorted by moving particles or
bubbles. A device similar in principle but for vision in the air (with
red lasers forming a rectangular field of vision) is already in use in
Siberia. A few units were installed on tractors working in oil fields,
where during the winter, snowstorms make it hard to see one's own hand
at arms length. The device is rugged, and can work in extreme
temperatures. The vision distance is extended to 300m (1,100 ft).
</P><P><B>3. Mirror, mirror on the ... piesoelectric</B>
</P><P> The Turn, Ltd. also demonstrated an optoelectronic device
designed to control the radiation wavefront in laser or other optical
systems. The control is accomplished by means of curvature radius change
as the control voltage applied to the piesoelectric understructure. This
"mirror" can be controlled dynamically (resonance frequency is about 3
KHz) and with high precision (there are 18 elements! with sensitivity of
1.5 um/kV). Reflectance (at 10.6 um) is 98.5 for copper and 98.1 for
molybdenum. The light zone is 50mm in diameter. Total shape distortion
is about 316.4 nm. There are numerous applications of this device from
industrial lasers to dynamic abberation correction in photographic
cameras.
</P><P><B>4. UV Biosensor</B>
</P><P> A simple biosensor for ultraviolet light intensity has been
developed at the Institute of Chemical Physics in Moscow, Russia. The
light-sensitive component of this sensor is a photochromic film made of
the light-sensitive protein bacteriorhodopsin and its analogues. This
film is superior to any traditional photochromic materals (organic or
non-organic dyes). The sensitivity of the film can reach 1mW/cm sq. and
it can be cycled through the light-dark periods millions of times
without any decrease of initial optical density. The film is purple and
changes its color (within a few seconds of exposure) depending on the
light spectra and the nature of the bacteriorhodopsin analogue used.<BR>
 The biosensor could be made as a strip of this film embedded into
transparent plastic. The device can detect if radiation is dangerous for
human eyes and skin. If made out of photochromic film with different
sensitivities, it could read light intensity. No power source is needed.
The sensor can also be extremely inexpensive (0.25 mg of protein needed
for the sensor can be produced in Russia for about ten cents)
</P><P><B>5. Next steps</B>
</P><P> Russian scientists are interested in collaboration at all
levels, from conferences to short visits, to joint projects. ONR Europe
has funds to support European scientists' visits in the US government
and academic laboratories. Proposals can be submitted by individual
scientists upon request.

Biological antifouling</H3>

Summary
Antifouling in echinoderms
Personal contact
</PRE>

<B>1. Summary</B><P>
     Echinoderms have surfaces remarkably free of fouling
organisms such as bacteria and algae. As part of research
funded by the Marine Technology Directorate (UK) and the
European Commission MAST II program to apply natural
antifouling mechanisms to the development of novel
technologies for the protection of marine sensors, the group
at Dunstaffnage Marine Laboratory (DML) has been studying
the properties of the echinoderm surface.<P>

<B>2. Antifouling in echinoderms</B><P>
     How echinoderms maintain the fouling-free surface is of
wide interest as there is a need to develop effective, non-
polluting, antifouling technologies. Investigations have
been made of the chemical structure of the echinoid surface
coats (cuticle). As little is known concerning surface coats
other than their ultrastructure, the research has
concentrated on the physico-chemical properties of the
echinoderm surface. The surface coats are extremely thin and
closely attached to each other and the underlying epidermis.<BR>
     Scanning electron microscopy was used to look at spines
without any treatment, and after incubation at 50 C with
pronase E. The glycocalyx was intact on untreated spines,
whereas spines treated with pronase E completely lacked
glycocalyx, although surface cells and some cuticle was
still observed.  The results suggest that one hour of
incubation with small amounts of protease is enough to
damage the surface coat of spines. Those damaged spines are
easily susceptible to fouling with bacteria or algae.<BR>
     The chemistry of the surface coats, particularly the
glycocalyx, is similar to mucus secretions released from the
animal. A sensitive method to do in situ labelling has been
developed and this has allowed aspects of the chemical
composition of the surface coats to be investigated.<BR>
     Enzymatic treatment of modified spines indicates that
most of the modified carboxyl groups belong to the protein
and or glycoprotein molecules, situated on the surface of
the sea urchin spines. The general results to dual
radiolabelling experiments provide a half turnover time of
the surface coat of approximately twenty five days. This
would be too long to be an effective method of removing
fouling but it must be remembered that the tumover time
relates to all of the surface coats (and the epidermal
surface). The turnover rate of the fuzzy coat alone may be
radically different.<P>

Underwater Acoustic Imaging System
Personal contact
</PRE>


<B>1. Summary</B><P>
     An Underwater Acoustic Image System (referred to as to
the Sonovision Set by the inventors) was developed at the
Andreev's Acoustical Institute in Moscow. The system is
based on the Sokolov Tube - an approach that has had a long
history of research in Russia, but which has received only
modest attention in the US. The system is capable of
resolving down to 0.5 degrees with a field of vision of 40
degrees at a working distance of 20 meters.  The system was
field tested to obtain images of steel pipes, wood beams,
and human divers.<P>

 <B>2. Underwater Acoustic Imaging System</B><P>
     An acoustical image of an object comes into view as
result of object "illumination" by two ultrasonic
transducers. This image is focused by a specially developed
Piezoelectric Element Matrix (PEM) lens.  The PEM lens is
made from a piezoceramic disk with a half-wave thickness at
1.0 MHz frequency. Grooves are cut into the lens surface at
a depth of about 2/3 plate thickness, making about 1000
square elements with sides of 1 mm. Each element is
electrically connected with a glass-metallofiber faceplate
of vacuum cathode-ray tube or Cathode-Ray Converter (CRC).
The combination of the PEM and CRC, named the Acoustic
Electron-Ray Converter (AERC or Sokolov Tube), is the main
component of the imaging system described. The electrical
potential distribution on the back surface of the PEM is
carried to the inner surface of the CRC. An electron beam
scanning this surface converts the electrical image into a
time dependent output signal that can be processed and
displayed as an image. The system has being designed to have
minimal geometric distortions, taking into consideration the
diffraction spot diameter and piezoelements' size.     This
device was first developed by Prof. S. Sokolov (Sokolov,
S.Y.- US Pat.2164125(1937)). In 1955, the  first successful
experiments were carried at the Andreev' Institute.<BR>
     Prof. Kazantsev has described this device at the recent
ONR Workshop on Ultrasonic Imaging Transducers in England.<P>

Newsletter No. 13<P>
International Science and Technology Center</H3>

This newsletter describes an opportunity for S & T program
managers to take advantage of an organization that is
allocating funds for joint S & T ventures.  The idea is simply
to provide S & T funds for peaceful purposes, using former
weapons scientists and engineers.<P>

<B>WHAT IS THE ISTC?</B><P>

The International Science and Technology Center is an inter-
governmental organization established by an international
agreement.  It develops, approves, finances, and monitors
science and technology projects that address its objectives as
set forth below. The initial Parties to the agreement are
the European Union, Japan, the Russian Federation, and the
United States of America.  Recently, Finland, Sweden, and
the Republic of Georgia acceded to the agreement.  The
initial program budget is about $70 million.  The Center has
three administrative bodies:<P>

The Governing Board consisting of representatives of the
initial Parties;<P>
The international Scientific Advisory Committee (SAC); and
The Secretariat, located in Moscow, which includes the
     Executive Director and three Deputy Directors.<P>

<B>OBJECTIVES OF THE ISTC</B><P>

The main objectives are:<P>

<OL>
<LI>to provide weapons scientists and engineers in Russia and other interested states of the CIS opportunities to redirect their talents to peaceful activities;
<LI>to contribute thereby to the transition to market-based economies responsive to civil needs;
<LI>to support basic and applied research and technology development for peaceful purposes; and,
<LI>to promote the integration of scientists and engineers from Russia and other CIS states into the international scientific and engineering communities.
</OL>

To help achieve these objectives the Center assists in
matching former weapons scientists and engineers from Russia
and other CIS states with foreign colleagues who have
similar interests in research and development for peaceful
purposes.<P>

<B>ELIGIBLE INSTITUTIONS AND USE OF ISTC FUNDS</B><P>

Project proposals can be submitted by any person,
institution, government, or intergovernmental or non-governmental organization.  A large share of the funds are used to provide financial support for weapon scientists and engineers from the CIS members.  Smaller amount of funds are used to cover limited equipment costs and costs of international travel.  Foreign collaboration in ISTC projects is strongly encouraged.  However, ISTC funds are not intended
to support foreign collaborators.<P>

<B>DECISION-MAKING PROCESS</B><P>

Proposals are submitted to the Executive Director of the
Center.  Each proposal must comply with the ISTC INSTRUCTIONS
FOR PROPOSAL PREPARATION.  The Executive Director must also
receive the approval of the state(s) in which the work is to
be carried out before transmitting the proposal for further
consideration.  Each complete proposal, including the
official approval, is transmitted to the Governing Board
without delay.<P>

The Governing Board, taking into account the views of the
SAC, makes decisions regarding projects on a consensus basis
during its meetings which are scheduled no fewer than four
times annually.  Projects can be financed by one or several
Parties.<P>

The total number of projects approved since the opening of
the Center in March, 1994, is 55, representing a total
contribution of approximately $31 million.  The smallest
project is $37,000 and the largest $3.1 million.  The
projects will sponsor more than 3,500 scientists and
engineers for periods of up to three years.  Projects have
been approved in such fields as nuclear reactor safety,
radioactive waste management, medicine, and laser technology.
Several projects could provide direct support to developing
technologies related to international efforts in
verification of nuclear test ban treaties, disposal of
weapons of mass destruction, and environmental monitoring<P>

</P><P>The Russian Foundation For Basic Research (RFBR) was established
by a Presidential Decree in 1992 as an independent federal agency for
the advancement of science in Russia. It receives and reviews research
proposals and awards individual, pilot and group grants, instrumentation
grants, support of data bases and information systems, and publication
projects. Their budget comes from the Federal Government as a fixed
share of the Federal budget for science. Additional funds are expected
to come from foreign sources through different cooperative and
collaborative projects. Thirty panels (10-16 experts each), from a pool
of about 1,000 scientists, review (for a fee) about 3,000 proposals
annually. RFBR presently supports about 1,200 institutions in the fields
of: Mathematics, computer and information sciences, physics, chemistry,
biology, geophysics, atmosphere, oceanography, humanities and arts. The
average grant is about $10,000/year.

<P><B>1. SUMMARY</B></P>       <P>Collaborative work in England and
Uzbekistan has demonstrated that  extracts of various tissues of the the
middle Asian tortoise amplifies  radioresistance in mice subjected to a
normally lethal whole body dose of  radiation.</P> 
<P><B>2. RESEARCH DESCRIPTION</B></P>       The middle Asian tortoise
is a remarkable animal.  It exists in a  quiescent state for up to 10
months of the year, surviving on glycogen  stored in the liver during
its active phase.  Of greatest interest, however,  is the fact that it
can survive a whole body dose of ionizing radiation  100-fold greater
than any other known living creature.<BR>      A search for the
explanation of this extreme radioresistance has been  the subject of
joint studies between Peter Quinn, Professor of Biochemistry  at King's
College, London, and Azim Turdiyev at the Institute of  Biochemistry of
the Uzbek Academy of Sciences, Tashkent.<BR>      The most important
discovery to date has been a demonstration that  extracts of various
tissues of the tortoise promote recovery from radiation  damage in mice
subjected to a normally lethal whole body dose of radiation;  in these
experiments, mice were irradiated with gamma radiation.<BR>      One
group of irradiated mice was injected intraperitoneally with an  extract
of tortoise spleen and their survival and haemopoietic functions  over
30 days post-irradiation were compared with a second group given an 
injection of saline.  Only 5% of the control group were alive after 8
days  whereas more than 80% of the treated animals survived compared to
a group of  non-irradiated mice.  The spleen weight of the surviving
animals was the  same as non-irradiated mice after this time but there
was a dramatic  proliferation of spleen colonies.  There was also a
doubling of mitotic  cells in the bone marrow.  Over a 30 day period,
recovery of white cell  populations in surviving mice was significantly
enhanced by administering of  spleen extract.<BR>      The nature of
the experiment determined that the subject mice received  no immediate
radiation damage protection from the spleen extract; this was  confirmed
when the decrease in blood cell populations during the initial  phase
following irradiation was found to be almost identical to mice that  had
not received the extract.  It was the normal appearance of the 
proliferating cells repopulating the blood  and the lack of  evidence of
 anomolous mitosis typical of damaged cells that were encouraging to 
researchers.<BR>      The results have led to the suggestion that
spleen factors present in  the tortoise extract were responsible for the
proliferation of  undifferentiated stem cells that had survived
irradiation and their  differentiation into observable erythroid and
granulocytic cell lines in the  bone marrow on day 8 post-irradiation.<BR>
      Some progress has been made toward identifying those factors
present in  extracts of spleen and other tissues of the tortoise
responsible for  conferring radioresistance to mammals.  These turn out
to be a family of  small, unusual peptides derived from progenitor
molecules present in the  extracts, and are quite different from the
high-molecular-weight Stem Cell  Growth Factors present in regenerating
calf spleen that demonstrate  radioprotective activity.<BR>      The
mechanism of protection also appears to be different from that 
attributed to cytokines - e.g., interlukin-1, TNF or immunostimulants,
all  of which must be present prior to irradiation.  Individual peptides
appear  to play different roles in rescuing the surviving stem cells. 
Some have  been shown to stimulate repair of DNA in human lymphocytes
damaged by  exposure to gamma-radiation; others are more effective as
cell-proliferation  agents.<BR>      Future studies are planned to
characterize and chemically synthesize  each of the bioactive peptides. 
Their effect on animals treated with  chemotherapeutic cancer agents
will also be examined.  Collaboration with  other researchers with
relevant interests and available funding is currently  being sought.<P></P>

Science in Armenia</H3>
In November,1995 the visit to Armenia was made jointly by
scientists from the Office of Naval Research Europe and the Air Force
Research and Development European Office. There will be additional
newsletters giving more details on institutions, science and people from
this country. <P><B>Contents:</B>
</P><P></P><PRE>

2. Background
3. The Armenian National Academy of Science
4. Call for help from Armenia
</PRE>
<P><B>1. SUMMARY</B>
</P><P> Some of the Armenian research facilities that we visited were
found to be doing outstanding, world-class work. Institutes and the
universities have done a remarkable job of maintaining their
infrastructure and potential during the worst of times, and are
optimistic that the international scientific community will recognize
the value of what they have to offer. The institutes use the typical
Soviet scientific model of having both testing and engineering
facilities to follow-up on basic scientific results. We feel very
strongly that the timing is optimum for the U.S. academic, government,
and industrial researchers to form a strong, lasting relationship with
Armenian scientists and institutes for the benefit of both of our
countries.
</P><P><B>2. BACKGROUND</B>
</P><P> Armenia has a population of only 3.3 million people, but has a
strong tradition of scientific excellence and was likely the third
largest contributor to research within the USSR, following Russia and
Ukraine. In recent years, however, the resilience and determination of
the country to maintain its scientific infrastructure has been put to
the test. In December 1988, an earthquake devastated the northern
portion of the country killing 55,000 people and swelling the capital,
Yerevan, with refugees. After the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991,
this land-locked country found itself geographically and politically
isolated. Armenia went to war with its neighbor, Azerbaijan, over
control of Nagorno-Karabakh and region within Azerbaijan populated by
ethnic Armenians. Consequently, Armenia's neighbors, Iran and Turkey,
enforced total land blockades along their borders while Armenia's one
remaining neighbor, Georgia, was deeply embroiled in a civil war. For
the first few years of its newfound independence, virtually any imports
and exports had to be transferred by air. The country's nuclear power
station shut down during the earthquake and a lack of natural fuel
resources led to long periods of power outages, including the cold
winter seasons. In less than three years, the value of currency
decreased by a factor of more than 100,000 while prices of many consumer
goods inflated rapidly to western levels.
</P><P> Today, however, Armenia takes pleasure from relative stability
and a confident outlook towards the future. There is a cease-fire with
Azeibarjan and the land blockades are loosening. The civil war in
Georgia has ended, Armenia's nuclear power station recently re-opened,
and their currency, the dram, has held a constant rate of exchange
against the dollar for more than a year. Economically, however, Armenia
still has a long way to go, but is westernizing quickly and has
attracted more foreign aid from the U.S. per capita than any other
country in the world besides Israel. Although they were the first of the
former Soviet republics to introduce privatization and economic reform,
a typical research scientist for the Academy of Science earns a base
salary of only $8.50 per month -- half that of a scientist in Ukraine,
and ten times less than a scientist in Russia. Scientists are also
frustrated by frequent power outages, and in some cases, loss of power
due to the inability of institutes to pay the bills. A majority of the
institutes and universities are virtually unheated and will be closed
completely during the coldest winter months.
</P><P><B>3. THE ARMENIAN NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCE</B>
</P><P> The Academy was founded in 1943 as the primary coordinator of
basic research within the Republic. The Academy is composed of 34
institutes, and is divided into departments of Physico-Mathematical and
Technical Sciences, Natural Sciences, and Humanities. Approximately
4,000 researchers work among the various institutes--about 1,500 fewer
than five years ago. Economic conditions have lowered governmental
funding to less than one million dollars annually, causing increasing
emphasis on the need to attract outside funding sources. Last year 428
researchers within the Academy received Soros grants, giving them the
largest number of any FSU country except Russia.
</P><P><B>4. CALL FOR HELP FROM ARMENIA</B>
</P><P> The biggest problem facing Armenian science is information
exchange, according to Academician Fadey T. Sarkissian, the President of
the Academy of Sciences. Power disruptions, a blockade by neighboring
countries, and financial woes make it difficult for the Armenians to
receive or send out scientific information. They require support to
publish and distribute several monographs and books on a wide variety of
scientific subjects. They would like to receive scientific journals,
magazines, and papers. If any of my readers have suggestions or ideas to
help the Armenians, please contact the Office of Naval Research Europe.<P>

<P><B>1. SUMMARY</B><BR>  In November, 1995, scientists from the
Office of Naval Research Europe and the European Office of Aerospace
Research and Development jointly visited some physics and laser research
facilities in Armenia.<BR>  Intriguing work on low frequency acoustic
lasers, X-ray generation enhancement by acoustic waves, novel materials
for lasers, rotation detectors with a resolution of 0.3 arcsec and 22
bits of accuracy, lidars for remote environmental sensing, facilities
capable of growing high- quality doped and undoped crystals and optical
materials, and high-power lasers are just a few examples of science and
technology described in this letter.<BR>  We feel very strongly that
the timing is excellent for the U.S. academic, government, and
industrial researchers to form an effective, stable connection with
Armenian scientists and institutes advantageous to both of our
countries.
</P><P><B>2. INSTITUTE OF APPLIED PROBLEMS IN PHYSICS</B><BR>  The
institute maintains strong relations with their Russian counterparts,
Parma University in Italy, Laue- Langevin Institute in Grenoble, France,
Technical University in Munich, Germany, and is building relationships
with American firms such as HP and GM. The Institute has 14 grants from
the International Science Foundation (Soros Foundation).
</P><P> There are three projects involving acoustic waves that were
described to us which seem to be on the whole with or ahead of research
in the west:
</P><P> a. Modulation of x-rays generated by the dispersion of high-
energy electrons or positrons in crystals by acoustic waves. If the
frequency of the applied acoustic wave is tuned to one of the natural
modes of vibration of the particle traversing the crystal, then the
resulting x-ray radiation can be enhanced to the point where it is up to
two times more intense than is available from x-ray tubes. Armenian
scientists have also been experimenting with the generation of radiation
in the UV to hard x-ray region by skimming high-energy particles over
surface acoustic waves.
</P><P> b. Control of instabilities in gas discharge lasers through the
application of acoustic waves. In particular, a longitudinal acoustic
wave has been used to control the temperature and radial temperature
gradient in a discharge column in a low temperature plasma. This work
has the potential to eliminate the need for the high flow rates that are
currently necessary in high-power discharge lasers.
</P><P> c. Generation of monochromatic and coherent acoustic waves with
frequencies in the area of a few Hertz to tens of Hertz. This can be
used to generate a long standing wave which can be used as a sensitive
seismic detector. For instance, they have created a vertical acoustic
wave in lake Sevan. By monitoring the standing wave they claim to have
enough sensitivity to detect a one kiloton explosion in the US.
</P><P> The institute has developed a lightbulb based on plasma
acoustic modulation which requires only 20-25% of the power needed for
conventional fluorescent bulbs of the same output power and contains no
mercury. Electric heaters have been fabricated from a volcanic rock
(natural Armenian resource) that are 20% more efficient than
conventional electric heaters.
</P><P><B>3. INSTITUTE OF RADIOPHYSICS AND ELECTRONICS</B><BR>  This
institute has been heavily involved with the design and fabrication of
frequency-specific wave detectors and applied research in radiophysics,
electronics, and automatic control. The Institute cooperates with Sogang
University in South Korea, Manchester and Warwick Universities in UK,
and Hengstler company in Germany.
</P><P> Lately, much of their focus is on the development of accurate,
sensitive microwave radiometers for wavelengths in the range of 2mm to
30cm, and the use of masers as receivers up to 200 GHz.
</P><P> Present projects are oriented towards the development of
wavelength specific detectors for particular applications. These
include: a 195 GHz high-Tc superconducting detector for mapping ozone
distribution in the atmosphere, millimeter band detectors for
short-range communications and data transfer, 1-50cm band detectors to
measure water content of the soil, 94 GHz detectors for imaging, and
many other. The soil humidity detector is already operational, and is
claimed to be more sensitive than anything on the market.
</P><P> They also have ideas for developing an amplitude and phase
detector for microwaves with a sensitivity ten times better than any
device presently available.
</P><P> Current research is oriented towards the development of new
materials for these detectors. In particular, they are looking at
different semiconductors, superconducting tunnel junctions, and high-Tc
superconductors. They have made some interesting progress in reducing
the number of free carriers in materials like PbTe by using pulsed laser
evaporation to do epitaxy and in developing high-Tc detectors.
</P><P> Prior to the breakup of the Soviet Union, much of their
research and production capabilities were directed toward military
applications. This includes a series of rotation detectors, the largest
of which have a resolution of 0.3 arcsec and 22 bits of accuracy. A 14
bit accurate detector designed for fighter aircraft is available for
purchase at around $500 per sample.
</P><P> They have also developed a six channel, six centimeter
wavelength radiometer to fly on the MIR Space Station.
</P><P> A theoretical model to predict the radiation emitted by charged
particles in random, inhomogeneous media is currently under development
at the institute.
</P><P><B>4. PHYSICAL RESEARCH INSTITUTE</B><BR>  The research in
this institute is devoted to lasers and laser interactions with matter.
The Institute cooperates with the University of Crete in Greece, Rice
University in Houston, Texas US, number of universities in Israel, Japan
and Germany.
</P><P> There is a project on two-photon resonance up-conversion in
metal vapors. This is a potential method for shifting the incident
wavelength into the UV or farther into the IR. In the area of
solid-state lasers, there is a lot of research in the growth and
characterization of solid-state laser materials, mainly oxides. Over 50
different solid-state laser materials have been grown and studied,
including Er and Ho doped crystals. These materials are characterized
according to their spectroscopy, crystal properties, and lasing
characteristics. This expertise has led to the ability to modify some of
the inherent characteristics of the lasing medium such as the lifetime
of the excited state in Er-doped materials.
</P><P> Two years ago the emphasis shifted to the production and
characterization of scintillator materials.
</P><P> There is also a significant amount of research in nonlinear
optical materials and in particular photorefractive materials. The aim
of the photorefractive work is to understand the role of dopants in the
photorefractive effect. They have been doping LiNiO3 with controlled
amounts of Fe, Cu, Zn, and Hf and then studying the properties of the
resulting material.
</P><P> A novel technique for measuring of ultra short pulses has been
developed using the second harmonic generation in non linear crystals
(in collaboration with Hungerian Institute of Physics).
</P><P><B>5. LASERAYAN TEKHINICA ARMENIA</B><BR>  This was and has
every manifestation of becoming again an influential production and
applied research facility for lasers, laser components and laser
systems.
</P><P> The coating facility contains what was state-of-the-art in 1990
Russian evaporative coating chambers which have been maintained during
the last few years of inactivity. Visual inspection of the coatings
indicates that they are of good quality although serious testing would
have to be carried out in order to ensure that this is the case.
</P><P> The crystal growing facility contains a mixture of homemade and
Russian growing chambers which have also been well maintained. They are
not yet in operation due to the irregularity of the electrical supply.
This has supposedly been addressed and they expect to resume operation
in the spring.
</P><P> The crystal growing facility has the ability to grow a variety
of solid-state laser materials either as rods or slabs. They also have
the facilities to grow fluoride crystals such as YLF. We saw examples of
Er-doped Garnet and YAG rods and slabs. Nonlinear crystals are also
grown, cut and coated in this facility. Examples of nonlinear optical
materials are KTP in sizes up to 10 x 12 x 30mm, BBO in sizes up to 6 x
6 x 10mm and LiNbO3 as well as other standard materials.
</P><P> There is expertise in the design and construction of remote
sensing systems and LIDARs. There was an airborne laser fluorimeter on
display in one of the labs that had flown in helicopter was designed to
detect chlorophyll- A and oil spills.
</P><P> Work had also been done on a LIDAR system for remote sensing in
the wavelength range 500- 4500nm. This facility has also designed a YAG
system for the Russian space effort. It was capable of delivering more
than 1 J per pulse at 20 Hz with a pulse width of 10-12 ns. The
divergence of the beam was 0.8 mrad. The size of the laser, excluding
the power supply, was ~5cm x 15cm x 60cm.

<B>1. Summary:</B><P>
 In this newsletter, I have collected some facts about
the direction and financial support of  Russian science in
1995, specifically in the area of biotechnology. There are
also geographical and  age distribution statistics of
Russian Foundation for Basic Research (see European
Biophysics  Newsletters <A HREF="HTTP://WWW.EHIS.NAVY.MIL:80/IVNEWS1.HTM"># 1</A>, <A HREF="HTTP://WWW.EHIS.NAVY.MIL:80/IVNEWS14.HTM"># 14</A>) grant recipients. I have
translated the most interesting parts of the interview with
the Russian Ministry of Science and Technology Policy about
international cooperation. The  ministry is developing new
international policy that will control intellectual rights
transfers, and  centralize and control international
agreements, MOUs and contracts, especially in defense
sensitive science and technology. Recently the ministry
renegotiated a few actual contracts and  agreements.
Examples are DOE contracts and a CRDF call for proposals.<P>

<B>2.Science support in Russia in 1995:</B><P>
 According to 1995 statistics from the Russian
Foundation for Basic Research (RFBR), the science budget in
Russia (officially 4% of the federal budget) was divided as
follows:<P>
<PRE>
   Russian Academy of Sciences                     19.5%
   Russian Academy of Medical Sciences              1.7%
   Russian Academy of Agricultural Sciences         2.6%
   Russian Foundation for Basic Research            6.0%
</PRE>
 About 50% of funds from  the Russian Ministry of
Science and Technology Policy (MRSTP) was spent to support
about 60 "centers of Science & Technology".<P>

In biotechnology, these "centers" are:<BR>
"Vector" - virology<BR>
"Applied Biotechnology"<BR>
"Genetics"<BR>
"Bioorganic Chemistry"<BR>
"Biophysics"<BR>
"Immunology"<BR>
"Biomedical" - space<P>

<B>3. The RFBR geographical distribution of funds in 1995 was:</B><P>
<PRE>
   Central Russia (mostly Moscow and Moscow region) 50.0%
   Siberia (Novosibirsk, Tomsk)                     18.0%
   Urals                                             5.0%
</PRE>

 In 1995, RFBR supported about 37 thousand scientists in
government research institutions and 13 thousand at Russian
universities.<P>

<B>4. Age distribution of RFBR grant recipients:</B><P>

Interesting statistics of grants from RFBR but alarming for
Russian scientists:<P>
<PRE>
Age of applicants:  <30   30-35   35-40   40-50  50-60   >60
Applications %:     2.4    6      10      31.5   30.6   19.5
Grants %:           1.3    4.5    8.9     32.2   32.2   20.9
</PRE>
What obviously follows from these statistics is that there
were very few scientists younger than 35 in Russia who
worked in basic research in 1995.<P>

Federal support by RMSTP of Biosciences:<P>
<PRE>
Program      Million Rubles
1. Novel Methods in Biology            14.480
2. Biological Diversity                 4.000
3. Tools for Physical Chemistry
4. Biology and Biotechnology            5.990
5. Human Genome                         8.000
6. Priority Directions in Genetics      6.528
7. International Projects
</PRE>
Each program consists out of 5 to 7 "coordinated projects"
each containing about 100 individual research grants.
A program, Biosensors and Immunosensors, is a part of the
coordinated project called "Enzyme Engineering" within the
Program of Novel Methods in Biology.<P>

<B>5. Interview with Deputy Minister Mr. Yakobashvili: </B><P>

 An interview with the Russian Science and Technology
Deputy Minister Mr. Z. Yakobashvili has  been published
recently by a weekly paper called "Search" (This is analogue
to the US paper "The  Scientist"). The article is called
"Know Your Price".<P>

 Interview was conducted by Mr. Michael Buben.<P>

This is an abbreviated translation of the paper article:<P>

 Biographical data:<BR>
 Zurab Andreevich Yakobashvili, born in 1946 in the
Georgian capital city Tbilisi. Has lived in  Moscow since
1950. Graduated from Moscow University with master's diploma
in Physics in 1970.  After graduation, sent to Central
Economic - Mathematical Institute of Academy of Sciences,
where he started as a researcher and advanced to become a
deputy director. Mr. Yakobashvili has been a Deputy Minister
since 1992.<BR>
 Some facts on RMSTP of 1995:<BR>
 RMSTP has developed, and is prepared to realize in the
near future, a system of federal registration of
international agreements, contracts and MOUs.
The Russian Patent Office and RMSTP has developed a system
of laws for international intellectual rights control that
has been sent for consideration by the Russian legislature.
RMSTP is looking into a program of loans for patenting.<P>


M.B. - What is the role of your ministry in international
cooperation?<P>

To organize an official "system" of cooperation.
To teach foreign partners how to behave properly in Russia
[how to protect the Russian national
interest].<BR>
To help scientists with an official way of taxation and duty
payments.<P>

M.B. -  How were these questions solved last year?<P>

In 1995 we selected and supported 600 international projects
that were initiated by individual institutes and their
foreign partners (mostly US and Germany)<P>

Major interest is in the area of high energy physics,
biotechnology, novel materials, some new directions in
chemistry and, surprisingly, microelectronics.<P>

An exemplary project -  a new center of biomedicine that is
created under the agreement between our ministry and NASA.
During the negotiations we had to refer to Gore -
Chernomyrdin committee decisions.<P>

Another example is a Sino - Russian Center of High
Technologies. We created a system that will protect
intellectual property and will prevent any leaks of
sensitive information.<P>

We would like to take control over any international
cooperation that involves former defense scientists.<P>

In the US there are about 135 laws that control
international cooperation.<P>

We could not bring to closure an agreement on the free
electron laser project with the US (started on initiative of
academician Scrinsky). Vice president Gore told Saltykov
[Russian minister] that the project is too sensitive for the
US defense interests.<P>

Our (Russian) scientists nevertheless are not at all alarmed
by the Navy or Airforce "partners". They are not alarmed
when a team from CIA or Pentagon comes to conduct a seminar
where the Russian side is represented only by scientists;
and these scientists would explain that they carry out
purely basic (not applied) research. Perhaps their foreign
"partners" in epaulets are getting promotions for making
important contributions in purely basic research [sarcasm].<P>

In 1995, our ministry conducted "in a civilized way" 5
seminars with the Academy of Sciences, the Federal Defense
Ministry and NATO's science committee. We have developed
"rules of the game".<P>

M.B. - You have told us that there are 135 special laws in
the US. What do we have in our country?<P>

We have five laws governing property, and a number of
presidential decrees that control areas of dual
technologies.<P>

M.B. - What are the loopholes in our laws?<P>

We do not have organized control over the relationship
between S&T institutions and the federal government. It is a
slow process [to develop it].<BR>
Some of our institution directors were signing contracts
without any understanding of the legal implications.<P>

An example of the above: Our ministry protested a DOE
contract [with the Kurchatov Institute of Nuclear Physics],
after which DOE issued a document that assigned intellectual
rights to us.<P>

However, we would like to have a share in these intellectual
rights on US territory and to take advantage of the
favorable climate for commercial realization of S&T. We also
will have to share these rights on our territory as well.<P>

Mr. Yakobashvili concluded with the following phrase:
We should cooperate internationally in cases where it is
profitable to all sides. Our scientists have to feel that
they are needed not only abroad, but in our country.<P>

<B>6. Example of a renegoiated international program:</B><P>  

Civilian Research & Development Fund Cooperative Grants
Program<P>

Special Notice for Applicants from Russia and Kazakstan<P>

By agreement with the governments of the Russian Federation
and the Republic of Kazakstan, the CRDF is posting the
following notice, which is an amendment to the procedures it
originally announced on November 6, 1995:<P>

Russian and Kazak scientists and specialists who have
participated in defense-related work and who wish to be
included in a proposal to the CRDF, or those who wish to
submit a proposal for financial support of a project related
to conversion problems, are required to first request the
approval of the Ministry of Science of their respective
country. Only those who receive approval may enter into
discussions with potential American partners for preparation
of a joint grant application. This review will be carried
out in accordance with applicable Russian and Kazak
legislation. Please note that all requests for such
preliminary review must be submitted promptly in order to
allow the proposal to be submitted to the CRDF before its
deadline of March 15, 1996.<P>

In addition, all applicants from Russia and Kazakstan are
required to submit their proposals simultaneously to the
CRDF office in Arlington, Virginia, USA (ten copies, one
with original signature) and to their respective Ministry of
Science (one copy) by March 1, 1996.<P>

<B>1. Summary</B><BR>
Some virtual reality systems are rather realistic in particular domains of 
activity (e.g. flight or driving simulators). However, they do not include 
any facility for self-motion. Dr. Pelah from Cambridge University has 
recently obtained novel and unique experimental data that will help to 
relate pseudo - to real motion. With these, sensations of locomotion can be 
enhanced, retarded or altered in specific ways, by using these new motion 
after-effects.<P>

<B>2. Multi-Sensory Neural Calibration</B><BR>
The human nervous system continuously monitors and integrates a large number 
of sensory messages (i.e. from motor, vision, etc.). If each message at 
every instance in time was of equal importance, this task would probably be 
intractable, because of the massively large number of possible inputs that 
would need to be processed simultaneously. Fortunately, the statistical 
distributions of sensory message types are highly correlated. For example, 
in human locomotion, proprioceptive inputs that signal motor activity for a 
given degree of effort, such as walking or running, would be correlated with 
corresponding inputs that signal visual flow; that is, the faster one moves 
the faster the world is seen to rush by.  Thus, for a given type of 
activity, associations of a kind are likely to be made between signal these 
combinations of sensory sources.  When the activity changes, so must the 
associations, and it follows that because the time course of re-association 
is finite, after-effects and illusions occurring during such re-calibration 
may be observed.  Dr. Pelah has recently confirmed this by discovering a 
class of visual after-effects following motor-visual association during 
treadmill running and other activities.<P>

To include a facility for self-motion in virtual reality, one must first be 
aware of the perceptual processes taking place, and the inevitable 
technological limitations.  For instance, a virtual reality system for self 
motion will be contained in a limited space and must therefore rely on 
treadmill-type pseudo self-motion actuators to reproduce as much as possible 
the physical sensations of locomotion; the experience of treadmill 
locomotion is very different from real locomotion. The multi-modal 
association mechanisms outlined above can define correlations between pseudo 
and real locomotion. Thus, self-actions and correlated perceptions which, 
once identified, quantified and functionally understood can contribute to 
the design of effective virtual reality systems.<P>

<B>1. Summary</B><BR>
The Institute of Marine Engineers (London) conducted a one
day seminar on "Microbes in Ships: Effect on Operation and
Safety". The workshop was supported by Lloyd' Register, UK
and was attended by the European Navy and civilian engineers
and scientists representing ship building, design, oil
shipping, and microbiological industries. Mr. Stuart of
Lloyd' Register concluded the meeting by summarizing most of
the up to date findings on microbial contamination in ships.<P>

Microbial contamination encompasses fuels, lubricants, bilge
and ballast water. It often causes severe damage to hull,
machinery and equipment. Shipboard contamination may be
initiated from previously infested tanks and systems, or be
introduced onboard through contaminated fuel or sea water.
Poor housekeeping methods and ship design are conducive to
microbial proliferation and its associated problems.<P>

Far from being an "act of God", microbial damage is almost
entirely manmade and preventable; consequently hull
insurance is often refused for coastal trade and inshore
work boats, unless appropriate anti-microbial preventative
procedures are implemented.<P>

The research conducted by Lloyd's Register examined the ways
in which microbial contamination can be reduced by
implementing controls, good housekeeping and chemical
biocides. New standards are suggested to monitor these
measures and ensure that the safe operation of ships is not
jeopardized and human health is not endangered.<P>

<B>2. Introduction</B><BR>
While microbial problems in the marine industry were
originally mainly confined to distillate fuels and
lubricants, recently the areas of attack have spread to
residual fuels, bilge, ballast, and potable water.
Curious though this appears on a preliminary examination,
there are in fact several reasons for this sudden upsurge.
Lower levels of shipboard manning and less experienced
personnel have proved a fatal combination for maintaining
stringent housekeeping. Adverse trading conditions have led
to ships being laid up or in intermittent service, providing
long, undisturbed incubation periods for opportunist
microorganisms . Somewhat ironically, marine pollution
legislation under the MARPOL 73/78 regulation which
restricts the pumping of bilges, has led to water laying
stagnant for longer periods. Environmental restrictions in
the use of toxic biocidal chemicals within bilges and fuels,
exacerbate the problems associated with microbial
contamination. Design considerations for tanks, bilges and
pipe systems should provide effective water draining and
subsequent treatment.<P>

Consideration of these factors, as well as explaining the
increase in corrosion problems, also identifies how
strategies for recognition, evaluation, rectification and
control of microbial infestation may be implemented.<P>

<B>3. Safety in Ships</B><BR>
<B>3.1 Microbes</B><BR>
The microbiological contamination process is a well known
phenomenon and small populations of microorganisms exist
quite naturally. These microorganisms, consisting of
bacteria, yeasts and moulds, are easily tolerated at low
contamination levels. It is only when their numbers are not
controlled within their immediate environment, that they
experience rapid growth, resulting in infestation.<P>

From a marine point of view there are six main areas of
concern for microbiological infestation. These are:   1.
Distillate fuel; 2. Lubricating oil; 3. Cooling water; 4.
Bilge water; 5. Ballast water; 6. Distillate cargoes.
In each case, it is to be remembered that microbes are
living organisms and their growth depends upon the readily
availability of water, nutrients, heat, and oxygen (or
sometimes lack of it) within an otherwise acceptable
environment.<P>

Microbiological contamination and growth can have a
significant impact upon the safe and efficient operation of
ships. In many instances, problems which were fundamentally
microbial in nature have not been recognized as such,
especially when microbial infection was only partly to blame
for the phenomena experienced.<P>

There is no doubt that the marine industry continues to lag
behind other major industries in its appreciation of the
consequences of microbial infection, particularly those
infections which have involved distillate products. The
experience gleamed from the detection, quantification and
cure of infection in other industries can still be applied
in principle, but there are a variety of additional factors
unique to the marine industry.<P>

<B>3.2 Types of Microbes</B><BR>
In the problems of the marine industry, three basic types of
spoilage and corrosive microorganisms are identified;
bacteria, yeasts and moulds.<P>

Bacteria can be further subdivided into three main types: 1.
Aerobic Bacteria (Require oxygen to survive); 2. Anaerobic
Bacteria (Live in the absence of oxygen); 3. Facultative
Bacteria (Live with or without oxygen)<P>

BACTERIA are a very diverse group of simple, single celled
organisms with a rigid cell wall. Bacteria may be rod-like,
spherical or spiral in shape and typically range from 1 to 5
um in size. Many bacteria are actively mobile and can move
through a liquid medium using a whip-like appendage or
flagellum. They are able to reproduce asexually and rapidly
by binary fission, often with a doubling time of less than
twenty minutes.<BR>
This allows them to exploit any good growth conditions. Some
types produce spores which are resistant to adverse
conditions such as disinfectants and temperatures. They may
grow aerobically (with oxygen) and/or anaerobically,
(without oxygen) using both simple and complex nutrients.
Their great diversity means that virtually any organic
substance can be utilized by one or more types of bacteria.
Although in general they prefer neutral or slightly alkaline
conditions, some species are very acid tolerant. Partial
breakdown products are a common feature, being secreted out
of the cell. Such partial breakdown products serve as
nutrients for other microbes. This leads to the rapid
development of a consortium of species able to biodegrade
the substrate, being interdependent upon each other for
nutrients or environmental modification. Many types produce
copious amounts of extra-cellular slime material, which aids
their attachment to surfaces and also protects the colony
from changes in the environment. In particular, slimes may
deactivate, or prevent diffusion of chemical biocides into
the bulk of the slime, thus reducing the effectiveness of
this form of remedial treatment. Even a thin slime layer
prevents diffusion of oxygen to the base of the slime, and
this, coupled with the demand for oxygen by the aerobic
bacteria, leads to ideal conditions for the growth of
sulfate reducing bacteria (SRB) and associated corrosion
problems. Typical bacteria known to utilize hydrocarbons are
Pseudomonas aeruginosa, other Pseudomonas species,
Flavobacterium spp., Acinetobacter spp., Alcaligenes spp.,
Micrococcus spp., Arthobacter ssp., Corynebacterium spp.,
Brevibacterium spp., Klebsiella spp.,<P>

YEASTS are unicellular, ovoid or spherical in shape and
about 5 micron long, however some may also produce
rudimentary filaments.<P>

They reproduce by budding on the parent cell, increasing in
size and eventually separating. The reproduction cycle takes
several hours to complete and they prefer slightly acid
conditions. Typical yeasts growing on hydrocarbons are
Candida spp., Saccharomyces spp., Torula spp., Torulopsis
spp., Hansenula spp.<P>

MOULDS are typically multicellular, with rigid, chitinous
cell walls. They usually grow in the form of branched
hyphae, a few microns in diameter, to form extensive, thick,
tough, intertwined mycelial mats, especially at interfaces.<P>

Growth is brought about through simultaneous filament
lengthening and production of branches. The reproduction
cycle to double their size lasts only a few hours, unless
there are problems in nutrient diffusion to the center of
the coherent mat, then rapid growth is confined to the
periphery. Eventually, spores are produced which disperse
and germinate to produce new growth mats, preferring
slightly acid conditions. They produce many oxidized carbon
compounds, especially low molecular weight compounds such as
organic acids, which can be used by other microbes. Their
demand for oxygen again creates ideal conditions for the
growth of SRB. Typical moulds which degrade hydrocarbons are
Penicillium spp., Aspergillus spp., Fusarium spp., Monilia
spp., Botrytis spp., Cunninghammella spp., Scopulariopsis
spp.<P>

SULPHATE REDUCING BACTERIA (SRB) are a specific group of
anaerobic bacteria that have special growth requirements.
They only use simple carbon sources, not hydrocarbons,
require the activity of other microbes in a consortium, and
produce hydrogen sulphide by reduction of oxidised sulphur-
containing compounds, such as sulphate from sea water.
They are involved directly with many microbial corrosion
reactions and can cause sulphide souring of stored
distillate products.<P>

There are several genera of dissimilatory anaerobic bacteria
known as Sulphate Reducing Bacteria. Two of the most
important are Desulfovibrio spp. and Desulfotomaculum spp.
The latter has the ability to produce resistant spores,
which can tolerate prolonged exposure to air and can survive
the application of many biocides currently available.
Both of these particularly insidious strains of SRB are
highly dangerous and in their most virulent form, will
quickly corrode hull, machinery and equipment.<P>

The moulds tend to form a coherent mat under which intense
corrosion can occur. Two types of moulds Cladosporium
resinae now renamed Hormoconis resinae and Aspergillus
fumigatus which can tolerate sea water and higher
temperatures, were previously known as being the most
troublesome. Today, responsibility is shared between a very
broad spectrum of bacteria, yeasts and moulds.
The aerobic bacteria Pseudomonns spp. have the ability to
utilise a wide range of substrates for their growth and can
cause considerable surfactancy problems, in the presence of
dissolved oxygen. Only a few ppm of dissolved oxygen is
required to sustain microbial growth. Depletion of oxygen
then serves to encourage the growth of anaerobic bacteria.<P>

<B>3.3 Sources of Microbial Contamination</B><BR>
Operational problems due to microbial contamination may be
due to imported infested hydrocarbons and sea water,
previous onboard contamination, a combination of both or
result from poor onboard operational procedures.<P>

<B>3.3.1 Imported Infestation</B><BR>
<B>3.3.1.1 Sea Water</B><BR>
Ocean water usually contains less than 103 bacteria per cm3
and negligible quantities of yeasts and moulds. Only 0.1% of
these bacteria will be hydrocarbon degrading and SRB is even
rarer. However, sea water confined in harbors and estuaries
with a long history of oil spillage, oil tank and sewage
discharges will contain far in excess of 10000 bacteria per
cm3, including hydrocarbon degraders and large numbers of
SRB. Additionally, phosphorus and nitrogen pollutants from
agricultural fertilizers, plus corrosion inhibitors and oil
additives, will ensure that sufficient nutrients are present
to nourish SRB. Consequently, harbor and estuary sea waters
which might contain up to 11 ppm of nitrogen and 2 ppm of
phosphorus, are far more nutritious to rapacious
microorganisms than the water in the open oceans, which
would not contain more than 1 ppm of nitrogen and
phosphorus.<P>

<B>3.3.1.2 Refinery Practices</B><BR>
Recent years have seen a dramatic increase in contaminated
distillate fuel oils being supplied. This problem is then
compounded by poor housekeeping standards at bunkering
facilities.<P>

Controls: Poor quality control standards and relaxed
housekeeping at refineries, tank farms and delivery barges
can be responsible for fuel contamination. Recently,
imported infected gas oil cargoes from Eastern Europe have
been distributed for use on ships. In many cases, the contamination was detected
before being used onboard and was successfully counteracted
with heat, filtration and biocidal treatment. However, not
all ships were so fortunate.<P>

Storage: Another source of microbial contamination is
introduced when shore storage tanks are cleaned and washed
using polluted river water. This will not only introduce
fuel adapted microbes but also vital nutrients, particularly
nitrogen and phosphorus. However, it does not mean that
tanks which are infected will always deliver 'unfit for use'
contaminated fuel. Microbes aggregate at the fuel/water
interface but are readily dispersed in the fuel by modest
agitation; they have a specific gravity of about 1.05, and
settle slowly back to the interface. Fuel drawn from the top
of an infected but undisturbed tank will be reasonably
clean. Conversely, if the draw off is taken by floating
suction during a fast delivery when the tank level is low,
this will result in heavily contaminated fuel. The outcome
could be severe operational problems within a few hours of
using the infected fuel.<P>

Floating roof storage tanks usually permit some water
ingress through the seals. In a polluted atmosphere this may
carry in nutrients. Even if a floating roof tank is empty it
should still be regularly drained and manholes should not be
left open. This admits light, allowing algae to flourish and
hence builds up a food chain for microorganisms. Fuel
residues in the tank complete the nutritious environment.
Should storage tanks be left empty for long periods, they
may need decontamination before refuse.<P>

Process: The major factors contributing to the increase in
microbial problems in the marine industry are changes in the
fuel supply.<P>

1. Changes in base oils, refining and blending; the size,
saturation and configuration of hydrocarbon molecules
influences their biodegradability.<BR>
2. Changes in the type and range of fuel additives; these
frequently contain nitrogen and phosphorus, vital
elements for growth.<BR>
3. Changes in product handling and distribution; faster
throughput permits less time for particulate and water
to settle and, at the refinery, less time for the
product to cool. This has exacerbated the problem by
making the fuel more nutritious to contaminating
microbes.<BR>

Fuel oils have so far only experienced heavy infection in
gas or diesel oils of the distillates. The higher incidence
of contamination in distillates is no doubt due to the
predominant molecular types. Black distillates are all the
more vulnerable due to the abundance of trace elements
emanating from quantities of residual fuel and the
cutterstock used during blending.<P>

It is quite a common occurrence for sulphides to be produced
by the activities of SRB whenever wet fuel is stored or
transported. Present in the water phase, SRB activity is
stimulated in the presence of fuel oil and contaminated
water. This activity occurs when hydrocarbon degraders
create the anaerobic conditions, acid and alcohol food
sources, and shift the overall pH value of the oil/water
phase necessary for SRB proliferation.<P>

<B>3.3.2 Onboard Contamination</B><BR>
Operational problems relate to the hazards in various
systems onboard, but full consideration should first be
given to the source of contamination.
Functional operational problems are commonly encountered
only after severe infestation by microbes, following early
warning signs. The early warning signs enable preventative
and successful remedial measures to be undertaken. The
visual and operational warning signs of hydrocarbon and
bilge/ballast water infection, which although individually
may be ascribed to other causes, should in combination alert
the marine engineer to a potentially hazardous situation.<P>

Bilge and Ballast Water: Polluted waters and a continuous
supply of hydrocarbons into bilges which may not always be
pumped dry, all contribute to microbial problems. SRB
activity is clearly evidenced in high rates of corrosion and
tends to be localized around specific areas, forming pits
and eventually holes.<BR>
Microbial problems in bilge and ballast systems are usually
associated with SRB pitting corrosion. In the majority of
cases, their presence will be identified visually and by a
distinct sulphurous smell. These warning signs of potential
problems, should ensure preventative measures are applied in
sufficient time to prevent structural damage.<P>

Fuel Oil: There will always be an initial source of
shipboard fuel contamination such as a shore tank, a dirty
pipe line, road tanker or polluted tank wash water. Airborne
contamination via tank breathers is less likely. Once
infestation has occurred, particular circumstances may
encourage microbial proliferation onboard. Further
inoculation is then immaterial as the key aggravating
factors are water and warmth.<P>

Water accumulates in tanks when there is no drain or water
scavenge system, where the drain is not at the lowest point
in the tank and where draining procedures are not enforced.<P>

Tanks in the engine room or other warm locations and tanks
receiving recirculated distillate fuel from injectors, are
ideal to incubate microbes. The double bottom tanks due to
the lower temperatures are less prone to microbial
proliferation.<P>

When heavily infected fuel is used, the symptoms of
microbial contamination will confront the ship operator
within a few hours. In the first case he will probably be
faced with filter plugging, fuel starvation, injector
fouling and, if coalescers are in use, they will
malfunction. The extent of the contamination must be
established.<P>

Lubricating Oil: Lubricant operating temperatures of
crankcase oils in wet engines are normally sufficient to
control and prevent infestation. Any problems are usually
associated with ships which have shut down their lubricant
system, allowing temperatures to drop and water to
accumulate.<BR>
Microbial growth in mineral hydraulic oil systems are prone
to attack. This is due to the operation of the system
generating heat and the bulk temperature will then probably
be high enough to stimulate microbial growth. If air is
entrained, oxygen will dissolve according to its partial
pressure and aerobic microbial growth will be sustained.<P>

Microbes are not inhibited or destroyed by the range of
pressures in common use. It is also possible that they can
contribute to cavitation damage by acting as bubble nuclei.
Controllable pitch propeller hydraulic oil systems have been
particularly vulnerable to microbial spoilage and fouling
problems. This has resulted in biocides being incorporated
within the hydraulic oil formulation.<P>

There are many thousands of types of microbes; only a few
are able to grow in lubricating oils at the elevated
operational temperatures in use. Providing the plant
treatment equipment is functional, purifier heater
temperature is maintained and the water content kept at a
minimum, the lubricating oil system will be both
environmentally and nutrient deficient. Such conditions will
prevent microbes from establishing themselves. Should heavy
contamination of the lubricating oil system occur, this self
regulating mechanism will be unable to prevent microbial
proliferation. Fortunately, the symptoms of microbial
contamination will not occur immediately, allowing the
engineer to implement corrective physical and/or chemical
decontamination programs.<P>

Cooling Water: Microbial contamination is often identified
in engine cooling water and can destroy the corrosion
inhibitor chemicals. The result is that the coolant may
smell and discolor, develop slimes/scum and gradually become
acidic. If it is an oil emulsion type, the emulsion may
split into two layers.<P>

Cooling water containing corrosion inhibitors is normally
alkaline at about pH 8-9. Since the system is in circulation
and aerated in use, any initial microbial contamination is
normally due to aerobic bacteria. However, oxygen
deficiencies occur as the flora increase and it has been
found that many of these bacteria are capable of obtaining
their oxygen by rapidly reducing nitrite, an anti-corrosive
ingredient. The nitrite is reduced to ammonia or nitrogen
gas and the water rapidly becomes corrosive. After some
time, cooling water may be sufficiently anaerobic to allow
SRB to proliferate. When this occurs, with the simultaneous
dispersion of the nutrient phase, rapid growth can cause
spoilage within days.<P>

<B>4. Health of Crews</B><BR>
Human Casualties of Microbial Contamination.
Recreational, potable and process water including air
conditioning systems are all able to nurture
microorganisms, including Legionella. Awareness of
those conditions which aggravate microbial
contamination and growth and of the possible infection
routes can suggest sensible control measures.<P>

The Merchant Shipping Notices M.1214, M.1215 and 1215
highlight and introduce measures for designing,
maintaining and disinfecting these systems.<P>

<B>4.1 Microbial Hazards</B><BR>
Microorganisms are included as 'substances hazardous to
health' in the UK 'Control of Substances Hazardous to
Health Regulations' (COSHH), 1988. It would be prudent
to comply with these regulations.<P>

Conventional pathogenic (disease producing) microbes
are not normally found in fuel and lubricants but two
opportunistic pathogens, the bacteria Pseudomonas
aeruginosa and mould Aspergillus fumigatus are
sometimes detected. These are common spoilage
microorganisms with a potential for causing clinical
infections in susceptible individuals. The most likely
route into the body is via inhalation as an aerosol
spray/mist. In addition, most spoilage bacteria contain
endo-toxins, which when inhaled as an aerosol can give
rise to flu-like symptoms.<P>

Of far more concern, is hydrogen sulphide, emanating
from SRB in tank and bilge water bottoms after extended
storage and stagnation. This is a lethal gas which is
more toxic than hydrogen cyanide. The danger with
hydrogen sulphide is that a false sense of security is
experienced, as it anaesthetises the sensory organs and
the characteristic offensive odour gradually
disappears.<P>

<B>4.2 Risk Assessment</B><BR>
Hazards can exist without significant risk to health.
Aerosol spray droplets below 5 um in diameter are
inhalable but if fine aerosol formation is avoided,
there is virtually no risk. Such aerosol formation is
most likely to occur during tank cleaning and approved
masks should be worn.<P>

Small concentrations of hydrogen sulphide in a water
phase equilibrate with very high concentrations in the
air phase, rising to dangerous levels within enclosed
spaces.<P>

Dangerous accumulation of hydrogen sulphide within
enclosed spaces should be avoided. If heavy infection
is identified, a biocide should be applied. Ventilation
is certainly not a guarantee of safety, as SRB will
continue to generate hydrogen sulphide until they are
killed - thus entry into a contaminated region is not
advisable.<P>

<B>4.3 Biocide Chemicals</B><BR>
Biocides which are used to kill or suppress microbial
growth are themselves toxic chemicals and COSHH
assessments may regulate their use. They must be used
judiciously, ensuring that the crews' health and safety
is not jeopardized. Also, they may be environmentally
unacceptable. Their proper safe use should be in
accordance to the Health and Safety material data
sheets supplied by the manufacturer.<P>

<B>5. Standards</B><BR>
There are no agreed or regulatory microbiological
standards which can be applied to either fuel or fuel
water bottoms, lubricants, bilges, ballast water and
distillate cargoes.<P>

Fuel Oil: With regards to fuel, microbial contamination
limits in relationship to possible operational problems
can only be assessed as guidance values. Since
microbiological tests quantify living organisms in
fuel, there will be many more undetected dead microbes
and biomass which might, if filter blocking occurs,
render the fuel 'unfit for use'.<P>

Marine Fuel Oil Supplier's Responsibility: The recent
high incidence of contaminated gas oil cargoes which
have in turn been supplied to ships, does little to
improve the confidence of operators in the marine
industry. One would have thought that this would have
sent shock waves through out the industry, but still
one encounters ships experiencing microbial operational
problems directly related to contaminated supplies.<P>

In every line of business it is natural to seek to
maximise profit, and competition may tempt business to
cut out what they view as "unnecessary" expenditure.
Allied to this, is the inescapable fact that the
running costs of a ship are high and returns limited,
encouraging fierce competition and creative
interpretation of even very strict rules.<P>

Despite the introduction of BS MA 100 in 1982 and ISO
8217 in 1987, marine fuel oils have been subject to
accidental and deliberate quality abuse. Why is it then
that all attempts have failed to control the quality of
marine fuel oils? Is it simply that the current
specification is inadequate and does not provide the
desired protection, or rather that one expects too much
of the engines and treatment plants?<P>

The perception of quality itself inevitably introduces
a natural conflict of interest, where the blame for
poor quality is apportioned between engine
manufacturers who demand quality fuel oil and fuel oil
manufacturers who demand quality engines, the end user
wants all round high quality of course. This is why the
definition of quality of marine fuel oils will remain
an enigma, as it is inseparable from the issue of
quality engines.<P>

There is also clearly a difference between those who
accidentally produce and supply a poor quality product
and those who deliberately do so, usually in ignorance
of the consequences to the safe operation of the ship
and the crew.<P>

Marine Fuel Oil Quality Specification: High quality
products are usually expensive and in order to secure
sales, harsh commercial realities inevitably moderate
the ideal quality desired.<P>

In the marine industry, the balance between technical
requirements and price is delicate and in practice the
ultimate arbitration of fuel oil quality takes place in
the engine and treatment plant.<P>

Certainly, improvements in marine engine design and
treatment plants over the past decade, appear to have
provided some tolerance to variable fuel oil quality.<P>

Although the specification offers full protection if
adhered to, analytical techniques provide only a
partial safeguard and warning against adulterated fuel
oil.<P>

In cases which do escape prior observation, the engine
and treatment plant will ultimately provide definitive
evidence of poor fuel oil quality and litigation may be
the ultimate guardian. Obviously, this route provides
no long term answer and is only a short term
palliative.<P>

Marine Fuel Oil Protection of Quality: The current fuel
specification provides adequate indication of
merchantable quality. That the specification does not
list every attribute required of a merchantable fuel
oil, does not mean either that the seller is free to
deliver unmerchantable fuel oil or that the fuel oil
complying with all tests listed but which for other
reasons is unusable, should be regarded as
merchantable. After all, the permissible content of
radioactive material is not listed in any fuel oil
specification which is not a carte-blanche for its
inclusion, as it is obvious that its presence is most
undesirable. Similar logic must be applied to microbial
contamination as being unacceptable and although not
specifically mentioned in the current international
specification, should not be tolerated from the fuel of
any supplier.<P>

ISO 8217 is an efficient specification which calls for
minimum independent testing and expenditure to control
quality. Since this specification fully protects the
consumer, only a few accidental problems should occur
and microbial contaminated supplies should have been
eradicated.<P>

However, some less prudent suppliers are prepared to
take risks with health and safety for monetary gain,
exacerbated when some fuel oil buyers shop around for
the cheapest deal. The strong desire to save and made
money provides sufficient incentive to cut corners
regardless of the consequences in maintaining fuel oil
quality. Owing to the very nature of the product and
the rather cavalier way it is handled, the
specification cannot be expected to prevent all forms
of quality abuse, but it has proved to be very
effective in identifying most offenders.<P>

The control of quality for fuel oils intended to be
used on land or at sea is governed by totally different
considerations. It certainly appears that so far the
development of land rules and regulations has
outstripped those which protect marine fuel oil
quality. It may well be that equally stringent rules
and regulations for marine fuel oils will be adopted in
the near future, which will automatically eliminate
"out of specification" fuel oil.<P>

There is also more awareness by marine fuel oil
purchasers, who now recognise that agreement contacts
require a clause stating that "products are to be
microbial free". Although not precise in its
definition, its presence should reduce the numerous
cases of contaminated supplies.<P>

Protection of Ship Operators: It would appear that
everybody is interested in fuel oil quality, yet the
problems persist. As strange as it may sound, the abuse
of quality is one of the driving forces behind the
specifications, rules and regulations, as all these
must respond to the problems created in the market
place.<BR>
It is hoped that the work on standardization of
procedures world-wide will continue and a comprehensive
system can be established, which will both be able to
deal satisfactorily with the current fuel oil quality
problems and be sufficiently elastic to keep pace with
the future advances of the industry.<P>

The petroleum and marine industries have already put an
enormous effort into providing solutions. As it becomes
harder to interfere in quality safety margins, the
methods used will tend to become more sophisticated,
increasing the onus of industrial responsibility to
deal with them.<P>

Is it easier to define the effects that these may have
on the user even if they are not always immediately
apparent, the most evident being the rapid and
catastrophic damage to the engine. Much less obvious is
the increased maintenance and excessive premiums due to
the exceptional number of claims, which can
significantly add to the running cost of the ship.<P>

Without standards of acceptable microbial limits, the
marine industry will continue to be treated with the
mentality of "out of sight, out of mind" leaving the
false impression that ship operators are themselves
responsible for resolving supply problems. Since fuel
oil suppliers are not party to what ship operators
intend to do with the loaded fuel oil, be it for
immediate use or long term storage, they cannot be the
ones to decide microbial limits. By definition,
acceptable microbial contamination limits should not
result in engine damage and treatment plant operational
problems.<P>

Should fuel oil suppliers good "housekeeping" practices
fail to achieve such standards, other preventative
actions should be implemented, such as the introduction
of a controlled microbial biocide treatment program.
There is evidence to suggest that the introduction of
preventative dosing of chemical biocides in fuel oil
storage tanks ashore would partially resolve ship
operators' problems.<P>

The reason that this approach to ensuring the safe
operation of ships has not been adopted is purely
financial. The additional costs of the biocide and
dosing program by the fuel oil suppliers would either
have to be absorbed by them or passed onto the ship
operator.<P>

<B>6. Conclusion</B><BR>
Microbial fouling and corrosion are becoming
commonplace onboard and will probably continue to
increase due to fuel oil formulation and handling
trends, polluted harbor waters plus regulatory
pressures. Ship design and building should recognize
these facts, so that systems are designed to be less
conducive to harboring microorganisms and more readily
sampled and decontaminated if problems are experienced.
Comprehensive onboard test kits are available for
detecting and quantifying microbial contamination and
for monitoring the success of anti-microbial measures.<P>

There is a growing awareness by underwriters that
microbial damage claims are not due to an "act of God"
but are detectable and avoidable. An onboard testing
regime would provide good evidence that due diligence
had been exercised.<P>

Various strategies are available for reducing the
problems but solutions must be safe and environmentally
acceptable. The details needed to build these
strategies into full working protocols will depend upon
individual circumstances, the time available and access
to anti-microbial agents. There are many different
microbiological problems that need to be met with
specific, tailored solutions. However, there are
certain common principles of good practice which can be
implemented. These anti-microbial strategies have
proved to be successful in the field. Briefly
recapping, these are:<P>

Physical Prevention: preventing ingress of inoculating
microbes, particularly those already adapted to growth
in relevant environments. Avoid spreading contamination
by passing clean fluids through contaminated pipes,
filters and into dirty tanks. Minimize conditions which
encourage microbial growth and water.<P>

Physical Decontamination: settling, heat, filtration
and centrifugal procedures all aid in decontamination,
the choice depending upon equipment and time
constraints.<P>

Chemical Prevention: protecting against minor
contamination, coupled with good housekeeping to
prevent rather than cure infection.<P>

Chemical Decontamination: a wide range of chemical
biocides is available. Only a few are appropriate to
each specific application, there being no universal
eradication fluid. All are toxic and must only be used
with due regard to health and safety and environmental
impact.<P>

Such is the scale of the problems being encountered
within the marine industry, that ship operators have
expressed their growing concern. Microbial
investigations by Lloyd's Register have identified,
that they are no longer just looking at dirty fuel oil,
crankcases, blocked filters, etc. but that microbial
contamination is now compromising the safe operation of
the ship.<P>

<B>1.  Summary</B><BR>
This letter is about the efforts of Armenian
scientists to study sensory mechanisms of snakes that
are seemingly capable of detecting the earth tremors 18
hours before their occurrence and about unique fifteen
years long studies of materials bacterial destruction
and its prevention (There are about 2,500 species of
biodestructor bacteria in their databank!)
There are news from the European Union (EU): The EU has
initiated Biotechnological Demonstration Projects to
prove the technical viability and economic advantages
of new technologies.  The EU is also putting one
million ECUs in to their new biotechnology publicity
program.<BR>
Finally to all of you who is interested in
biotechnology I offer description of forthcoming
meetings in Europe.<P>

<B>2. Snaky Biosensors</B><BR>
The Armenians have originated a project of using
poisonous gurza snakes as biosensors for earthquakes.
They have noticed that several hours prior to a quake,
hundreds of these snakes surface, head to the river,
and swim downstream to congregate until the earthquake
is over.  (They only go as far as the spot where the
local molybdenum mine dumps its refuse in the water.)
Then they return, also en masse.<BR>
The Armenian scientists are looking at three
possible explanations for the behavior of the snakes.
Although the snakes are deaf, they are very sensitive
to infrasound and infrared.  It is also possible that
they sense minute chemical changes in HS
concentrations.<BR>
The scientists don't feel it is an electromagnetic
effect--gurzas placed in Helmholz coils showed no
special sensitivity.  The snakes seem to provide the
best advance warning of all animals studied--up to 18
hours.  Dogs seem to know when earthquakes are coming a
few hours prior.  Goats, we are told, are not so good,
"maybe 30 minutes to an hour ahead at the most".<P>

<B>3. Microbiology - Anticorrosion and Materials Destruction</B><BR>
The Armenian Institute of Microbiology institute
was founded in 1961 and has nearly 200 employees, 10
laboratories, and a small chemical and drug factory.
It also has library of more than 20,000 living bacteria
cultures which are available for international access.
(Researchers had to keep the test tubes in their own
beds last winter to save bacteria from the harsh
conditions at the institute last winter!) The Institute
maintains a databank of information on all their
cultures to include nomenclature, bacterial
characteristics, and passport data (strains). They are
putting all this into an electronic database.
Of great significance is a databank of 2,500
species of biodestructors.  They have developed a scale
to measure the degree of bacterial damage and
procedures to protect people and equipment exposed to
biodestructors.  Current research includes bacterial
destruction of synthetic materials for waste treatment,
bacterial enrichment of ore, synthetic production of
fructose, bacterial insecticides, acido-lactic products
for treatment of childhood diseases, and production of
gunpowder additives/replacements.<BR>
In addition, the institute is developing a liquid
protection coating to prevent biocorrosion and
destruction of pipelines.  The bacterial agents in this
coating are also being investigated for use as an
additive to paints used for ship hulls to prevent
mollusks from attaching.<P>

<B>4. Antibacterial Healing Ointment from Russia</B><BR>
Russian doctors Ivanov and Egorov claim
development of a new ointment that scarlessly heals the
skin infected by: all forms of warts, condyloma
acuminata, molluscum contagiosum, epidermodisplasia
verruciformis Levandovsky-Lutz, acroceratosis
verruciformis Hopf, and keratoacanthoma
They also claim that they can heal the following
skin cancers: epithelioma basocellulare, epithelioma
pagetoides, and epithelioma spinocellulare.
They invite collaboration and/or equal rights
business partnership.<P>

<B>5. European Union (EU) Demonstration Project</B><BR>
Since "seeing is believing" the intention of
demonstration projects is to provide the program with
an internal mechanism for the exploitation and
dissemination of new technologies where uncertainties
and risks may discourage potential users. Demonstration
projects aim to promote biotechnology to commercial
users investors and the general public at large.
The Fourth Framework program defines demonstration
projects as where "the objective is to prove the
technical viability of a new technology together with
its economic advantages. Projects will be
precompetitive and as such should focus on the
applications of new technologies and involve
participants by both producers and users." Thus while
traditional research and technology development
projects aim to generate basic knowledge the purpose of
a demonstration is to show that new technology will
actually work in a real situation. "Technical
viability" involves showing that a new technology has
advantages compared with current technology or that it
can comply with regulations or standards or that it is
acceptable to the public. "Economic advantage" means
that the new technology should not only increase
financial profit but also increase the efficiency of
public services or improve public perceptions of
biotechnology .<BR>
The project must involve both people who produce
the technology and people who would use it so as to
represent both viewpoints.<P>

<B>6. A Million ECUs For Publicizing Biotechnology</B><BR>
The European Commission is spending I million ECUs
over the next three years on advancing public awareness
and understanding of biotechnology across Europe.
The appointed Task Group has at present some 50 members
from all EU and most other European countries. There
are six Working Groups relating user group needs with
Task Group activities: biotechnology industry;
journalists and the media; politicians and policy
makers; biotechnology research and higher education;
environmental and consumer organizations; and research
on public perceptions.<BR>
The overall aim is to promote greater public
awareness and understanding of biotechnology and to
encourage informed, open debate. It does this in a
number of different ways:<BR>
public opinion surveys and media analyses to aid policy
development, planning and provision of information; a
series of briefing papers on key issues in
biotechnology, widely distributed throughout Europe and
translated into the main European languages handbooks
and leaflets detailing sources of biotechnology
information throughout Europe for non-specialists. The
Internet and WWW providing information, the exchange of
information and Correspondence in relation to all the
above activities.<BR>
The European Commission has supported the Task
Group since its establishment in 1991 and this new-
funding will enable the expansion of its activities and
also new targeted activities for Specific groups such
as industrialists or environmentalists.<P>

<B>1.Summary</B><BR>
This newsletter is in response to an overwhelming
number of requests for more information on Russian R&D
sparked by the release of the newsletter "Russian
Science". In this letter, I enumerate federal funds
distributed in the areas of basic science, education,
and military R&D (this time I did not forget about the
conversion factor from the Russian ruble to the US
dollar). I think it would be interesting for you to see
how Russians control their R&D policies. They put
forward a comprehensive program aimed at coordinating
different government agencies (and ministries) and at
integrating Russian R&D into the modern international
environment. Also included is a list of prominent
Russian academicians, industrialists, and scholars who
advise the Russian President on S&T policy. At the end
of this newsletter I also added statistics on incomes
of Russian scientists.<P>

A comprehensive program (Decree # 3360 of the Russian
Federation Government) "On State Support for the
Development of Scientific and Technical Developments"
was developed with Russian Academy of Sciences and the
Ministry of Science and Technical Policy. The Decree
was signed by Premier Chernomyrdin in April 1995.
The main points were made on allocation of foreign
funds for purchase of scientific equipment, journals,
patents and certifications; institute tax exemptions for
import and export of scientific materials and
equipment; formulate and implement "measures" to
support development of science and innovative
activities. Below is an itemized plan of this program.<P>

<B>1. Summary:</B><BR>
The Science Park of Trieste is the first science
and technology park in Italy. It started to operate in
1982. The Park stretches over a territory of 35
hectares, on the plateau surrounding Trieste, and
consists of 41,000 square meters of premises and
facilities. Further 16,000 square meters of premises
are still under construction.<BR>
The presence in Science Park of the International
Center for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology and of
Elettra Synchrotron Light Laboratory established a tool
of international value for scientific, technological
and economic development in the fields of biotechnology
and of material science.<BR>
 In the Science Park there are about 20
international and national centers, laboratories and
companies run on both governmental and private funds,
employing more than 750 people.<P>

<B>2. About The Science Park</B><BR> 
The Science Park Consortium, which is a
governmental body operating under the aegis of the
Italian Ministry of University and Scientific and
Technological Research, has the task of managing,
promoting and developing the Science Park. Among its
members, there are the Autonomous Region of Friuli
Venezia Giulia, the Province and Municipality of
Trieste, the Universities of Trieste and of Udine, the
National Research Council and the most renowned
scientific institutions of the Friuli Venezia Giulia
Region.<BR>
The Consortium is in charge of the urbanization,
the building of premises and equipped laboratories and
arranges and manages the supply of the logistic and
technological services required by the tenants of the
Park. It looks after the promotion and the image of the
park and fosters relations with other institutions
(such as Public Bodies, Universities, financial
organizations, research centers, industries).
The Consortium supports technical and commercial
development of the centers and companies located in the
Science Park offering administrative, legal and
marketing assistance, and promotes training activities
for junior graduates.<BR>
 The Science Park Consortium may contribute
directly towards projects of applied research and of
technological development of special importance
conducted by the Centers and Companies operating in the
Science Park, through contributions in supporting
expenses, and by means of capital and interest account
financing.<BR>
 Amongst the most effective support measures or
interventions in favor of the Centers in the Park,
there is the fact that the Consortium is willing to
purchase specialized instrumentation and equipment
necessary for the activity of its tenants to whom it is
then rented; this is a neat solution to a not uncommon
problem for those working in R&D - lack of resources
for investments conditioning the overall outcome of the
activity.<BR>
 In accordance with local laws, the Regional
Administration may provide contributions to capital
account up to a 40% of expenses necessary for plant,
expansion or running in the initial development stage
of "research laboratories whose objective is to promote
the industrial development in technologically advanced
sectors with a highly qualified workforce".<BR>
 Included in the Consortium's programs is a
commitment to providing training programs for new
graduates this has led to many young people entering
research and production not only locally: scholarships
are an item in the Consortium's budget and this means
training that is preferably carried out in Centers
working within AREA.<P>

<B>3. Research Areas and Labs of the Science Park</B><BR>  
The main activities of the Science Park are
scientific research, development and transfer of new
technologies and of innovative services in the fields

<B>1. Summary:</B><BR>
The United Nations Industrial Development Organization
(UNIDO) recognized, at a very early stage the potential
of genetic engineering and biotechnology to alleviate
disease and starvation and to promote the economic
progress of the developing world. It began the
initiative that has led to the foundation of ICGEB.
The research, training schemes and services of ICGEB
represent an innovative and comprehensive approach to
promote biotechnology internationally. The Center aims
at helping developing nations to help themselves and
holds out the prospect for advancing knowledge and
applying the latest biotechnological techniques in
public health, nutrition, environmental
protection/remediation and energy saving.
ICGEB provides a scientific and educational environment
of the highest standards. It brings biotechnology to
developing countries by strengthening their research
capabilities. Its laboratories develop state-of-the-art
research of importance to bio-industries in Member
States.<P>

<B>2. About the ICGEB</B><BR>
In 1981, UNIDO convened a meeting of distinguished
scientists to consider the mechanisms to speed up the
dissemination of these revolutionary technologies. The
result was a proposal to establish an international
center of excellence that, by providing an environment
conducive to research and development, would act as a
vehicle to foster biotechnology in the developing
world. In 1982, this concept was approved by a high
level conference of developed and developing nations in
Belgrade. The first steps to establish the Center were
taken the next year when, at a follow up
Plenipotentiary Meeting in Madrid, the Statutes of the
Center were signed by 26 countries. The establishment
of ICGEB and its subsequent development has been
guided, under the aegis of UNIDO, by a panel of
scientific advisers and by a Preparatory Committee of
representatives of the States having signed the
Statutes. With the entry into force of the Statutes on
3 February 1994, and with the subsequent Agreement
between ICGEB and UNIDO for the transfer of assets at
the end of 1995, the Center has become a fully
autonomous international organization composed of 37
Member States.<P>

Located in Trieste, Italy and New Delhi, India the
Center forms an interactive network with Affiliated
Centers in Member States.<P>

The organs of ICGEB are the Secretariat, the Board of
Governors and the Council of Scientific Advisers. The
Secretariat is composed of the Director, the two Heads
of Components and the scientific and administrative
staff operating within the framework of the ICGEB
program. The Board of Governors consists of a
representative of each Member State and constitutes the
directive organ of the Center. The Council of
Scientific Advisers is composed of eminent scientists
and oversees the scientific excellence of ICGEB.
The scientific and administrative management is the
responsibility of the Director and the Heads of the two
component laboratories. The research staff at each
component laboratory consists of senior scientists
directing research groups composed of junior
scientists, support staff and trainee fellows from the
Member States.<P>

The Center presently employs ( 1995 ) over 200 staff
and guests at its premises in Trieste and New Delhi .
The Trieste Component currently occupies 5,700m2 and is
expected to expand to 7,000m2 within 1996. The New
Delhi Component, has moved to the new 1O,OOO m2
premises at the end of 1995. A new guest house is
already available in New Delhi and there are similar
plans for Trieste.<P>

In its second session the Board of Governors endorsed a
program covering the 1996-2000 period and implying an
overall financial requirement of US$72.6 million. Funds
are provided by the Governments of Italy and India, the
AREA Science Park of Trieste - the authority that
administers the science park where the Trieste
Component is located- as well as voluntary
contributions by the participating countries. From
1999, all Member States will participate in the
financing of ICGEB, through a scale of assessment to be
adopted by the Board of Governors.<P>

Group on Biosafety. ICGEB has dedicated significant
resources in strengthening institutional capability in
Member States to assess biological safety through
training programmer that are unique in the coverage of
topics and the comprehensives of approach. In addition
UNIDO, in co-operation with ICGEB, has established the
Biosafety Information Network and Advisory Service
(BINAS) which is aimed at serving as a dedicated
resource for assisting Member States in the area of
biosafety. BINAS facilitates regulatory harmonization
by allowing referral to, and cross-correlation of,
existing national regulations and administrative
procedures, thus simplifying identification of
regulatory conflicts. As such BINAS provides a decision
support environment for the formulation and/or
refinement of biotechnology regulations. It strengthens
institutional capability by advisory services, training
in risk assessment methodologies and information
support.<P>

<B>11. Co-operation with International Agencies and Industry</B><BR>
This is promoted to harmonize and speed up projects of
common interest. Apart from UNIDO, ICGEB retains close
contacts with WHO, FAO, UNEP, UNESCO, IAEA, OECD, the
Commission of the European Communities (CEC) and the
European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL); close
collaboration with the International Center of
Theoretical Physics (IAEA/UNESCO) and with the
International Center of Science and High Technology,
located in Trieste under UNIDO auspices, is well
developed.<P>

ICGEB adopts a positive patenting and licensing policy.
Licenses can be made available to enterprises of Member
States. Furthermore, through the establishment of new
guidelines, ICGEB should be in the position of

<B>1. Summary</B><BR>
A review of private FSU R&D companies was held at the
resort area near Moscow in September 1996. As the first
meeting of this kind in the FSU, it has attracted
attention of the Russian Department of Commerce, large
Russian R&D institutions, as well as the US industrial
representatives in Moscow. A private design bureau
based at the Bauman Technical University (Moscow)
offered a number of materials and robotics technologies
based on their space vehicle research. About forty
formal papers were given as discussion posters. Most of
the talks were on materials, physics of materials, and
surface physics. There were also papers on laser
physics and laser technologies. In this report you will
find a complete list of reviewed papers and a
description of a few general interest technologies such as
thermal insulating materials, coatings, and lasers. The
unedited proceedings can be made available upon
request. The event was sponsored by all three services
of Edison House.<P>

<B>2. Background</B><BR>
After the breaking of the Soviet Union, centralized R&D
support and leadership have been in decline in the FSU.
Many leading scientists and engineers from academia and
military-industrial complex in FSU have started their
own R&D companies, which sometimes represent the best
of R&D in some areas. These companies invariably stay
underground, as they are afraid of organized crime.
There is also a very little support from the
government. These private companies were often formed
from the former enterprises of the USSR military-
industrial complex, or/and formed by well known
scientists. These companies are market oriented and
often have access to modern equipment that the state
enterprises do not have because of bad planning or lack
of funds.<BR>
"Plasma Test Ltd" in Moscow, a successful hi-tech
corporation working in the area of plasma incineration
and materials coatings, owes much of its prosperity to
Mr. Adam Gonopolsky. Adam is an outstanding
representative of a new class of Russian entrepreneurs
and industrialists and a distinguished scientist and
educator. He took charge of organizing the meeting in
view of his knowledge of private industry in FSU.
The meeting took place in a sanatorium surrounded by
birch and pine woods; all privately owed territory
located about 60 km from Moscow. All modern amenities
were available. There was a swimming pool, sauna and
the were racquetball courts on the grounds.<BR>
Transportation from and to airports and railway station
was arranged for all participants. We also visited the
nearby experimental center of Bauman Technical
University where we saw demonstration of interesting
technologies and visited unique space technology
museum. The Institute was a primary space research and
space engineering education center in USSR. Most of the
cosmonauts were trained there.<P>

<B>2.1  Patent information</B><BR> 
Most of the papers presented are protected by USSR
copyright certificates. However, 19 papers out of 40
did not have copyright. Thirty percent of the papers
have patents that have passed the international
patent standards and whose innovative nature is
indisputable in any country where they are
valid. The remaining seventy percent of patented
projects have Russian Federation patents.<P>

<B>3. Selected technologies</B><P>

<B>3.1 Ecologically safe non-combustible heat-insulating materials based on mineral fibers and non-organic binders</B> are made from mineral superfine fibers (basalt,
kaolin etc.). The materials are chemically inert and
noncombustible; do not liberate toxic substances at
high and low temperatures and offer low thermal
conductivity.<P>
Properties: 
Basalt based
density, 140 kg/m3; thermal conductivity 0.0035 w/mQ;
temperature range -260 +700oC
kaolin based
density, 270 kg/m3; thermal conductivity 0.0045 w/mQ;
temperature range -260 +1300oC
Quartz based
density, 140 kg/m3; thermal conductivity 0.0035 w/mQ;
temperature range -260 +1100oC<P>

Applications: chemical, machine building, electric
power industry (including nuclear), industrial and
civil engineering, cryogenic engineering, ship-
building, aerospace industry, transport, food industry,
etc.<P>

These materials were awarded a diploma and a gold medal
in April 1996 at the Geneva International exhibition of
inventions in Switzerland (salon 24). These materials
were patented in the Russian Federation.<P>

<B>3.2 Hand held cutter</B> (Based on space rocket engine
R&D). Cuts steels, cast iron, concrete, rock, etc. up
to 10 - 15 inches of thickness.<P>

Applications: reclamation, emergency & rescue services,
metallurgy, civil engineering, transport, etc.<P>

Advantages: reliability and simple service due to
simplicity of the design; easy operation, mobility and
flexibility, extremely simple to use. Binary fuel -
kerosene and oxygen, inexpensive.<P>

<B>3.3 Fire extinguishing device</B> (based on space
technology). Using a solid rocket propellant and water,
it extinguishing fires with remarkable speed by filling
the volume under fire with water vapor.<P>

<B>3.4 Underwater containment technology </B> (based on
satellite antennae research)<BR>
Developed for containment of the nuclear submarine
"Komsomolets" that sank in the Norwegian sea on the
depth of 1700m. The whole project from design,
manufacturing and to actual deployment took only three
months. They developed and manufactured: new special
elastic material based on glass fibers and silicone, a
mechanical device that automatically unfolds the
material to envelope part of the submarine hull; self
opening partitions, and elastic bags that were filled
with water inside of the submarine.<P>

<B>3.5 The electrostatic protection coating</B> for aircraft
composite materials allows spray-covering of the
assembled aircraft as well as its separate parts and
can be used during aircraft repairs. The technology was
tested on the KA50 and K62 helicopters and on SU84
airplane. The coating makes a thin conductive layer
that becomes a part of the composite after a special
treatment.<P>

<B>3.6 A single mode CO2 laser</B> was designed using an non-
conventional approach of electrodless AC discharging at
12-15 kHz to generate a highly homogeneous medium in
diffusion-cooled wave-guide tubes with slow pumping. A
beam power of 500w and diameter 7mm, with a divergence
of 1.5mrad has been developed. 5000w laser is under
construction.<P>

<B>3.7 The plasma-detonation treatment</B> is based on the use
of plasma jets powered by the transformation of a
detonation wave into a plasma pulse. Energy density can
reach 10E7 W/cm2. When the pulse interacts with a
surface of metals it forms a region of shock-compressed
plasma with a highly localized temperature of 3000oC.
The device can operate with a frequency of 1-4Hz and a
pulse duration 1-5ms. With evaporation of the central
electrode material a surface layer alloying of 15-18 mm
diameter 100-150 microns depth. Metallographic studies
revealed the presence of a white unetched layer that
coincided with the layer of high hardness.<P>

<B>3.8 High frequency induction pulse treatment</B> -
hardening of asymmetric pieces of metal or metal alloys
without external cooling with speeds of quenching up to
10000oC/sec. About 1mm depth of hardened material was
obtained after 100ms at frequency 66kHz.<P>

<B>3.9 High speed streak and framing photography</B> has been
developed to analyze spatial-temporal characteristics
of IR and UV lasers (CO, CO2, YAG, Er eximer, etc.).
Framing range up to 5000f/s.<P>

<B>3.10 Low temperature plasma treatment of fibers.</B> A glow
discharge in vacuum treatment of organic and non-
organic fibers results in increased adhesive
properties, hydrophilicity (e.g. polyester fabrics
increases capillarity from 40 to 200mm), bonding
strength between fibers. A compact and simple industrial
device was developed.<P>

<B>1. Summary</B><BR>
EC-US Task Force on Biotechnology Research encouraged the
Working Group on Environmental Biotechnology of EU to
support the EC-US workshop on Environmental Biotechnology
that was held in November 1996, Granada, Spain. The
workshop objectives were to examine the biochemical and
genetic bases of biodegradation in different environments
and for the rational design and use of microbes in polluted
sites. Additional objectives were to foster cooperation
between US and EC scientists in the field of environmental
biotechnology, including scientists at an early stage of
their careers, and to provide research managers with
insights, based on case studies, into new directions in
environmental biotechnology.<P>

Nineteen internationally recognized research leaders and 20
advanced students and post-doctoral fellows took part in
oral and poster sessions and extensive discussions that
generated a number of interesting new research venues. In
this letter you will find a short summary of these
discussions, and a list of presented papers. I also
included information on the EU-US Biotechnology Task Force
and on the current program of the European Commission on
Environmental Biotechnology.<P>

The workshop was supported by the Commission of the
European Communities, Brussels, Belgium; Office of Naval
Research, Arlington, VA, US; Office of Naval Research,
Europe, London, UK; and by the US Army European Research
Office, London, UK.<P>

<B>2. Background</B><P>

<B>2.1 EC-US Task Force on Biotechnology Research</B><BR>
The US-EC Task Force on Biotechnology Research was
established on 7 September 1990 by an administrative
arrangement between the European Commission and the United
States Government, with the goal of increasing the mutual
understanding between European Community activities and US
programs related to biotechnology research. The Task Force
was designed to serve as a mechanism for the exchange of
information regarding scientific aspects of biotechnology.
In June 1996, this arrangement between the Commission and
the United States Government was renewed for a period of
five years.<P>

The discussions at the plenary meetings involved subjects
deserving major international attention and collaboration.
Within this framework, a workshop for scientists invited
from Europe and the US was organized in October 1994 in
Brussels on aspects of Environmental Biotechnology. The
workshop focused mainly on Anaerobic Biodegradation, the
Development of Microcosms and Mesocosms for
Biodegradability Testing, and Tailor Made Microbes for
Biodegradation.<P>

Due to the success and interest in the Brussels workshop,
the Task Force encouraged the Working Group on
Environmental Biotechnology to organize two follow-up
activities. One is this workshop, Joint EC-US Workshop
on Environmental Biotechnology which focuses on the
Molecular and Biochemical Bases of Biodegradation
and a Hands-on Short Course on Bioremediation.<P>

<B>2.2 Granada Workshop</B><BR>
The members of the European Steering Committee were Dr. I
Economidis (EC)m Dr. D. Janssen (The Netherlands), Dr. P.
Williams (UK), and Dr. J.L. Ramos (Spain). Members of the
US Steering Committee were Dr. Anna Palmisano (DoD, ONR), 
Dr. Joseph Suflita (U. of Oklahoma) , Dr. Wall (Missouri U) 
and Dr. Young (Rutgers U). The workshop' local and main 
organizer and chair was Dr. Juan L. Ramos, CSIC, Granada.<P>

The major objectives of the workshop were:<BR>
a. to examine the biochemical and genetic bases of
biodegradation in different environments, for the
rational design and use of microbes in polluted sites<BR>
b.  to foster cooperation between US and EC scientists in
the field of environmental biotechnology, including
scientists at an early stage of their careers, and<BR>
c. to provide research managers with insights, based on
case studies, into new directions in environmental
biotechnology. One half-day was dedicated to a
discussion of the state of the art, an assessment of
future directions, and a definition of areas of mutual
EC-US interest.<P>

<B>3. Discussions and Future Directions</B><P>

<B>3.1 The Biochemistry of Anaerobic and Aerobic Biodegradation</B><BR>
Some of these bacterial biodegradative processes take
place as part of co-metabolism with other compounds.
Relevant metabolic processes in anaerobes include
reductive dechlorination and halorespiration, and
degradation of aromatic hydrocarbons (toluenes, xylenes,
ethylbenzene, benzene) and alkanes. Advances in the
biochemistry of biodegradative processes in aerobes include
not only the characterization of key pathways in Gram-
negative bacteria, but also the biochemistry of other less
studied microbes such as Gram-positive bacteria and fungi.
With the aid of recent developments in the area of chemical
engineering, some of these anaerobic and aerobic processes
have been adopted for industrial utilization.<P>

Some aspects of this area of research deserve further
attention, in particular:<BR>
i) Understanding the biochemistry of anaerobic processes as
the molecular basis of the anaerobic degradation;<BR>
ii) Genetics of anaerobes and Gram-positive bacteria, with
emphasis on the development of tools for their engineering
and manipulation.<BR>
iii)Influence of the composition of the medium,
identification of abiotic factors that alter the
control of gene expression for extra- and intracellular
enzymes, etc. The biochemistry, physiology and genetics
related to the utilization of alternative electron
acceptors by anaerobes should also be considered.<P>

<B>3.2 The environment as a limiting factor for biodegradation</B><BR>
On many occasions, limitations to biodegradation are
outside the microorganism, and involve factors such as
limited access of microorganisms to the pollutant because
of physical constraints, such as limitations caused by
reduced mass transfer or reduced desorption of the
pollutant from soil particles and other substrates.<P>

What organisms or microbial activities can be used to
overcome these limitations? How can surfactants,
exoenzymes, carriers, etc help to accelerate pollutant
desorption and mass transfer? Are combined physicochemical
and biological approaches needed in cases for which the
environment is the main limiting factor?<P>

<B>3.3 Molecular basis for recalcitrance of pollutants</B><BR>
Insights have been obtained into the causes of
recalcitrance of many synthetic chemicals, although
unifying concepts are still difficult to define.
Nonetheless, it was clearly shown that certain limitations
can be overcome by expansion of the substrate specificity
of key enzymes, or by coupling the action of several
different enzymes such as oxygenases and ligninases.<P>

Hybrid pathways have been obtained for the metabolism of
certain recalcitrant compounds such as aliphatics and
aromatics with a low level of substitution with nitro
groups or halogen atoms. Hybrid pathways represent a way
to overcome microbiological limitations in bioremediation.<P>

The intrinsic toxicity of some chemicals was shown to
limit the performance of microbes with interesting
biodegradative properties, although an array of microbes
able to thrive in the presence of high concentrations of
toxic pollutants are being found worldwide, representing
new opportunities. The need for microbes to be able to deal
with recalcitrant polychlorinated compounds was found to
be of particular interest. A series of open questions
about the ability of recombinant microbes to survive and
perform under field conditions were raised. Field tests
with wild-type and recombinant microbes have to be
designed to demonstrate biodegradative activity in situ.
Elucidation of the physiological, biochemical and genetic
base of tolerance to organic solvents and other toxic
pollutants will require studies to determine whether these
"new" traits can be transferred to other microbes of
interest for biodegradation. It was suggested that stress
responses that improve activity and survival be studied.<P>

<B>3.4 Biodiversity of biodegradation</B><BR>
In almost any given pollutant, a wide variety of aerobic
and anaerobic microbes, including bacteria and fungi, can
be found. Biodiversity extends not only to microbes but
also to genes and catabolic pathways: at least five
different pathways are now known for toluene metabolism by
aerobic bacteria and fungi and at least one pathway is
known for anaerobic bacteria. Future studies will therefore
involve the design of new pathways via the use of different
genetic modules that will allow the expansion of the
catabolic potential of microbes. This natural process can
be mimicked in the laboratory, which gives new insights in
the molecular mechanisms of bacterial adaptation.<P>

Can such new pathways be designed for recalcitrant
pollutants? Would every synthetic chemical become easily
degradable in the environment? How do natural genetic
processes (transformation, conjugation, transduction)
contribute to the evolution of new pathways? How do
catabolic plasmids evolve and spread? What is the
ecological and environmental significance of these
pathways? How are different catabolic pathways regulated?
Which environmental signals trigger the evolution of
regulatory mechanisms?<P>

<B>4. Future hands-on short course on bioremediation</B><BR>
The Steering Committee has met to plan the "Theoretical and
Practical Course on Environmental Biotechnology", to be
held at Rutgers University in the summer of 1998. To foster
cooperation and collaboration between US and EC scientists,
a Theoretical and Practical Course on Environmental
Biotechnology for advanced students on both sides of the
Atlantic was proposed. The course will be organized by Dr.
Lily Young and Dr. Gerben Zylstra. Members of the Steering
Committees will support the organization of the course and
relevant scientists in the area will be invited to take part
as instructors. The course will be held at facilities
available at Rutgers University in New Brunswick, New
Jersey.<P>

The Course on Bioremediation (Rutgers University,
summer 1998) will be team-taught by faculty from both
the US and EC. Dr. Lily Young of Rutgers University
will be the Course Director. The students will be
drawn equally from the US and the European Community.<P>

Field sites in the northern New Jersey / New York City
area will be exploited to sample a range of
environmental matrices, including soils, groundwater
and estuarine sediments.<P>

In the medium term, exchanges of personnel between US
and European laboratories for training is envisaged as
a way to strengthen links between laboratories. These
links will form the basis of further development in the
area of Environmental Biotechnology.<P>

In the future joint research activities are envisaged
as a way to firmly establish cooperative links.<P>

<B>1. Summary</B><P>

   Two laboratories were visited in Petten, Netherlands:  The Institute for Advanced Materials of the Joint Research Centre (IAM-JRC) and The National Ceramic Centre of the Netherlands Energy Research Foundation, ECN.  Both have excellent materials research programs, state-of-the-art facilities, and first rate scientists.  IAM-JRC focuses on high temperature structural materials--ceramics, alloys, and composites. The National Ceramic Centre (ECN) has excellent processing and testing capabilities and their research is broad, ranging from structural ceramics to solid oxide fuel cells.  Funding for IAM-JRC research is mostly from the European Union, while the Dutch government supports most of the efforts at the National Ceramic Centre.  However both laboratories seek (and obtain) additional funding from European industries.  Industrial support is becoming a more important fraction of both laboratories' research budgets, as government money is decreasing.  The two laboratories are physically adjacent to each other.  They do collaborate on research projects, but often they are competitors for external funding.  US scientists and technologists interested in mechanical property and corrosion testing should visit IAM-JRC to study, and possibly duplicate, their unique testing equipment.  The end use of most of the composite research appears to be shifting from structural applications to energy use and functional material applications.<P>

<B>2. Introduction</B><P>

   This report was prepared jointly by Ben Wilcox and Jack Mecholsky.  Jack will complete his year at ONREUR in August and will return to his faculty position in the Department of Materials Science and Engineering at the University of Florida, Gainesville, FL.  Ben joined ONREUR in May 1996 for a period of three years.  Prior to that he headed the Materials Science Division at the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), Arlington, VA.  He will report on technical aspects of structural and functional materials research in Europe, Africa, and the Middle East.  He will also report selectively on science policy and funding strategies of different countries and the European Union, particularly as they affect Materials Science and Engineering research.

   Our trip to Petten was arranged by Prof. M.H. van de Voorde who is Head of a Materials Division at IAM-JRC.  He is also a Professor at Delft University of Technology. IAM-JRC and ECN both occupy a research site in Petten, Netherlands, which is about 60 km north of Amsterdam.  They are two separate and independent laboratories; IAM-JRC is funded predominately by the European Union (EU) and ECN is funded mostly by the Dutch Government.  In both cases additional funding is sought and received from industries in the EU countries.  We noted one project where the two laboratories collaborated, an Advanced Coating Centre for the development of new coatings for materials in severe environments, i.e. for wear and corrosion resistance.  However in most cases it appeared that the laboratories were in competition, especially for industrial contract research funding. In both laboratories there is a strong effort to increase industrial support as EU and Dutch government funding decreases, i.e. IAM-JRC is seeking to increase its industrial support from 20% to 30% of its total budget.<P>

<B>3. Research at the Institute for Advanced Materials of the Joint Research Centre (IAM-JRC) at Petten</B><P>

   IAM-JRC, Petten and its sister laboratory at Ispra, Italy were founded in the mid-1960's as part of EURATOM when Europe was investing heavily in nuclear energy R&D.  Both had (and still have) very strong materials research capabilities, including nuclear materials.  In the 1970's nuclear research was de-emphasized and the laboratories broadened their mission, much like some DOE National Laboratories in the U.S.  Nuclear materials testing and evaluation at the Petten High Flux Reactor is still an important function.<P>

   The Institute for Advanced Materials has evolved into a first rate laboratory for the development and characterization of metallic, ceramic, and composite structural materials for advanced high temperature technologies, and they have established an international reputation in materials science.  Much of their success is due to the ten year leadership of the Director, Dr. E.D. Hondros, who retired in 1995, and is now Senior Visiting Professor in the Materials Science Department at Imperial College of Science, Technology, and Medicine, London.  He was succeeded as Director by Dr. Torronen from Finland, an expert on materials and nuclear safety. Much of the research is published in abstract form in "The Materials Challenge", a news bulletin of the Institute for Advanced Materials.  This is a very high quality glossy publication, and is distributed widely. It is also a good marketing document.<P>

   The laboratory staff numbers about 100 plus some post-doctorate and part-time students.  The scientists are multi-national.  We saw excellent state-of-the-art facilities for creep and fatigue testing, ceramic processing, ceramic joining, and high temperature corrosion (including a thermogravimetric Cahn balance capable of testing to 1500C, and a low velocity burner rig).<P>

   Dr. Steen has a vigorous research program on ceramic composites including:  fatigue of 2D woven ceramic matrix composites (CMC's) at high temperatures;  effects of interfacial damage on mechanical properties of long fiber CMC's; and residual stress state and damage mechanisms in CMC's.  The testing equipment for measuring creep, strength, toughness, fatigue, etc., is outstanding.  Much of the equipment was designed at IAM-JRC and either was built on site or contracted for manufacture at their discretion.  For example they developed, with a commercial company, a prototype radiant heating furnace for tensile testing machines which can achieve up to 2000 degrees centigrade in air for isothermal conditions and up to 1750 degrees C in cyclic loading.  They also developed a highly sensitive alignment capability for reliable heating methods for uniaxial testing up to 1600 degrees centigrade.  They perform much of their high temperature testing using local heating and thus cold grips.  Again many of these facilities have been individually designed by the staff.<BR>
 There is a seven-person effort headed by Dr. Bullock on preparation and evaluation of ceramic matrix composites (carbon fibers in a silicon nitride matrix).  They coat the fibers with boron nitride to provide for weak interfaces to enhance toughness, and consolidation is by hot pressing.  Dr. Ceccone has a good effort in joining ceramics (silicon nitride) using diffusion bonding and brazing.  He uses a partial transient liquid phase approach, and includes a nice effort on residual stress modeling and measurement.  Dr. Bresser's metallurgical research centers around: coatings for Ni-base superalloys, including aluminides and MCrAIY coatings, where M is Fe,Ni, or Co; and thermomechanical fatigue of coated and uncoated Ni-base alloy single crystals.<P>

<B>4. Research at the National Ceramic Centre of the Netherlands Energy Research Foundation (ECN) </B><P>

   We were hosted by Dr. L.A. Correia.  She first gave us an overview of ECN, and then focused on their R&D efforts in ceramics.  ECN is the leading center for energy research in the Netherlands.  Their business units work on renewable energy sources (sun, wind and biomass), energy from fossil fuels, the rational use of energy and materials, nuclear energy, radiation technology and policy studies.  ECN's principle mission is to develop innovative technologies and design and to commercialize energy-efficient products for an environmentally safe and sustainable energy supply at an affordable price.  They have a staff of about 750, and carry out national and international R&D for the Dutch Government, Dutch industries, the European Union, foreign governments, and international industries and agencies.  They are similar in many respects to DOE's Pacific Northwest Labs in Hanford, WN.<P>

   The National Ceramic Centre focuses on the development and production of components based on engineering ceramics.  Their charter is broad, ranging from structural ceramics to solid oxide fuel cells.  In 1987 they embarked on a vigorous program (along with the rest of the world) on high temperature ceramic superconductors.  After several years they stopped this research when funding was terminated.  They have excellent ceramic processing, characterization, and testing capabilities.  In the solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC)  research they are pursuing the flat plate concept with metal separator plates (other laboratories throughout the world are investigating tubular and monolithic configurations).  Their research has produced ceramic cells which yielded 0.84 W/cm2.  They have no plans to initiate research on solid freeform fabrication (i.e. selected laser sintering, 3D ink jet printing, etc.), which is rapidly gaining momentum in the U.S., especially for prototyping of ceramic components.<P>

<B>5.  Assessment</B><P>

The testing facilities for tensile, flexural, creep and fatigue testing are unique and first rate.  The fabrication facilities are adequate to produce the materials needed for testing.  Most of the composites efforts at both facilities seems to be shifting from structural applications to functional materials and energy end-uses such as fuel cells, heat exchangers, and solar cells.  US investigators should visit Petten and study their testing facilities for possible duplication in the US.<P>

<B>1.  Summary</B><P>

The IRC in Materials for High Performance Applications at the University   
of Birmingham and University College Swansea is one of eight IRC's   
established beginning in 1989 by the Engineering and Physical Sciences   
Research Council (EPSRC).  This IRC focusses on metallurgical and   
ceramics processing, with emphasis on a high degree of automation and   
computer control for all the processes.  There are outstanding   
metallurgical processing facilities at Birmingham, including a plasma   
melting furnace, centrifugal spray deposition unit, hot isostatic   
pressing (HIP) unit, casting facilities and forging equipment.  Swansea   
has world class mechanical testing (creep and fatigue) facilities and   
excellent capabilities in computer modeling of processing and component   
design.  The center has about 25 academic staff, 70 research staff, 25   
technicians and 60 graduate students.  The IRC has excellent ties to   
British Industry.  In addition to the $2.6 million annual funding they   
receive from the EPSPC they have obtained an additional $16 million for   
research and facilities over their seven year operation, mostly from   
British Industry.  The quality of research is very high and there has   
been excellent technology transfer to many UK industries.<P>

<B>2.  Interdisciplinary Research Centres (IRC's) in the UK</B><P>

The first of a series of Interdisciplinary Research Centres (IRC's) was   
set up in 1989 by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council   
(EPSRC), formerly the Science and Engineering Research Council (SERC) as   
a response to the challenge of providing focal points for research of   
international standing in areas where the capital requirements were   
substantial.  The key idea behind the initiative was to persuade   
universities to improve their way of handling interdisciplinary research.   
 A major focus was to enhance University/Industry interactions, and   
provide UK industry with facilities and technical talent to help them   
remain competitive.<P>

Equipment was an important factor behind the concept of the IRC's,   
particularly as a means of catalyzing collaboration among people.  If   
researchers have to share equipment they also end up talking to one   
another about their research.  One of us (BAW) recalls that this is a   
major reason for the success of the NSF Materials Research Laboratories   
(MRL's).  The IRC's are funded at the level of about $24 million a year   
and were designed to last for a period of ten years, with periodic   
reviews to assess performance.  In addition to the quality of research, a   
 major metric of success is how much additional funding is brought in   
from industry.   Historically this has not played such an important   
factor in U.S. University  Materials Research Centers funded by the DOD,   
NSF, or DOE, although interactions with industry and government   
laboratories are strongly encouraged.<P>

There are eight IRC's, and seven of these support research in various   
areas of functional and structural materials, attesting to the importance   
that the EPSPC placed on materials science and engineering research.<BR>   
 These topics were chosen from about 200 suggested research areas.  The   
IRC's are:<P>

(1)  "IRC in Biomedical Materials", Queen Mary and Westfield College,   
London.  Note that QMW was reported on by one of us (JJM) in Materials   
Newsletter #96-10, dated July 31, 1996.<BR>
(2)  "IRC in Materials for High Performance Applications", University of   
Birmingham and University College Swansea (subject of present report).<BR>
(3)  "Optoelectronics Research Centre", Southampton University.<BR>
(4)  "IRC in Polymer Science and Technology", Universities of Bradford,   
Durham and Leeds.<BR>
(5)  "Centre for Process Systems Engineering", Imperial College of   
Science, Technology, and Medicine and University College London.<BR>
(6)  "IRC for Semiconductor Materials", Imperial College of Science,   
Technology and Medicine, London.<BR>
(7)  "IRC in Superconductivity", University of Cambridge.<BR>
(8)  "Research Center in Surface Science", Universities of Liverpool and   
Manchester.<P>

<B>3.  Research at the IRC in Materials for High Performance Applications (Birmingham and Swansea)</B><P>

This IRC was initiated in 1989 and brings together three departments at   
Birmingham University-Metallurgy and Materials, Manufacturing and   
Mechanical Engineering , and Chemical Engineering, together with the   
Department of Materials Engineering at University College Swansea.  The   
Director is Prof. M.H. Loretto, Birmingham, and the Associate Director is   
Prof. R.W. Evans, Swansea. The department head at Swansea ,Prof. B.   
Wilshire, was instrumental in the formation of the IRC and continues to   
contribute to its success. There are about 25 academic staff, 70 research   
staff, 25 technicians and 60 graduate students.  The core funding for   
basic scientific research provided by EPSRC is about $2.6 million per   
year.  Since its inception the additional funding received from industry,   
other government and European programs, is more than $16 million,   
including substantial contributions for major facilities.<P>

The mission of the Birmingham/Swansea IRC is: "....a design-driven   
approach to the development of new materials, novel materials processing   
and manufacturing technologies and the subsequent use of computer-aided   
materials engineering to allow their efficient transfer to industry...."   
 There are six major research thrusts:<P>

<OL>
<LI>Plasma melting, atomization and sprayforming;
<LI>Casting;
<LI>Processing and properties of ceramics;
<LI>Processing of alloys and component production;
<LI>Alloy development and microstructural assessment;
<LI>Mechanical property assessment and life prediction.
</OL>

Thrusts (1)-(5) are mainly at Birmingham, and thrust (6) is at Swansea.   
 The creep and fatigue testing facilities at Swansea are world class.   
 The Swansea group also contributes substantially in computer modeling of   
metal deformation processing and solidification during casting to develop   
software for process and component design.<P>

Selected Facility and Research Highlights:  Extensive metallurgical   
processing facilities at Birmingham, equal to the best in the U.S.,   
include a plasma melting furnace, centrifugal spray deposition unit, hot   
isostatic pressing (HIP) unit, casting facilities, forging equipment, and   
other facilities.<P>

(a)  The plasma melting furnace, manufactured by Retech Inc, Ukiah, Ca,   
uses two 150 kW transferred-arc plasma torches for the cold-hearth   
melting of reactive and high performance materials under inert   
atmosphere.  It is capable of casting ingots in 10cm and 15 cm diameters   
in lengths up to 1.4m with controlled chemistry and good surface finish.<P>

(b)  Centrifugal spray forming of tubular or ring shaped products is   
accomplished by atomizing a molten stream of metal using a rapidly   
rotating water-cooled cup.  The resultant spray impacts onto the inside   
of a computer-controlled reciprocating drum to form the desired shape.   
 This process is carried out in an inert atmosphere or in a vacuum.<P>

(c)   The HIP unit, manufactured by VG Special Systems Ltd, is computer   
controlled, allowing accurate control of process parameters (time,   
temperature, pressure and heating/cooling rates).  The capabilities are:   
max. temp.-2000C, max pres.-200MPa
 max. diameter of work-piece-12cm, max length of work-piece-30cm, max.   
mass of work-piece-35Kg, pressurising atmosphere-argon or nitrogen.  The   
HIP unit has a custom built dilatometer for use in-situ in the vessel   
together with a data acquisition system to record dimensional changes   
that occur during the densification of powders.<P>

(d)  Casting facilities are capable of induction melting up to 25Kg of   
ferrous alloys, resistance melting of up to 250 Kg of light alloys, and   
semi-levitation melting of 5Kg of titanium alloys.  There is real-time   
x-ray equipment for studying mold filling and solidification, e.g. of   
aluminum up to 4.5 cm thick.<P>

(e)  Forging facilities include:  100 ton and 200 ton mechanical presses,   
a 150 ton hydraulic press, and a 500 ton hydraulic press for isothermal   
forging at temperatures up to 1300C in inert atmosphere and for hot-die   
forging with pre-heated dies up to 1050C.<P>

The metallurgical research focuses primarily on nickel, ferrous, aluminum   
and titanium alloys, including extensive work on gamma titanium   
aluminide.  The emphasis is on process development, modeling and control   
to identify the effects of process parameters on microstructural   
development and subsequent component properties.  There is a high degree   
of automation and computer control for all the processes.  IRC was   
successful in developing a predictive model for formation of   
microstructural defects in nickel superalloys during plasma and vacuum   
arc remelting.  In the alloy development area of gamma titanium   
aluminides, addition of boron (via an Al-B compound) provides grain   
refinement and improved mechanical properties.  The IRC is frequently   
called on by UK industry to produce experimental quantities of alloys and   
components for evaluation in specific industrial applications.<P>

The IRC effort on processing of functional and structural  ceramics is   
not as extensive as the metallurgical research, but is very innovative   
and staffed by excellent researchers.  The focus is on understanding and   
controlling the critical parameters in the hydrothermal and emulsion   
synthesis of industrially important ceramics including magnetic,   
piezoelectric, solid oxide fuel cell and ceramic matrix composite   
materials.  In one effort they used colloidal processing of PZT powders   
to fabricate rods with better mechanical and electrical properties than   
materials produced using standard processing techniques.  The improvement   
was correlated with a reduction in micro-defect size.  The ceramics   
research also includes efforts on laser melt growth of complex oxide   
ceramic monofilaments, electrophoretic deposition/infiltration of   
coatings and composite matrices, and processing and modeling of   
particulate paste systems including catalyst monoliths.<P>

Technology Transfer:  The IRC has been tremendously successful in   
transferring technology to British Industry.  Examples are: (a) two   
commercial software packages, MAVIS and DIANA, were developed at Swansea   
for the simulation of heat transfer and solidification in gravity casting   
processes and die casting, respectively.  These PC-based packages are   
used extensively in the UK Foundry industry;  (b) plasma melting   
technology was transferred to IMI for difficult-to-melt titanium based   
alloys, to DRA for gun steels, and to INCO for nickel-based superalloys;   
 ( c) diffusion bonding technology using HIP was transferred to Lucas and   
HIP Infutec Ltd.  Major technology transfer occurs when students trained   
by the IRC are employed by British industry; approximately 35 former   
students now work in UK industries.<P>

<B>4.  Assessment</B><P>
   
There is no question that the IRC has met its objectives in terms of   
developing world class facilities in metallurgical processing   
(Birmingham) and mechanical testing and computer process design   
(Swansea).  The strong computer capabilities at Swansea greatly benefit   
from the Computer Learning Center for Materials, which has over 60   
Pentiums available for undergraduate and graduate laboratories with   
interactive software programs in materials science.  U.S. researchers   
would benefit greatly from visiting all of these laboratories.   
 Interactions with and technology transfer to British industry is   
outstanding.  The quality of education and science and engineering is   
very high.  Fifty PhD's have graduated, and four textbooks and over five   
hundred papers in referred journals have been published.  A major factor   
in the IRC success has been the dynamic leadership of the Director, Prof.   
Mike Loretto.  An internationally renowned electron microscopist, he has   
successfully dedicated his energies over the past seven years to all   
aspects of developing the IRC, ranging from acquisition of space and   
facilities--to hiring of  excellent staff-to fostering outstanding   
interactions with British industry.<P>

<B>1.  Summary</B><P>

The Inaugural Hirsch Lecture " Surprises in Materials Science" delivered by Sir Alan Cottrell FRS , was presented on October 4,1996 at the University Museum, Oxford. It honored Sir Peter Hirsch, formerly Chair of the Materials Department on the occasion of his 70th birthday. In the future the Hirsch Lecture will be given every other year, alternating with the well known Hume-Rothery Lecture. Sir Alan's lecture was a tour de force both for its clarity and its content of exciting surprises and discoveries in the field of materials science. Included in his "surprises" were: the observation  by Hirsch and his group in the 1950's using transmission electron microscopy that dislocations in Al moved due to stresses generated by beam heating; unexpected catastrophic failure of Liberty ships during World War II because the ductile-to-brittle transition temperature of the ship steel was not sufficiently low to withstand brittle fracture in icy waters; the surprising behavior in Ni3Al where the strength increases with increasing temperature; the observation that brittle solids (glass and ceramics) can be made to fail non-catastrophically by reinforcing with fibers; the discovery of quasicrystals ,or solids which exhibit five-fold crystallographic symmetry; fullerines or , C60, sometimes referred to as "bucky balls"; and most importantly high temperature ceramic superconductors based on the cuprate family.<P>

<B>2. Introduction</B><P>

This newsletter is a report on the Inaugural Hirsch Lecture given on October 4, 1996 at the University Museum, Oxford University.  The Museum, which opened in 1860, is a Victorian Gothic building which houses an extensive natural history collection.  It was a perfect setting for such an important lecture.  The lecture, given by Sir Alan Cottrell, Professor Emeritus at Cambridge University, had the enticing title of  "Surprises in Materials Science".  The lecture was in honor of Sir Peter Hirsch FRS who several years ago retired as Chair of the Materials  Department at Oxford and who just celebrated his 70th birthday.  Professor Brian Cantor, the present Chair of Oxford's Materials  Department, served as Master of Ceremonies.  He noted that the Inaugural Hirsch Lecture is the first in a series which will be given every other year in the future, and will be alternated with the well-known Hume-Rothery lecture which is presented under the sponsorship of Oxford's Materials Department.<P>

Professor Cantor then introduced Prof. Michael Whelan of the Materials Department in Oxford, a long-time collaborator of Peter Hirsch at Cambridge and later at Oxford.  Whelan recounted a number of personal anecdotes and technical achievements of Sir Peter over his long and distinguished career at Cambridge and Oxford.  He reviewed some of Hirsch's early work beginning in 1954 on x-ray microbeams, his enormous contributions in the field of transmission electron microscopy, and numerous other technical and public service achievements during Sir Peter's 26 years as the Isaac Wolfsson Professor at Oxford.<P>

The speaker for the first Inaugural Hirsch lecture, Alan Cottrell, was an exceedingly appropriate choice, since in the 1950's and 1960's both he and Peter Hirsch were at Cambridge University, Cottrell serving as Professor of the Metallurgy Department and Hirsch working as a scientist in the nearby Cavendish Laboratory.  Sir Alan later became Chief Scientific Advisor to H.M. Government, Master of Jesus College, Cambridge, and Vice-Chancellor of Cambridge University.<P>

<B>3.  The Inaugural Hirsch Lecture, "Surprises in Materials Science" , by Sir Alan Cottrell  FRS</B><P>

Sir Alan reviewed many surprises and discoveries in the field of materials science.  He began by discussing Peter Hirsch's early work in electron microscopy where he and his colleagues thinned gold by beating with a hammer until foils were sufficiently thin for transmission by electrons.  This early work was aimed at studying the work hardening behavior of metals.  A surprise came in the early work of Hirsch and his group when they observed in the electron microscope that dislocations moved in aluminum thin foils under the stresses generated by electron beam heating.  This was a major discovery because it did indeed show that dislocations existed in crystals and that they moved under stress, thereby producing plastic deformation.  Hirsch's classic paper showing electron micrographs of dislocations and sub-boundaries in aluminum was published in Phil.Mag. in 1956.<P>

Sir Alan discussed an early surprise in materials science which occurred during World War II when Liberty ships which had been welded broke apart catastrophically by fracturing in two.  It was first thought that there was a design flaw , but it was later shown using notched impact tests that the problem was that the steel exhibited a ductile-to-brittle transition temperature (DBTT) where sustained plastic flow occurred above the DBTT and brittle fracture occurred below the DBTT.  The ship steel DBTT of those days occurred around zero degrees Centigrade.  The original design and tests on the suitability of ship steel were done at room temperature and it was not known that a ship sailing in frigid ice water would undergo this ductile-to-brittle transition and fail catastrophically.  An enormous amount of research was done in the ensuing years and it is known that the DBTT in steel and other metals is complex and is associated with cracking initiated by plastic deformation.  The early solution was to design steels by altering the composition such that the DBTT was sufficiently below the freezing point of water that catastrophic fracture did not occur, even in Artic waters.<P>

A surprising observation was found in research on intermetallic compounds such as nickel aluminides (Ni3Al) which show a very unusual temperature dependence of the yield strength.  Generally, metals become softer and weaker at high temperatures, but in the case of nickel aluminide there first is a strong increase in strength with temperature.  This is very surprising, as well as the observation that there is very little strain rate dependence of the yield strength.  This phenomenon has been studied by a number of workers and is a very complex story.  Research is still continuing in this interesting area.<P>

Another initially surprising development came about as the result of the finding that brittle solids such as ceramics and glasses can be made damage tolerant, i.e., have high toughness and non-catastrophic failure, by introducing fibers and making a composite.  The toughness can be derived from energy absorption by extensive microcracking or from fiber pull-out at weak interfaces between fiber and matrix.  This is presently an exciting area of research and the hope is that brittle solids will become much more useful in engineering structures as a result of compositing.<P>

The 1980's provided three surprises in materials science.  In 1984, Schectman, then at NIST, discovered in rapidly quenched aluminum manganese alloys using electron microscopy diffraction techniques, crystals which had five-fold crystallographic symmetry.  These were named quasicrystals and indeed surprised the world's crystallographers, who thought that such symmetry could not exist.  Subsequent work by Schectman and others using Penrose Tile analogies showed that such structures could be explained.  In 1985, the fullerines were discovered by Kroto (Sussex University) and Smalley and Curl ( Rice University).  These are clusters of 60-carbon atoms which have an unusual structure resembling geodesic domes or soccer balls.  They have been called "bucky balls"-short for buckminster fullerines.  This discovery led to the great surge in present day work in the field of nanostructure materials.  It was recently announced that Kroto, Smalley and Curl will share this year's Nobel  Prize in Chemistry.  In 1986, perhaps the biggest surprise of all occurred when Bednors and Mueller at IBM Zurich discovered high temperature ceramic superconductors based on cuprates.  This surprise discovery was of such magnitude that it sent scientists worldwide pursuing this important area of research.  The field is still very active and applications are being found in thin films for electronic devices and in bulk superconductors for magnets and motors.  It's interesting that the theorists still do not have a universally accepted theory for high-temperature superconductors.  Bednors and Mueller received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for their discovery.<P>

Sir Alan concluded with the observation that "our science is rich with surprises".  New discoveries occur with a fairly reasonable frequency.  He predicted that in the future we will see a surprise or scientific discovery in materials science roughly every four years.  He concluded by exhorting the audience to continue their active research and contribute to the future discoveries and surprises in this fertile field.<P>

<B>4.  Assessment</B><P>

This lecture was a tour de force both for its clarity and its content of exciting surprises and discoveries in the field of materials science.  Personally, this was a very memorable event for me.  I conducted post-doctoral metallurgical research at Cambridge University in the early 1960's when Professor Cottrell was Chair of the Metallurgy Department.  He was then making his seminal contributions in dislocation theory and the theory of brittle fracture.  At the same time in the nearby Cavendish Laboratory Dr. Peter Hirsch and his group were conducting their pioneering experimental and theoretical research in transmission electron microscopy which led to such a great increase in our understanding of the nature of defects in crystalline solids.  Cambridge was truly a hot bed of exciting materials science research during that period.<P>

<B>1.  Summary</B><P>

This conference on ceramic -and metal- matrix composites (CMC's and MMC's), held in San Sebastian, Spain, September 9-12, 1996, was very well attended by representatives from 25 countries.  There were 20 half day sessions for oral presentations and 60 poster session contributions.  Five papers were given on ceramic fibers, and the remaining talks and poster contributions were about equally divided between CMC's and MMC's.  I think that the presentations showed that there has been considerable progress over the last several years in terms of developing the microstructures (especially the interface between the matrix and reinforcement) required to achieve desired performance goals.  The only composite system discussed which appears to be gaining substantial use at present is particulate SiC reinforced Al.  Others, i.e. CMC's and SiC fiber reinforced Ti alloys, show promise in jet engine applications.  However the cost must be reduced-I feel through improved innovative processing-before the composites will see widespread applications.<P>

<B>2.  Introduction</B><P>

CMMC 96,a  conference on ceramic -and metal-matrix composites (CMC's and MMC's) ,was held at The Miramar Palace, San Sebastian, Spain from September 9-12, 1996.  San Sebastian is a seaside resort in northwest Spain located in the heart of Basque country, about 15 miles from the French border.  A major reason for the successful organization and execution was due to the financial and administrative assistance of Centro de Estudios e Investigaciones Technicas de Guipuzcoa (CEIT), which is a non-profit research laboratory associated with the School of Industrial Engineering of the University of Navarra in San Sebastian.  CEIT has about 75 staff plus about 45 students from the University, many of whom perform their M.S. and Ph.D. thesis research at CEIT.  Staff from CEIT conduct research in materials (especially inorganic composites), applied mechanics, micro electronics and  control engineering, and environmental engineering.<P>

The Conference was organized such that there were no separate parallel competing sessions on CMC's and MMC's.  Rather, the program of 20 half-day sessions was structured along generic themes, covering the following topics:<P>

 Processing/Manufacturing (7 sessions)<BR>
 Fibers/Reinforcements: New Developments, Properties (1 session)<BR>
 Interfaces: Synthesis and Characterization (3 sessions)<BR>
 Mechanical Properties: Experimental and Modeling (7 sessions)<BR>
 Thermal and Environmental Stability (1 session)<BR>
 Applications (1 session)<P>

However, there were parallel competing sessions, e.g., processing opposite mechanical properties.  I attended the processing sessions and will report on these.<P>

<B>3.  Attendance and participation</B><P>

The Conference was truly international.  There were about 210 participants from 25 countries, who presented 93 oral papers (including 14 plenary lectures) and 60 poster session contributions.  Five of the oral technical papers dealt with ceramic fibers, and the remaining papers were about equally divided between CMC's and MMC's.  The poster session also was about equally divided between CMC's and MMC's.  There were a large number of delegates and contributions from five countries (Germany, France, Spain, UK, and US).  Participation and contributions were also made by scientists from Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Czech Republic, Denmark, India, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Netherlands, Portugal, Russia, Slovenia, Sweden, Switzerland, and Taiwan.<P>

<B>4.  Technical sessions</B><P>

<B>Fibers: </B>A. Bunsell (Ecole des Mines de Paris) gave an excellent historical review of fibers used for reinforcing MMC's and CMC's, beginning with boron and graphite for reinforcing light alloys in the 1960's, development of oxide fibers (especially alumina-based) in the 1970's, and silicon carbide and silicon nitride fibers in the 1980's.  The processing and properties of multifilament fibers in a tow (alumina, silicon carbide, silicon nitride) are entirely different from monofilaments (large diameter silicon carbide made by CVD, single crystal alumina) . The ultimate application depends on the matrix chemistry; the development of suitable fiber coatings; the stress, temperature and environment of the composite; and of course the fiber and composite cost.  The upper temperature limit for using polycrystalline ceramic fibers is about 1300 C because of creep strength limitations.  I believe that single crystal alumina might provide higher temperature capability, but the fibers are too expensive at present.<P>

There continues to be research on development of new fibers.  H. Baldus (Bayer AG) reported results on a new borosilicon carbonitride synthesized from a polymer precursor via melt spinning; G. Chollon (Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials) discussed the thermal stability of silicon nitride based fibers prepared by a vapor-solid process-the fibers are stable in nitrogen up to 1450 C for 10 hours; P. Doleman (U. Birmingham) discussed the growth of alumina/YAG eutectic fibers by the laser-heated floating zone process.  These will probably have good high temperature creep strength, but I suspect they will be too expensive to gain widespread use.<P>

<B>Interfaces: </B>The interface between a reinforcing fiber or particle and the matrix is of great importance in determining the properties and performance.  Usually a coating is required to provide high temperature diffusion barriers between the reinforcement and the matrix, oxidation protection of the reinforcement, weak interfaces in CMC's for improved toughness, etc.  For CMC's, D. Marshall (Rockwell) and M. Lewis (U. Warwick) showed promising results by coating fibers with rare earth orthophosphates and aligned layer structures (beta-aluminas).  Several papers discussed characterization of interfaces in titanium matrix composites (TMC's) reinforced with SiC monofilaments, especially aimed at understanding the effect of interfaces on the low transverse strength.  A transverse loading test was described by A. Kalton (Cambridge U.) ,and B. Guichet (ONERA) used fiber push out tests on samples with various thicknesses and fiber volume fractions and showed two distinct types of interface decohesion.  W. Clyne (Cambridge U.) discussed SiC monofilament reinforced Ti alloys and speculated that initial debonding may occur as soon as a significant normal tensile stress is set up at the interface, but that subsequent opening of a cavity then depends on the hydrostatic stress in the vicinity of the cavity.<P>

<B>MMC's:</B>  In my view, the most important applications-related presentations centered around the MMC system particulate SiC reinforced Al.  Research on this system has been under way for a number of years and this was reflected by the large number (some 20) contributions dealing with this composite.  A variety of processing technologies have been demonstrated and some of these have been commercialized: pressureless metal infiltration into a ceramic preform; powder metallurgy processing; pressurized metal infiltration of ceramic powder preforms; stir casting followed by closed die forging or extrusion; a combination of spray-forming, extrusion, and thixoforming; and sand and permanent mold casting.  Applications include automotive brake rotors, heat sinks for electronic applications,sporting equipment,and a variety of wear resistant parts.<P>

The half dozen or so papers on SiC monofilament reinforced Ti alloys attracted considerable interest because of the potential application of this composite in jet engines.  S. Sandhu (U. of Surrey) gave an interesting paper on Ti-aluminide composites fabricated by a matrix-coated-fiber (MCF) process using electron beam evaporation followed by hot isostatic pressing.  I think that while SiC fiber reinforced Ti alloys are very promising, the processing must be such that the composites and components are affordable.  This is being addressed in the U.S. by the 3M Corporation.<P>

<B>CMC's:</B>  In terms of applications, CMC's are not as advanced as SiC(p)/Al, but there has been substantial progress in recent years.  P. Spriet of Societe Europeene de Propulsion (SEP) gave an overview of SEP's experience with CMC's in turbo jet engines.  Component demonstrations of SiC(f)/SiC(m) composites were made for flame holders, exhaust cones, and inner flaps which were tested in a Mirage engine.  So far, about 300 flaps have been made.  The Spanish experience in evaluating CMC's for aeroengines was described by I. Gutierre  (INASMET, San Sebastian).  They evaluated SiC(f)/SiC(m) composites for various engine components, but no performance information was presented.  T. Kishi (U. Tokyo) gave an excellent overview on CMC research in Japan (1989-96) and included applications of monolithic ceramics in auto turbines and Si-Ti-C-O fiber-bonded CMC (Tyrannohex) for turbine blisks.  C. Beesley (Rolls Royce) reviewed their experience with CMC's including the possible insertion of a fiber reinforced CMC as a shroud.  He emphasized the necessity of reducing composite and component cost if CMC's are to find widespread use in aircraft gas turbine engines.<P>

<B>Laminate Composites:</B>  Nearly all of the papers dealt with fiber or particulate reinforced composites.  However two papers dealing with laminate composites deserve mention.  In a plenary lecture, A. Kelly (Cambridge U.) pointed out that laminate systems offer the best means of testing ideas aimed at restricting creep at the highest possible temperatures, e.g. CMC's operating at 1500 C.  He also discussed the very high strength of laminates made as strained layer superlattices for semiconductor applications in heterojunctions.  L. Vandeperre (Katholieke U. Leuven) described research on electrophoretic deposition of SiC laminates with carbon interlayers obtained from three types of carbon suspensions.  Depending on the carbon interlayer, various fracture types were observed.  However I think the most important thing that this study showed was that electrophoretic deposition can rapidly produce shaped porous ceramics which could be used for preforms.  The author noted the potential for shaping gradient materials by electrophoretic deposition.  This can be done by switching between suspensions to obtain layers of different composition or changing the solid composition of the suspension.  I think that this technology deserves further investigation.<P>

<B>5.  Assessment</B><P>

CMMC 96 was a well organized, well attended international conference featuring the latest research results of scientists from 25 countries.  There is no question that additional research is required to optimize microstructure and performance of MMC's and CMC's before they are used more widely.  However I think that it is of equal, or even greater, importance to continue to develop processing technologies aimed at reducing composite and component cost.  This appears to have been done in particulate SiC reinforced Al where applications are now being realized.  However, additional processing research will be needed to produce affordable SiC fiber reinforced Ti alloys and CMC's'for a variety of potential high temperature structural applications.<P>

<B>1.  Summary</B><P>

The Structural Materials Centre (SMC) of the Defence Evaluation and Research Agency (DERA) was established in 1994 and brought together in Farnborough many staff  working in structural materials from eight Ministry of Defence (MOD) laboratories.  There are some 500 materials scientists and engineers conducting research in three general areas:  Advanced Metallic Alloys and Ceramics, Advanced Non-Metallics, and Multi-Functional Materials.  Their mission includes providing technical advice and research to assist ALL THREE SERVICES.  Approximately 20 percent of their effort is directed toward dual-use research aimed at benefiting both the military and the civilian sector.  They have an extremely capable technical staff and soon will occupy an outstanding new 28,000 square meter well-equipped laboratory.<P>

<B>2.  Introduction</B><P>

On November 5, I visited the Structural Materials Centre (SMC) of the Defence Evaluation and Research Agency (DERA), Farnborough, Hampshire, UK which is a one-half hour train ride (one hour drive) from central London.  I was hosted by Dr. John Morton, director of SMC, who provided an excellent overview of the history and evolution of DERA and SMC, the mission and organization of SMC, and a summary of their current research efforts.  I also spoke with several scientists about their research and toured part of the new 28,000 square meter materials research laboratory which is presently being constructed.<P>

In recent years there has been considerable change in DERA as a result of downsizing by the Ministry of Defence (MOD), very similar to what is occurring in the DOD.  This involves closing, consolidating, and restructuring laboratories, including relocating people and providing the new central research facilities required to support MOD's missions.  The Structural Materials Centre was established in April 1994 by bringing together from various defense laboratories around the UK, some 500 materials scientists and engineers working in structural materials.  They came from laboratories on eight sites, mainly from Farnborough, Fort Halstead and Holten Heath.  In addition to its own staff, the SMC has an extensive network of academic and industrial collaborators.  A major difference between  SMC and  DOD materials laboratories, is that SMC is responsive to the needs of ALL THREE SERVICES, a so-called "purple" laboratory.  I think this is a daunting challenge, but they appear to be making very good progress.<P>

It should be noted that research on semiconductor and optical materials and devices is undertaken in new laboratories at Malvern in Worcestershire.  Here emphasis includes applications such as thermal imaging, gas sensing and ultra high-speed low-power electronics.<P>

<B>3.  Mission and organization of the SMC</B><P>

The major objectives of the SMC are: (a) To be the Ministry of Defence's primary source of impartial and authoritative advice on structural materials research and technology; and (b) To contribute to UK industrial competitiveness and wealth creation via dual-use technology transfer and development.  The research activities are in three general areas: Advanced Metallic Alloys and Ceramics, Advanced Non-Metallics, and Multi-Functional Materials.  The last class includes materials which will have both structural and other functional characteristics, such as structural radar absorbing materials and smart materials.<P>

SMC was the first of four Dual-Use Technology Centers established by DERA, the other three being: Farnborough Supercomputing Centre, Centre for Marine Technology, and Software Engineering Centre.  About 20 percent of SMC's research efforts are Dual Use, i.e., of benefit to both the military and the civilian sector.  These very much resemble activities in DOD's Technology Reinvestment Project (now called  Joint Dual Use Program ).  As part of its thrust in Dual-Use research, SMC is partnering with industry and academia to seek funding of joint research projects from various sources, eg., the European Union, UK Civilian Agencies, etc.  In addition SMC supports, with MOD funds, extramural research at universities and industries in the UK. Their financial plan, which is modeled on industrial practice, has the goal of obtaining research funding from external sources about equal to the extramural support they provide to UK academic and industrial organizations.  It is planned that eventually about one-third of the occupants of the new laboratory will come from SMC partner organizations.  Also, SMC staff will be encouraged to spend time in industry and academia if the joint research efforts will be enhanced.<P>

<B>4.  Research at SMC</B><P>

The new laboratory and research facilities at SMC will be excellent.  In addition to normal laboratory equipment they will have three large bays: one for processing polymer-, metal- and ceramic-matrix composites, another for materials mechanical testing, and a third comprehensive metal processing facility for melting steels, Al and Ti alloys, and rolling, forging, and vapor processing of alloys.<P>

The Structural Materials Center at DERA, Farnborough is a very well equipped laboratory with an extremely capable  technical staff.  They are the "corporate" structural materials research laboratory of the MOD, and as such provide the needed technical expertise to assist all three services.  Once their new building and facilities are completed they will have a world class research laboratory.  They appear to have successfully dealt with the difficulties of laboratory downsizing implemented by MOD, and are well on track to being a very effective "purple" MOD laboratory.  I think that their focus of 20 percent of their effort on dual use research is well founded, and will greatly assist in developing collaborations with researchers from industry and academia.<P>

<B>British Meteorological Research Aircraft Available for Hire</B><BR>
The Meteorological Research Flight (MRF), a component of the Research Division of the Ministry of Defense's Meteorological Office, conducts research in stratiform and cirrus cloud physics, volume and particle scattering radiation and atmospheric chemistry.  In addition to their approximately 30 person research staff, MRF's most important asset is their C-130 Hercules aircraft that is fully equipped for long duration (12 hour), large capacity (~18,000kg) flights ranging in altitude from 15 to 10,000m.  The aircraft is available for collaborative research with MRF scientists at no cost or for sponsor supported research at ~L7,5K/hr (~$11,000/hr).  MRF is anxious to establish scientific collaboration with researchers worldwide in their areas of interest.<P>

<B>Aerosols May Partially Mitigate Global Warming</B><BR>
Calculations from the Global Climate Model of the British Meteorological Office's Hadley Center for Climate Prediction and Research show that approximately 1/3 of the global warming due to greenhouse gasses may be mitigated by sulfate aerosols.  This is caused both directly by the increased reflection of solar radiation due to  the presence of the sulfate aerosols, and/or indirectly by reflection from cloud droplets forming around the sulfate aerosols.  Other important results indicate that the annual temperature variability will remain the same no matter the level of global warming. <P> 

<B>British Meteorological Services to Become Customer Reimbursed</B><BR>
Starting in April, funding for the British Meteorological Office (BMO) will come from its customers, ranging from government agencies through private industry.  Presently, ~1/3 of BMO's L80M (~$120M) funding already comes from private interests.  The remaining 2/3 of BNO's funding comes as part of a government appropriation to the Ministry of Defense (MoD).  Starting in April, while BMO staff will remain under the MoD,  their appropriation will be distributed throughout British government agencies, who, in turn, will pay MoD for BMO services.  Approximately half of this funding will be in core budgets over which the individual agencies will have little overall control.  They can either pass this on to MoD for BMO, or return it to the central government for redistribution to other agencies' BMO core.  The other half, however, will be at  the agencys' discretion to be expended on whatever meteorological services they desire, from whomever they desire it.  Initially, it is likely that this second half, called "services" will likely be spent on BMO services.  In time, however, competition for meteorological services may develop.  Time will tell.  <P>


<B>Meteorological Research Flight (MRF)</B><BR>
MRF is an approximately 44 person component of the Research Division of the United Kingdom's Ministry of Defense's (MoD), British Meteorological Office (BMO).  As part of the MoD, BMO is England's govermental-wide weather analysis and forecasting agency, with a full component of numerical models and operational forecasting responsibilities.  The Research Division, under Julian Hunt, is charged with the responsibility of conducting research to improve BMO's forecasts.<P>

As with most modern research establishments, BMO's Research Division requires the use of a full spectrum of tools ranging from in-situ and remote sensing tools and platforms.  One of these is a C-130 Hercules aircraft operated by MRF to support their own cloud physics, radiation, and chemistry research, as well as research performed by satellite, mesoscale meteorology and remote sensing divisions of BMO's Research Division.<P>

Led by Phil Hignet, MRF's three person radiation research studies focus on volume absorption and particle scattering.  The five person cloud physics research group,led by Doug Johnson, studies both stratiform and cirrus clouds (cumulus cloud research is performed by the Research Division's mesoscale meteorology division, lead by Keith Browning).  Research in atmospheric chemistry, led by Ken Dewey,  focuses on tropospheric ozone, stratospheric-tropospheric interaction and OH concentration from HC degradation.<P>

MRF's C-130 Hercules aircraft, based in Boscombe Down, is fully state of the art.  Its crew includes 14 seats for scientific  project participants.  The aircraft has long endurance (11 hours), large capacity (17,600 kg with full fuel load),  and a suite of modern instrumentation including gust probes, aerosol and cloud physics instrumentation, short, long and microwave radiometers, trace gas samplers and a 3 cm radar.  The aircraft is currently used on 36 projects,  including collaboration with US (ASTEX, MAST), French (ETEX, CRAU) and German scientists, covering topics including oil fires in Bahrain, satellite wind and SST comparisons, methane fluxes, .......<P>

The C-130 is available for no charge for research done in collaboration with MRF scientists or for hire otherwise. <P>

Details on the C-130 aircraft and/r MRF research is available from Alan Weinstein at ONREUR <P>


<B>Hadley Center for Climate Prediction and Research</B><BR>
The Hadley Center, an approximately 100 person component off the Research Division of the British Meteorological Office, has responsibility for preparing global forecasts out over the next century for the United Nations' International Policy Formulation (FCCC).  Co-located with BMO's daily operational numerical forecast center, the Hadley Center uses essentially the same model, but includes a fully interaction ocean model as well.  <P>

Key areas of improvement in the model include cloud and aerosol parameterization, radiation, ocean models, ocean and land carbon cycles, and atmospheric chemistry.  Much of the research to develop these improvements is performed by the Hadley Center's sister Meteorological Research Facility and university research supported by the National Environmental Research Center (NERC).<P>

Recent calculations from the Center's Global Climate Model show that approximately 1/3 of the global warming due to greenhouse gasses may be mitigated by sulfate aerosols.  This is caused both directly by the increased reflection of solar radiation due to the presence of the sulfate aerosols, and/or indirectly by reflection from cloud droplets forming around the sulfate aerosols.  Other important results indicate that the annual temperature variability will remain the same no matter what the level of global warming.<P>

<B>1.  Summary</B><BR>
European Geophysical Society - XXI General Assembly
The 21st General Assembly of the European Geophysical Society was held in The Hague, Netherlands from 6 - 10 May 1996.  Of the over 2500 were in attendance almost 10% were from "Overseas", including about 50 Americans.  The 105 individual sessions covered the full spectrum of solid, fluid and gaseous geophysics.  <BR>
The 25 sessions of the Oceans and Atmospheres Subsection covered a wide spectrum of scales ranging from global through regional (e.g. Baltic Sea Experiment) to local (e.g. boundary layers), over the full spectrum on modern geophysics from solid (earth), liquid (ocean) and gaseous (atmosphere and space). <BR>
General impressions:<BR>
a.  Small, focused  experiments abound;<BR>
b.  Observational S&T is as good as, if not better than in the U. S.;<BR>
c.  Modeling S&T is not as strong, and interactive modeling is practically nonexistent;<BR>
d.  As in the U.S., most European boundary layers research is terrestrial; and<BR>
e.  There is a growing level of pan European cooperation in environmental S&T. <BR>
Notable scientific observations include: <BR>
a.  Under stable stability, boundary layer height may be better scaled by Brunt-Vaisala Frequency (based on stability) than on Coriolis (based on kinematics) and <BR>
b.  Modeling indicates that momentum exchange due to surface waves has considerably less impact on air-sea interaction on regional scales than on local.<BR>
There is much opportunity for cooperation between U.S. and European oceanic  and atmospheric science and technology.<P>

<B>2.  General Assembly</B><BR>
The European Geophysical Society (EGS) celebrated its 25th year at its XII General Assembly in the Netherlands Congresgebouw, The Hague, on 6 - 10 May 1996.  Approximately 2500 solid, fluid and gaseous geophysicists from virtually every European country and approximately 200 from "overseas", including the U.S (~50), attended the Assembly.<P>

History of the EGS can be divided into three phases;<BR>
<UL>
<LI>birth during a meeting of the International Union of Geology and Geophysics (IUGG) in Moscow in 1971 with initial focus on geology;
<LI>expansion in the early 1980s into fluids and gases and publication of its first journal (in partnership with American counterpart, AGU) called "Tectonics"; and 
<LI>maturity in the late 1980s with the establishment of a central office managed by an Executive Secretary. 
</UL> 

Under the executive stewardship of Arne Richter,  the Society has<BR>
<UL>
<LI>Approximately 3000 members in 6 sections (including Ocean and Atmosphere); 
<LI>publishes 11 journals with no page charges (including Annales Geophysicae, Climate Dynamics and Journal of Atmospheric Chemistry of interest to the ocean and atmosphere community);  
<LI>grants awards, medals and honorary membership (including the Fridtjof Nansen and Milutin Milankovic Medal from OA) all aimed "....to promote geo- and space-sciences on a pan-European international level...".  It shares offices and enjoys a close working relationship with its analogous, and much larger, predecessor, the AGU.
</UL>

Assembly.  To those Americans acquainted with annual meetings of US societies, the EGSs General Assembly would had a familiar appearance.  There was a business meeting, award presentations, exhibitors, posters and 106 (most overlapping) individual sessions (including 25 in OA). <BR>
Medals.  Medal presentations of note to the OA community were , the Guttenberg Medal for "...contributions to Solid Earth in general." was awarded to Frank Press, the Nansen Medal for " .....distinguished research in Oceanography."  to Anders Stigebrandt, and the Milankovich Medal for "....outstanding achievements in climatological sciences." to Lennart Bengtsson.<P>

<B>3.  Scientific Sessions</B><BR>
At a meeting this large it is impossible for one person to attend more than a few individual sessions. This reporter spent most of his time at the the Boundary Layers and Turbulence, special Baltic Experiment (BALTEX), and Air-Sea Interaction sessions, and a bit at Oceanography, Predictability and NWP sessions.  From that small sampling, it is clear that European oceanic and atmospheric science is surely comparable to U.S. in quality, if not quantity.  <BR>
<UL>
<LI>Boundary Layers & Turbulence.  In boundary layer research, most of the European investment is in research over land, primarily to improve pollution forecasting.  Most notable was their heavy activity in field observations, in such diverse places as Saheil, Spain, Germany, and Holland. Most of these field efforts appeared rather modest, but first rate.  They use first rate instrumentation, on the ground, on towers and from aircraft, much off it developed locally and sold commercially  by European companies.  All this field activity will contribute to the overall body of knowledge about the boundary layer, that someday someone will coalesce into a major improvement of our understanding of this highly turbulent, very complex region of the atmosphere.  The most interesting new development I heard was a movement away from Coriolis based mixed layer depth scaling toward a scaling based upon Brunt-Vaisala frequency.  The former, after Eckman, is based upon traditional rotation of wind with height in the friction layer.  If this scaling is valid, the mean depth of the atmospheric boundary layer should vary with latitude.  This is not verified, particularly under stable conditions, in the little data that is emerging around the world.  Scaling with inverse Brunt-Vaisala frequency was first introduced in the 1980s by Kitaigorodskii.  Cooperative potential might exist in coastal areas with Navy funding over water and European activity over nearby land.    
<LI>BALTEX.  The Baltic Experiment is a 10 European nation undertaking, under the GEWEX umbrella,  to understand the energy and water budgets of  this semi-enclosed sea and to relate these budgets to large scale atmospheric and oceanic circulation.   Most of this meetings papers concentrated on modeling.  The models were similar, if not a bit behind American counterparts.  Model inter comparisons between various nations' research and/or operational models abounded.  What little verification was shown indicated the models agreed more with each other than with observations.  This is a situation often encountered in American model comparisons as well.  Unfortunately, few model or other studies centered on process understanding.  Although the primary goal of BALTEX is understanding the full ecological picture of the Baltic, no interdisciplinary, interactive studies or even modeling was presented.  
<LI>Air-Sea Interaction.  For session held on the last day, this was surprisingly well attended.  It was worth the wait.  Several papers centered on the role of waves in exchanging gas and momentum between the air and sea.  One interesting result indicated that coupled air-sea exchange appears to have little impact on the regional scale, but greater impact on small scales.  
</UL>

<B>4.  Observations</B><BR>
	Exhibits.  Most of the exhibitors were small instrumentation companies and/or book publishers, of which there are many in Europe.  Other exhibitors, whose activities will be subjects of separate newsletter reports include the  European Commissions Marine Science & Technology (MAST) Program and the Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO).   <BR>
	Overall.  Overall, the Assembly  indicated that European geophysical science is equal, if not superior, to the U.S. in observational S&T and a bit behind in modeling.  The Hague is an excellent venue, with excellent meeting facilities for daytime work and beautiful outdoors facilities,  the World Court and the Court of Military Justice (two completely different courts) and several museums (including a showing of the Vermeer Exhibit), for after hours enjoyment and informal meetings.<P>

<I>Key words:	beach evolution, gas exchange, wind-wave relationships</I><P> 

<B>1.  Summary</B><BR>
The National Technical University of Athens is Greeces largest engineering school with a full range of curricula from the traditional (CE, ME, EE etc.) through a few specialized areas (Architectural, Mine, Metallurgy) to some of particular interest to the Navy (Naval Architecture, Marine).  Of particular interest for this visit was the <B>Laboratory of Harbor Works</B> in the Civil Engineering School.  Led by Prof.. <I>C. I. Moutzouris</I>, this Laboratory tackles "practical problems" and "satisfies it customers".  They work in three areas, harbor and beach evolution (largest), wind/wave relationships, and gas transport across the air-sea interface.  The harbor and beach evolution programs study the effects of artificial structure (piers, primarily) on beaches and harbor currents and suggest solutions (unfortunately <I>after</I> the structure has been built, not before).  The wind/wave program uses modern telemetry to transmit wind and wave data from throughout the Aegean Sea back to Athens for archiving and analysis.  The gas transport across the air-sea interface program studies dissolved gasses under differing wave conditions in order to understand the effects of structures (e.g. breakwaters) on the ecology of a harbor or beach.  <P>

The faculty and staff at LHW are interested in sharing their technology with U.S. scientists. Dr. Moutzouris was quick to acknowledge the simplicity of many of their projects.  For example, their beaches were sheltered from storms and had no tides to deal with.  However, they often have complicated sand sizes to contend with.  They were interested in working at U.S. sites (e.g. Duck, N.C.) and/or suggesting Greek sites for U. S. programs.<P>

<B>2. National Technical University of Athens</B><BR>
NTUA can trace its ancestry to 1837 as the "Royal School of Arts", later changed to the "School of Industrial Arts" in 1843.  Today it is located over a 100 hectare campus in the Zografou area of Athens.  The teaching staff numbers 560, supported by 900 post-graduate students, 264 laboratory technicians and 242 administrative staff.  Its disciplines include Civil, Mechanical, Electrical, Architectural, Chemical Rural/Surveying, Mining and Marine Engineering, and Naval Architecture, as well as a General Studies.<P>

<B>3. Department of Water Resources, Hydraulic and Maritime Engineering of the Civil Engineering School</B><BR>
The DWRHME faculty includes six Professors, three Associate Professors, seven Assistant Professors, four Lecturers and nine Teaching Assistants (Post-Graduate Students).  This combined faculty teach 27 courses. Their stated areas of competence include Fluid Mechanics (Surface, groundwater and maritime hydraulics), Engineering hydrology (Development and Management of water resources), Hydraulic works (Dams and hydropower plants), Port, Coastal and Offshore Engineering) and Ecology (Sanitary engineering, pollution and protection of aquatic environment).  <P>

Funded research projects over ten years 1982-1991  number 61, worth 2.5M ECU ($3.2M).  This ranks the Department first in the Civil Engineering School and fifth among all NTUA departments. Over the succeeding two years, the department had 24 funded projects totaling 4.5M ECU ($5.8M) ranking it highest in the School and second (1992)  or third (1993) in the University. <P>

Four laboratories function within the Department.<BR> 
	<DD>The <B>Laboratory of Applied Hydraulics</B>  is deployed in a 20X50 M hall that is equipped with a recirculating water supply system with a capacity of 200L/s that covers the needs of flumes, basins and other experimental apparatus.  <BR>
	<DD>The <B>Laboratory of Sanitary Engineering</B> has equipment to carry out conventional as well as specialized analyses for the assessment of the quality of the aquatic environment and of liquid waste.  <BR>
	<DD>The <B>Laboratory of Hydrology and Water Resources</B> affords modern computing facilities with RISC work stations and personal computers connected to the hydrological and meteorological authorities of Greece.  The laboratory also operates an automated telemetric meteorological station in the NTUA campus.  <BR>
	<DD>The <B>Laboratory of Harbor Works</B> houses two wave flumes and a basin 25X27 M with random wave generators, under an enclosure of 5,000sq m.  Instrumentation included measuring equipment for laboratory work, current and wave recorders, data acquisition and processing system for field studies and a series of relevant software packages.<P>

<B>4.  Laboratory of Harbor Works.</B><BR>  
The LHW staff  is composed of four NTUA faculty and 12 soft money people.  The total budget is approximately 120 M Drachma/yr. ($.5M).  Under the direction of Professor C.I. Moutzouris, the LHW has grown over the past ten years by tackling "practical problems" and "satisfying it customers".  <P>

The three main projects of the Laboratory deal with beach and harbor evolution, gas transport across the air-sea interface, and wind wave relationships.  The first of those three is by far the largest.  <P>

<B>4.1 Harbor and Beach Evolution</B><BR>
One example of the beach and harbor evolution program deals with the beach at Aghios Nikolaos, in Crete.  A new harbor for small craft was built to accommodate the growing tourist traffic in small yachts.  This harbor seriously modified the local currents such that the beach that brought the tourists in the first place, became almost completely eroded within one year.  In 1992 the relevant public authority commissioned a study to find out what happened and suggest remedies.  <P>

The team from the Harbor Works set out current meters etc. and ran some models (One called "Mike 21").  From this, they designed a system of two detached breakwaters to correct the problem.. The local authorities built the breakwaters and filled in part of the beach.  Within one winter half of the original beach had returned.  This winter the beach is still growing.  I actually saw the beach when I was in Crete attending the 3rd European Underwater Acoustics Conference described in a separate ONREUR Newsletter.  It was well populated with bathers.  Their customers, the harbor authorities, are very happy.  Original results of this program were reported at <B>HYDRO-PORT 94 in Yokosuka, Japan</B> (Reprint available from ONREUR).  Follow on will be reported at the upcoming  American Society of Civil Engineering (ASCE) International Conference on Coastal Engineering in Orlando, FL in September 1996.<P>


This is but one example of their approach to solving practical problems.  Another they showed related to changes in Pireas Harbor due to installation of a pier.  In this case they not only took in situ observations and ran models, but also replicated the harbor in their laboratory basin.<P>

They are interested in sharing their technology with U.S. scientists.  They were quick to acknowledge that their beaches were sheltered from storms and had no tides to deal with.  However, they often have complicated sand sizes to contend with.  They were interested in working at Duck and/or suggesting Greek sites for Duck follow-ons.<P>

<B>4.2 Gas Transport Across the Air-Sea Interface.</B><BR>
This project, led by Dr. Ekaterini Daniil, is studying oxygenation due to wave breaking.  The application is to understand the ecological effects of wave breaking.  In particular the effects of  a rubble mound breakwater of the S-type were studied using the wave flume in their laboratory.  The water was chemically deoxygenated and dissolved oxygen concentrations were followed over time in characteristic locations.  Experimental results showed that transfer velocity increased with increasing wave height for waves of the same frequency and with increasing frequency for waves of the same height.  This and other similar results were reported in <B>1995 Annales Geophysicae (Vol 13, 1039-1046)</B>.

<B>4.3 Wind Wave Relationships.</B><BR>
This project uses telemetered data from across the Aegean Sea to monitor wave heights under changing weather conditions.  The raw data is stored locally, modestly processed and transmitted to Athens routinely or upon demand.  If weather conditions change, data is take more or less frequently, and transmitted accordingly.<P>

<B>5.  Assessment</B><BR>
The Laboratory of Harbor Works is led by an aggressive director who has identified an area of importance to a community in Greece that is willing to fund his services.  He uses state of the are technology and models to serve real world customers.  He has expressed willingness to cooperate with U.S. programs in his area.  It is worth supporting a visit by him to several U.S. centers doing similar science and technology.  A visit will be arranged in 1997.<P>

<B>1. Summary</B><BR>
The 3rd European Conference on Underwater Acoustics was held in <B>Heraklion, Crete, Greece on 24-28 June 1996</B>. 245 Scientists and engineers from 21 countries worldwide attended.. The conference had four simultaneous sessions each day devoted to the following topics: Scattering, Sound Propagation Modeling, Inverse Problems in Underwater Acoustics, Signal and Data Processing, Underwater Communications, Acoustics in Marine Geology and Geophysics, Acoustics in Fisheries, Acoustic Experiments  and Measurements, Tomography, Transducers and Instrumentation, the THETIS II Project (Acoustic Tomography in the Western Mediterranean Sea), Noise, Reverberation, and Bubble Acoustics.<BR>
There were both oral and poster sessions.  <P>

In addition to the regular proceedings, Dr. <B>Walter Munk</B> was granted an honorary doctorate from the University of Crete.  Dr. Munk was recognized for his career long contributions to oceanography, recently focused on acoustic Tomography.<P>

<B>Notable observations from the conference include:</B><BR>
1) The European community in acoustics is active on all fronts from theory through field experimentation.  <BR>
Major participants include <B>France, Russia and the United Kingdom</B>.  Smaller players include Denmark, Germany, Italy (Largely from SACLANTCEN), Norway, Poland, Ukraine, and Belgium.<BR>
2) Russian scientists had much to add to theoretical work, particularly in <B>acoustic tomography</B>.<BR>
3) There is a major EU (MAST) project in the Western Mediterranean, called <B>THETIS</B>, using acoustic tomography on the ocean mesoscale, that bears monitoring in the future.<BR>
4) There is a need for a workshop on the naval applications of ocean acoustics, involving U.S. and European workers.<P>

<B>2. Venue</B><BR>
The Third European Conference on Underwater Acoustics was held at the Institute of Applied and Computational Mathematics (IACM), one of the seven institutes of the Foundation for Research and Technology-HELLAS (FORTH), approximately 10 miles SE of Heraklion, Crete, Greece on 24 - 28 June 1996.  245 Scientists and engineers from 21 countries attended.<P>

FORTH was created in 1987 out of the Research Center of Crete, when the institutes of Patras and Salonica joined the University of Crete for this foundation.  The local hosts for this conference were from the Division of Underwater Acoustics, one of the three Foundation divisions.  Led by Professor J. S. Papadakus, the scientific committee included representation from Denmark, Germany, Italy, France, Spain and Great Britain.  <P>

Each day, there were  four separate, parallel oral sessions that started after a an invited plenary paper.  A total of 154 oral papers were presented.  These were supplemented by 42 poster papers.<P>

<B>3.  Sessions</B><BR>
Oral and poster sessions were devoted to the following topics:  Scattering, Sound Propagation Modeling, Inverse Problems in Underwater Acoustics, Signal and Data Processing, Underwater Communications, Acoustics in Marine Geology and Geophysics, Acoustics in Fisheries, Acoustic Experiments  and Measurements, Tomography, Transducers and Instrumentation, the THETIS II Project (Acoustic Tomography in the Western Mediterranean Sea), Noise, Reverberation, and Bubble Acoustics.<P>

<B>4.  Attendance</B><BR>
The leading countries in Europe in this area, as judged by participation at this meeting, in decreasing order of attendance, are France, United Kingdom, and Italy (Largely from SACLANTCEN).  Other European countries with representation, again in decreasing order of attendance, included Greece (Possibly because they were the host country), Norway, Denmark, Germany, Russia, Poland, Sweden, Netherlands and Belgium.  From North America, the countries represented were USA and Canada.  From Asia, there were attendees from China, Singapore and Japan.<P>

In specific areas, Scattering was led by France, Both Modeling and Inverse Problems by USA and France, Underwater communications by France, Tomography by Russia, Experiments by United Kingdom and France, Transducers by France and United Kingdom, Noise by USA and UK, Bubbles by UK.  Acoustics in Geology and Geophysics and Acoustics in Fisheries had the most number of countries, but were not dominated by any single one. <P>

<B>5.  Assessment</B><BR>
Based upon conversation before, during and after this conference, it is clear that the U.S. acoustics community in the Navy is familiar with most of the European activity, except for that in France.  Judging from this conference, there is much work being done in France.  It is appropriate to explore that further.<P>

Russian scientists are particularly active in acoustic tomography.  They presented several interesting papers on novel techniques for retrieving ocean parameters (currents, density). <P>

The major program in acoustics that is sponsored by the European Unions Marine Science and Technology (MAST) Program is called THETIS.  It started out using tomography for offshore probing.  It has recently moved further offshore for mesoscale features in the western Mediterranean.. Data has been collected and is in analysis presently.  Although little new is coming out of this program, it is a major tomography experiment on the mesoscale and bears monitoring by the Navy S&T community.<P>

This conference dealt largely with research in acoustics.  A few poster papers were on applications.  A longer meeting devoted primarily to applications appears appropriate.<P>

<B>1.  Summary</B><BR>
<B>Seventh Conference on Mesoscale Processes of the American Meteorological Society</B> was held in <B>Reading, UK on September 9 - 13, 1996</B>.  Recognizing the important historic, as well as current, role of  European Meteorologists in general, and UK in particular, the AMS chose Reading as the site for their mesoscale processes meeting. The Royal Meteorological Society served as co-sponsor.  The University of Reading was the venue.<P>

The conference reflected the current expanded definition of mesoscale by devoting the first full day and much of the third (almost 1/3 of the total conference) to the study and forecasting of extratropical cyclones.  The remainder of the conference dealt with the more standard mesoscale topics of convection (both tropical and extra tropical), orographic forcing, the boundary layer and gravity waves..  This expansion into the traditional synoptic scale reflects the increasingly scale interactive nature of weather research and operations these days.  <P>
 
The majority of the approximately 300 attendees came from the United States and the UK.  However there was considerable participation from mainland European countries, as well as other North Americans and Asians.  From the attendance, it is clear that mesoscale meteorology is of world-wide interest these days.  This forum was an excellent opportunity to bring together this varied geographical interest. <P>

Notable among the overall observations were the following:<BR>
(1) There is very important scale interaction between convective and orographic processes on the traditional mesoscale and such synoptic scale processes and phenomena as baroclinic instability, fronts, cyclones, etc., that can send energy either up or down scale. Such scale interaction has tied the previous somewhat separated mesoscale and synoptic communities much closer together.<BR>
(2) Computer technology has brought practical numerical modeling down to scales were classical mesoscale phenomena (e.g. squall lines, sea breezes, mountain winds) are resolvable, thereby unleashing important new observational considerations.<BR>
(3) In view of the growing availability of  "non-conventional" observing tools (radar, wind profilers, satellite data), data assimilation has taken on greater importance in numerical weather prediction on all scales.  In combination with growing computer power, this greater emphasis on data assimilation is making previously esoteric methods (e.g. adjoint), commonplace.    <BR> 
(4) Appreciation for the impact of initial condition errors on numerical forecast skill has generated considerable interest in targeting observations where they can have the most impact on forecast skill, thereby heralding a lively competition for ideas on how to best identify potential areas for such targeting.<P>

<B>2.  The American and Royal Meteorological Societies.</B><BR>
Readers of this newsletter need no introduction to either the <B>American or Royal Meteorological Societies</B>.  The AMS is headquartered in Boston, Ma and has over 11,00 members and a full range of publications and scientific meetings.  The RMS headquarters is in Reading.  Its membership is approximately 3200 and it also supports the full range of meetings and publications, albeit somewhat smaller than the AMS, reflecting its smaller membership.  Many meteorologists hold membership in both societies.  Both societies have long traditions of leadership and communication in their respective countries.  The AMS celebrated its 100th birthday last year and the RMS is scheduled to celebrate its 150th in 1999.  Their joint sponsorship of this conference reflects the growing international nature of current weather research.<P>

<B>3.  Sessions</B><BR>
In order to accommodate the inevitably large number of submissions, particularly in light of the expansion of mesoscale meteorology into traditional synoptic scales, conference organizers had to resort to both parallel sessions and poster papers.  Fortunately, parallel sessions were only required on one of the four conference days.  This was Tuesday, for the Tropical Weather Systems (aka Tropical Convection) and Orographic Processes sessions. <P>

Poster sessions were preceded by a short oral session when poster authors had one minute to summarize their papers to wet the appetite of prospective viewers.   Following these oral summary sessions, specific time was set aside for poster paper viewing that did not compete with oral sessions.  This combination of short reviews and specific viewing time made the poster presentations more important parts of this conference than at others.<P>

<B>3.1 Extratropical Cyclones</B><BR>
The conference started at the large end of the newly defined mesoscale, with one full day devoted to  extratropical cyclones.  It is hard to think of one process, one technique, one relevant geographical domain, or forcing type that was not discussed.  Processes covered the range from inertial, through wave and barotropic, to baroclinic.  Techniques included theoretical studies, modelling (including just about all of the current models on both sides of the ocean), and case studies of individual events.  Domains included sea, land and both, from oceans (Pacific and Atlantic), through seas (e.g. Adriatic, Mediterranean), to lakes (e.g. U/S. Great Lakes), through continents (North America and Europe), to land-sea interface zones (e.g. eastern Pacific cyclones coming ashore onto the U.S. west coast).  Forcing covered the spectrum form orographic, through kinematic to adiabatic.  <P>

In the end, almost all of the processes being explained are presently included in one form or another in todays numerical models.  Modern computing power has made it possible to run these models with ever higher resolution.  Yet, with all the wealth of data, understanding and insight that has been accumulated over the years, numerical forecasts are considered good if, as in the words of one author, "....they have the right shape, and (are) close in space and time".  In this instance "close" in space and time were 10s of miles and hours.  While that is considered a synoptic scale success by most research standards, it is far from the mark in true forecasting satisfaction.  A customer on the ground who was only 10 miles from a forecast rainfall event, or right under one that came a couple of hours early or late, would not be satisfied with this "success"..  Unfortunately, little light was shed in this session on how to assimilate all our growing understanding (or is it just "explanation" ) of individual or theoretical into progress from a research success into an operational one on the scale of fronts and cyclones.  <P>

<B>3.2  Tropical Weather Systems</B><BR>
Held in parallel with Sessions 3.3. below, most of the papers in this session dealt with observations and/or modelling done in conduction with the TOGA-COARE program in the tropical Pacific Ocean.  Understanding of tropical convection was the underlying goal of this major international program.  Hence, most of the papers dealt with observations (radar, wind profilers, satellites) and modelling of mesoscale convective complexes (MCCs), squall lines and other similar convective systems.  It is clear that the international weather research community has only begun to scratch the surface of the TOGA-COARE data.  We will be hearing about this experiment for years to come.<P>

Notwithstanding the dominance of TOGA-COARE papers in this part of the conference, the last session in this series looked at tropical convection in such other areas as coastal Australia, the Gulf of California, around Taiwan and over Thailand.  It was hard to discern any unifying theme or results from these papers other than their concentration on some very local phenomenon that had more individuality than similarity with others in this session.  Much needs to be done in drawing some commonality between varies local processes world-wide. <P>

<B>3.3  Orographic Processes</B><BR>
Held in parallel with Sessions 3.2 above, papers in this session covered the full spectrum of orographic forcing from isolated hills, through low ridges to high mountain ranges.  Papers dealing with coastal topography shared time with those over the more conventional inland mountains.  As might be expected at a conference in Europe, many of the papers described flow over and around the Alps and the Pyrenees.  However, the US Rockies and coastal California as served as the venue for several of the papers.  <P>

In the end, it is clear that topography is just as important a forcing factor as is convection.  The former is dominant in the tropics where moisture is greater and stability less.  Orography becomes more important as moisture declines and stability grows.  Lee waves, of course are the extreme of this progression.<P>

<B>3.4  Forecasting and NWP</B><BR>
As was the case with the conference in general, these sessions covered the spectrum from synoptic through traditional mesoscales.  It is becoming clear that as computer power continues to grow, previously impractical modelling is now becoming realizable.  <P>

On the synoptic scale, this has had two important effects.  In the first case it has allowed considerable attention to systematically identifying cyclone precursors.  In particular, the first session in this series dealt heavily with the method that is most popular in the UK and France, called singular vectors.  The second important impact of growing computer power on synoptic forecasting has been the increasing use of adjoint data assimilation. <P>  

On the traditional mesoscale, the growing availability of computer power has led to the growth of non-hydrostatic models, as ever higher resolution has become possible. Grid spacing of the order of kms is now making it possible to resolve individual thunderstorms, squall lines and mountain valleys in mesoscale models.  Such resolution calls for systematic assimilation from such heretofore non-conventional observation tools initializing numerical models as radar, wind profilers and clouds from satellites.  Adjoint data assimilation, that was originally introduced in conjunction with synoptic weather prediction, is now gaining increasing use in assimilating this high temporal and spatial resolution data in mesoscale models as well.  <P>

<B>3.5  Extratropical Convection</B><BR>
With this session, the conference return the more conventional mesoscale phenomenon such as thunderstorms (with and without hail), squall lines, mesoscale convective systems and tornadoes.  The papers presented here covered the spectrum from theory through observations (both case studies and compilations) to numerical models.  It is clear from these papers that the available of observing tools, from radar to lightning detectors, when combined with sophisticated models, present a powerful arsenal for uncovering the secrets of severe storms that plague humankind on virtually all of the worlds continents.  Those in Europe are rarer and usually less intense than those in the U.S., but when they do occur they can be just as devastating.  Unfortunately, these sessions showed that we have a long way to go before we can reliably predict the occurrence or evolution of these systems.  <P>

<B>3.6  Boundary Layer</B><BR>
The boundary layer is where the atmosphere touches the earth (and/or ocean).  It is in this layer that we live.  More important for physical understanding, it is through this layer that all energy is transferred from the surface to the air.  Papers in this session covered both latent and sensible heat transfer and well as the effects of friction.  Among the more interesting papers in this session were those that dealt with the interaction of fronts and the boundary layer.  Unfortunately (for this reporter) only one paper dealt with air-sea coupling on the mesoscale.  <P>

<B>3.7 Gravity Waves, etc.</B><BR>
By the "etc." in the title of these sessions, you can draw the correct conclusion that they occurred at the end of the conference and included papers that could not logically fit in elsewhere.  While gravity were the waves most commonly discussed, other waves included internal and inertial.  <P>

<B>3.8 Special Programs</B><BR>
Just as TOGA-COARE has served as a focus of attention for tropical convection, two upcoming programs that were discussed at this conference hold similar potential for extratropical cyclogenesis and orographic forcing.  The former is called the Fronts and Atlantic Storm Track Experiment (FASTEX).  Led largely by UK and French scientists, but with a growing U.S. presence, this program will go into the field over the north Atlantic during the winter of 1997.  Its primary focus will be on the prediction of cyclogenesis upstream of Europe.  The organizers of this experiment have assembled an impressive array of aircraft and ships and have interested some of the worlds leading modelling centers. It is surely an experiment with much potential for coalescing much of the extratropical cyclogenesis research presented at this conference.<P>

The second new project that was discussed at this meeting is still in its early planning stages.  Called the Mesoscale Alpine Program (MAP), this project will focus on mountain airflow dynamics and orographic precipitation mechanisms.  Upper level wave breaking, potential vorticity banners and airflow over mountain are presently the main foci of the former. Both dynamics and microphysics are foci of the precipitation component.  <P>

As the name implies, the venue for MAP will be the Alps.  Present plans call for a major field campaign during the fall of 1999.  Over the next couple of years, planning and preparatory modelling will be the main activities.  As might be expected, this program is primarily spearheaded by scientists from central Europe, from France, through Germany, Switzerland, and Austria, to Italy.  To date, U.S. interest has been led by Joachim Kuettner of NCAR and Ron Smith of Yale.   <P>

<B>4.  Attendance</B><BR>
Based upon preregistered attendance, the leading countries interested in mesoscale processes are USA (44% of attendees), UK (23%), France (12%), and Canada (6%). Of course, this was an American Meteorological Society meeting, held in the UK, and all numbers of this kind should be normalized by a countrys total population.  However, there are no real surprises in these statistics.  The US and UK have long been recognized as leaders in this kind of research and France and Canada have shown recent interest.  Perhaps more surprising might be that only 15% or the attendance was from the rest of the world.  That number came from eleven other European nations, four Asian and two South American.  <P>

An analysis of papers in individual session series may be revealing as to where specific national or orgainzational interests lie. In <B>Extratropical Cyclones</B>, half the papers were presented by U.S. authors, (with NOAAs Severe Storms and Environmental Technology Laboratories having half of those), with UK (all from the University of Reading), France (mostly CNRM and CNRS) and Canada (McGill and the University of Toronto) in the 10-15% range and no other country above 5%. <B>Tropical Weather Systems</B> was led by US (60%, led by NCAR and GSFC), France (25%, led by CNRM) and UK(10%, all by U Reading). Europeans led the way in <B>Orographic Processes</B> with 58%, composed principally of France (17%, ), UK(13%), Switzerland (11%), Italy (6%), and Germany (4%), although the US still had 36% (a quarter of those from NCAR).  The US only had 33% (half from NCAR) of the <B>Forecasting & NWP papers</B>, followed by UK (21%, equally divided between U Reading and the UK Meteorological Office) and France (9%).  The most noteworthy aspect of the <B>Extratropical Convection</B> sessions was the leadership by the US (57%, with Colorado State University authors contributing a quarter of that total), with the only other country above 10% being the UK (3/4 of those from the UK Met Office).  The total number of papers in <B>Boundary Layers and Gravity Waves</B> were too small to draw valid conclusions, but both were led by the US and UK as might be expected by their overall leadership in total attendance.  <P>

<B>5.  Assessment</B><BR>
The most notable aspect of this conference was the extension of the traditional mesoscale into such previously considered synoptic scale phenomenon as cyclones and fronts.  Earliest weather research and forecasting centered on these phenomenon and our knowledge and understanding of them is the most mature in all of meteorology. The growth of modern computer power has allowed this understanding to increase considerably, but a "good" forecast on this scale is still off in space by 10s of kilometers and time by hours.  Superb by most standards in the research community,  this "good" forecast is often overshadowed by bad "busts" whose origin is still not clear and whose genesis is the focus of much of the present research in this area.<P>

Modern computer power has allowed resolution of modern mesoscale models to shrink to the kilometer range thereby heralding the rise of non-homogenous models, adjoint data assimilation and realistic predictions of wind events in individual valleys, rainfall events, sea breezes, etc. However, such models require previously unheard of data quality and quantity that will challenge future observation systems and data assimilation techniques.   <P>

Mesoscale meteorology, both from the viewpoint of operational forecasting and research is an international undertaking that is both healthy and vigorous.  Recently completed tropical programs (e.g. TOGA-COARE) and new ones on mid latitude marine cyclogenesis (FASTEX) and mountain phenomena (MAP) should provide the kind of data and modelling studies that will allow the continuation of progress in this exciting weather scale.  <P>

<B>1.  Summary</B><BR>
UK OCEANOGRAPHY '96, the latest in the Challenger Society for Marine Science's biennial series of ocean science conferences started in 1984, was held at the University of Wales, Bangor (UWB)  on 2 - 6 September 1996.  The topics discussed at this year's conference covered the spectrum from physical, through biogeochemical, to biological oceanography. The domains ranged from coastal margins (including estuaries and beaches), through the shelf and shelf seas, to the deep ocean, from the ocean bottom (primarily sediments), through the volume, to the surface and into the atmosphere above. <P> 

Far outnumbering the normal retinue of established UK ocean science community members , this year's conference, by design, attracted a large number of UK  students and postdocs.   Also by design, the organising committee included participants from other European countries, whose participation was notable.   Other than three from ONR Europe, there were no US participants.<P>
 
As noted by the Challenger Society's president,  UWB's Professor John Simpson, this year's meeting attracted over three times the attendance of the first in this series held in  1984, also hosted by UWB. The 380 person attendance and wide breadth of topics this year, attests the health and vigor of ocean science in the United Kingdom.  <P>

Notable among the overall observations were the following:<BR>
(1) European oceanography in general, and UK oceanography in particular, has had and continues to have, a number of local field campaigns whose success has resulted in the collection of a rich base of new data;  <BR>
(2) Most of the analysis of this field data to date has been primarily as individual case studies, from which overall condenses have not yet emerged; and<BR>
(3)  Much of the local case study findings have analogies in U.S. findings, with little if any mentioned recognition.<P>

<B>2. Challenger Society of Marine Science.</B>  
UK OCEANOGRAPHY '96 is the latest in the biennial series sponsored by the Challenger Society of Marine Science.   Headquartered at the Southampton Oceanography Centre and operating on an annual budget of approximately 18,000 Pounds ($29,000), the Challenger Society is the UK's societal focus for oceanography.  Their primary communication vehicles are their thrice annual Ocean Challenger magazine, their biennial UK OCEANOGRAPHY meeting and other meetings as appropriate.  Started in 1984 at the University of Wales, the UK OCEANOGRAPHY series has been held successively at Southampton, Norwich (University of East Anglia), Plymouth, Liverpool, and Stirling (Scotland).  Growth of ocean science in the UK is reflected in attendance less than 120 in 1994 to over 380 this year.  The 1998 conference will return to Southampton.<P>

In order to focus attention on specific areas of interest, the Society has specialist groups for Air-Sea Interaction, Altimetry, Marine Chemistry, Ocean Modelling. The Society honors one student per year at the Open University and will soon initiate a medal in honor of it's long time Honorary Secretary, Ron Currie, "...to scientist who make outstanding contributions to ocean research.".<P>

After hosting the first biennial UK Oceanography conference, The University of Wales, Bangor returned as host this year  because of a combination of their fine conference facilities and their School of Ocean Sciences, one of the UK's leading oceanography research and teaching centers.   A separate Newsletter describes this School's program in detail.<P>

<B>3.  Sessions</B><BR>
In response to the large number of submitted papers, the conference had both oral and poster sessions. Two simultaneous oral sessions each day were normally initiated by a keynote speaker who set the stage by reviewing past work and suggesting routes for the future.  The only plenary sessions were the opening welcome, the Buckland Lecture by Prof. John S. Gray of the University of Oslo (See 3.12 below) and "A Tribute to the life and work of Dr. John Swallow FRS" by Prof. Henry Charnock, himself a FRS.  The close personal and professional relationship between these two most highly respected members of the UK ocean community was underscored by Prof. Charnock's poignant closing remark that when he has a particularly interesting idea to share with his close personal friend, he is pained by the realization that this friend is no longer there.  <P>

<B>3.1  Ocean Margins</B><BR>
The ocean margin is that critically important zone where the land meets the sea.  As noted by Professor Patrick Holligan in his keynote address,  it is in this zone that human activities have their greatest impact on the sea.  He noted that although great advances have been made in understanding the physical processes in this region of the ocean, considerably less is known about biological and/or sedimentary processes.  By implication, if not direct statement, he suggested that understanding the physical forcing of those two processes holds the key for advancing our overall comprehension of this critically important oceanic region.<P>

Although the ocean margin extends from the immediate coastline out to the shelf break, most of the papers in this session dealt with process on or just off the shelf, leaving inshore processes for other sessions.  As if to illustrate Prof. Holligan's remarks about the relative understanding of physical vs. biological and sedimentary processes, only two papers in this session dealt with the latter. As if to underscore our lack of biological and sedimentary observations on which to even build this understanding, both of these studies were modelling works whose results, although plausible and interesting, lack quantitative verification.  The remaining nine papers in this session concentrated on modelling and observational studies of physical phenomena (currents, tides, internal waves) off such varied locations as East Greenland, Southeast Africa (Agulhas Current), Northwest Africa, New Zealand as well as several sites around the United Kingdom.  Although many interesting site specific observations were presented, there was no apparent unifying underpinning common to all.<P>

<B>3.2 Marine Biogeochemistry</B><BR>
The keynote by Prof R Chester of the University of Liverpool postulated likely directions for biogeochemistry in the coming decade as a challenge to the young audience to think beyond their past training.  Major programs in the 70s and 80s recognized the importance of atmospheric interchange and hydrothermal contributions to BGC; much attention was paid to trace metals, their speciation, roles, and cycles.  Major trends through the early part of next century will include large international interdisciplinary programs, modelling of climate and land/ocean interaction, and continued work on trace metals, all oriented to understanding global cycles and organic marine geochemistry.  The excitement for the researchers will come from the application of sharply focused individual skills in large scale programs designed to answer questions beyond the scope of small teams or institutions.  The 16 short papers, as well as related posters, mostly dealt with analytical techniques and localized studies, but some anticipated the keynote's prognostication by applying data from the major field programs of the last decades to assessments of water mass characteristics and changes, and longer term aspects of BGC cycles.  The session was basically process-oriented, and contained virtually no modelling.<P>

<B>3.3 Paleoceanography</B><BR>
The three papers in this session dealt with sedimentary deposits in areas around the United Kingdom.  There was no keynote speaker for this short session.<P>

<B>3.4 Surface Processes</B><BR>
Discussion of this session will be included in the Air-Sea Interaction session write-up.<P>

<B>3.5 The Deep Ocean</B><BR>
This set of 25 papers dealt primarily with physical oceanography of the oceans beyond the shelf break.  Two papers discussed the freshening of intermediate water in the Faroe-Shetland Channel; four reported on the use of chemical tracers; others discussed results of modelling and observations, both in-situ and remote.  Although there were some interpretive papers, interestingly there were very few on process, and little theory (we did miss one session in order to accommodate a visit to the University's Marine Institute).  Altogether the collection was quite eclectic, indicative both of the traditional wide scope of UK physical oceanography (PO) and of the meeting's emphasis on junior scientists presenting their results.  Harry Bryden's keynote on Variability in the Deep Ocean summarized recent results on basin scale trends in the North Atlantic and discussed several of the current hypotheses (e.g. heaving of T-S surfaces, sloshing of Mediterranean water, variations in ventilation and convection); Bryden made a compelling argument for resurvey in the last 18 months of the measurement phase of WOCE to improve our understanding of the significant basin scale changes.  Although this section was at least as well attended and populated as any of the others, the general impression is of scattered efforts rather than the focused programs, buoyed by EC support, that characterized sections on coasts, margins, and estuaries.  Indeed some concern was voiced during discussion about the UK's ability to maintain its traditional global perspective and strength in PO, given increased emphasis on the economic impact of research, the ever increasing role of Brussels in European science, and the conclusion of the sea going phase of WOCE.  The '98 meeting will likely see significantly fewer papers in this section as the focus shifts to the coastal zone, fisheries, health of the ocean, etc, where industry and research can generate wealth.<P>

<B>3.6 Shelf Seas</B><BR>
Shelf seas are those regions of the world's ocean that are bounded by land on more than one side.  Hence, they are sometimes called "Enclosed" or "Semi-Enclosed" or "Marginal" seas. As stated by the keynote speaker for this session, Prof. John Simpson, these seas have practical importance "   as sources of food, hydrocarbons, ......and (are) sinks for many of the waste products of the surrounding population..."  If properly understood, these seas can be a valuable resource.  If poorly understood their (mis)use can be catastrophic.  <P>

The papers in this session were a mix of physical, biological and sedimentary observations and models studies.  Both vertical and horizontal exchanges processes were described and modelled.  As might be expected at a UK conference, most of the focus was on such locally recognizable seas as the Celtic, Irish and North, although one paper described similar process in the Aegean.  Through a combination of UK and EU funding, a major data base has been collected about the various physical, biological, chemical and sedimentary processes active in these shelf seas.  A synthesis of these observations to elucidate common features of shelf seas was not apparent.<P>

<B>3.7 Estuaries</B><BR>
Estuaries are those regions of the coastal margin where rivers have a major influence.  During his keynote talk, Prof. Dyer gave an excellent overview of existing knowledge about estuaries.  He noted that most of our existing models are highly empirical.  The focus of his message was that estuaries are in change due largely to human activity. River damming is strongly effecting sediment deposits and global warming, although only raising sea level by 1-2%, may effect the tidal prism ( i.e. the difference between high and low tide) by as much as 10%.  Both of these effects bear careful monitoring and study over the next decade.<P>

This session began with two papers that showed how estuary research is evolving from empiricism to physical understanding.  The first showed how estuarine bathymetry responds to tidal amplitude at the mouth and river flow at the head.  The second showed how an empirical relationship of salinity distribution with distance from the estuary mouth could be interpreted in terms of river flow, tidal range and dispersion coefficient.  <P>

<B>3.8 Modelling Ocean Processes</B><BR>
In combination with the Ocean Modelling Special Group Meeting OMSGM), this topic occupied all of the last full day of the meeting. Unfortunately, this session did not include a keynote speaker to set the tone for the papers to follow.  Nevertheless, this session and the OMSGM showed how much insight can be obtained from the correct use of numerical models and the right combination of modelling and observation.  In particular, one paper used an isopycnal model to show how eddies decrease the mean flow.  Other papers dealt with the mechanics of numerical modelling from nesting through data assimilation to model comparison studies.  In the end, it must be remembered that numerical modelling is but one more tool in the box for ocean researchers to use.  It's effectiveness can only be maximized by careful integration with observations, theory and common sense.<P>

<B>3.9 Air-Sea Interaction and Surface Processes</B><BR>
Although separated at the conference, these two sessions have much in common and are treated together in this summary.  In his keynote address, Peter Liss chose to concentrate on gas exchange across the interface.  Much of his time was devoted to dimethylsulfide (DMS), whose evolution can be effected by such unexpected things as viruses and enhanced carbon dioxide uptake by iron.  He illustrated the complexity of this field by describing its four "inters", inter-disciplinary (physics, chemistry, biology), inter-reservoir (air and sea), inter-element (many trace gas compounds abound) and inter-national (a major topic of interest world-wide).<P>  

The remainder of the papers in this and it's companion surface processes session broke into either chemical or physical exchange.  The former covered the range from ozone, through acids to hydrocarbons and trace metals. Many of these exchanges display seasonal and/or diurnal cycles that relate to physical forcing.<P>  

The papers dealing with physical exchange covered both momentum and heat.  The former effects wave spectra through wind, while the latter effects large scale ocean and atmospheric dynamics.  The papers here identified a few important aspects of these exchanges but only scratched the surface of their full impact.<P>

<B>3.10 The Coastal Zone</B><BR>
Virtually all of the papers in the morning session of this section discussed procedures and results from the Holderness Experiment, which is part of the EC LOIS programme (LOIS was oriented to understanding the movement of sediment in estuaries), part of MAST.  Holderness was a major, three-year campaign (major field year 94-95 to study beach and offshore processes and develop models related to sediment movement.  The field experiment is now concluded, and as one of the speakers stated, now is the time to produce "tangible deliverables". From what we heard at the conference, this will not be easy. The afternoon session, after the keynote by Prof de Vriend of Twente University on "Marine Morphodynamic Modelling", had two papers on wave-bottom interaction, and an extremely interesting 3D time dependent model of longshore currents in the surf zone that we will attempt to follow-up on.  De Vriend's keynote was an interesting contrast to the individual presentations, using morphology as an integrating construct within which to apply and assess submodels at the variety of scales needed to understand and predict coastline and bedform behavior.  A major success of the morphodynamics approach, in addition to its contributions to the understanding of process and its effectiveness as a "looking glass" for deficiencies in submodels, is its ability to suggest where and how to (and not to) look for evidence of anthropogenic impact.<P>

<B>3.11 Biological Oceanography</B><HR>
Dr Mike Heath of the SOAEFD Marine Lab, Aberdeen, provided the keynote, focusing on zooplankton studies.  He highlighted the major contributions of Steele and Frost in relating temporal and spatial scales of physics and biology, leading to the concepts of the food web and global productivity studies. Biomass-based models however fail with zooplankton because of the large changes in body size and physiology over the life cycle. Understanding of speciation and life cycles is thus crucial to knowledge of population dynamics and productivity.  This was illustrated with differences between species of Calanus and Alexandrium.  Heath ended with concern for the loss of taxonomic skill and the need for simple molecular approaches as a substitute, given the importance of speciation.  The 8 short papers, as in the other sections, were a mixture of experimental and instrumentation studies.<P>

<B>3.12 The Buckland Lecture.  </B><BR>
Buckland was a natural historian, wildlife enthusiast and prolific writer who left funds to a Foundation that annually supports a professor to deliver three lectures.  This year's Buckland Professor, John S. Gray of the University of Oslo, spoke on "Protecting the Seas: Using Science for Better Environment".  Gray defended science against the claims of the Greens and other critics that science has failed, contending instead that the failure is that of managers and politicians to effectively use science.  The role of science in the decision process is decreasing; we have now even gone beyond the Precautionary Principle which ignores the balance of cost and benefit to where (in the context of the North Sea for example) the 96 Ministerial Conference at Esbjerg totally reversed the burden of proof, requiring demonstration that a substance will not lead to harm before it can be used. Gray demonstrated however, using examples from the North Sea, that scientific analysis has improved monitoring methodologies and impact assessments, and when applied in conjunction with open forum discussions with both Greens and industry has led to effective protective measures during development and operations.  He proposes modified wording top the precautionary principle to explicitly include a scientific basis for decisions, and extended efforts to develop public consensus through open discussions with all groups and new science-based approaches to looking at hard issues. <P>

<B>4.  Attendance</B><BR>
Based upon attendance alone, the leading centers of ocean science research in the UK are Southampton, Bangor, Norwich (University of East Anglia), Liverpool, Birkenhead (Proudman Marine Laboratory) and Plymouth, in that order.  Not coincidentally, with the addition Stirling, Scotland, these have been the locations of the past UK Oceanography conferences.  Attendees from other places such as Reading, Oxford, Cambridge and several places in Scotland were also present. Participation from outside the UK included attendees from Germany, France, Spain, Ireland, Greece, Portugal, Italy, Norway and Russia in Europe; India, Japan, Australia and New Zealand in Asia; and Canada in North America.  U.S. participation was limited to attendance by three members of the ONR Europe office and a couple of co-authors on papers presented by others.<P>

Based upon papers presented at specific sessions, with 20% of it's authors papers as a cutoff point, Southampton focuses most on coastal margins and the deep ocean, Bangor on shelf seas and the coastal zone, Norwich on the deep ocean and air-sea interaction, Liverpool on biological oceanography and air-sea interaction, Proudman on shelf seas, and Plymouth on estuaries.  Viewed another way, with 20% of the presented papers as the cutoff, coastal margins are studied more at Southampton and Bangor than elsewhere, surface/air-sea interaction at Norwich and Liverpool, the deep ocean at Norwich and Southampton, shelf seas at Bangor and Proudman, estuaries at Plymouth, and biological oceanography at Liverpool.  However, virtually all of the centers had at least one paper in every session and virtually every session had papers by all of the centers.  Ten papers were presented by authors from outside the UK, mostly from mainland Europe.  The conference vividly demonstrated the growth of euro-centrism and European Community focus of UK oceanography.<P>

<B>5.  Assessment</B><BR>
Based upon the large number of attendees, many being students and postdocs, and the varied distribution of topics presented, UK OCEANOGRAPHY '96 indicated a healthy and vigorous ocean science research community in the United Kingdom.  Like similar communities elsewhere, UK oceanographers are worried about funding, ships, employment for newcomers, and many other things, but most felt optimistic about the future. <P>

The emergence of the European Union as a major source of funding support has drawn the UK oceanography community closer to their colleagues in Europe.  This support, along with that from within the UK itself has led to many field campaigns whose success has generated a wealth of data about individual areas and processes.  In many case these areas and processes bear striking resemblance to similar ones studied by ocean scientists in the U.S. (and probably elsewhere as well).  Unfortunately little reference was made to this similar work. Since the work of many young UK scientists has its funding roots and data sources from EC programs such as Marine Science and Technology (MAST), it will likely their work will be less known outside EU circles.  We may find the next generation of UK scientists somewhat removed from close associations with US scientists that the current generation has known.<P>

The most important payoff from all of the exciting ocean science activity displayed at this conference will be the synthesis of individual observations into a collective understanding of process world-wide (or at least UK-wide).  Not everything is the same in different areas, but similarities and differences must be identified for real progress to be made.  That identification has yet to be made.<P>

<B>1.  Summary</B><BR>
A research group in the Department of Computer and Electrical Engineering at Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh is developing a method of signal processing based on statistical and fractal mathematics.  In several applications involving real world data sets containing signals embedded in noisy, textured backgrounds (e.g., sidescan sonar and mammography imagery), they have shown their method can significantly enhance the ability to detect desired signals.  Including a priori information in the processing can further improve results.  They are also investigating methods which can reduce misinterpretation of the output signal caused by instability in sensors.  Incorporating other measurable parameters about the sensor can reduce misleading distortion effects in the output.<P>

The group showed examples of successfully segmenting  imagery containing multiple texture classes (mud, gravel, sand, etc).  They were able to faithfully reproduce texture patterns using a method based on fractals.  Taking advantage of the fact textured backgrounds usually have little or no important information in an image data set, this groups method has great potential for applications where low bandwidth communication (e.g. AUV link to a survey ship) or limited storage is a concern.  Fractal reconstruction of textured backgrounds can reproduce useful realistic (though not identical) imagery at a fraction of the data requirement of pixel-for-pixel reproductions.<P>

Signal processing techniques are often tuned to the specific equipment and environment being investigated.  Investigators in this field may find this a fresh approach in applications where large data sets with textured backgrounds are involved such as remote sensing, ice classification, mine detection, seabed mapping, SAR data sets, etc.  Their demonstrated success using real world applications is a tribute to the robustness of their approach.  It may be worth having a sample data set examined by this group.<P>

<B>2.  General Information</B><BR>
At Heriot-Watt University in Scotland, a research group within the Department of Computing and Electrical Engineering is involved with developing a method of signal processing that applies statistical and fractal techniques.  Dr Laurie Linnett, the groups leader, and Dr Stuart Clarke recently briefed the ONR Europe oceanography staff  on their work, demonstrating some impressive results using real world data.  Their technique has potential applications in a number of areas where weak signals are to be extracted against noisy backgrounds. They not only successfully extracted the signal from real world data, but also demonstrated cases where human senses could not have detected the signal or would be misled by the noise in the data.  To provide us with a better understanding of their work, Dr Linnett arranged for a day long demonstration of the groups work at Heriot-Watt where we were able to spend some time with the team members discussing their specific area.  The group was very gracious and provided us with some very interesting insight on what seems to be a very powerful signal processing technique with extensive applications.   <P>

<B>3.  Facilities</B><BR>
Heriot-Watt University is one of UKs leading researched-based technological universities with a heavy orientation toward natural science and engineering.  Its roots go back some 175 years to the Edinburgh School of Arts, one of the countrys first "mechanics institutes".  First the Watt Institute, then Heriot-Watt College in 1885, it was granted its Royal Charter in 1966.  Previously located in the historic Grassmarket section of "old town" Edinburgh, it completed a 20 year phased move in the early 1990s to a 380 acre park in Riccarton, a few miles west of the city.  There are some 4500 students there, about 15% come from outside the UK.  There are about 900 postgraduate students, 320 academic staff and 450 contract researchers, technicians and other support staff.  The campus includes a 90 acre Research Park started in 1971, the first of its kind in Europe.  Its purpose is to  have R&D-based enterprises located in conditions favorable to long term interaction with the university to foster research based activity and technology transfer.  The park is wholly owned by the university with two phases completed and occupied, and a third phase with all infrastructure in place.<P>

Heroit-Watt has an annual income of $90million, with just less than 50% coming from the Scottish Higher Education Funding Council, about 30% from research grants, contracts and consultancy and the remainder from investment, residential services and other general sources.  The university is reputed for its effective problem solving services for business and industry and has had major opportunities presented by the shift in orientation towards technology research in the UK.<P>

The Department of Computer and Electrical Engineering has about 50 academic staff supported by research staff, postgraduate students and technicians.  The department is involved in a wide variety of research areas including communications systems, networks, sonar systems, ocean systems, image processing, intelligence systems, microwave systems, computer vision and a host of others areas.  During our visit, we spent almost all of our time with Dr Linnetts group in their laboratory, which was a modern and spacious work area in the departments 7000 square meter facility. <P>

<B>4.  Specific Interest Items</B><BR>
Dr Linnetts group demonstrated a number of real world applications in which they have successfully applied statistical and fractal methods to separate signal from noise in very large data sets.  Their methods adapt well to remote sensing  applications such as detecting objects on the sea floor with sidescan sonar, detection of breast microcalcification clusters and masses in digital mammography and edge detection between various textures such as mud, sand and gravel on the sea floor.  In related work, a model is being developed to produce sidescan sonar imagery as output.  This technique provides direct visualization of distortion effects and ambiguity which result in sensor output due to instability of the instrument and lack of incorporating other important measurable parameters such as pitch, roll, ambient temperature, etc.  The distorted output can mislead operators when interpreting an image, an effect analogous to seeing distorted reflections in mirrors at an amusement parks fun house.    <P>

In texture classification and object detection against a highly textured background, it is useful to find a technique which removes subjectivity introduced by manual human interpretation.  The problem is approached by first objectively segmenting the image into areas of various background textures and then locating the object(s) as disturbances against the background.  Fractal dimensions are measured to an adequate degree in multiple directions to use for segmentation without becoming a computational nightmare.  The mathematical basis of this technique can be found in published works coauthored by Dr Linnett and members of his group.  Two techniques can then be used to analyze the data, supervised and unsupervised pattern recognition.  In the supervised method, a priori information about the statistical nature of the texture in incorporated into the segmentation scheme.  This is accomplished by observing "training areas" within the original image where the observer uses representative sections of the image from which the statistics are determined.  This requires some subjective human input in the solution such as determining the number of different textures in the image and picking the representative training areas.  From that, membership in each class is determined on each pixel and the texture boundaries are determined.  In unsupervised  classification, the idea is to automate the entire process so that large volumes of data can be handled and human subjectivity is removed to provide more consistent results.  This is accomplished by applying a "principal components" analysis in which most of the variance which distinguishes the different textures is contained in the first few principal components of the statistics.  The data points fall into unique clusters associated with each texture from which a set of samples from each cluster can be used to construct training areas for each class of texture.  An important characteristic of texture segmentation using the fractal technique is that different samples of the same texture look virtually identical visually, though they would match poorly in a pixel for pixel comparison.  Where a limited bandwidth communications link is involved (e.g. an AUV transmitting data to a survey ship via acoustic link), or compact storage and easy access is desired, the boundaries of the areas and a visual impression of each texture may suffice.  If so, only boundary information, the abnormality (object) information and a set of reconstruction parameters for the textured background are needed to build a realistic (though not identical) image.  This reduces the data package size by as much as a hundredfold compared to a pixel for pixel reproduction.  Though this is not true data compression, it is an effective way of compactly handling the essential data.  The technique works well for busy, highly textured imagery where just a bits of significant information is contained in the background (as opposed to a "head and shoulder" portrait where details throughout the image are important).  The results are quite impressive, particularly in the fact that the technique could be applied to such a wide variety of other areas such as ice classification, satellite imagery, SAR and radar data, to name a few.  In some cases, they had little or no prior hint as to the source the data and we able to extracted signals which even surprised the suppliers of the data.<P>

A fairly new area of their work is their effort in realistically representing motion in data sets.  For example, where sand ripples on the sea floor are fixed, swell or wind waves on the ocean surface involve motion.  Dr Linnetts group is tackling this from a phase shift perspective.  An image, whether it involves a fixed or moving subject, contains phase and magnitude information.  The image can be accurately reconstructed by taking a Fourier transform, then taking the inverse transform.  It appears from their work the most important information that characterizes the image (fixed or moving) is contained in the phase information, however research has been focused on manipulation of magnitude because it is less complex to work with.  Their focus on phase shows promise for signal processing applications such as SAR and radar data sets.    <P>

<B>5.  Comments.</B><BR>
The success Dr Linnetts group has had using real world data sets is a tribute to the robustness of their approach.  Because it is based on the mathematical properties (probability functions, distributions, fractals, etc) of large data sets containing extensive textured areas, the applications are more universal than some other techniques.  Their method can extract signals without knowing the source of the data.  However if a priori knowledge is available, it can often be incorporated to further enhance the results.<P>

Admittedly, the world of fractals and the statistical methods employed are not my area of expertise and I hope I have accurately represented the groups effort in this report.  The results are nonetheless very impressive, showing significant enhancement of imagery which objectively aids interpretation of sensor output, reduces calculation requirements for online use, maximizes the efficiency of weak/slow transmission links and reduces data storage requirements.<P>

The motivation for the work done by Dr Linnetts group is an outgrowth of  the research pattern found throughout the UK today - the goal is to generate wealth (i.e. make a profit or generally improve the quality of life) for the country.  Their association with the Defence Research Agency (DRA) in much of this work is a good example of how the system works.  An agency such as the Ministry of Defence (MoD) has requirements which DRA tries to resolve.  DRA finds a research group such as Dr Linnetts group to tackle the science and technology aspects.  DRA markets the research technique so the commercial/industrial sector can build a system which is sold, in turn, to MoD as well as having a commercial market.  All players gain in this scenario - well, at least thats the theory.<P>

Because the research is driven by a sellable product in mind, there may be other markets for the product, too.  As noted previously, this particular work appears to have potential in a number of remote sensing applications which may also be of Navy interest (i.e. mine detection, ice classification and mapping, SAR, seabed mapping, etc.).  The group is  hard charging and very open to finding new applications for their methods.  Those involved with signal processing may find this a fresh approach to extracting information from large data bases.<P>

<B>1.  Summary</B><BR>
 <B>The 10th International Research Ship Operators Meeting (ISOM)</B> was held on <B>2 - 3 October, 1996</B> at the <B>Southampton Oceanography Centre</B>.  As the name implies, this is an annual meeting of the day-to-day operators of oceanographic research ships.  The purpose is to compare notes and share experiences.  There were approximately 25 attendees from 11 countries worldwide in attendance.  The agenda for this years meeting included the regular reports by each ship operator on their activities for the year, followed by discussions on insurance, autosubs, performance indicators, database and planning, Marine Technicians Workshop, ISM code, manning and budgets, vessel and personnel clearences, scientific diving, and deep CTD deployments.  The meeting adjourned with agreement to hold the 1997 meeting around the same time of year, in Spain (probably Barcelona).<P>
 
 Highlights include the following:<BR>
a)  Although the U.S. has the largest number of oceanographic research vessels, many other countries have excellent facilities, and there are a lot of them available.<BR>
b)  There is an increasing use of other countries vessels as part of a "bartering" system,<BR>
c)  All countries share common concerns for budgets, manning and capacity,<P>
 
<B>2.  Activities</B><BR>
<B>Belgium</B> - Belgium has one ship, the "Belgica",  that had a routine operating year with no lost equipment.<BR>
<B>Chile</B> - Chile has four ships, two primarily for general oceanography and two primarily for fisheries.  The main foci of their activities this year were "red and brown tide" research and JGOFS.<BR>
<B>Finland</B> - Finland has one ship, "Armanda" (Flower of the Sea), whose main cruises this year were in conjunction with a Finland-Norway-Sweden survey.  Its major upgrade this year was to improve noise isolation in the laboratories and engine room, at a cost of approximately $1.2M over 3 three years.  Main activities for next year will be a Denmark Strait criuse.<BR>
<B>France</B> - France has six major oceanographic research vessels, operating under a total budget of approximately 150FF (~$30M)/yr.  Their major news of last year was the introduction of their newest vessel, the Nadir.  They are major participants in a three cornered bartering agreement with Germany and England.  <BR>
<B>Germany</B> - Germany has three large oceanographic research ships, and two medium ones.  They are managed by a private contractor.  They made no changes this year.  However, their operation is under review by their federal minsitry of research and they expect to reduce their total inventory by one of the medium size vessels.   "Money is getting scarce" in Germany for all research activities, including ship operation.<BR>
	<B>Japan</B> - Japan has five ships in their inventory.  Three are operated by a private contractor and the other two, that serve as parent ships for their two submersibles and two RPVs, by JAMSTEC.  They are presently refurbishing a previously nuclear ship, that will be the worlds oceanographic research vessel when it is completed in 1996.  This new ship will be called the "Mirai", Japanese for "Future".  <BR>
	<B>Netherlands</B> - The Dutch have one research vessel whose activity is all coastal, in the Nordic Seas /continental shelf.  They lost one mooring in the Biscayne bay, which they never recovered.  <BR>
<B>South Africa</B> - The representitive from South Africa expressed serious concern for the operation of his one vessel ("Afrikaner"), because of decreasing usage.  90% of the cost of the ~$12M ship operation is tied up in salaries.  He is willing to charter his ship simply for the cost of the fuel.  This year his fleet was invcreased by nine smal fishing vessels, for which he has few customers.  Most of the activities of the South African oceanographic fleet is for fisheries research.<BR>
		<B>Spain</B> -  Spain has one oceanographic research vessel that employs thirteen people.  They did 13 cruises last year to such far away places as Antartic, Chile and California. Last year they lost five physical oceanographic moorings due to no response from their (single) acoustic releases.  The discussion that followed concluded that the releases responded to the acoustic signal but jammed before opening.  <BR>
	<B>United Kingdom</B> - The UK has three main ship operators, British Antartic Survey, Scotland Fisheries and NERC.  The BAS has one ship, the "Ross", that is under active deployment from October through May (Antarctic summer).  This deployment accommodated scientists from Japan, U.S. (NASA) as well as Plymouth Marine Laboratory in UK this year.  Their main concern was in replacing the 25 year old ship and with recurring traction winch problems. <BR>  
		Scotland operates two vessels under private contract since 1991.  A new vessels is being procured.  <BR>
		NERC operates 3 oceanographic research vessels, "Discover", "Darwin", and Challenger", out of their Research vessel Support branch of the Southampton Oceanography Centre.  The big news from NERC is the ongoing select panel review of requirements for research vessels over the next ten years, that is expected to be completed in February 1997. <BR>
	<B>United States</B> - The U.S. operates 28 oceanographic research vessels under UNOLS.  These are all at research centers around the country.  The primary news from there was the possibility of adding another vessel, probably a swath design.  Funding for this is under consideration by the U.S. Congress.<P>
 
<B>3.  Other Sessions<BR>
3.1  Insurance</B><BR>
Due the increasing occurrence of bartering ( foreign nationals on host country ships), liability insurance must be seriously considered.  Countries have differing liability laws.  Presently, every operator uses their own carrier, with no group rate possible.  At an earlier ISOM meeting, it had been agreed that large ships should carry $25M liability insurance, and smaller ones $15M.  A candidate group liability plan was circulated among the attendees.  A copy can be obtained from Professor Nixon of the University of Rhode Island, the ISOM leader in this arena.<P>

<B>3.2  Legal Liabilities for Autosubs</B><BR>
This session started with a 5 minute video of Autosub tests.  Autosub is a major NERC undertaking to develop a vessel that will navigate far and wide collecting whatever oceanographic data it has sensors for.  These range from the standard CTD information to more mission specific ones.  
For this meeting, the discussion centered on the legal responsibilities of such vessels.  They are not covered by normal laws relating to dispensing material into the sea, since they move under their own power.  Yet, they are not manned ships.  New ground could be broken in this arena.  After a half hour of discussion, little conclusions were reached other than we had best continue thinking about the problem.<P>

<B>3.3  Performance Indicators</B><BR>
	In these days of shrinking budgets, every organization must defend its performance.  Ship operators are no exception.  This discussion centered on meaningful performance indicators.  For now the standard ones are Days at Sea, Days on Station, Equipment efficiency (including lost equipment), and "Data Quality".  All have their deficiencies, but no better ones were introduced.  <BR>
	An interesting sidelight to this discussion was as description my the MAST representative of how they measure proposer performance.  To nobodys surprise, they count open literature papers.  However, they only credit the first paper in a series that all use the same data.  <BR>
	The NSF representative mentioned that they were abandoning the standard measures and going for one that indicated the ability of the performer to live up to cost and performance estimates in the proposal.  For example, the ability to keep costs within 5% of the estimate, amount of unscheduled down time on equipment.  <P>

<B>3.4  Oceanic Data Base</B><BR>
	There is an extensive data base of all ship operators on the homepage of the University of Delaware.  The address is "<A HREF="http://www.cms.udel.edu">http://www.cms.udel.edu</A>".  Details on each countrys ships statistics and schedule are posted and kept up to date by the individual ship operator.  <P>

<B>3.5  International Marine Technology Workshop</B><BR>
	The 9th ISOM identified a need for such a workshop.  Under the sponsorship of MAST, the first IMTW was held at SOC on 30 September - 2 October 1996.  There were approximately 50 attendees.  Three topics were discussed, Mooring Technology, Standards and Calibrations, and Fishing Technology.  The format called for each session (day) to start with a scientist describing the need and a technologist describing current capability.  Following these introductory presentation were descriptions of specific programs and much open discussion among the attendees.  Plans are underway to held another IMTW in conjunction with the next ISOM in 1997.<P>

<B>3.6  ISM Code</B><BR>
	By 2002, all oceanographic research vessels will have to live under this code.  Presently it is optional.  The only operator at this meeting who was presently certified under it is Capt. Kay of the Scottish Fisheries.  The Scottish Fisheries representative offered Capt. Kays help in getting certified.  The procedure seemed simple, but probably bureaucratic.  <P>

<B>3.7  Deep CTDs</B><BR>
	Deep CTD casts offer a challenge to present winches as they put stress beyond present standards on the cables.  Most operators are willing to extend the standards for those few times when deep CTDs are needed, with few, if any, recorded losses of equipment due to cable failure.  The more serious problem is cable stretching short of actual breaking.  If a cable stretches, its ability to transmit data decreases, thereby jeopardising ship operations during the remainder of the cruise.  <P>

<B>3.8  Next ISOM</B><BR>
	It was agreed that there should be an 11th ISOM.  The representative from Spain offered to be the host.  His offer was accepted, with the tentative dates of 2-3 October 1997 reserved.  <P>

<B>4.  Attendance</B><BR>
	The 10th ISOM was attended by representatives from the following countries:  Belgium, Chile, Finland, France, Germany, Japan, Netherlands, South Africa, Spain, UK (Three organizations including Scotland), and US (NSF and ONREUR)., as well as representatives from The European Community (EC) and OCEANIC (U Delaware).  There were a total of 25 attendees.  Other members of ISOM who were unable to attend this meeting are Australia, Canada, and Korea.  The full description of ISOM, including a list of members with full addresses is available on the WWW under "<A HREF="http://www.cms.udel.edu/ships/isom/">http://www.cms.udel.edu/ships/isom/</A>".  <P>

<B>5.  Assessment</B><BR>
	ISOM is a worthwhile annual meeting that allows oceanographic ship operators to compare notes.  Its duration of 1-2 days is correct.  Most of the attendees are actual ship operators.  The only funding agencies are a representative from EC and NSF.  The latter include ONR interests.  ONR representation is not necessary but would be worthwhile in the future to meet the international participants in the oceanographic research ship operation business.  <P>

<B>1.  Summary</B><BR>
 An international symposium on "New Challenges for North Sea Research" was held on 21 -23 October 1996 in Hamburg, Germany. Hosted by the Zentrum fur Meeres- und Klimaforschung, Universitat Hamburg, the symposium was both a retrospective look over twenty years of North Sea research since the Fladenground Experiment (FLEX 76), and a prospective view into the future.  Approximately 150 scientists, primarily from countries surrounding the North Sea, were in attendance.  The large attendance, right up to the very last session, for such a focused meeting is  testimony to the importance that northern Europe attaches to the North Sea.  Attendees were rewarded with excellent papers, well organized into cohesive sessions, with adequate time for presentation and discussion.  The retrospective look showed that we understand quite a lot about the boundary forcing (from air, land via river runoff, and surrounding water from the Atlantic Ocean and Baltic Sea) and the resulting circulation and are beginning to gain insight into the resulting biogeochemical structure of this semi-enclosed sea that is so important to northern Europe.  The prospective view called for research on space and time scale (e.g. coastal response to global warming) and disciplinary processes (e.g. bio-physical, air-sea) interaction and a series of specific process studies as opposed to one major experiment.<BR>
 Highlights include the following:<BR>
a)  Industrialized countries surrounding  the North Sea (e.g. UK and Germany) have considerably reduced the nutrient (nitrogen and phosphates) content of their river runoff,  <BR>
b)  Atmospheric particle deposition contributes four times as much nutrient loading than does river input;<BR>
c)  Most of the water entering the North Sea gets circulated around the coasts and exits through the Norwegian Current, leaving only very small (and hard to detect) changes in the large interior bulk;<BR> 
d)  Individual species play critical roles in North Sea ecological dynamics;<BR>
e)  The Skagarrak (Channel connecting Baltic and North seas) and the Norwegian Trench are the final resting places for most of the sediments entering the North Sea; and<BR>
f)  North Sea morphodynamics are 3-dimentsional.<P>
 
<B>2.  Introduction</B><BR>
 Surrounded by Scotland and England to the west, Belgium, Netherlands and Germany to the south, and Denmark and Norway to the east, the North Sea covers an area of approximately 400,000 square kilometers (~160,000 square miles).  This is approximately half the size of the Eastern Mediterranean, 1/3 that of the Gulf of Mexico or the Sea of Okhotsk and about equal to Red and Black Seas. Its average depth of approximately 100 meters ( ~300 ft), is comparable to the three times larger Hudson and the half as large Persian Gulf. Its major inflow is from the North Atlantic, with secondary connections to the Atlantic through the Dover Strait and to the Baltic sea through the Skagerrak.  Strategically located among nations with rich maritime histories and advanced technologies, the North Sea has long been the focus of scientific research.  Its shallow depth and heavy riverine drainage has made its future health the focus of concern for the past two decades that started with the Fladenground Experiment, FLEX 76.<BR>
 Chairman Heinrich Hoeber of Meteorologisches Institut, ZMK, Universitat Hamburg called this symposium to take stock of the present state of understanding of the oceanography of the North Sea (20 years after FLEX 76) and to contemplate the future. The venue was the Kathologiche Akadamie in Hamburg, whose facilities were well suited for the approximately 150 attendees.  These included an excellent spectrum of both junior and senior researchers, virtually all from countries surrounding the North Sea.  The symposium format, again well suited to the task, had each session starting with a keynote speaker (30 minutes), followed by two or three oral presentations (20 minutes each)  and posters near the coffee break area.  The final session (approximately 90 minutes) was devoted to a discussion of where to go next led by the symposium chair and his keynote speakers, with active participation from the audience.<P>
 
<B>3.  Sessions</B><BR>
 <B>3.1 External Forcing</B> - The first day was devoted to external forcing of the North sea by, in turn, the atmosphere, the North Atlantic, the Baltic, and rivers (called "the land").  <BR>
 3.11  Atmospheric forcing is both chemical (wet and dry particle deposition) and dynamic (heat and momentum transfer across the air-sea interface). Particle deposition contributes over four times the nitrate input to the North Sea as does river runoff. (Ed note: This is probably because particles come from everywhere, whereas river runoff comes only from a few specific estuaries.) There is only a small seasonal cycle and, at best, a very small annual trend (with much variance) in this input, making long time records mandatory for valid conclusions about the long term. Observation and models of trace metal and nitrogen input to the Sea are well in hand, but toxic organics remain a mystery.  The impact of these toxics on the health of the Sea is not known.  <BR>
Heat and momentum flux depend heavily on surface drag induced by waves.  This surface stress often varies with the angle between the wind and waves and is usually spatially inhomogeneous.  Long time records depend heavily on stable towers, whose existence in the North Sea is seriously threatened.<BR>
 3.12 The North Atlantic is the single largest input into the North Sea.  Most of the flow, 1.7Sv (approximately 3% of that carried by the Gulf Stream), comes in east of Shetland Island.  Another 0.1Sv, small but critically important, comes in through the Dover Strait.  Tidal forcing confines most of this flow to the coasts off Scotland, England (on the west), Belgium, Netherlands and Germany (to the south), Denmark and Norway (to the east), and out through the Norwegian Current, with a little exchanging with the Baltic Sea, through the Skagerrak.  Possible long term change in this flow due to global warming is quite uncertain.  Although there is not much interannual variability in temperature and salinity flux into the Sea, there is considerable SST change, but no trends.  There is an 8 year periodicity in the flux and SST data.  Combined physical and biological sampling has been going on across the Norwegian Trench since 1983, showing the standard spring bloom of phytoplankton, followed by a rise in zooplankton.
 3.13 Exchange with the Baltic Sea occurs with saline outflow of about 0.8Sv around the north Jutland (Denmark) coast and fresh water inflow through the Skagerrak.  This causes a sharp SST front with many meanders and eddies.  Models show the meanders to be about 50 - 100 Km, last 25 days.  The eddies are 50M deep, typically detach in 6 hours and last for 1-5 days as they travel to the west.  Although the overall statistics seem consistent with the few satellite SST observations taken in the area, the models need far more validation before  taken as fact. The role of the Baltic in North Sea circulation is largely unknown.  Nobody was willing to speculate how the North Atlantic inflow would be changed if the Baltic was cut off from the North Sea.  One hypothesis might be that tidal currents would still drive flow around Shetland Island and the total flow would remain largely unchanged.  The alternate suggests it is the fresh water inflow from the Baltic that drives of the whole North Sea circulation and that without it, the North Atlantic would simply lose connection with the North Sea altogether.  
 3.14 River inflow provides the final input to the North Sea.  Over the past two decades there has been a clear reduction in nutrients and heavy metals from the rivers of the heavily Industrialized nations surrounding the North Sea.  The impact of that on the overall health of the Sea is not as clear as much of the river flow simply hugs the coast and eventually exits out along the Norwegian Current.  The greatest impact of river cleanup may be to improve conditions off your neighbors coast (England to Germany, Germany to Denmark, etc.).  The Huber Estuary is an example of an English outflow.  A key finding here is that up to 70% of the trace metal flux out of the Huber occurs in just two months, highlighting the intermittent nature of such fluxes.  In contrast to the heavy metal focus of the Huber outflow, food web dynamics is the focus of studies of the Elbe River Estuary.  At the end of the food chain, the protozooplanton biomass grew to 40 micrograms/litre. <BR>
<B>3.2 Internal Dynamics</B> - The second day, dealt with internal dynamics.  This included fronts
& eddies, biological oceanography, long tern variability, benthic process, and (in the early morning of the third day), coastal morphology.<BR>
3.21 Stratification, Fronts and mesoscale features.  Although the primary circulation of the
North Sea is tidally driven, with some component due to winds, heating and stirring are critical process controlling the hydrography of the North sea.  The doubling of the tidal currents from neap to spring can result in an eight-fold increase in mixing.  Since much of the internal part of the sea is homogenous, 1-dimensional models are used extensively to account for vertical exchange. In a comparison between TKE and Mellor-Yamada 2.5 closures in 1D formulations, both models were similar in their underestimate of total mixing when compared to observations. Unfortunately, along coastal regions, where much of the North Sea countrys main interests lie advection cannot be ignored and 3-dimentional models must be used.  When comparing 1 and 3-dimentioal formulations of another turbulence closure scheme, advection was found to be of first order importance.  
A 15 month data set between August 1988 and October 1989 showed seasonal variability is the dominant signal in the southern North Sea, with as much as a 6 degree change in SST, but a much smaller change in salinity.  This period was characterized by below average rainfall through most of England and Germany (primary catchment basins for the Southern North Sea) but above average in Scotland.  The resulting salinity showed above average off England (downstream of Scotland) and below average in the German Bight (downstream of England and Germany).  
 3.22 Biological evolution is one of the most compelling reasons for northern European interest in the North Sea. In an excellent keynote paper for this session, Mike Heath traced early understanding of biological-physical interaction to Steeles work in the 1960s. This led to food web models that linked various components of the biologics.  For twenty years, this simple model has been used to describe the spring bloom, but usually with too rapid a rise in total mass.  It is now clear that the model must include more than one zooplankton size to more correctly slow the rise.  This illustrates the need to understand particular species, rather than total biomass.  This was further illustrated by an analysis of a particular species of Callanus who take a whole year for recruitment.  Hence, their bloom is more correctly related to the previous years chlorophyll production than to the current year.  This is in stark contrast to other, very similar appearing but genetically different Callanus species who follow the more familiar spring bloom cycle.  Sorting out different species and, hence different bloom evolution presents a major challenge to fisheries interests in the North Sea.
 The complicated nature of biological evolution was the topic of the remaining papers in this excellent session.  From England, through the German Bight, to coastal Denmark, simple bloom dynamics is not able to explain observed biomass collections.  Strong horizontal gradients shortly offshore complicate the picture even more.  <BR>
 3.22 Interannual and decadal variability papers focused on how sudden major changes in a wide variety of different animal life in the North Sea can occur. The observed doubling of algal biomass in the Wadden Sea between 1976 and 1978 was an example that drew much attention.  However, most other long term records showed similar episodic changes that relate to a complicated mix of bio-physical interaction.<BR>
3.23  Benthic processes are dominated by a sequence of deposition and resuspension that
ultimately results in deposition rates of greater than 1 cm/year off Southern Norway.  This sequence of deposition and resuspension makes it very difficult to sort out local from long distance benthic sources, both organic and inorganic.  One major conclusion of the Benthics Links and Sinks (BELS) project in August and February 1992 was that the Southern Norway deposition zone does not provide an area of high microbial and geochemical turnover because materials deposited there have travelled a long distance.  Hence, they are aged and largely refractory.<BR>
      3.24  Morphological evolution was the last session on internal dynamics.  Here the attention was directed to very local responses.  The keynote address showed examples of how common are beaches with clearly three dimensional structures.  The only way to forecast these structure will be to develop models that combine the best features of existing three dimensional current, wave and tidal models.  <BR>
	The importance of sediment size in understanding and predicting beach evolution was underscored in the papers that followed. For example, in the backbarrier tidal flats of the Wadden Sea, sandy sediments (grain sizes >0.063 mm) are controlled largely by hydrodynamics of current and wave forcing.  Muddy sediments (<0.063), on the other hand, respond to both hydrodynamic and biogenic processes. <BR>
	<B>3.3 The Future</B>- The final day of the symposium centered on new observing  and modelling  techniques and culminated with a lively discussion of where to go in the future.<BR>
3.31  New observational techniques are often the engines for new advances in understanding.<BR>
The FLEX 76 experiment focused on vertical exchanges in the central North Sea.  It used what would now be considered a full array of "standard" observing platforms, including ships (15 in number), aircraft, drifting buoys, etc.  Although the original hypothesis of horizontal homogeneity was proven incorrect, FLEX 76 was a success.  It is now time to contemplate new observing systems. Three interesting ones that were described involved 1) use of seabirds as instrumentation platforms, 2) optical spectrometry, and 3) microstructure profiling.  <BR>
	Seabirds are attractive instrumentation platforms because their natural accumulation zones reflect physical forcing and simple sensors can be mounted on their feet.  In particular, albatrosses were shown to be able to obtain SST patterns that would be hidden from satellite remote sensing because of cloud cover.  It was suggested that penguins could provide some vertical depth.  <BR>
	The shallow depth of much of the interesting parts of the North Sea allows optical remote sensing to be of use in mapping the spatial distribution of sediment types and phytobenthic biomass.  <BR>
Ratios between different windows of a 12 channel spectrometer can differentiate between sediments and phytobenthics. <BR>
	Although advection is a first order process in much of the coastal North Sea, vertical exchange processes are also important there and are the primary agents for change in the interior.  This led to the primary focus of FLEX 76 being on vertical exchange processes.  This, in turn, turned much attention understanding turbulence.  Finally, that attention has led to the development of a (temperature and conductivity) microstructure profiler.  One meter long, with a fall velocity of  0.3 to 10 M/sec, this device is similar to ones in the U.S.  With, however, with one key difference, the ability to operate in a rising mode, thereby getting turbulence data right up to the surface. Cable vibration, the bane of moored turbulence platforms is overcome by use of a buoyant float between the mooring anchor and the instrument to absorb cable vibration.  Operated thusly, the MST can measure dissipation rates down to 10 exp-11 w/kg.<BR>
	3.32  Just as instrumentation has evolved considerably since FLEX 76 so has modelling.  The 1 and 2-dimensional models that reigned supreme in the 1970s are now being replaced by 3-dimentionsional ones with ever increasing process sophistication and resolution. For dynamics, the German Weather Service has been running an operational North Sea prediction model that is forced by wind, waves and tides, since the 1980s.  Closer to shore, a group in Hamburg has been experimenting with a high resolution 3-dimensional coastal model in the Wadden Sea whose verification statistics look encouraging. Overall, physical modelling of the North Sea is quite mature.<BR>
	The more challenging modelling problem involves linking physics with biology.  Here, the range of sophistication is broad.  One extreme  has very complicated ecosystem simulation but with the low resolution of a box model (called ERSEM).  The other extreme has simpler ecosystem dynamics in a fully three dimensional formulation (called ECOHAMI).  Between the two is a 1 dimensional formulation that have very high vertical resolution thereby resolving vertical exchange processes.  In a rare model comparison, it was shown that, although some times one or the other does better (and not always the same one), most of the time there is little to chose between them. It is more a matter of using whichever one better serves the problem you are trying to understand. <P>

<B>4.  Assessment</B><BR>
	Because of its strategic location among technically advanced countries, and its reasonably simple circulation structure, the North Sea is probably one of the worlds most heavily studied, and possibly best understood, semi-enclosed seas.  The final session of this symposium summarized where we stand and where to go next.  Rising out of a discussion that raised many, many issues, two recurring themes developed, interaction and processes.<BR>
	Many of the attendees were comfortable with our broad understanding of North Sea process on any one space or time scale, and with our knowledge of how individual processes evolve. However, the interaction between different time and space scales of similar processes or the interaction between different processes, even on the same scales, was thought to be very poorly understood.  Of all of these, the strongest call was for more study into the bio-physical interactions that abound in the North Sea.<BR>
	Although most attendees were comfortable with our first order process understanding, they were uncomfortable with the depth of that understanding.  It is one thing to describe the overall circulation of the North Sea, but very much another to understand the eddy and/or turbulence evolution.  Similarly, it is one thing to describe the broad evolution from nutrients to zooplankton, but very much another to differentiate between species. The second significant theme of this summary session, then, was to focus future work on deeper understanding of individual process by doing many individual, small, process experiments, rather than one single grand one.   <BR>
	Finally, and possibly of interest to readers outside Northern Europe was the issue of transportability.  Here the feeling was divided.  Some thought the next step in the service to society was to try to apply our understanding of North Sea process to other areas.  Others thought so much still needed to be done in the North Sea itself, that all attention should remain there.  <P>

<B>1.  Summary (compiled by LCDR Joseph)</B><BR>
A Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) led international scientific team consisting of U.S., Russian, and Norwegian scientists spent a month on a Russian vessel, the Professor Logachev, this last summer carrying out geological and geophysical research in the Greenland-Norwegian Sea. This joint oceanographic expedition was funded by NRL, the National Science Foundation, and the Russian Academy of Sciences, with additional support from the Office of Naval Research and Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory.  Professor Logachev is operated by the Polar Marine Geosurvey Expedition headquartered near St. Petersburg.  The ninety participants included scientists from the VNIIokeangeologia Institute, Institute of Microbiology of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Vernadsky Institute of Geochemistry and Analytical Chemistry, Shirshov Institute of Oceanology, University of Oslo, University of Bergen,  NRL, Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, George Washington University, Maryland Geological Survey and MIT.<P>

One major objective of the cruise was to return to a Norwegian Sea mud volcano site to conduct extensive surveys and analyses as a follow-up to an investigation initiated by scientists on a joint NRL/Norwegian cruise in August, 1995 aboard the Haakon Mosby.  Unique temperature anomalies recorded there by Professor Kathy Crane were a scientific first according to Dr Peter Vogt, the lead American scientist.  The ship moved to the Knipovich Ridge Valley, part of the northernmost extension of the Atlantic Mid-Ocean Ridge, to search for evidence of hydrothermal activity within the rift valley.  Data collection from the region indicates signs of hydrothermal mineralization and recent volcanism in the region.  Further sedimentary coring north and west of Svalbard was done after investigation into deep iceberg plowmarks just north of 80 degrees N was postponed due to the presence of pack ice.<P>

The sharing of research technologies and platforms made the expedition financially feasible for NRL scientists while providing research support for the VNIIokeangeologia and Polar Marine Expedition during a period of severe financial difficulties in the Russian Federation.  It also formed the basis for future research collaboration.<P>

<B>2.  Full Report (by Dr van Keuren)</B><BR>
An NRL-led international scientific team consisting of U.S., Russian, and Norwegian scientists spent a month on a Russian vessel this last summer carrying out geological and geophysical research in the Greenland-Norwegian Sea. Funded by the Naval Research Laboratory, the National Science Foundation, and the Russian Academy of Sciences, with additional support from the Office of Naval Research and Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, the expedition departed Bergen, Norway on 24 July and concluded its work in Longyearbyen, Svalbard, on August 23. Research focused on several sites between 64 degrees N and 80 degrees N along the continental margin and the Knipovich Ridge Valley, a segment of the Mid-Oceanic Ridge where the North American plate is moving away from the Eurasian plate.  <P>   

The international scientific team was housed on the Professor Logachev, a vessel operated by the Polar Marine Geosurvey Expedition headquartered in Lomonosov near St. Petersburg. The Logachev is 104.5 meters in length with a displacement of 5,700 tons and was completed in 1991 after the break-up of the Soviet Union. It houses up to 93 scientists and crew, and contains extensive laboratory space, along with an armada of modern technologies for sampling and analyzing the sea bed, the subbottom, and the water column. The ship is larger and able to carry out a greater diversity of scientific functions than many American oceanographic research vessels.   <P>   

Participants on the cruise included staff members from the VNIIokeangeologia Institute in St. Petersburg, with research groups in gas hydrates, hydrothermal phenomena, and general environmental science; the Institute of Microbiology of the Russian Academy of Sciences in Moscow; the Vernadsky Institute of Geochemistry and Analytical Chemistry, and the Shirshov Institute of Oceanology, both of Moscow. There were two representatives of the University of Oslo, a graduate student and a geophysical engineer. Additional support was provided by the University of Bergen (Professor Eirik Sundvor). Engineering and crew staffing was provided by the Polar Marine Expedition. The head Russian scientist was Dr. Georgiy Cherkashev of the VNIIokeangeologia, and the captain was Alexander Arutyunov, a forty-year veteran of the Soviet Navy. Other Russian participants included Dr. Gennady Ivanov, an expert on the Barents Sea environment; Dr. Gabriel Ginsburg, an authority on gas hydrates; and Boris Malin and Alexander Shagin, Expedition Chief and Vice-Expedition Chief respectively. The Director of the Polar Marine Geosurvey Expedition is Dr. Vladimir Kryukov.   <P>

NRL participants were Dr. Peter Vogt, lead American scientist; Dr. Kathleen Crane, a visiting geophysicist at NRL from Lamont-Doherty Institute of Geophysics and Hunter College; Justin McCune, a computer specialist; and graduate student Jennifer Lee, from NRL and George Washington University. Other Americans included NRL historian Dr. David van Keuren; Jeffrey Halka, with the Maryland Geological Survey; Claude (Pete) Petrone, a retired National Geographic Society photographer; and Stephanie Harrington, a graduate student from MIT. There were ninety cruise participants altogether.<P>

The Norwegian Sea has been a focus of NRL oceanographic attention for a quarter century. The most recent research there was joint NRL/Norwegian work in August of 1995 (Labstracts, June 3, 1996), conducted from the vessel Haakon Mosby, operated by the University of Bergen. In the course of that expedition, NRL and Norwegian scientists discovered and carried out an initial survey of a mud volcano, or warm seep, located at 72 degrees N on the continental slope west of the Barents Sea.<P>     

A major objective of the Logachev cruise was a return to the Haakon Mosby mud volcano to pursue more extensive surveys and scientific analyses than could be accomplished on the Haakon Mosby expedition.  After conducting short investigations at several sites from 64 degrees N to 70 degrees N, the Logachev arrived at the mud volcano site on August 4 and remained there for a week. Transponders were placed on the seafloor to facilitate accurate navigation and instrument positioning. The site was then surveyed by sidescan sonar, video sled (with video and still cameras), and CTD (to take measurements of conductivity, temperature, and depth in the water column). Piston, gravity, and box cores were used to collect sediment samples at various locations within the grid area.<P>

Cores taken at the center of the mud volcano returned sediments rich with hydrogen sulfide gas and methane hydrate crystals. The cores literally bubbled away in front of researchers, as the gas hydrate, an ice-like substance, decomposed to methane gas and water. (Gas hydrates are only stable at the low temperature-high pressure environment of the seafloor). Geologists observed hydrate crystals as large as eight to ten centimeters in diameter, as well as numerous tube worms in the sediment. The video and still films displayed methane hydrates scattered across the sea floor in small fragments and extensive patches. Additionally, CTD measurements gave evidence of a signficant positive temperature anomaly in the water column directly over the volcano center. According to Dr. Peter Vogt, "Nobody has ever, over a so-called cool or warm seep, found a temperature anomaly in the water column" before. This was a scientific first for the Logachev team.              From the site of the mud volcano, the Logachev headed north to the Knipovich Ridge Valley. The Knipovich is the northernmost extension of the Atlantic Mid-Ocean Ridge, running 600 km between 73 degrees 30' N, 8 degrees 0' E, and 77 degrees 40' N, 6 degrees 40' E. It is one of the least known of the oceanic rift valleys and does not even appear on most maps of global plate tectonics. The Knipovich Ridge is characterized by widely spaced clusters of seamounts separated by long stretches of sediment-filled valley floor. This is atypical of mid-ocean ridge topography. The rift valley running along the center of the ridge ranges in depth from 3200 to 3400 meters. Near its northern end is the Molloy Deep, which at 5570 meters is the greatest depth in the North Atlantic-Arctic region.  <P>

The major objective within the Knipovich Ridge area was to search for evidence of hydrothermal activity within the rift valley. The Logachev, using sidescan sonar, profiled part of the rift valley north to south, commencing on the night of August 12. A CTD was attached to the sidescan to search for temperature anomalies in the water column. Early results indicated a temperature anomaly near the north flank of a submarine volcano at 76 degrees 48' N. Coring, dredging, and the video sled were deployed to explore the area around the suspected anomaly site. Although the exact site of the warm vent was not located, CTD readings, along with evidence from dredging and photographic profiles produced signs of hydrothermal mineralization and recent volcanism in this section of the rift valley.    <P>           

A failure of the sidescan sonar in the lower rift valley area limited the ability of the Logachev to complete the bottom profile. However, enough evidence was gathered during this year's visit to warrant a future return in order to continue and expand the investigations. One idea under consideration is to bring the MIR deep submersibles, belonging to the Shirshov Institute of Moscow, to dive on both the mud volcano and the Knipovich Rift Valley sites sometime within the next year. The MIRs are capable of making in-situ sea floor investigations, placing experiment packages, taking measurements, and collecting samples at specific sites. <P>

Departing the rift valley site, Logachev headed toward its northernmost planned site, deep iceberg plowmarks at 80 degrees 10' N. However, the pack ice edge was located just above 80 degrees, so the plowmark site was left for a better ice year. After further sedimentary coring north and west of Svalbard, Professor Logachev disembarked its American and Norwegian contingent at Longyearbyen, in Svalbard (latitude 78 degrees 15' N.), on the 23rd of August. The American Ambassador to Norway, the Honorable Thomas Loftus, and his Military Attache, Captain Robert Paleck, met the Logachev and her crew in Longyearbyen fjord for a ship's tour and reception.<P>

The cruise of the Professor Logachev was more than a joint oceanographic expedition. Scientific expertise and techniques were demonstrated and shared among the American, Russian, and Norwegian participants. Approximately a dozen research seminars were delivered in Russian and English by scientific specialists, and a Russian language course was organized for the benefit of members of the American team. In addition to the regular research staff, the crew included ten graduate students (1 Norwegian, 2 U.S., 7 Russian) pursuing advanced studies in the oceanographic sciences.<P>

In a time of tight financial resources both in Russia and the United States, the Logachev cruise advanced the scientific research front in both countries. The sharing of research technologies and platforms made the expedition financially feasible for NRL scientists, while providing research support for both the VNIIokeangeologia and the Polar Marine Expedition, during a period of severe financial difficulties in the Russian Federation. It has also formed the basis for future research collaborations.<P>

The first follow-up may be next year's spring meetings of the American Geophysical Union in Baltimore, where sessions reporting on the scientific accomplishments of the expedition will be given by American and Russian scientists.<P>

<B>Summary:</B><P>

A workshop on "Theoretical and observational studies of polar lows" was held at St. Petersburg, Russia, 23-26 September 1996.  An international group with participants from Canada, Denmark, Germany, Norway, Russia, United Kingdom and USA participated in the workshop.  The papers presented covered the fields of climatological studies, studies using numerical models and satellite studies for the Northern and the Southern Hemisphere.  Two polar low cases were discussed in more detail during working groups sessions.  Programs related to polar low research were discussed in order to coordinate the international efforts in investigating polar mesocyclones.<P>

<B>1. Introduction</B><P>

The sixth meeting of the EGS Polar Lows Working Group (EPLWG) was held at
the State Scientific Center of the Russian Federation Arctic and Antarctic
Research Institute (AARI), St.Petersburg, from 23 to 26 September 1996. For
the first time, this workshop brought together scientists from western
countries with scientists of AARI on the research field of polar
mesocyclones. During the first two days of the meeting, 17 presentations of
polar low studies were given, the next two days were devoted to more
detailed discussions of two selected case studies in the frame of smaller
working groups. The workshop was sponsored by the Office of Naval Research
European Office (ONR). In the following, the presentations of the
participants and the main points of the discussions of the working groups
will be summarized. The meeting proceedings containing the extended
abstracts of the presentations can be obtained from G. Heinemann end of
November 1996.<P>

<B>2. Presentations of the participants and working groups</B><P>

The meeting was structured into three scientific sessions, a session with
current and future programs related to polar low research, working group
meetings and a general concluding session. The meeting was opened by talks
of A. Danilov, Deputy Scientific Director of AARI, and by G. Heinemann
(GH), chairman of the EPLWG. GH pointed out that this was the first time
for the EPLWG to hear about AARI's activities in polar low research. This
opening of the PL group to eastern Europe, where the Russian coast belongs
to the Arctic over several thousands of kilometers, and the fact that much
of the Russian science is performed also in Antarctica, would probably
widen the view of polar mesocyclones. As at previous meetings, an
international group with participants from Canada, Denmark, Germany,
Norway, Russia, United Kingdom and USA participated in the workshop.<P>

<B>2.1 Session 1: Climatological studies</B><P>

Erik Rasmussen, Niels Bohr Institute, University of Copenhagen, Denmark,
used three years of Advanced Very High-Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR)
imagery for the investigation of polar lows over the Barents Sea. For the
period 1991-1993, polar lows were found to occur relatively frequently in
the Barents Sea region. The evaluation of synoptic maps indicate that most
of the polar lows developed along the sea ice front and were associated
with upper- level potential vorticity (PV) anomalies.<P>

V. Lagun and E. Lutsenko from AARI presented preliminary classification
results on polar mesocyclones over the Norwegian and Barents Seas for the
period 1981-1995. Their polar low climatology was based on NOAA and METEOR
satellite imagery and about 500 mesocyclones were detected during these 15
years. Twice-daily surface pressure and geopotential height fields from
NCEP data (1981-1991) were used for a quantitative climatology.<P>

J. Harold, School of Environmental Sciences, University of East Anglia
(UEA), Norwich, UK, showed results for a climatology of polar mesocyclones
over the North Atlantik based on AVHRR imagery. During the period October
1993-September 1995 more than 4000 individual vortices were detected and
tracked. All cyclones were identified from cloud signatures using channel 4
(IR) of the AVHRR instrument. The two year data set was then used to
examine the month by month variability in cyclone activity. The seasonal
characteristics of cyclones, and their spatial variability was also
studied. It was found that there is considerable variability in mesocyclone
activity between months, but the seasonality was broadly consistent between
the two years. The spatial variability revealed significant spatial and
seasonal variability in cyclone activity, suggesting a similar variability
in the coupling of the high latitude ocean and atmosphere.<P>

Kari Wilhelmsen, Norwegian Meteorological Institute, Division for Northern
Norway, reported on the importance of inversions upon the development of
polar lows and weather forcasts in the Arctic. It was pointed out that the
static stability of the air in a vertical column extending from the surface
up to 500 hPa is of great importance for polar low developments. During
cold air outbreaks, strong cold air advection is present in the boundary
layer resulting from the diabatic heating of the cold air flowing from the
sea ice over the open water. Upper level cold cores with 500 hPa
temperatures below -38 deg Centigrades were found to be essential for the
onset of deep convection and polar low formation, if they move over the
open sea, where the near-surface air is typically 0 to +2 degrees above
freezing level. The role of the inversion capping the boundary layer in
preventing deep-layer convective instabilities was shown.<P>

<B>2.2 Session 2: Theoretical and numerical studies</B><P>

I. Lavrenov and V. Bokov (AARI) have investigated problems of wind wave
modelling and forecast for Arctic seas. An operational spectral model of
AARI was used taking ECMWF analyses of the surface pressure field as
initial data. While the results were quite satisfactorily for large-scale
atmospheric conditions, significant underestimations of the wave height
were found for the case of a MC over the Barents Sea 24-26 December 1995.
More realistic initial fields from reanalyzed synoptic maps led to an
increase from 3 to 7 m wave height in the vicinity of the MC.<P>

T. Klein from the Meteorologisches Institut der Universitt Bonn (MIUB),
Germany, gave a presentation on idealized numerical simulations with a
three-dimensional model for the investigation of the synoptic-scale forcing
on mesocyclone development in the Weddell Sea region. Simulations with the
NORLAM model with 50 and 25 km horizontal resolution and 30 vertical layers
were performed using complex physical boundary conditions and different
idealized synoptic-scale forcings as initial states. Sensitivity studies
demonstrated that the topography and the diabatic heating of the surface
fluxes of latent and sensible heat played an essential role in the
formation of mesocyclones.<P>

C. Kpken and G. Heinemann from MIUB presented a case study of an Arctic
mesocyclone by means of aircraft data assimilated into a mesoscale
numerical model. The mesocyclone occurred on 18 March 1989 near the sea-ice
edge east of Jan Mayen and had already been investigated during a NOAA
research flight campaign. Kpken and Heinemann studied the same case using
the NORLAM meso-scale limited area model and analysis scheme in a modified
version. The numerical simulation without data assimilation yielded no
signs of a meso-scale development, which was in contrast to the cyclonic
rotation with wind speeds up to 20 m/s observed by the aircraft and SSM/I
wind speed retrievals. In order to obtain a dynamically consistent
3-dimensional analysis of the system, the aircraft flight level data were
used in the objective analysis. The resulting analysis was then used for
the further model integration. This allowed studies of the dynamical
structure of the vortex and its further development which represents a more
detailed analysis compared to the analysis relying solely on the aircraft
data.<P>

J. Harold (UEA) gave a presentation about the modelling the effects of
polar mesocyclones on the underlying oceans. Harold explored the effect of
polar mesocyclones on the high latitude North Atlantic. A Mellor and Yamada
level 2.5 one dimensional mixed layer model was used to examine the
individual effects of wind stress, change in wind direction of the wind
stress, and heat transfer on the ocean. The combined effect of theses
processes was quantified for a range of idealised cyclones.<P>

The first talk about one of the working group's case studies was given by
I. Johannessen, Geophysical Institute University of Bergen (GIUB), Norway.
He presented numerical simulations of the "Le Cygne" polar low occurring
from 13 to 16 October 1993 over the Norwegian Sea using the NORLAMS model
(NORLAM model with the cloud water scheme of Sundquist et al., 1989) with
50 km and 25 km horizontal resolution and 18 and 30 sigma layers vertical
resolution, respectively. For the genesis phase of the polar low,
baroclinic instability coupled with upper level PV forcing was suggested as
the triggering mechanism, with convection contributing at a later stage in
the form of conditional instability of the second kind (CISK) or air-sea
interaction instability (ASII). The NORLAMS predicted the evolution,
maintenance and track of the depression very well, but a large sensitiviy
on the starting time of the simulation was found (taking ECMWF analyses as
initial fields and boundary values). The positive PV anomaly being present
at upper levels during the initial stage of the polar low was found to be
also present during the mature phase of the depression.<P>

Simulation results including the second (SH) case study of the EPLWG were
presented by G. Heinemann (MIUB). The two cases shown occured during 20-22
May 1986 (Case 1) and 30 July-1 August 1986 (Case 2) in the Weddell Sea
region. During this period, the Winter Weddell Sea Program field phase 1986
was performed and additional observational data were available, in
particular 3 hourly synoptic observations and 6 hourly radiosonde ascents
from the German research vessel "Polarstern", which was situated close to
the MC on 31 July 1986. Both cases developed close to the sea ice front of
the Weddell Sea. Simulations over 54 h using the NORLAM model with 50 km
horizontal resolution and 30 sigma layers showed a triggering by
upper-level PV anomalies for both cases. In contrast to summertime
mesocyclones, the MC events during winter were associated with strong
convection and large surface energy fluxes. Sensitivity studies show that
the diabatic heating by cloud water condensation was of great importance
for the intensification during development of Case 2 during the first 24 h.
Comparisons of the model results with radiosondes and synoptic observations
showed the good quality of the model simulations.<P>

The talk of C. Kpken (MIUB) about the potential use and difficulties of
the assimilation of SSM/I data into a meso-scale numerical model for polar
low research represented the link between model and satellite studies.
SSM/I-derived parameters like near-surface windspeed (WS) and integrated
water vapour (IWV) with a horizontal resolution of about 50 km have been
used for the detection and study of meso- scale polar vortices in many
cases. Kpken showed assimilation experiments using WS and IVW retrievals
in the NORLAM model. WS was analysed with a 3-dimensional multivariate
successive corrections scheme which converges towards the solution of an
optimal interpolation (SC/OI). For the assimilation of IWV a two step
method was chosen: First the SC/OI scheme was used in a 2-dimensional
univariate version to analyse the field of integrated water vapour; in a
second step the first guess profiles of specific humidity were adjusted to
these analyzed total contents. The IWV assimilation improved the analysis
and simulations significantly and had also large impact on the dynamical
fields in the vicinity of fronts. But, in the cases considered, the
improvement for the polar lows was limited, since they showed only a week
signature in the integrated water vapour content due to their shallow
vertical extent. The assimilation of WS retrievals presented more
difficulties to the data analysis scheme, since the information about wind
direction had to be taken from the model forecast.<P>

<B>2.3 Session 3: Satellite studies</B><P>

The use of satellite-derived parameters for polar low research has
increased considerably during recent years. The most important instruments
used are the SSM/I on board the DMSP satellites since 1987, the European
Remote Sensing Satellite scatterometer (ERS-SCAT) launched in 1991 and the
AVHRR and the TIROS-N Operational Vertical Sounder (TOVS) on board the NOAA
satellites since 1978. The application of these new types of satellite data
for polar low research was the central point of the EPLWG meeting in 1992.
Since polar MCs usually occur in data sparse regions, satellite images have
been the only tool for the detection of these phenomena in many cases. With
the advent of more advanced satellite instruments and the associated
retrieval algorithms, the use of the satellite data has become more
quantitative. High-quality sounding data from the TOVS have proven to be of
significant value for retrievals of atmospheric temperatures and humidities
in polar regions. AVHRR data are a valuable tool for the detection of
meso-scale cloud structures and also for the determination of cloud
parameters and sea surface temperatures for polar mesocyclone studies. The
high precision passive microwave imaging sensor SSM/I allows the
determination of near-surface WS and integrated atmospheric water
parameters over ocean areas, but low-level structures are often smoothed
out by averaging over the whole atmospheric column. ERS-SCAT data allow the
determination of near-surface wind vectors over the ocean, but the main
restriction is the narrowness of the scatterometer swath (about 500 km
only), which leads to large gaps between subsequent satellite overpasses
and therefore an insufficient areal coverage. The most efficient way to
perform remote studies of MCs is to combine different satellite
measurements in the form of a multi-sensor study using different data types
being coinicident in time. This multi-sensor approach was followed in most
of the papers presented in this section.<P>

The paper of L.A. McMurdie, Dep. of Atmospheric Sciences, University of
Washington (UW), Seattle, USA, and C. Claud, Laboratoire de Meteorologie
Dynamique (LMD), Palaiseau, France, investigated MCs in cold airstreams
poleward of major frontal zones over the southern oceans detected by
geostationary GMS imagery. Quantitative information regarding the
atmospheric temperature, humidity, water and wind fields of these systems
was retrieved from SSM/I, ERS-SCAT and TOVS data. Fields of IWV, integrated
cloud liquid water, liquid and solid precipitation occurrence, WS and
geopotential thickness, but also ERS-SCAT surface wind vectors have been
investigated for about 50 individual MCs. In few cases, the surface
cyclonic circulation of the MC was confirmed by the ERS-1 winds. It was
found that solid precipitation was more prevalent than liquid precipitation
in most MCs and that MCs with spiral-shaped cloud systems have lower IWV
content than comma-shaped MCs, reflecting the fact that the latter ones
were generally detected more equatorwards. For a case occurring near the
Antarctic ice edge on 2 June 1993, evidence was found that surface fluxes
of heat and moisture were likely to have contributed significantly to its
development.<P>

M. Lieder and G. Heinemann (MIUB) presented two MC cases over the northern
Amundsen Sea and Bellingshausen Sea, that occured during the special
observing periods (SOP) July 1994 and January 1995 of the First Regional
Observing Study of the Troposphere (FROST) in the Antarctic. The
development of the two vortices with a lifetime of 48 hours and size of
approximately 800-1000 km was studied using data from SSM/I, ERS-SCAT,
AVHRR data and IR mosaics of the Antarctic region sampled from
geostationary and polar orbiting sensors (Antarctic Meteorology Research
Center, Wisconsin, USA). The MCs show a distinct signal in the remotely
sensed parameters, in particular in the SSMI-derived WS and IWV. In the
case of 5 to 6 July 1994, the ERS-1 winds show clearly the surface cyclonic
circulation of the MC.<P>

John Turner and Gareth Marshall, British Antarctic Survey, Cambridge, UK,
showed results of a comprehensive study of Antarctic MCs in the Weddell
Sea/Bellingshausen Sea area using AVHRR data collected at Rothera Station
during the period March 1993 to February 1994 and ERS-SCAT data. All the
vortices were first observed in the AVHRR imagery and a total of 452
mesocyclones were identified. But, because of the narrow 500 km swath of
the scatterometer and the fact that winds can only be derived over the
ice-free ocean, only 43 cases (9.4% of the total) were coincident with
scatterometer observations. Most systems had a surface circulation and
these were found to vary from a slight deviation from the broadscale
geostrophic flow to a closed circulation. However, 25% of the MCs did not
have any surface circulation. Fields of relative vorticity were also
determined from the scatterometer data, with maximum values of up to 4x10-4
s-1. The problems of the ambiguity removal for the ERS-SCAT winds were
addressed, which can lead to errors in the wind directions of 180 degrees
especially near fronts and in the centre of vortices.<P>

Satellite-derived aspects of the NH case study 13 to 16 October 1993 were
eludicated by the paper of C. Claud (LMD), N.M. Mognard, CNES/CESBIO,
Toulouse, France, and L.A. McMurdie (UW). Spatio-temporal fields were
analyzed using TOVS and SSM/I retrievals, but also data from the
Topex/Poseidon altimeter, which yields wind speed and sea state along a
narrow swath. Using the different satellite measurements in synergy, the
respective role of baroclinicity, surface fluxes, and upper-level support
in the initiation and developement of the polar low was evaluated.<P>

L. Mitnik, Pacific Oceanological Institute, Russia, gave an overview about
the potential of the Real Aperture Radar (RAR) on board the Russian Okean
satellites, which can be used in synergy with a passive microwave imager on
the same satellite as well with SSM/I data.<P>

Ian Renfrew, Aashish A. Clerk and Kent Moore, Dept. of Physics, University
of Toronto, Canada, addressed the question of polar low movement from the
viewpoint of cyclonic co-rotation of two or more MCs. Instead of being
advected by the surrounding larger scale systems, two or more polar lows in
the same vicinity were found to have binary interactions between pairs of
polar lows. In geographic co-ordinates these interactions can appear as
unusual loops, twists and turns in the low tracks. Satellite imagery from
several case studies had been examined to accurately determine the polar
low tracks. In addition, ground based and satellite derived wind data were
utilised to provide estimates of the low magnitudes and a theoretical
rotation rate for the binary systems, based on barotropic vortex dynamics,
was calculated. A good correspondance between these calculated rotation
rates and the observed rotation rates was found.<P>

<B>3. Programs related to polar low research and concluding remarks</B><P>

During this session current and future projects related to polar MCs were
presented. P. Twitchell, International GEWEX Project Office, Silver Spring,
USA, reported on experimental activities in the frame of the GEWEX, FASTEX,
and Labrador Sea Projects. The latter two have close links to polar low
research, since field experiments will be performed in the Labador Sea area
including intensive ship measurements in February 1997, increased frequency
of radiosonde ascents of synoptic stations as well as possible instrumented
aircraft missions between Greenland and Labrador.<P>

J. Turner gave an overview about the FROST project, which included three
SOPs (each lasting one month) for the SH and is now in the stage of
reanalysing the atmosperic fields using numerical forecasts, satellite data
and all available observational data.<P>

G. Heinemann reported on the future activities of MIUB in the frame of the
German contribution to ACSYS. An aircraft-based experiment is planned in
April/May 1997 at the western side of Greenland aiming at the investigation
of boundary layer fronts at the sea ice edge over the Davis Street and a
the study of the three-dimesnsional structure of the katabatic wind system
over Greenland. These studies will be complemented by numerical model
studies and satellite studies, which will also be carried out in the
Antarctic.<P>

The plans of the University of Bergen were outlined by E. Raustein and
include the atmospheric forcing on ocean circulations in Arctic oceans,
simulations with a non-hydrostatic model and theoretical work on polar MCs.<P>

I. Renfrew gave a viewback on the Canadian Beaufort and Arctic Storms
Experiment (BASE) performed in September and October 1994 over the Canadian
Arctic, where 11 SOPs with aircraft measurements and two ground-based
radars were carried out.<P>

The future polar low projects of AARI were presented by V. Lagun and A.
Danilov. It is planned to set up and complete the data banks at AARI
containing satellite data from 1981 to 1996 and observational data from
Arctic and Antarctic stations. Apart from case studies, a synoptic
climatology for Arctic MCs is planned using ECMWF and NCEP data. The next
step will be energy budget studies for polar low events, wind wave
modelling and boundary layer studies. Projects in the frame of ACSYS
comprise the modelling of climate processes and ocean atmosphere
interaction.<P>

<B>1.  Summary</B><BR>
The EPLWG held is sixth meeting at AARI in St Petersburg, Russia in late September.  The intent of this newsletter is to provide some background and add supplementary editorial comments regarding the workshop as viewed by this author.  A full report of the meeting was prepared by the Chairman of EPLWG and is posted on both the EPLWG homepage and the ONR Europe homepage (addresses below).  The EPLWG consists of an international mix of senior researchers, post-doctorate students and operational meteorologists conducting theoretical and observational studies of polar lows.  This provided an excellent forum to combine western and Russian research in a common area of interest.  The workshop quite successfully accomplished this and hosting  the workshop at AARI boosted Russian participation.  ONR Europes support via its Conference Support Program was instrumental in enabling the workshop to be located in St Petersburg with a full complement of western participants in attendance.  The opportunity to join forces in this cooperative effort was fully embraced by all involved and will undoubtedly enhance understanding of the polar mesocyclone phenomena.<P>

<B>2.  General Information about EPLWG</B><BR>
The EGS Polar Lows Working Group (EPLWG) held its sixth meeting at the State Scientific Center of the Russian Federation Arctic and Antarctic Research Institute (AARI) in St Petersburg, Russia from 23-26 September, 1996. EPLWG falls under the umbrella of  the European Geophysical Society, though they do not receive any financial support from them.  There were some 25 participants from Denmark, Germany, Iceland, Norway, Russia, the United Kingdom and the United States present at this meeting.  Papers from Canadian and French members of the working group who were not able to attend were also presented at the meeting.  The group consists of  a mixture of senior researchers, post-doctorate students and operational meteorologists from a number of institutes and agencies with interest in high latitude operations.  A complete list of attendees is found on the EPLWG homepage.<P>

EPLWG has met each year since its founding in 1989 (except 1995) at Cambridge, Copenhagen, Vienna, Iceland, Paris and St Petersburg, respectively.  One of the intentions of holding this years meeting at AARI was to encourage Russian researchers with interests in this area to participate in the working group.  AARI has much to offer with large databases (particularly in the Arctic) and years of operational activity and experience in the high latitudes.  Their participation is not only beneficial to EPLWG, but serves as a forum to establish new collaborative ties with western researchers.  The cost of  getting to St Petersburg (particularly for post-doctorate students) was sufficiently high that it would have reduced the number of western participants, so outside funding was solicited.  ONR Europe supported the meeting  via its <B>Conference Support Program (CSP)</B>.  This allowed some six additional students to attend the meeting which significantly enhanced its success.  EPLWG has received an invitation from the Norwegian Meteorological Institute to hold its next meeting in Tromsoe, Norway in early summer 1998.<P>

<B>3.  The EPLWG Meeting</B><BR>
The EPLWG workshop was entitled "Theorectical and Observational Studies of Polar Lows".  A full report of the meeting was prepared by Dr Gunther Heinemann, Chairman of EPLWG.  It provides an excellent synopsis of the work being conducted by both western and Russian scientists in this area.  It can be found on the EPLWG homepage at <A HREF="http://www.rhrz.uni-bonn.de/~unf433/eplwg/eplwg.html">www.rhrz.uni-bonn.de/~unf433/eplwg/eplwg.html</A>.  It is also posted on ONR Europes homepage at www.ehis.navy.mil as an Ocean, Atmosphere and Space S&T Newsletter.<P>

<B>4.   Comments</B><BR>
AARI proved to be an excellent site for hosting the EPLWG meeting this year.  <B>CSP funding was instrumental</B> in allowing this to happen.  The primary benefit was that it allowed for much greater Russian participation in the working group than if held elsewhere, enabling numerous AARI scientists (not just workshop participants) to discuss recent similar research work being conducted in the Russian science community.  There were seven Russian presenters at the workshop and numerous other interested AARI staff joining in on various group discussions.  This particularly successful aspect of the meeting has potential for developing  long-term interaction between western and Russian polar researchers.  Had the meeting been held at another site, the extent of Russian input would have been diluted in comparison, if not completely absent from the working group.  The timely interaction that did take place was a mutually recognized "plus" for both sides.   Deputy Scientific Director of AARI, Dr A. Danilov, made it clear in his summary remarks that AARI is enthusiastically embracing the opportunity to participate in EPLWG and welcomed the collaborative nature of the group.<P>

Holding the meeting at AARI also provided the opportunity for the western scientists to tour the facilities and learn a little about the current state of research at AARI.  Tours included a visit to the weather satellite data collection laboratory (which seemed to have some of the most modern equipment in the building) and a visit to the ice tank facilities.  The ice tanks were quite impressive in their size and unique ice making capability by using retractable cooling units.  A brief video provided some insight to the research in ice strength and hull design being conducted there.<P>

Arctic research is one area which continues to hold Russias strong interest and it was evident that difficult financial times are having an impact on the countrys ability  to continue the work in this arena without collaboration.  As mentioned before, AARI has extensive polar region databases and years of field experience to offer in a cooperative effort such as this and their involvement in the EPLWG will significantly enhance understanding of this phenomena.<P>

<B>1. Introduction </B><BR>
 The following report summarizes the capabilities and recent research activities
of the Division of Hydraulics and Environmental Engineering at the Aristotle
University of Thessaloniki, Greece.  The report is based on the Dr. Brunos
experiences during a 4-month Fulbright lecturing/research appointment. He would like to acknowledge the generous assistance of the staff and students of the Division during his stay in Thessaloniki.<P>

<B>2. Summary </B><BR>
 The Division of Hydraulics and Environmental Engineering is an active participant
in European Union and locally-sponsored research efforts covering a wide range
of ocean engineering issues.  The primary areas of interest are Aegean Sea
circulation and water quality dynamics; nearshore processes; fundamental fluid
dynamics; and water resources management.  The Division's focus in addressing
these problems is heavily weighted towards numerical modeling, an area in which
the staff excels.  The Division possesses an impressive suite of numerical
models,  including codes developed by the staff as well as codes originating in
the U.S. and Europe.  The Division is less well equipped in terms of laboratory
and field data collection.  However,  as a result of its participation in
European Union (MAST) joint research ventures and the EU-sponsored
facilities-sharing programs, the Division is becoming more active in the
acquisition and analysis of field and laboratory data.  This has greatly
enhanced the capabilities of the staff, and should contribute to the continued
expansion of the Division's ocean engineering research activities. <P>

<B>3. Thessaloniki </B><BR>
 Located at the head of the Thermaikos Gulf, the northwestern corner of the
Aegean Sea, Thessaloniki is the second largest city in Greece with a population
of approximately 1 million.  <P>

<B>4. University of Thessaloniki </B><BR>
 Founded in 1925, the university is the largest in Greece, with a total undergraduate enrollment of approximately 60,000 students in 35 departments on a campus that covers 137 acres.<P>

<B>5. School of Technology</B><BR>
 Founded in 1955, the school is composed of 7 Departments :
<OL>
<LI>Civil Engineering
<LI>Architecture
<LI>Rural & Surveying Engineering
<LI>Mechanical Engineering
<LI>Electrical Engineering
<LI>Chemical Engineering
<LI>Mathematics, Physical, and Computational Sciences
</OL>

The school has a total undergraduate enrollment of approximately 7,100 students
and 135 post-graduate students.  The staff includes approximately 280 teachers
(lecturers, assistant professors, associate professors, and  professors), all
of whom hold the Ph.D. degree, and approximately 190 technical and
administrative support staff.<P>

<B>6. Department of Civil Engineering </B><BR>
 Founded in 1955, the Department has a total undergraduate enrollment of approximately 2,000 students in 4 divisions:
<OL>
<LI>Structural Engineering
<LI>Hydraulics and Environmental Engineering
<LI>Geotechnical Engineering
<LI>Transport and Organization
</OL>

The undergraduate students pursue a 5-year course of study leading to the Diploma of Civil Engineering.  The curriculum includes 3 years of core courses followed by 2 years of specialized study in any one of the 4 areas listed above.  A
Diploma Thesis is also required.  The graduate ("post-graduate") program is
small by U.S. standards, reflecting both the scarcity of financial support and
the very restricted employment opportunities for Ph.D. degree recipients in Greece.<P>

 The Division conducts teaching and research in many areas of concern to the Navy, including: physical oceanography, fundamental fluid mechanics, circulation and water quality modeling, flow-structure interaction, coastal engineering, hydrology and water resources management<P>

<B> 7.1 Staff</B><BR>
 The Division has a total teaching staff of 18, an administrative/technical
staff of 8, and a total of 25 full-time post-graduate students.  In addition,
the Division is host to several visiting researchers who also hold appointments
at universities elsewhere in Greece.  These visiting researchers are funded on
an entirely "soft-money" basis through government or industry-supported
research projects.  Based on my own experience, they make significant
contributions to the overall research effort within the Division.<P>

<B>7.2  Facilities</B><BR>
 The Division has a reasonably well-equipped laboratory, with several small
recirculating flumes equipped with hot film anemometers, pressure and temperature sensors, etc.  The flumes are primarily used for teaching demonstrations and instructional laboratories, although they are occasionally  employed in Ph.D. thesis research projects.  Such experimental projects are rare, owing to the Division's focus on numerical modeling.  The computer facilities are
first-rate, with workstations and pentium-based personal computers widely
available and network connection to a Vax 9000 mainframe.  Software currently
in use includes "in-house" codes as well as models developed in the U.S. (e.g.,
the Princeton Ocean Model and the Army Corps' shoreline evolution model,
GENESIS) and the European Union.  The Division does not operate a research
vessel of its own, but has access to a 6-meter vessel operated by the Biology
Department.  Field instrumentation includes an ADCP, 2 Aandera current meters,
a thermistor chain, a CTD, an OBS sensor, and a wave recorder.<P>

<B>7.3  Staff Research Interests</B><BR>
 In an overall sense, the marine-oriented staff is heavily concentrated in
computational fluid dynamics and numerical modeling of ocean circulation, coastal dynamics, and water quality dynamics.  This focus has been modified slightly in recent years as a result of the Division's participation in several European Union-sponsored (MAST) research projects involving the acquisition and analysis of oceanographic field data.  The marine research interests of the Division can be summarized as follows.<P>

Numerical modeling of ocean circulation and coastal dynamics<BR>
 Key participants : Professors Yannis Krestenitis and Christoforos  Koutitas;
 Drs. Spiros Christopoulos and Theofanis Karambas<P>

This group has been involved in several MAST projects, including G6M, G8M, MERMAIDS, PROFILE, ECAWOM, and SAFE.  They have employed the Princeton Ocean Model in numerical studies of the full Aegean Sea and the Thermaikos Gulf.  They have also developed their own numerical codes for modeling storm surges, nonlinear wave propagation and breaking, sediment transport and pollutant transport.  Professors Krestenitis and Koutitas have both served on MAST proposal review committees, and Professor Koutitas is a member of the MAST modeling committee.  Drs. Christopoulos and Karambas are particularly active in the modeling of nearshore processes, and are participants in the Waves in Shallow Water Environments (WISE) program. <P>

The group has in the past 5 years expanded its interest and capabilities in field
and laboratory data acquisition and analysis.  Professor Krestenitis and Dr.
Christopoulos form the University of Thessaloniki component of the MAST 
PROFILE ("Processes in Regions of Freshwater Influence") project, which
includes extensive data collection efforts in the Thermaikos Gulf.  The team is
currently comparing numerical predictions of the 3-D Gulf dynamics (using the
Princeton Ocean Model) with an extensive 18-month data set that includes moored observations of the vertical distribution of currents, temperature and
salinity.   Drs. Christopoulos and Karambas are active participants in a
recently-initiated wave data acquisition program in the northern Aegean.  Dr.
Karambas is currently involved in a large wave tank study at the Catalonia
University of Technology (UPC) with the aim of measuring reflection and
transmission coefficients in the vicinity of a submerged breakwater.  His
participation in the project is being supported through the European Union's
program for shared access to laboratory facilities.<P>


Computational Fluid Dynamics<BR>
 Key participants : Professors Petros  Anagnostopoulos,  Christoforos 
 Koutitas, and Jacques Ganoulis<P>

These individuals are active in the numerical modeling of flow-structure interaction, e.g.,  flow around a cylinder and flow-induced vibrations.  Their work is almost entirely numerical, although there has been recent involvement in
combined numerical-experimental efforts aimed at simulating the flow through a
staggered series of cylinders.<P>

Water Quality Modeling<BR>
 Key participants : Professors  Christoforos Koutitas, Yannis Krestenitis and
 Jacques Ganoulis,  Drs. Spiros Christopoulos and Theofanis Karambas<P>

This group has a wide range of interests in the numerical simulation of water
quality dynamics and pollution transport processes.  Extensive use is made of
an "in-house"  version of the EPA's WASP modeling system,  modified to allow
the water quality component to interface with the Princeton Ocean Model. 
Conservative substance transport models have been developed for use in the
Thermaikos Gulf.  Work is also being performed in the nearshore area, with
particular attention to the dispersion characteristics of the surf zone.  The
group conducts limited water quality field data acquisition in the Thermaikos
Gulf.  Professor Ganoulis is also heavily involved in engineering risk analysis
as applied to water pollution problems.<P>

The author, who represented the Office of Naval Research in London
as a liaison scientist from 1992 to 1995, presents an in-depth
technical assessment of electronic R&amp;D in Europe. The report
covers topics in electronics, which are of interest to ONR,  the
US defense establishment, and the general S&amp;T community. He
has focussed on activities in solid state and vacuum electronics
R&amp;D in the various regions in Europe, with emphasis on Germany
and the Former Soviet Union.  Observations are based on his personal
visits to leading R&amp;D institutions in Europe and his interaction
with scientists, engineers, and S&amp;T managers throughout Europe.
 Topics covered include design, processing, measurement methodology,
 and manufacturing of electronic components. The report explores
business strategy, as well as the driving forces behind European
electronic S&amp;T development. The most recent technological
breakthroughs in MMICs and optoelectronic ICs are highlighted,
and the European approach to monolithic microwave IC development
is compared to current US activities in this field. The author
comments upon the impact of the new economic and political reality
in central and eastern Europe on electronic S&amp;T, presenting
assessments and recommendations when warranted.<BR>

<P>
<FONT COLOR=#000000>This report summarizes my activities as a
liaison scientist at ONREUR London from September 1992 to November
1995. The report covers topics in electronics of interest to ONR
and the US defense establishment. The views expressed here reflect
my own biases as a research scientist with experience in electronic
material and devices for the past 30 years.  My observations are
based on numerous personal visits to leading R&amp;D institutions
in Europe and on interaction with scientists, engineers, and S&amp;T
managers throughout Europe. My assessment and recommendations
reflect my strong view that electronic S&amp;T in Europe is healthy,
growing, sometimes very innovative, and of potential benefit to
the DoD community in the US.<BR>

<P>
Germany is emerging as a leader in numerous electronic-related
technologies. Driven by social, political, and market forces,
German S&amp;T managers are restructuring existing electronic
related programs and are engaged in long-range R&amp;D planning.
 The German S&amp;T blueprint in electronics includes a quest
for higher information and energy density storage devices; smaller,
faster, and more powerful computers; new methods to synthesize,
measure, manipulate, and utilize atomic and molecular structures
(nanotechnology); and new systems for information processing and
communication. Some of the latest innovations include<BR>

<P>
<FONT COLOR=#000000>1. Design of new tools and process methodologies
for fabricating high-frequency monolithic microwave and millimeter
wave integrated circuits (MMICs).  This development has direct
impact on the mobile communication and the automotive industry.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT COLOR=#000000>2. Novel techniques for measuring high-frequency
electronic components using the latest scientific innovations
pioneered in Europe, e.g., the use of proximal probes such as
the scanning force microscope (SFM) to test MMICs with nanometer
spatial resolution and temporal resolution up to 100 GHz.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT COLOR=#000000>3. Manufacture of inexpensive plastic packaging
for MMICs that are applicable up to 12 GHz operation. These devices
are targeted for commercial and military microwave products, 
e.g., phased array radar (PAR) that use MMIC chips.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT COLOR=#000000>4. Rapid development of application-specific
integrated circuits (ASICs); the integ-ration of electronics with
sensors and miniature mechanical actuators. This fast-paced R&amp;D
is driven by market demands in high-volume, consumer-oriented
chemical, medical, and automobile industries. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT COLOR=#000000>5. Strong support and participation in the
European Commission's Framework Programs targeting information
and communication technologies, e.g., ESPRIT (European Strategic
Program for R&amp;D in Information Technology) and RACE (R&amp;D
in Advanced Communication Technology in Europe). These programs
have serious implications for how Germany and the European Union
will compete within the global information technology market.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT COLOR=#000000>I recommend that we in the DoD<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT COLOR=#000000>1.  look closer at some of these German innovations,
especially the computer-aided design (CAD) of coplanar MMIC chips
and the plastic packaging methodology, to reduce even further
the cost associated with manufacturing our own MMICs for military
systems.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT COLOR=#000000>2. initiate our own R&amp;D program in real-time,
high spatial and temporal resolution testing methodology of MMICs.
 Such dynamic high-frequency testing will be imperative for developing
future communication and millimeter wave DoD system components.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT COLOR=#000000>3. keep a close watch on the &quot;smart&quot;
sensor technology development in Europe.   Although the US still
leads in the manufacturing of such components, the Europeans,
and the Germans in particular, are tooling up for production in
many of their industrial sectors. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT COLOR=#000000>4. keep close ties with the German scientific
community involved in nano-scale R&amp;D.  The Germans have proven
to be leaders in nanoscience; their ministry for S&amp;T is vigorously
funding nanotechnology. They are determined to harvest economic
and social benefits from this scientific discipline in the future.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT COLOR=#000000>5. follow closely the European information
and communication programs. For example,  Germany, in collaboration
with other European Union countries, is vigorously pursuing digital
mobile communication. The Europeans have been leading the world
in digital communication development and are determined to establish
new global standards in it, e.g., the establishment of the new
European Digital Communication System (DCS) standard and pursuing
the development of the Mobile Broadband System (MBS) for digital-based
networking in the 21th Century. These developments are bound to
impact our own information technology strategy.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<I> Russia<BR>
</I>
<P>
<FONT COLOR=#000000>Russia and many of the republics of the Former
Soviet Union (FSU) offer a window of opportunity in selected areas
of electronic-related S&amp;T of strategic importance to the DoD.
Among these are the following.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
1.  Vacuum microwave devices based on concepts less developed
in the West. For example,  vacuum devices that do not use the
conventional &quot;bunching&quot; principle to extract microwave
energy found in traditional klystrons and TWTs. The Russians have
developed novel approaches for extracting microwave energy  based
on transverse grouping of homogeneous electron beam in circularly
polarized electromagnetic fields (in resonant cavities and slow-wave
structures). This approach circumvents the limitation imposed
by bunching and leads to improved device performance, e.g., super
linearity in device characteristics such as frequency and phase.
Specific devices include<BR>
<UL>
<LI>High-power Circularly Polarized TWTs (CPTWT)<BR>
<LI>High-power Cyclotron-Wave Converters (CWC)<BR>
<LI>Low-noise Cyclotron-Wave Parametric Amplifier (CWPA) <BR>
<LI>Cyclotron-Wave Electrostatic Amplifiers (CWESA)<BR>
<LI>Narrowband Controlled CWESA-Filters<BR>
<LI>Cyclotron-Wave Phase Shifters (CWPS)<P></UL>

2.  Multibeam Klystrons (MBKs) for radar applications. Compared
to standard klystron for equivalent power levels, the multibeam
cathode klystron offers:<P>
<UL>
<LI>Higher efficiency (55-70%) and lower operating voltage (25-35 kV)<BR>
<LI>High dynamic range of output power (from tens of kW to tens of MW)<BR>
<LI>Reduced power supply size and weight<BR>
<LI>No arcing and voltage breakdown<BR>
<LI>Gun isolation in air (not oil)<BR>
<LI>No need for X-ray shielding (reduced level of harmful X-ray emission)<BR>
<LI>Easier handling and better reliability<BR>
</UL>
<P>
<FONT COLOR=#000000>3. Russian research and development in the
area of high power gyro-amplifiers at millimeter wave has been
ongoing for many years, and is considered to be more extensive
than anywhere else in the world. The existence of powerful 35
GHz and 94 GHz gyro-klystrons for radar developed in Russia during
the last 15 years became public knowledge only about 2 years ago.
Russian  contributions include the following gyro-klystrons:<BR>
<UL>
<LI>three-cavity, 250 kW peak power, half-power bandwidth of 1.5 % at 35 GHz, gain
of 40 dB and 32% efficiency<BR>

<B>1.  INTRODUCTION<BR>
</B>
<P>
<FONT COLOR=#000000>Electronic science and technology are the
cornerstone of modern warfare. Nearly all Navy hardware rely on
electronic and electro-optic systems to meet required objectives.
The future needs in electronics will be even more demanding in
terms of high-speed, low-power consumption and high-reliability
components. Fundamental to achieving planned device performance
levels is the development of novel materials and the understanding
of their underlying physics. The task at hand is the speedy insertion
of new developments in research into the application community
within the Navy and DoD. Because US leadership in electronics
is currently being challenged by foreign competitors, it is more
important than ever that the US research establishment be kept
abreast of the latest progress in Europe (and Japan). <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT COLOR=#000000>It was therefore one of my main objectives
at ONREUR to assess emerging science and technology (S&amp;T)
in electronics, and to serve as a bridge between leading European
scientists and the Navy's scientific staff concerned with electronics.
The resulting assessment is summarized in this report. It should
be stressed, however, that the viewpoints expressed in this report
reflect my own biases and background in electronics and are not
intended to be all encompassing.  The report focusses on S&amp;T
in only a few European countries that, in my opinion, represent
the regional trends.  For more extensive detail, the reader is
referred to Appendix C, which lists the titles of newsletters
written by this author, copies of which can be obtained from ONREUR
in London.<BR>

<B>2. GERMANY: NEW CHALLENGER IN ELECTRONIC S&amp;T  <BR>
</B>
<P>
<FONT COLOR=#000000>The Federal Republic of Germany (FRG) has
a well-organized national S&amp;T program, a large part of which
impacts the electronic-based infrastructure. The strength of the
German electronic S&amp;T lies in the strategy of forging ahead
in R&amp;D areas in which it feels it can compete with the US
and Japan - or even lead. Although there are some universities
and research laboratories that pursue &quot;me too-ish&quot; activities,
as a whole, the Germans have proven to be independent thinkers
and innovators.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B> A. National Focussed Programs: III/V-Electronics and Photonics
<BR>
</B>
<P>
<FONT COLOR=#000000>Much of the success of German innovation can
be attributed to well thought-out, long range planning. Usually
the best and most prestigious scientists of the country participate
in guiding German S&amp;T. Scientists and engineers from the Ministry
of S&amp;T and Education, universities, industry, and scientific
societies such as the Fraunhofer and Max-Planck serve on advisory
committees that set priorities and guidelines for electronic programs.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT COLOR=#000000>A good example of this S&amp;T &quot;forging&quot;
is the National Focussed Programs in III/V-Electronics and Photonics.
Started in 1990, this program concentrates on R&amp;D projects
that have transition potential in the civilian sector. The research
consortium &quot;III/V-Elektronik&quot; will enable the German
semiconductor industry to achieve a competitive edge in micro-
and opto-electronic IC technologies. Accomplishments would also
secure a larger demand for German made GaAs substrates, which
until recently have dominated the world GaAs market.  The main
goals of this III-V program are to<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT COLOR=#000000>1. Develop the technology of high-frequency
integrated circuits for future electronic systems, systems that
will have an impact on transportation safety, monitoring of the
environment, and communication. The Germans anticipate an increased
market demand for<BR>
</FONT>
<P><UL>
<LI>Safer transportation-related systems such as collision sensing radars,
<BR>
<LI>New environmental monitoring systems, such as millimeter wave sensors
and systems for traffic control, and<BR>
<LI>New
communications systems, such as short distance communication using
millimeter wave, and ultra-high data rate transmission in fiber-optic
networks.<BR></UL>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT COLOR=#000000>All of the above applications call for higher
complexity, density, and component integration in the microelectronic
chip.  <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
2. Focus on III/V semiconductor structures of very small dimension.
Structures in this nanometer-scale or quantum regime reveal interesting
new electronic and optical properties and have lead to new electronic
device concepts. Examples of some of these new structures include
quantum-wells, -wires, and -dots. Applications include very efficient
quantum-well lasers, very fast transistors, and new detectors
for the near and far infrared.<BR>

<P>
<FONT COLOR=#000000>3. Integrate the abovementioned mesoscopic
structures into functional elements and leap into the domain of
&quot;nanoelectronics,&quot; a realm beyond the limits of present
day electronics. The kernel of this research is the development
of new tools that will allow the realization of multifunctional
circuit elements, e.g., electronics and optoelectronics on the
same chip.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT COLOR=#000000>4. Develop integrated optoelectronic components
(e.g., laser sources, detectors, and optical couplers) and use
them in prototype communication systems. The realization of such
systems hinges on two compound semiconductors: InP for the 1.3
to 1.5 </FONT><FONT COLOR=#000000 FACE="Symbol">m</FONT><FONT COLOR=#000000>m
wavelength application, and GaAs for the shorter 0.9 </FONT><FONT COLOR=#000000 FACE="Symbol">m</FONT><FONT COLOR=#000000>m
wavelength application. The leading coordinators for this two-tier
project are: for InP, the FhG Heinrich-Hertz-Institut for Telecommunication
in Berlin; and for GaAs, the Fraunhofer Institute for Applied
Physics (FhG-IAF) in Freiburg. A total of 15 institutions are
involved in these projects.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT COLOR=#000000>Some major successes from this program include:
<UL><LI>The development of new design tools and process methodology for monolithic
microwave and millimeter wave integrated circuits (MMICs), e.g.,
the use of coplanar waveguide technology in the fabrication of
high frequency MMICs (see Report #1 for details). Much of this
pioneering work was done at the FhG-IAF in Freiburg.  This laboratory
also conceived the integration of high-frequency RF and optical
components on a GaAs chip. They have been so successful in this
niche technology that the German Ministry of S&amp;T is entrusting
FhG-IAF to develop the next generation, InP-based, 40 Gbit/sec
opto-electronic ICs under their new Photonic 2 program.<BR>
<LI>The
design, processing, and fabrication of a MMIC amplifier based
on a 0.18 micron gate (pseudomorphic) PM-HEMT (25% In in the InGaAs
channel). The two-stage version has a gain of 10 dB at 60 GHz
with a noise figure of 4 dB. A three-stage unit achieves a 37
dB gain. <BR>
<LI>The
development of an active phase array IC consisting of a 4-bit
analog phase shifter integrated with a digital controller.<BR>
<LI>The
development of a 5-stage distributed amplifier with a gain of
9.3 dB over the 5 GHz to 60 GHz frequency range (with a noise
figure less than 4.3 dB up to 60 GHz); and a narrowband, 3-stage,
low-noise amplifier (LNA) with more than 21 dB gain between 70
and 80 GHz (with a noise figure of 6.4 dB at 76 GHz). These MMIC
amplifiers are the first of its kind using coplanar waveguide
technology; the 21 dB gain from 70 to 80 GHz is believed to be
the highest gain yet reported on any MMIC amplifier above 40 GHz
for both GaAs- and InP- based circuits.<BR>
<LI>Novel
measurement techniques for measuring high-frequency electronic
components, e.g., the use of proximal probes such as the scanning
force microscope (SFM) and near-field scanning optical microscope
(NSOM) to test MMICs with nanometer spatial resolution and temporal
resolution up to 100 GHz [see News #39 for details].<BR></UL>

<B> B. Industrial R&amp;D Initiatives in III/V Electronics<BR>
</B>
<P>
<FONT COLOR=#000000>In contrast to the high-risk approach pursued
at FhG-IAF, the R&amp;D modus operandi at industrial laboratories
such as AEG Daimler-Benz and Siemens is much more conservative.
This philosophy derives from their profit-oriented business strategy.
Their semiconductor and GaAs R&amp;D is closely linked to systems
applications, which is the true basis for their profit. Although
no risk takers, the German industrial laboratories are well focussed
in their R&amp;D programs as exemplified by Siemens and illustrated
below.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B> C. Case History: Siemens <BR>
</B>
<P>
<FONT COLOR=#000000>Siemens is ranked as the third largest producer
of electronic components (after Philips and Thomson) in Europe
and the sixth largest electronic supplier in the world. It provides
more GaAs parts than any US company and spends about 8B DM ($5B)
or 10% of its total income on R&amp;D. 300M DM of this is earmarked
for semiconductor R&amp;D. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT COLOR=#000000>The company's business strategy for manufacturing
semiconductor products (including GaAs) can be summarized as:
high volume, high performance, small and flexible production lines,
use of Si production resources for GaAs processing as much as
possible, and use of well-developed processing technologies. Siemens
is a very profit-oriented company and, as a result, conservative
about implementing high-risk technologies in unproven markets.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT COLOR=#000000>Semiconductor products fall into the following
categories:<BR>
<UL><LI>Dedicated ICs, 39%,<BR>
<LI>Memory, 28%,<BR>
<LI>Small signal, 10%,<BR>
<LI>Optoelectronics, 12%, and <BR>
<LI>Semi-custom devices, 4%.<BR></UL>
<P>
<FONT COLOR=#000000>The split between silicon MOS devices and
small signal GaAs devices is about 50/50. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT COLOR=#000000>Products that are competitive on a global
scale include discretes (MESFETs and HEMTs) and MMICs for consumer
applications (DBS, Mobile Communication, Radar). In 1993, Siemens
fabricated about 6 million GaAs discretes and more than 500,000
MMICs. The major microelectronic products are dedicated ICs, standard
ICs, discrete semiconductors, and opto-electronics. The application
drivers are consumer electronics, telecommunication, industrial
electronics, automotive and transport, data communications, military,
and space. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT COLOR=#000000>The following is a short summary of the most
important markets in which Siemens is competing.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<I><B><FONT COLOR=#000000> 1. Consumer Electronics <BR>
</FONT></B></I>
<P>
<FONT COLOR=#000000>The consumer electronics is the largest volume
market at the moment headed by Direct Broadcasting Satellite (DBS)
application. The key GaAs component is the low-noise converter
(LNC) for DBS reception.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT COLOR=#000000>Siemens together with GEC-Marconi produces
DBS MESFET LNCs covering different subbands between 10.95 and
12.5 GHz. The circuit comprises an LNA, an active mixer, a local
oscillator<B> </B>(LO), an intermediate frequency<B> </B>(IF)
amplifier, and an on-chip filter. The Siemens 4 mm square components
have achieved over 30 dB conversion gain and better than 6 dB
noise figure. The associated HEMT LNA MMIC has a gain of 19 dB,
NF of 1.25 dB, and S11/S22 better than 10 dB between 11-12.5 GHz.

<I><B><FONT COLOR=#000000> 2. Telecommunications <BR>
</FONT></B></I>
<P>
<FONT COLOR=#000000>Mobile communication is the fastest growing
market in Europe headed by cellular or cordless telephones. The
market is expected to increase from 2.6 million units in 1990
to 100M by year 2000. The second generation of mobile communication
services is characterized by the change from analog to digital
transmission techniques. The new system standard is fixed by the
GSM (Group Special Mobile) telephone system. It will be the first
mobile communication standard to be introduced all over Europe.
The first version at 900 MHz is already operational; the second
generation at 1.8 GHz, called PCN or DCS1800 (Personal Communication
Network or Digital European Cordless Telephone) was just introduced
last year.<BR>

package (good to 12 GHz and usable to 180 degrees C) for their
commercial microwave products. Other GaAs items include a 1.8

</FONT></B></I>
<P>
<FONT COLOR=#000000>A major military application is phased array
radar (PAR), which uses active transmit/receive (T/R) modules
in quantities of some hundreds to a few thousand GaAs components.
A typical T/R module consists of a set of GaAs MMICs such as LNA,
VGA, PHS (phase shifter), switches, and medium and high power
amplifiers (MPA, HPA). The special requirements for this module
are low NF for the receiver, high accuracy for the phase/gain
control units, and highest possible PAE for the HPA to reduce
power consumption of the antenna.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT COLOR=#000000>Detailed information about device performance
for space and military applications can be found in Report #3.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT COLOR=#000000>Siemens is making money on the GaAs foundry
through sales of GaAs parts for the merchant market (mostly commercial).
It uses the most developed and reliable process technology to
cut cost. Commercial cost drivers increase efficiency of resource
utilization and lead to competitiveness. The maxim is to use the
material and technology that proves to be &quot;good enough&quot;
(including packages). Siemens' success with plastic packaging
warrants a closer look at our own DoD programs to reduce MMIC
costs even further.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT COLOR=#000000>This conservative, low-risk approach may be
short sighted. They may have to rely on outside R&amp;D breakthroughs
for their future S&amp;T base. To provide breadth to their research
programs, Siemens is funding research at some of the most prestigious
universities and non-profit laboratories in Germany.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT COLOR=#000000>Siemens planners anticipate a booming market
in DBS, mobile communication, wireless LAN, and ASICs in the next
few years and are taking proper steps now to position themselves
as a major provider of GaAs-based components in Europe and the
world.<BR>

<B> D.  The Role of Former East Germany: Personal Observation
<BR>
</B>
<P>
<FONT COLOR=#000000>The formal unification of East-West Germany
on October 3, 1990 marked a historic event for the German people
and the world. It brought together two countries that were ideologically
separate for almost four decades and unleashed political and social
changes that are still being felt today.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT COLOR=#000000>The unification also heralded major changes
within the East German scientific community. Right from the start,
the government in Bonn set up a Science Advisory Council to evaluate
the different scientific disciplines in East Germany and to implement
a restructuring of its infrastructure in the &quot;western mold.&quot;
This whole evaluation process was finished by the end of 1992.
By the beginning of 1993, the federal government set in motion
sweeping changes within the former East German S&amp;T establishment
(see News #13 &amp; 23 and Report # 2). Some of the key changes
in the former S&amp;T establishment include:<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT COLOR=#000000>1. reducing the scientific and technical staff,</FONT>
<P>
<FONT COLOR=#000000>2. laying off the &quot;old guard,&quot;</FONT>
<P>
<FONT COLOR=#000000>3. abolishing the former Academy of Sciences
structure,</FONT>
<P>
<FONT COLOR=#000000>4. establishing new Max-Planck and Fraunhofer
institutes, </FONT>
<P>
<FONT COLOR=#000000>5. appointing new leaders in the newly established
institutions, and</FONT>
<P>
<FONT COLOR=#000000>6. reinstating research within the new academic
environment.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT COLOR=#000000>Over the past 3 years, I was privileged to
visit many of these new institutions and to witness this metamorphosis
first hand. Here are some of my personal observations:<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT COLOR=#000000 FACE="Symbol">_ </FONT><FONT COLOR=#000000>The
restructuring of the former S&amp;T institutions by West German
scientists was necessary but fair. Today, many senior professors
who were privileged under the old Communist regime continue enjoying
financial security under generous German pension plans. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT COLOR=#000000 FACE="Symbol">_ </FONT><FONT COLOR=#000000>Although
the initial impact of German unification was severe, the last
five years have heralded a new sense of optimism among the citizens
of East Germany. In contrast to a year or two ago, when the population
seemed to be in a catatonic trance, people today are more confident
and smiling. Service in stores and restaurants is polite and efficient.
There is the feeling of &quot;can do.&quot; Major reconstruction
is taking place: highways, roads, streets are being repaired;
new rail and telephone lines are being installed; old buildings
are repaired and historical sites restored; and new shopping centers
are mushrooming everywhere.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT COLOR=#000000 FACE="Symbol">_ </FONT><FONT COLOR=#000000>Before
1990, the German Democratic Republic (GDR) was a major contributor
to electronic technology within the Eastern Block. The electronic
R&amp;D centers were located at Berlin, Erfurt, Freiberg, Leipzig,
and Dresden. Most of this R&amp;D was done at the GDR Academy
of Sciences, industrial laboratories, and to a minor extent, at
the universities. Berlin was the hub for processing of microcircuits
and semiconductor lasers, although most computer-related development
and processing took place at &quot;Robotron&quot; in Sommerda
near Erfurt.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT COLOR=#000000 FACE="Symbol">_ </FONT><FONT COLOR=#000000>Today,
most of these R&amp;D sites have been either taken over by West
German firms, have been completely restructured, or have simply
been shut down. For example, Wacker-Chemitronic, the pioneer of
GaAs and one of the world leading manufacturer of GaAs wafers,
transferred its GaAs production facilities from West Germany to
Freiberger Electronic Materials (Freiberger Elektronikwerkstoffe,
FEW), a new GaAs production complex located in Freiberg/Sachsen.
Most of the electronic R&amp;D that was formerly done at the GDR
Academy of Sciences is now performed at so-called &quot;Blue-List&quot;
research laboratories or at newly established Fraunhofer institutes.
The most notable among them are the Paul-Drude Institute for Solid
State Electronics in Berlin, Institute for Semiconductor Physics
in Frankfurt (Oder), Ferdinand-Braun Institute for High Frequency
Communication Technology and Optoelectronics in Berlin, and the
Fraunhofer Institute for Microelectronic Circuits and Systems
in Dresden (for a complete listing and information, see News #13).
The newly formed Max-Planck Institute of Microstructure Physics
in Halle has new leaders and is playing a key role within the
German electronic R&amp;D community.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT COLOR=#000000 FACE="Symbol">_ </FONT><FONT COLOR=#000000>Finally,
it is important to add that today, with the new scientific order
in Germany, the research institutions in East Germany represent
an added intellectual force to Germany. They also offer a vital
link to the former Eastern Block states. The former ties with
Russia are still very strong. As East Germany transitions into
a fully integrated democratic Germany, this connectivity will
play an important role in bridging the two worlds. Such bridging
will bring together not only the scientific communities, but will
hopefully spill over into all the other cultural and social ramifications
of life.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT COLOR=#000000>I, personally, have no doubt that a region
which was the nurturing place for giants like Martin Luther, Johann
Wolfgang Goethe, Johann Friedrich Schiller, Johann Sebastian Bach,
and Georg Friedrich Handel will re-emerge from the ashes and will
play again a leading role in shaping the next millennium. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B> E. Lessons Learned, Assessment, and Recommendations<BR>
</B>
<P>
<FONT COLOR=#000000>German R&amp;D institutions have shown to
be innovative and pace-setters in the world of high-technology
electronics. They have demonstrated some of the latest state-of-the-art
design, processing, and testing facilities as good as anywhere.
National processing facilities such as the FhG-IAF are available
for joint projects and are run by crews of highly trained and
talented engineers. The management is efficient and the R&amp;D
well focussed. In the case of MMIC and optoelectronic IC development,
the long-term R&amp;D strategy has proven to be excellent as exemplified
by many &quot;world records&quot; and bodes well for the future
of German GaAs based technology.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT COLOR=#000000>Based on numerous visits to key laboratories
involved in RF and MMIC R&amp;D in Germany, it is safe to conclude
that the Germans are on a par with the US when it comes to exploiting
the GaAs-based technology. The MMIC R&amp;D in Germany is much
more commercially oriented than that in the US, where manufacturers
of MMICs are much more inclined to remain in their R&amp;D mode
as long as military applications dominate. This is beginning to
change as new commercial markets are calling for ever increasing
numbers of MMIC components. German manufacturers like Siemens
are convinced that money can be made with GaAs-based products
and are positioning themselves in the lead.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT COLOR=#000000>In the past five years, US DoD has invested
heavily in developing MMICs through programs such as the MIMIC
ARPA/Tri-Service initiative. The major objective of this heavily
subsidized government program was the anticipated improvement
in performance of present and future radar systems. The DoD expects
that, by investing in this MMIC technology, it will drive down
the procurement costs of such systems, provided that the technology
will spill-over into the commercial sector. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT COLOR=#000000>Now that DoD is facing cutbacks, it is imperative
that the MIMIC industrial community seek continuity in their programs
in the private sector. In a declining budget scenario, leveraging
by commercial interest becomes paramount. It is hoped that US
manufacturers, now active in the MIMIC program, will pay closer
attention to their competitors in Europe. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT COLOR=#000000>I recommend that the US keep abreast of the
German efforts in MMIC technology and that US government and industrial
laboratories forge a closer link with some of their MMIC programs.

Devices<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT COLOR=#000000>Much of Russian S&amp;T in electronics during
the Communist era was defense related. Most of our awareness of
their scientific contribution to this important field is just
emerging thanks to the breakup of the Soviet Union<B>.</B>  One
discipline in electronics in which the Russians excelled is vacuum
electronics. This is not surprising since the Russians always
lacked the advanced, market-driven infrastructure of solid state
electronics found in the West and, thus, channeled their R&amp;D
efforts into developing sophisticated vacuum-based electronics,
particularly microwave power devices. In the last few years, much
of this technology has been unveiled for closer scrutiny by Western
scientists.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT COLOR=#000000>A good example of this type of R&amp;D can
be found at the prestigious Moscow State University (MSU). Here,
the Microwave Electronics and Space Power Systems Group has been
developing vacuum microwave electronic devices that do not use
a conventional &quot;bunching&quot; principle to extract microwave
energy, e.g., traditional klystrons and TWTs. Instead, they are
developing new methods of energy exchange where electron-electron
interaction due to close proximity (bunching) is not a problem.
Their approach is totally novel. Microwave energy extraction is
based on transverse grouping of homogeneous electron beam in circularly
polarized electromagnetic fields (in resonant cavities and slow-wave
structures). This approach circumvents the limitation imposed
by bunching and leads to improved device performance, e.g., super
linearity in device characteristics such as frequency and phase.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT COLOR=#000000>Using these principles and realistic 3-D computer
simulation, the MSU group have succeeded in designing new types
of microwave devices. Many of these experimental prototypes have
been manufactured and tested at various microwave factories throughout
the FSU. One of their products is a microwave-power-to-dc voltage
converter used in wireless power transmission applications, e.g.,
space power systems. <BR>

</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT COLOR=#000000>The multibeam klystron (MBK) concept was first
proposed by US scientists in the early 1950s but was never developed.
The Soviets took the concept seriously and developed it into a
product that is currently used in many Russian radar systems.
The idea is to distribute and control not one, but multiple electron
beams in the klystron cathode. The low current of each electron
beam leads to low perveance and high efficiency. Since the total
current (NxI) is high, the cathode voltage is considerably lower
than in a conventional klystron. The net gain in design is<BR>

<P>
<FONT COLOR=#000000>The gain, power output and the frequency bandwidth
increase nonlinearly with the number of beams.  The overall improvement
is dramatic: higher efficiency (55-70%), lower operating voltage
(25-35 kV) and high dynamic range of output power (from tens of
 kW to tens of MW).<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT COLOR=#000000>Many institutes and universities were involved
in the development of MBKs during the Soviet era. These included
the Moscow State University, Moscow Power Engineering Institute,
and State Research and Production Corporation &quot;ISTOK&quot;
(an electronic factory outside Moscow).  Although the MBK technology
and know-how is still proprietary, the units can be purchased
from at least two sources in Russia. Recently, Svetlana-Electronpribor
of St. Petersburg has been circulating specifications of various
multibeam klystron amplifiers for sale to the West.<BR>

</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT COLOR=#000000>Russian research and development in the area
of high power gyro-amplifiers at millimeter wave has been ongoing
for many years,  and is considered to be more extensive than anywhere
else in the world. The existence of powerful 35 GHz and 94 GHz
gyro-klystrons for radar developed in Russia during the last 15
years became public knowledge only about 2 years ago. Russian
 contributions include the following:<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT COLOR=#000000 FACE="Symbol">_ </FONT><FONT COLOR=#000000>the
design of powerful three-cavity gyro-klystrons (developed by the
Institute of Applied Physics (IAP) in Nizhny, Novgorod and the
Moscow-based microwave industry TORY), which are capable of  200
to 250 kW peak power and half-power bandwidth of about 1 to 1.5
% at 35 GHz. This gyro-klystron utilizes a triode magnetron injection
gun for production of electron beam at beam voltage of  50 to
60 kV and beam current up to 15 A. These tubes have been used
in Russian radar as powerful transmitters in a three-stage amplification
chain: solid state amplifier-TWT- gyro-klystron. The gain of the
gyro-klystron is 40 dB and the efficiency is 32%.<BR>

gun to produce electron beam at beam voltage of 25 kV and beam
current of 1 A. The instantaneous half-power bandwidth of the
gyro-klystron is 0.3%.  Considering the capabilities offered by
this device, it is quite compact: its maximum length, height,

</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT COLOR=#000000>Another example of Russian ingenuity in electronics
involves using the latest computer chips developed in the US for
improving the graphics capability of PCs. This work is done by
a group of talented young engineers at the Computer Design Group
of the Microelectronic Center at MSU. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT COLOR=#000000>During the Communist regime, this same group
was in charge of developing the Soviet equivalent of our PC. The
result was modest by Western standards, but the knowledge base
was enormous. Today, this group is able to engage in creative,
new hardware projects thanks to the availability of US-made microchips
that are no longer  on the restricted export list.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT COLOR=#000000>Using US made programmable microchips and
hardware design tools, they have, for example, built a high-speed
accelerator board called Corvette 860RGB. The Corvette 860RGB
board consists of an 80 MFLOPS 64-bit Intel i80860 chip, 16 MB
of system RAM with extreme access speed, and a high-resolution
true color graphics subsystem with 4 MB of direct-access, dedicated
VRAM video buffer. The unit fits a standard PC and can be used
for image processing, scientific calculations, true color desktop
publishing, computer-aided design (CAD), and 3-D simulation and
animation. The Corvette 860RGB comes with software and graphics
primitives libraries and is compatible with NDP, PGI, STAR860,
and GNU compilers.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT COLOR=#000000>This is a good example of combining Russian
ingenuity with the achievements of Western high technology to
produce new products that may yet compete in a world market. The
abovementioned hardware prototype and its performance is impressive.
The question is whether Russian electronic factories are flexible
enough to mass produce them. One thing is certain, perestroika
has provided the Russian military unprecedented access to advanced
computer design tool technology.<BR>

<B><FONT COLOR=#000000> 5. High-temperature Electronics<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT COLOR=#000000>Electronic devices based on SiC and GaN semiconductors
are finding numerous applications in the automotive, aircraft,
and other commercial and defense sectors.  Both SiC and GaN have
shown potential as light emitting diodes in the blue and blue-green
region of the spectrum while cubic SiC appears to be the best
candidate for high-power, high-temperature electronic applications.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT COLOR=#000000>The US and Japan have expended substantial
R&amp;D effort on these materials in the past decade. The USSR
also had an intensive R&amp;D effort in these materials for at
least two decades before its collapse. Much of this work was done
for the military and only recently has the West had a glimpse
as to the extent of these activities. Much of the early information
about FSU SiC research came from Russian scientists who either
emigrated to the US or attended international conferences in the
West.  A more complete picture of the FSU's capabilities in high-temperature
electronic materials emerged in recent visits by DoD scientists
(among them this author) to key Russian and Ukrainian institutions
involved in SiC and GaN research.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT COLOR=#000000>Many groups in Russia and Ukraine are working
on SiC and GaN today.  Among them, the Ioffe Physical-Technical
Institute and the Leningrad Electro Technical Institute (LETI)
in St. Petersburg are the most eminent.  Both of these groups
have been working on SiC, GaN, and related compounds for the past
three decades (see author's Newsletter #30 on Electronics). Recent
advances in epitaxial growth of AlN, GaN, InGaN by MBE and CVD,
are challenging these institutes to revisit some of their previous
experimental approaches in growing GaN. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT COLOR=#000000>One of these approaches is to grow thick GaN
by the so-called sublimation sandwich technique. Here, ammonia
is streamed past a GaN powder or polycrystalline substrate in
close proximity to a SiC substrate. GaN grows best on 6H-SiC at
1150 C, although growth on Si is also possible. Growth rates can
be as high as 0.5 mm/hr. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT COLOR=#000000>As early as 1975, Prof. Vodakov and collaborators
at Ioffe showed that this approach can produce 0.5 mm thick free-standing,
high-quality GaN substrates after the SiC substrate is etched
away. This project has been revived, and Vodakov, along with Drs.
Mokhov and Roenkov, are now planning to grow thick GaN on 25 mm
diameter or larger SiC substrates.  <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT COLOR=#000000>The other group at Ioffe doing SiC or GaN
research and headed by Prof. Chelnokov were not forthcoming on
what they are doing. I had a short talk with Dr. Alexander Lebedev
from this group; he is apparently collaborating with the University
of Arizona Optical Sciences Center and Topaz in New Mexico on
SiC related projects. Cree-East is collocated with this group,
but they were not disposed to talk to strangers. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT COLOR=#000000>The last group in St. Petersburg involved
with SiC and GaN is LETI (now St. Petersburg State Electrical
Engineering University) headed by Prof. Yuri M. Tairov. Dr. Pitchugin,
who works for Tairov, has built a CVD reactor in which both SiC
and GaN have been grown in the past. The system is currently being
duplicated by Chelnokov's group (with Cree funding). Prof. Tairov
is well known in the West for his pioneering work in SiC. He has
an active group in bulk SiC growth and a first class characterization
laboratory headed by Dr. Pikhtin. I was pleasantly surprised by
the openness, candor, and urbane manner of Prof. Tairov. He is
a scientist and leader in the best tradition. <BR>

</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT COLOR=#000000>I met Dr. Raphael Kucherov from ISTOK and
had an interesting discussion about using boron-10 isotope for
n-doping diamond films. This research is done in collaboration
with the Institute of Stable Isotopes in Tbilisi, Georgia and
was first disclosed to the West at the International Diamond conference
held in Lisbon in 1993. The concept involves utilizing 99.6% pure
boron-10 isotope during diamond film growth. The more abundant
boron-11 incorporates readily into diamond during film growth
but gives rise to p-type conduction.  Doping with boron-10 followed
by neutron irradiation leads to Li incorporation and n-type doping.
N-type doping of diamond is extremely difficult because of the
low incorporation and activation when using conventional N or
Li.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT COLOR=#000000>This group also synthesized boron carbide
with the isotope B10. This new material apparently has a thermal
conductivity 2.5 times higher and a sound velocity 20% higher
than normal boron carbide.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B> B. The Ukrainian R&amp;D Dilemma</B>
<P>
 
<P>
<FONT COLOR=#000000>Despite this highly developed S&amp;T infrastructure,
Ukrainian science is facing severe difficulties due to a general
economic emergency and the slow pace of conversion towards a free
market economy.  The average wage in Ukraine is currently 10 to
15 dollars per month, as compared to 60 to 80 dollars per month
in Russia.  Inflation is approximately 100 percent per month.
As of this writing, Ukraine still does not have a national currency.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT COLOR=#000000>Given such a chaotic economic infrastructure,
the Ukrainian scientists and institutions are handicapped doing
research even when funded by US or European agencies.  For example,
the Ukrainian government insists that at least 50% of the foreign
grant for R&amp;D be converted to local &quot;coupons&quot; at
the official government rate, which is about 1/3 the market rate.
If the project needs equipment or supplies, these must be purchased
with hard currency.  To complicate matters, the institutes are
constrained to support their full work force with any contract
money they receive.  It is not possible for institutions to layoff
workers who don't have projects, so their salaries are taken from
active projects.  This is particularly difficult since the scientific
research structure had been created for the USSR as a whole, and
is now much larger than can be supported by the needs of Ukraine
as an independent country.  By the time taxes and overhead are
added, there is very little left for doing the scientific research.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT COLOR=#000000>As a consequence of this economic situation,
institutions such as the Academy of Science are struggling to
find ways to combat what they call the &quot;external and internal
brain drain&quot; - an uncontrolled exodus of scientists leaving
the country for opportunities abroad, and those who leave science
for jobs such as driving taxis, which can pay much more.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT COLOR=#000000>The most frustrating aspect of this dilemma
is the abundance of apathy towards changing things. There seems
to be no obvious effort made to convert what used to be defense-related
high technology R&amp;D activities to new commercial ventures
that could benefit the country as a whole. The old system is very
pervasive. Most scientists I talked to were reserved about revealing
who is doing what and where. There is still fear on one hand,
and ignorance on the other, to divulge information about R&amp;D,
a legacy from the old days. Even today, each scientist has only
a narrow view of his/her own research field. Only heads of institutes
(and party members of good standing) were well informed about
the implication of their R&amp;D. In the USSR, over 80% of all
R&amp;D was funded by and done for the Ministry of Defense and
projects were &quot;compartmentalized.&quot; People minded their
own business and did not ask questions about what is going on
next door. Soviets have sacrificed all comforts of life for the
&quot;defense of the motherland.&quot; In return, everyone had
a job, a small flat, a month vacation, and enough food to live
on. Today the R&amp;D funding is reduced to 1/3 and the &quot;good
old days&quot; are just a memory.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B> C.  Assessment and Recommendations<BR>
</B>
<P>
<FONT COLOR=#000000>It is clear that Russia and many of the republics
of the FSU offer a window of opportunity in selected areas of
electronic S&amp;T that may be of strategic importance to the
DoD. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT COLOR=#000000>R&amp;D as exemplified by the MSU's vacuum
microwave activities is representative of Russian technological
advances along &quot;evolutionary branches&quot; different from
those found in the West. Because of economic hardships, there
is a real possibility that such technology &quot;species&quot;
may become extinct before they are fully appreciated (discovered)
by Western scientists. It is therefore recommended that serious
consideration should be given to supporting the R&amp;D activities
at institutions dealing with power microwave development. Small
investment on our part may lead to new information and insight
of FSU vacuum microelectronic technology. The first step in this
direction has already been taken. In the past few months, ONREUR
has facilitated the funding of research at Moscow State University
to further develop the cyclotron wave electrostatic amplifier
concept described above. The program is funded by ONR and its
technical supervision is under the Naval Research Laboratory.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT COLOR=#000000>I further recommend that the DoD invest in
cooperative R&amp;D programs in the FSU, particularly in vacuum
microwave components such as MBKs and gyro-klystrons for radar
systems. It is imperative to establish the necessary know-how
and infrastructure within our own country in designing and producing
such components. Countries such as China, France, and England
have already initiated such programs.  The DoD is favorably positioned
in developing such programs since it is already playing a major
role in vacuum electronics.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT COLOR=#000000>The Institute of Stable Isotopes in Tbilisi
is a unique facility that needs closer examination. The facility
has a stockpile of 99.6% purity stable isotopes of boron and other
group III elements. It would be highly useful for the DoD to invite
Dr. Guran Karumidze, principal investigator at Tbilisi, to the
US. The stockpile of isotopes in Tbilisi is a unique resource
for scientific investigation. N-doping of diamond and synthesis
of boron(10) carbide are just a few of the many applications.

</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT COLOR=#000000>As in all former Eastern Block nations, the
Hungarian research was modeled along the lines of the Soviet system.
It was based on the idea that basic and applied research was the
responsibility of the Academy institutes and that technical and
industrial research was the responsibility of the R&amp;D units
of the specialized ministries. Universities and industrial laboratories
were not allowed to undertake research activities on their own.
All industrial research laboratories were detached from companies
and were run as independent institutions.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT COLOR=#000000>Over the past 40 years this pattern has changed.
Due partly to political and economic changes, universities and
larger firms have gradually established research units. Moreover,
the Academy's institutes have gradually been involved in contract
research activities with industrial applications.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT COLOR=#000000>Since the dismantling of the COMECOM in 1989,
Hungary has been engaged in radical economic, political and social
transformation. Although changes have taken place more satisfactorily
than in most central and eastern European countries, they are
proving to be a difficult and painful process. The economic crisis
has not spared science and technology. As a consequence of both
the decline in government support and their dependency on contract
support from industry, Hungarian R&amp;D establishment has been
confronted by serious problems. The deterioration of the economic
climate has led to continued brain-drain within the R&amp;D community.
Many researchers have left their laboratories to seek work abroad
or to work in the private sector in fields marginally related
to their specialization. Throughout the R&amp;D landscape, there
has been a personnel reduction of 25% and a cut by almost half
in R&amp;D funding. Some institutes have closed doors or are operating
with a skeleton staff. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B> A. New Blueprint for Hungarian Science &amp; Technology<BR>
</B>
<P>
<FONT COLOR=#000000>Within this climate of change during the past
six years, Hungary has embarked on restructuring its R&amp;D infrastructure.
The new Hungary's R&amp;D blueprint reveals a two-fold structure:
basic research is administered by the Hungarian Academy of Sciences
(HAS) while technology is managed by the National Committee for
Technological Development (OMFB).<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT COLOR=#000000>This duality carries over to the R&amp;D funding.
There are two separate funds: one for research, called the National
Fund for Scientific Research (OTKA), and the other for promoting
technology, called the Central Technical Development Fund (KMUFA).
Interestingly, OTKA is financed by KMUFA, but managed by an autonomous
body headed by the Minister without portfolio for Science.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT COLOR=#000000>Both entities (science and technology) have
equal status within the echelons of the political system. There
is a Minister without portfolio for science and a Minister without
portfolio for technology. The former chairs the Science Policy
Committee, the highest authority for R&amp;D policy-making in
the country.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT COLOR=#000000>The Science Policy Committee coordinates and
proposes the R&amp;D policies to the government. The Committee
is chaired by the president of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences
and is composed of the following additional members: (1) The President
of OMFB, (2) the Minister of Culture and Public Education, and
(3) the Minister of Finance.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT COLOR=#000000>During the Communist regime, the Committee's
task was to implement S&amp;T policy decided upon by the Central
Party Committee. Under the new political climate, the Committee
has the task of coordinating the policy-making process, taking
into account the interests and proposals expressed by the major
institutions concerned.  Whereas before, the Ministries dictated
the S&amp;T policy, now the course is set mostly by HAS, OMFB,
the funding agencies (OTKA and KMUFA), and the commercial sector.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT COLOR=#000000>The ministries mentioned previously help to
develop S&amp;T policy in the areas for which they are responsible,
but play a lesser role in the overall charting of the S&amp;T
course. Outside organizations, such as industrialists, educators,
and trade unions, play a lesser advisory role. It is clear that
under the present structure, the future of S&amp;T in Hungary
is in the hands of scientists and government.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT COLOR=#000000>One may question such a &quot;top-down&quot;
approach in setting S&amp;T policy as being incongruous with market
economy and parliamentary democracy currently emerging in Hungary.
However, lacking a democratic tradition in the past, any other
approach would most likely lead to even greater turmoil within
the S&amp;T establishment. There is clearly a need for help in
developing a democratic tradition within the S&amp;T community
in Hungary. Educational institutions must train a new generation
of scientists, engineers, and technocrats who are able to function
and succeed within the new democratic environment. This process
can be speeded by establishing closer ties between the Hungarian
and Western countries'<B> </B>S&amp;T establishments. This can
only be achieved if scientific institutions in the West take a
more active role.  Such steps are beginning to be taken by many
university departments; they are beginning to take a more active
role in research and training a new generation of scientists and
engineers who are comfortable working within a greater European
community.<BR>

<B> B. The Electronic Infrastructure<BR>
</B>
<P>
<FONT COLOR=#000000>During the Communist era, Hungary had a healthy
electronic infrastructure that was well funded and served the
Warsaw Pact military needs. Si- and GaAs-based discrete device
components were fabricated and traded within that community. 
The center for most of this electronic R&amp;D was the Research
Institute for Technical Physics in Budapest. This institute of
the Hungarian Academy of Sciences was founded in 1956 and reached
its zenith in the 1980s. Unfortunately, the modern Si device fabrication
facility built in 1990, which was supposed to be the cornerstone
for Hungarian electronic infrastructure, was destroyed by fire
shortly after completion.  The Hungarian Academy never found the
resources to rebuild it and many of its technical staff left the
institute to start new careers either in the private sector or
abroad.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B> C. Computer and Information Technology<BR>
</B>
<P>
<FONT COLOR=#000000>Aside from fabrication of electronic components,
Hungary was and still is an important player in computer and information-related
know-how. The recent R&amp;D policy changes mentioned above have
had profound impact on this field. According to the Finance Ministry,
Hungary is experiencing a large demand for scientific, business,
trade, and service-related data; there is also great demand for
computer application products. This information technology related
market is still moderate when compared to the West, but it is
one of the fastest growing sectors within the Hungarian economy.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT COLOR=#000000>Information technology (IT) is not new to
Hungary. The first telecommunications manufacturing company, the
first research institute, and the first telephone network were
already operating in the early 1890s shortly after the invention
of the telephone by Alexander<B> </B>Graham Bell. The country
has had a rather strong tradition in electronics, computers, and
telecommunication technology, even under the Communist regime.
The IT and computer sector flourished and constituted a significant
fraction of the products exported to the eastern markets, primarily
to the Soviet Union. Items such as computer chips, hard disks,
CD-ROM drives, etc., banned under CoCom regulations, were created
and developed in Hungary (albeit not with the sophistication pursued
in the West).<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT COLOR=#000000>With the dissolution of the Soviet Union,
all the former eastern markets collapsed and Hungary was left
only with its technology and knowledge base. To add insult to
injury, the IT and computer sector was further crushed by the
relaxed CoCom restrictions. Western companies were suddenly allowed
to export to Hungary advanced IT systems and components, thus
posing direct competition to Hungarian-made IT products. As a
result, many of the institutionalized (government owned) electronic
and telecommunication enterprises are struggling to survive. Some
have entered into joint venture with western companies, others
were bought up outright. Today, a considerable number of the survivors
pursue &quot;value added&quot; and system integration projects.
The newly established small companies generally do not deal with
development and production; rather, they concentrate more on service-related
activities such as retailing, repair and maintenance, and consulting.
In short, domestic IT and computer firms are compelled to cooperate
with western partners, to cater to the service sector, and to
do business within a much harsher competitive environment.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT COLOR=#000000>To salvage its former IT industry, the Hungarian
government has started to explore new strategies in supporting
this vital technology sector. Unfortunately, within the government,
none of the ministries are responsible for IT policy making. Issues
addressed and decisions made even at the Prime Minister's Office
level still deal with secondary issues such as electronic networking
within the government agencies. All the ministries are mandated
to formulate and update their IT strategy yearly, but an integrated
IT policy is still awaiting presentation to Parliament.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT COLOR=#000000>Government agencies assigned with funding
and promoting IT development are looking for mechanisms to leverage
their meager resources. Top priority is given to S&amp;T projects
that involve working partnerships between government and industrial
establishments. Research institutes and universities are directly
involved with some of these programs. A few of the most noteworthy
projects are aimed at rebuilding the information infrastructure
of local governments. The S&amp;T community has already established
its electronic communication under this program. Academies, universities,
and research laboratories were the first to connect to international
networks. Electronic mail, file transfer services, and databases
are available for 6,000 researchers by OSI or TCP/IP protocols.
There are at least four Hungarian Academy of Sciences research
laboratories and about ten university departments dealing with
IT-related R&amp;D. Universities and private institutions teach
courses in the use of electronic communication and computers.
<BR>
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B> D. Reaching Towards the West<BR>
</B>
<P>
<FONT COLOR=#000000>Funding agencies are also entrusted with providing
a favorable environment for international collaboration. For a
country with a limited domestic market, it is essential to seek
closer ties with the mainstream international S&amp;T community.
Hungary is currently a member of the European Research Coordinating
Agency (EUREKA), Cooperation on S&amp;T (COST), and the European
Science Foundation (ESF). The Hungarian government is sharing
cost with the EC in developing IT infrastructure within the country
and is participating in the EUREKA COSINE program in linking the
Hungarian computer network with the European research community.
There is also a US-Hungarian S&amp;T Joint Fund, which facilitates
R&amp;D collaboration between the two countries.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT COLOR=#000000>The Hungarian research establishment is very
active and competitive in submitting research proposal to the
various EU S&amp;T initiatives. Just in the past six months, out
of the 300 proposals emanating from Central Europe under the European
Union's Fourth Framework Program for Research and Technological
Development initiative, 100 were from Hungary. Out of these, one
third have a good chance of being funded.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT COLOR=#000000>Despite all these efforts, the transition
is turning out to be a long and arduous process. There is need
for more funding, for more strategic planning, and for new alliances
with the West. Hungarians must learn to be more self-reliant and
to exercise a new way of thinking about their social, economic,
and intellectual life. This is not easy for people whose lives
were dictated by a central Communist committee for 45 years. The
West, on the other hand, must provide encouragement and financial
stimulation. It is essential that the land that gave the world
John von Neumann, the father of computer sciences, will not be
forgotten. <BR>

</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT COLOR=#000000>Italian scientists and engineers have an excellent
reputation within the electronics community. They have contributed
fundamental, as well as, practical knowledge to this field ever
since the term &quot;electronics&quot; was coined. Since the early
1950s and 1960s, Italian scientists have made key contributions
to solid state physics and electronics, e.g., electronic band
structure and optical properties of materials. Top research establishments
throughout the world employ many of Italy's best in this field.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT COLOR=#000000>It is therefore not surprising that we find
in Italy today a continued commitment to electronics R&amp;D excellence
within the university and research community. Solid state physics
and electronic engineering education are among the most prestigious
(and difficult) paths of learning that an Italian student can
follow.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT COLOR=#000000>Italian scientists tend to have a thorough
and individualistic approach to scientific research. Their interactions
and collaboration with fellow colleagues, however, tend to be
more international than national in character.  This tendency
may have to do with the way Italian S&amp;T is organized and funded.
The ministry responsible for funding research in Italy (MURST)
tends to give a limited amount of support to everybody, whatever
their research topic (&quot;rainlike funding&quot;). University
professors have complete freedom to choose their research topics
and to use precious resources pursuing their own interests (also
true at national laboratories). This &quot;shotgun approach&quot;
leaves little room for coordination, cooperation, and successful
utilization of the fruits of research on the open market. <BR>
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B> A. The National Research Council Institutes<BR>
</B>
<P>
<FONT COLOR=#000000>A case in point is how electronics R&amp;D
in Italy is managed. MURST splits the R&amp;D funds between the
two major beneficiaries: universities and the National Research
Council (CNR). Careful analysis of the organizational chart reveals
that electronics-related research is spread widely among the numerous
CNR laboratories and university departments. Just within CNR laboratories
engaged in physics and chemistry, there are at least eight institutes
doing electronics-related research, among them the Institute for

the R&amp;D establishment is starting to feel the heat from the
harsh environment imposed by international competition. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B> B. Industrial Connection<BR>
</B>
<P>
<FONT COLOR=#000000>Within the industrial sector, a few laboratories
are still engaged in electronics or optoelectronics R&amp;D, but
even those few are falling by the wayside. Chief reason for this
decline has, in part, to do with new market realities within the
European Union. For example, the Italian electronics giant Teletra
had for many years a significant effort in III-V semiconductor
R&amp;D. Since the merging of Alcatel and Teletra a few years
ago, however, the bulk of the electronics R&amp;D activities have
been moved to France. Alenia, a Rome-based industrial/government-run
laboratory pursuing Si IC development for defense systems, is
also downsizing. Only the telecommunication industries are in
an expansion mode in Italy. Pirelli, for example, has been so
successful in marketing fiber-optic amplifier components that
it is now developing its own semiconductor laser diodes.<BR>

materials, semiconductor physics, technology, and structural properties
of materials. About 60% of its research activities are in III-V
compound semiconductors; the rest is in high-temperature superconductors,
ferroelectrics, and magnetic and metallic materials. Of the total
staff of about 50, half are permanent employees of CNR, the rest
are visiting scientists, students, etc. Total MASPEC budget is
about 2.25 B LIRA ($1.4 M). The rough breakdown of income is one

to educating young engineers, the department is engaged in fundamental
and applied research within the framework of a &quot;center for
interdepartmental research&quot; called the Center for Material
and Information Technology (MTI). This university-CNR consortium
(established in 1992) consists of the Department of Information
Technology, the Department of Physics, and the Institute MASPEC-CNR
mentioned before. The idea was to establish a &quot;center of
excellence&quot; for electronics R&amp;D in Parma and to consolidate
resources now scattered throughout the city. Within this framework,
MASPEC-CNR will move into new laboratory facilities on campus

<FONT COLOR=#000000>For the last decade, Spain has been pursuing
an aggressive policy of modernization of its industrial infrastructure,
especially the segments depending on information and communication
technology. It is therefore not surprising that a fair number
of Spanish scientific laboratories are dedicated to electronic
and optoelectronic R&amp;D. One of the driving factors in this
high technology pursuit is Spain's membership within the European
Union (EU) and strong coupling to EU information and communication
technology programs such as ESPRIT and RACE. These programs help
in developing the technical know-how of the country and provide
opportunities to train qualified scientists and engineers for
Spain and Europe.<BR>

<FONT COLOR=#000000>The research approach at CNM-Madrid reflects
the temperament of its charismatic director, Fernando Briones.
This small but highly talented group has tackled some very important
but difficult solid state physics problems. One such &quot;holy
grail&quot; of solid state physics is the design of a buffer layer
that allows growth of epitaxial layers on lattice mismatched substrates,
e.g., GaAs or InP on Si. In this pursuit, Briones has developed
a specially designed P and As effusion cell that operates in a
pulsed mode. This fast-acting valve/cracker can be synchronized
with the layer by layer growth sequence in such a way that it
optimizes the kinetics of growth for each material. Briones and
his team have painstakingly studied the relationship between optimum
growth and valve sequencing (beam flux amplitude and duration)
by using reflection high-energy diffraction (RHEED) and reflectance
difference (RD) spectroscopy to obtain atomically sharp buried
interfaces.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT COLOR=#000000>The optimum use of ALMBE allows the growth
and doping of GaAs, AlGaAs, InP, and InGaAs at much lower growth
temperatures than MBE and with a growth rate similar to MBE. The
technique allows growth of different materials at much lower temperatures
than hereto possible.  Some of the achievements of the CNM-Madrid
group include the growth of Be doped InP with ALMBE at low temperatures
with hole mobility and compensation comparable to Be-doped InP
grown by conventional MBE (or gas source MBE) at much higher temperatures.
They have also grown strain-free InP at 350 C on Si with excellent
morphology and optical quality by using strain layer superlattice
(SLS) buffers.<BR>

electro-optic modulators and switches.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT COLOR=#000000 FACE="Symbol">_ </FONT><FONT COLOR=#000000>Designing
more efficient buffer layers for reducing strain and dislocation
in epitaxial layers grown on lattice mismatched substrates. This

</FONT>
<P>
<FONT COLOR=#000000>Prof. Munoz's projects are well focussed and
in the mainstream of current electronic and electro-optic R&amp;D.
The facilities for MBE growth, processing, and characterization
are as good as found anywhere in the world. Some recent successes
include the modeling, fabrication, and testing of AlGaAs/GaAs
p-i-n electro-optic diodes with a multiple quantum well (MQW)
in its intrinsic region. Such structures were grown both on (100)
and (111) GaAs substrates. Unlike the (100) geometry, which produces
a red-shifted optical absorption with applied bias voltage (due
to the quantum confinement Stark effect), the (111) p-i-n MQW
configurations show strong blue-shifted absorption with much lower
applied voltage. This strong blue shift is attributed to the piezoelectric
strain induced polarization in the (111) geometry and offers potential
in designing more efficient blue-shifting self-electro-effect
devices (BS-SEEDs). The InP/InGaAs analog for longer wavelength
application is currently being developed.<BR>

<FONT COLOR=#000000>Telefonica I+D is modeled after Bellcore in
the US. It is a commercial R&amp;D laboratory supporting the telephone
infrastructure of Spain and Europe. This well staffed and equipped

ranging from software development to optical communication. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT COLOR=#000000>The Basic Technology Division headed by Dr.
Lopez Barrio is one of the only divisions within Telefonica involved
with the actual development of electronic components. It consists
of five groups: microelectronics, optoelectronics, reliability
of materials, hardware, and software technology. The optoelectronics
group, staffed by about 12 well trained scientists and engineers,
has the task of developing prototype elements for the telephone
industry. Some of the projects include the development of new
multiplexing techniques for increased transmission capacity in
fiber optic communication, and the growth and processing of InP-based
optoelectronic chips for optical communication.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B> D. Observation<BR>
</B>
<P>
<FONT COLOR=#000000>It should be stressed that electronic R&amp;D
in Spain is of good quality. The universities and research establishments
produce well trained scientists and engineers, many of whom end
up working either in Europe or the US. In general, the laboratories
mentioned above are well funded, equipped, and staffed. They all
participate extensively in EC-financed projects and are in the
mainstream of European electronic R&amp;D. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT COLOR=#000000>Like many other European electronic R&amp;D
laboratories, the Spanish have a weak link to industry. Many elegant
ideas and projects being pursued by bright researchers remain
buried in technical journals without ever seeing market application.
Even the more applied research facilities like Telefonica have
no strong motivation to transfer their in-house developed technology
to the industrial sector.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT COLOR=#000000>National laboratories such as CNM have clear
scientific objectives, but again, no follow-through in the sense
of impacting the Spanish economy. Part of the problem lies with
the lack of a strong &quot;mid-level&quot; electronic industry
and industries within the country that use electronic technology.
Such industries could serve as users of new ideas/concepts coming
out of the Spanish R&amp;D establishments. With the current economic
slump throughout Europe, this &quot;bridging&quot; process between
R&amp;D centers and industry may prove to be even more tenuous
in the coming years.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT COLOR=#000000>On the positive side, Spain is successfully
training a new generation of technocrats who are comfortable with
the latest high-technology tools such as electronics. After all,
they are the ones that will form the core of modern Spain and
will inevitably impact Spanish society and economy in the next
century.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT COLOR=#000000>7.  CONCLUSION<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT COLOR=#000000>The intent of this report was to give a flavor
of the various electronic related S&amp;T activities being pursued
throughout Europe and to concentrate on analysis, comparative
studies, and assessments of diverse electronics and electro-optic
activities taking place there. Special emphasis was placed on
the emerging S&amp;T opportunities in nanoelectronics, solid state
and vacuum microelectronics, microwave integrated circuits, analytical
tools for measuring fast electronic components, novel electronic
materials, and underlying systems such as information technology
and communication. Furthermore, the goal was to get a broad perspective
of the &quot;European S&amp;T scene,&quot; as well as to focus
in-depth on S&amp;T issues in countries, such as Germany and the
Former Soviet Union, which offer a wealth of new ideas and approaches
useful in planning our own DoD's electronics S&amp;T. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT COLOR=#000000> Geographic focus on Germany and FSU was intentional.
Both of these countries have a strong S&amp;T tradition, have
occupied historic center stage in Europe for the past five years
and offered &quot;targets of opportunity&quot; during my tenure
at ONREUR. The ONREUR office in London has vested interest in
tracking the S&amp;T developments in both of these countries.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT COLOR=#000000>It is undisputed that Germany is a leader
in Europe in forging the blueprint of electronics for the 21st
century. In spite of the social and economic burden of unification,
Germany is and will continue to be a major contributor to European
S&amp;T. It is well organized, creative, and highly respected
within the world's R&amp;D community. It is a  leader in developing
&quot;environmentally conscious&quot; technologies which have
not only positive impact on the environment, but also are creating
new outlets for German high technology products.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT COLOR=#000000>Russia and some of the former republics of
USSR, on the other hand, offer a window of opportunity in niche
areas which are of strategic interest to the DoD. There is still
the potential for technology transfer, but we have to be much
more organized in dealing with their S&amp;T community. We also
have to be much more selective and demanding in the S&amp;T programs
we fund. That entails more accurate and more frequent assessment
of their S&amp;T capabilities.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT COLOR=#000000>The omission of France and Great Britain in
this report was also intentional. Both France and Great Britain
have close links to DoD through various exchange agreements. There
is a constant US interaction on a technical level with both of
these countries. This fact should, however, not preclude ONREUR
from continued assessment of their contribution to the European
electronic community.  As a matter of fact, we need to pay more
attention to S&amp;T events in France since the French have unique
and elegant ways of solving S&amp;T problems from which we all
can learn. And unlike most Western countries, they are not hampered
by budgetary cuts in R&amp;D.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT COLOR=#000000>The focus on the &quot;S&amp;T scene&quot;
in Hungary, Italy, and Spain was to give balance to the report.
Each one of these countries represent the &quot;emerging&quot;
European nations in the region; they have unique economic and
cultural factors affecting their S&amp;T infrastructure. These
factors needed to be exposed to place them in perspective within
the new European community. After all, the European Commission
is a strong supporter of S&amp;T programs in these emerging nations.
These research programs are vehicles for bringing the communities
together and spawn new technologies that will impact the electronic
market.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT COLOR=#000000>I believe that we need to go out of our way
to promote interactions with our European colleagues in the field
of electronics. There are many talented scientists and engineers
in Europe doing R&amp;D in unique ways. They generate many good
ideas which could be of benefit to our own S&amp;T community.
The major challenge is to identify these &quot;golden nuggets&quot;
and to take timely action. To achieve this, we need to have knowledgeable
people close to the scene. This is not always possible, especially
with the shrinking R&amp;D budget in the US. The recent trend
to staff ONREUR with scientists and technologists from organizations
such as NSF, ARPA, and industry is a step in the right direction.
However, much still needs to be done.  <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT COLOR=#000000>I recommend that those key areas termed &quot;windows
of opportunity&quot; should be pursued vigorously. I am happy
to report that some of my &quot;alerts&quot; have been taken to
heart and resulted in new S&amp;T initiatives in our own laboratories,
particularly in MMIC and vacuum microwave arena.  The Special
Programs Office at ONR has been very helpful in bringing such
technical transitions to fruition. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT COLOR=#000000>Finally, recruiting competent scienists and
engineers to staff ONREUR is a challenge to the ONR management,
specially during current uncertainties in the DoD. <U>The DoD
electronic S&amp;T community must be represented in Europe.</U>
Recent directive from DoD specifically calls for the Identification
of International Cooperative Opportunities for S&amp;T Programs.
This action alone is sufficient cause to have an electronics expert
in position at ONREUR. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT COLOR=#000000>ONREUR has a long tradition of excellence
in Europe for over five decades. That excellence is bound to continue
and flourish in the next millenium.<BR>
